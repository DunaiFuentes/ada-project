Even if you never turn it on, if you have a TV that's connected to an aerial and has been tuned in, you need a licence for it. If it's not connected to the aerial, then it can't receive the broadcast signal, so you don't need a licence.

You also don't need a licence if you have an internet-connected computer, although that can receive live TV (e.g. via iPlayer), because IPTV isn't deemed to be broadcast. Yet.

The legal situation creates some very weird anomalies. Imagine you had a TV which wasn't connected to an aerial, but was connected to a PVR which IS connected to an aerial, purely so that you can record programmes for later viewing.

I respect your opinion although I strongly disagree with it.  I don't think it was a major social change in the slightest and certainly not something that we needed to have a referendum over. 

Some gay people want to get married and some religious people want to stop them.  But for the vast majority of people, it's not about being gay or getting married, but simply about equality.  Male, female, black, white, straight or gay.  All men and women are created equal and the law should reflect that.  If there is a law that prevents people from being treated equally then I am of the opinion that the law should be fixed promptly and without fuss.

That said, I appreciate the fact that you feel betrayed by the Conservatives.  I've been betrayed by all three major parties now.  I'm sure it's only a matter of time before UKIP betray you too.

Until recently I held the view that we should totally reform the political system and hold referenda (via online voting) on a much wider range of issues.

Now I'm not so sure.  The danger is that the very serious job of running the country could become just another ""Celebrity Pop Factor Dancing on Ice - Get me out of here!"" kind of TV show.  The likes of Murdoch would love such a system because they know they can influence huge swaths of the less intelligent voting public in a short space of time.  Special interest groups would vote in force on the issues they care about, while the majority of middle-of-the-road folk who didn't care one way or the other would be less inclined to vote.

I think the Alliance party largely disagrees on this post, as they've moved from outright unionist to almost fully agnostic on the union at this point. As far as I'm aware, the party *explicitly* does not have a policy on the Union, and leaves it up to individual members (although most historically played it close to their chest, for obvious reasons). Thus it's not really possible for candidates to deviate from the party line here, as there isn't one.

In a post-GFA world, it's also hard to argue with their reasoning.

An increase in the size of the economy results in an increase in the size of taxation revenue, which is especially important at the moment given the governments current policy of paying off the current national debt. An increase in growth should lead to this debt becoming more manageable more quickly, which will lead to a reduction in the speed of cuts to public services.  

What happens if a country has a shrinking or even stagnant economy for a long time? The country is unable to pay its debt, and is forced to borrow money at a higher interest rate. This in turn leads to faster and more harsh public service cuts, culminating in high unemployment.

The problem is that voting for a candidate has no obvious direct influence on your life for most - at least nothing as simple as: Vote Labour and this will happen - and indeed past elections will have born that out for most people. They don't see how it affects them, they don't understand the reality of how a politician works to affect change, or compromises to achieve it, they're tired of the nonsense and they feel screwed either way. 

That's a simplification perhaps, but perhaps it's also the reality of our particular political system.

You want nearer 100% voter turn out? Make it mandatory. Easy. Why not? If that's what matters then force people to do it. 

Unless that's not the point. Unless what we actually want is voters to be engaged with the process and care about it. For that I have no idea what you can do. Politicians could do their part by not being corrupt or abusing their position for personal gain. 

If more had been done to pursue those responsible for the economic crash then I guess people would feel those in power care about the people more than their buddies in business and finance. But that didn't happen. 

I have no idea what the solution is, but simply moaning the public doesn't care enough misses the point that it's the politicians fault for letting the apathy sink in and for not doing enough to turn it around.

I believe that voting should be compulsory. The only requirement of participating in a democracy is that you should have to vote. No other obligations are put upon you, and voting is such a rare event. I'm glad that voting is compulsory in Australia because, even if people are apathetic, they still have to make *a* choice. 

I like to think that it at least forces part of the ""apathetic voter"" group to cast a thoughtful vote. 

For example, /r/unitedkingdom was FLOODED with anti-UKIP sentiment over the last few weeks.

So how many people from this sub-reddit voted *against* UKIP? Even if you didn't like the other choices, you could still have voted strategically to reduce the chances of UKIP getting in to power in your local area.

Wait, your comment isn't very clear. Can you confirm which of the two below you are actually suggesting?

1 - Penalties and standards of evidence in rape cases should vary depending on if the woman gets an abortion

2 - A woman should have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that she was raped before being allowed an abortion, and be fined if her evidence was found to be lacking.

Either of those are... interesting...

That's worrying, truly.

It is, but it isn't good enough at all. Leaflets are simplified, often exaggarate the truth, ignore the background of the party. They're just small party-produced propaganda pieces.

&gt;I don't believe people take an interest in something if they're not interested in it, but I think they should at least cast a vote when the time comes.

Why? As I said, that will badly skew results. People will vote for silly reasons. They'll vote X party 'cos their parents did or their friends told them to. They'll vote X party 'cos the name/slogan/logo looks good. They'll vote X party because it is the first name they see.

Each member state has the ability to modify and alter the rules set out by the EU with regards to net neutrality. Thus enabling the UK government to alter the nature of the law provided by the EU to protect internet access. 

The alterations won't be a fundamental change but they could well alter the intended nature of the laws. 

Coupled with what are rather ambiguous comments from the head of Ofcom with regards to his views on Net Neutrality, one could infer that they could well recommend tweaks that attempt to enable operators to 'receive a return on investment'. 

No one thought that such a position would come about in the US, and the FCC is quite capable of reclassifying the US operators 'telecoms' providers thus enabling them to enshrine net neutrality, but instead they're looking at internet fast lanes as a viable option. 

So when our own watchdog makes ambiguous comments regarding net neutrality, its rightful cause for concern and without these laws from Brussels it is entirely plausible that Ofcom could have made a similar recommendation for fast lanes - 

especially, it's worth pointing out, as the UK government voted against and may subsequently veto the NN laws and culture secretary has been in support of two speed internet. Source: http://www.dailydot.com/politics/net-neutrality-uk-eu-veto/

I don't begrudge people who do vote, and leading up to this I was at least partially excited about doing so.

It's madness to think democracy refines our governments in any meaningful way, a grand illusion at best based on single-issue voting and being loyal to mostly faceless parties etc. etc.

What changes society, and government, has more to do with educating the populace, technological advances, economic pressures and cultural memes; less to do with which pompous prick gets to be a glorified treasurer this year as opposed to the last (which is technically all that elected politicians are, divvying up our taxes).

1. Is it not a fraud when politicians promote a form of democracy known as representative democracy when that system is anything but, resulting in no more than an elective dictatorship?

2. Another fraud perpetrated on the British electorate are political manifestos, documents full of statements – all of which are ‘loosely’ worded – some of which may or may not be actioned and which bear hardly any relation to that which an incoming government does.

3. Is it not a fraud when a government – one not elected but contrived by politicians for the exercise of personal power – produces a programme for government in which, for example, it promises the electorate recall of their MP but ‘conditions’ that promise by insisting that the final decision rests with their own political class?

Are they really discussing the issues though? Is using false or exaggerated statistics to purposefully scaremonger, like 450 million people moving over here, or x% amount of children speaking a foreign first language in Britain (a statistic which would count Farage's children), or how many Romanian gangs are committing crime without any context or nuance discussion? I wouldn't say so. It's populism, and pandering to a fear of the masses by exaggerating it, just like what the Tories did with benefits. It's discussion in the same way the past governments putting their fingers in their ears and doing nothing is discussion, it is already holding a view point, then embellishing the facts to make your view look more appealing.

&gt; Just dont expect the NHS to be around in its current form, in ten years time if the population keeps getting bigger and bigger thanks largely to all the bottom feeders from Europe, their families and newborns.

Importantly UKIP do not employ a whip system to their local representatives.  This, in part, has contributed to them receiving councillor defections before the election from both Labour and the Conservatives when those parties dictated policy down with a more deft hand.  UKIP councillors are allowed a far broader range of policies, the emphasis they're pushing that they represent the electorate first, the party second.  

The downside being that outwardly this looks like they're somewhat herding cats, but rather it's preconceptions in the media expecting them to fall into strict party political lines and then not understanding why UKIP local representatives are seen to be jumping across party lines like fleas to make single line policy deals at a local level (not apologising for the obvious rogue councillor that suddenly goes outfield and says something completely opposed to party ethos.)

The other advice here is quality stuff - rewrite your cv. Check online advice (free in a local library if your internet has been sacrificed to frugality), ask at the job centre if they have any cv writing courses you can go on. The advice will be a bit basic, but if they have a course, it should be Free of Charge.

Contact local sure start centres, or colleges and ask about free courses for people in receipt of jobseekers, there's bound to be something, even if it's flower arranging, it'll get you out of the house and it'll go on your CV (was unemployed, went to college to learn a new skill) - it looks good to employers. If you can tailor training into the line of work that you want to get into, so much the better, that stuff shows on your CV.

I went to college after I was made redundant to do an autocad course and changed career paths around that time, I've started at the bottom and worked my way up, and in the last job interview I had, the interviewer could tell what I had done, and why I had done it based on my CV. He told me that he was impressed (don't know if I've got the new job yet, but fingers crossed).

&gt;___Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism___ is [Robert Pape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pape)'s analysis of [suicide terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_terrorism) from a strategic, social, and psychological point of view. It is based on a database he has compiled at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago), where he directs the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism. The book's conclusions are based on data from 315 suicide terrorism attacks around the world from 1980 through 2003. Of these, 301 were classified into 18 different campaigns by 11 different groups; the remaining 14 appear to have been isolated. Published in May 2005, Pape's volume has been widely noticed by the press, the public, and policymakers alike, and has earned praise from the likes of [Peter Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bergen), Congressman [Ron Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul) (R-Texas),  and [Michael Scheuer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scheuer).

Even if they'd somehow made a deal with the SNP, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, Alliance, and the Greens they'd still only have 329 MPs, just 14 more than the Conservatives + DUP. That's a tiny majority, and trying to constantly appease 7 different parties would be near impossible.

Had a second election been held in 2010, I think the Tories would have had all the advantages. First of all, Labour were now leaderless, [apparently on the verge of bankruptcy](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/19/labour-party-treasurer-change-john-prescott), and still very unpopular after the recent financial crisis and expenses scandals. They would have struggled heavily to run an effective second campaign. Secondly, the public does not like political instability, especially when the country is in economic trouble.

They did the opposite.  They said, predominantly, that micro-local UKIP branches had to set up and build up a local base.  They then said that these local groups had then to coalesce around other local groups, and only then would they build a central hub through which to funnel central funding.

In this manner UKIP is building grassroot support and building a network where local groups are wanting to help other local groups for their common growth.

So not only are they saying they'll back local representatives on local matters, they're saying local groups will be incentivised to work together and to deliver results.  So they're even more motivated to work cross party at a local level to deliver local, council improvements.  The more performance the more injection.

UKIP is criticised for their EU attendance.  In direct contradiction to that UKIP councilors have the best attendance records in domestic matters at council level.",0,1400845593,null,0,1400845782,0,chp64mb,t3_26abff,t1_chp64mb,t1_chp5t7j,null,1433921042,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Uh oh. No budget and you have guns?

Do you have all the legal areas covered here? What kind of weapons? There are a couple of Acts that restrict filming with guns, even imitation ones. Imitation weapons in any public space must have police permission. This is covered in the Firearms act. Even if you're filming on private property if a member of the public might hear or see the gun the police must be informed. You'll probably will also need an armourer depending on the weapons and licensing restrictions. It's tough to film gun scenes in the UK with no budget.

Despite a smear campaign, working with some genuinely excellent material that UKIP members begrudgingly provided, orchestrated by the three main (should we say *previously* main?) parties, UKIP have actually done exactly what Farage said they would...

What I mean by that is, he made the argument to David Cameron earlier this year that UKIP were not stealing conservative votes, contrary to Tory opinion. These results seem to show precisely that. UKIP have actually cleaved **both** the Labour and Tory votes and critically they seem to have done it in a surprising number of key Labour marginals. My guess, is that although they also appear to have taken a share of LD vote that has probably actually gone to Labour or the Greens, and in turn a greater share of the Labour vote has been lost than might initially appear to be the case. 

It's important, because if this is reflected on even a small scale at the general election, it probably increases the chances of a Tory government - either in coalition with UKIP or by virtue of UKIPs ability to cut the Labour vote in key target seats, which looks (from this anyway) to be potentially more harmful to Labour than it is to the Torys. I notice Cameron has already come out saying there won't be a formal UKIP coalition, but I wouldn't bet on that just yet. 

**What happens next?** - hard to say. The obvious part is that both David Cameron and Ed Miliband will proclaim that the electorate have demonstrated they aren't happy and want change... however both are likely to disagree about what change they actually want. The Torys will argue that we want an EU referendum (all be it where they try to convince us to stay, which is just bizarre). Labour on the other hand will argue that what voters really want are solutions to the *""cost of living crisis""*. So yeah, basically they are going to land precisely where they already stand. The Lib dems are interesting though... in a sense, they are more of a council based party than the other two, despite being smaller in number. Also, the LD party structure is more dependent on having council seats many of which it has now lost - a lot of the party faithful who have just lost their jobs are now going to be even more upset at Nick Clegg. It's actually possible he might face an internal rebellion in view of this. Though, my suspicion is he will survive this narrowly and get axed after his party gets owned at the next general election.

**The real story?** - Is going to happen on Sunday. If UKIP have secured 30% of the seats they targeted, then we could be seeing a rediculous victory in the European elections. It stands to reason that probably every person who voted for UKIP in the local elections voted for them in the EU elections... but, it's also likely that a lot of people voted UKIP for the EU elections **and not** for the local elections, so their vote share in the local elections is likely to be a minimum in the EU elections.",0,1400847118,null,0,1400847301,0,chp6gwe,t3_26aaez,t1_chp6gwe,t3_26aaez,null,1433921193,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Each member state has the ability to modify and alter the rules set out by the EU with regards to net neutrality. Thus enabling the UK government to alter the nature of the law provided by the EU to protect internet access.

&gt; The alterations won't be a fundamental change but they could well alter the intended nature of the laws.

&gt; Coupled with what are rather ambiguous comments from the head of Ofcom with regards to his views on Net Neutrality, one could infer that they could well recommend tweaks that attempt to enable operators to 'receive a return on investment'. 

So, basically, you're ""what iffing"" when there's real world evidence that our ISPs aren't interested in playing that game. As I've said before, there is currently no legislation that requires ISPs to act in a neutral manner, but they have no problem doing so anyway. 

&gt; No one thought that such a position would come about in the US, and the FCC is quite capable of reclassifying the US operators 'telecoms' providers thus enabling them to enshrine net neutrality, but instead they're looking at internet fast lanes as a viable option. 

Everyone thought that it was a possibility. Most people are stuck with one company, everyone gets internet service from some huge megacorp, and no one is forced to share networks with others. These are problems we do not have over here.

&gt; especially, it's worth pointing out, as the UK government voted against and may subsequently veto the NN laws and culture secretary has been in support of two speed internet. Source: http://www.dailydot.com/politics/net-neutrality-uk-eu-veto/

Doesn't seem like a problem. Today we can have a ""two speed internet"" or ""fast lanes"" or whatever dumbed down name the Americans are using right now. We don't.

&gt; If all of them had the ability to charge both the punter and netflix, you can bet they damn well would. 

The largest ISPs all have that ability - there is nothing to prevent them, it wouldn't be illegal, and they would have the clout to demand such deals. In practice, BT and Virgin both willingly peer for free with Netflix, and just about every ISP peers freely with the BBC. This is why I don't believe your scaremongering. They can do it right now. They have been able to do it since forever. They don't.

It would be reasonable for clerks to have the power to confiscate ballots which have been photographed, in order to prevent identifiable votes from being counted.

I also find it believable that they could prevent ballots they know to be spoiled from being put in the box, since a spoiled ballot isn't a vote.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I think on this we won't agree. It really boils down to what you think racism is... it strikes me that a lot of the racist propaganda thrown around about UKIP actually comes from either immigrants or people who are not living in areas of high immigration. I just don't believe that 30% of the British population are intrinsically racist, particularly given our background. For many people, it isn't the principle of immigration they have issue with (including, by his own admittance and marriage, Nigel Farage!) - but rather they take issue with the **pace** of immigration over the past 15 years. Looking at the immigration figures that came out yesterday, it's just staggering to think 212,000 from the EU came here last year. 

If you actually listen to what Farage says, he is inherantly pro-immigration. But what he wants are Doctors and Lawyers from the USA and commonwealth, not itinerant scrap metal collectors from eastern Europe, with questionable adherence to our laws and no real interest in our culture. He argues that in the past waves of immigration (such as those from the Caribbean and India in the 1960/70s) were largely fueled by anglophiles who came here effectively wanting to become British... in many ways those people were more British than the British. The current EU wave however has been fueled by poor economic migrants from the impoverished east and south of Europe. They have no interest in being British, little long term intention to stay if their home nation conditions improve and often send money home (effectively causing a form of external capital loss). They don't care about the UK or the people that live in it - it is simply a vehicle for them to improve their own lives (for which you ultimately can't begrudge them). 

His argument is essentially that less of the right stuff is better than lots of the wrong stuff... and having lived in a few areas of the South East that have been transformed by immigration, to their detriment, over just 10 years I have to say on this I can see why people are voting for him.",1,1400847798,null,0,1400848100,0,chp6mtl,t3_26aaez,t1_chp6mtl,t1_chp6cjo,null,1433921272,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

The downside is that once you devolve such powers down then it's like sending your kids into the wide world.  There is no uniform doctrine to pass down, beyond an extent.  You can't run it from the top up.

It's common to their ethos of taking power away from the EU and back to Westminster, and from Westminster down to local level.  Once you've done it you've got to allow the kids to run and make their own successes or to learn from their own mistakes - and to some extent you won't get the credit for the successes but you will probably have to endure the ramifications from some of their mistakes, and hope they learn to build on it.

There are benefits from having a less organic approach to local politics, for dictating down and maintaining a more stringent rule.  The chances are doing it the UKIP way you're going to have to watch your kid climb that tree and possibly fall, or build that fire and possibly burn their fingers.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It's not my fault you seem to arguing with what you think I've said rather than what I've actually said is it? 

There's two arguments, the one you're determined to have , which is ""religion is bad.. I think it's bull and here's why... ""

Then there's the argument that religion or specific religious texts limit or do not allow the individual to seek knowledge. 

I'm talking about the latter.  When it comes to this argument , a cursory examination of the text themselves are about exploration and discovery. They're meditations on existence, regardless of whether you believe them to be divinely inspired or not, and they delve into what it means to be a society. This , by it's very nature, means they encourage a person to explore. 

This is the kind of impulse that has led to many human beings seeking knowledge, and expanding their understanding further. If you look at the Old Testament , Genesis is about encounters with others and encounters with yourself. The New Testament challenges things like the idea of wealth and attainment, it asks people to look at what the society around them means. 

If you look at the Quran it is full of direct questions about the material universe that ask you - ""is that all there is?"" In Islam there is a hadith, which are the sayings of the Prophet, that says ""Seek knowledge , even if you must go to China"" - which commentators say means find knowledge even if it takes you places that are alien to you. 

I'm sure I could go on with evidence from the Gitas, the Sutras and other texts.  The commonality is that knowledge is important, attainment of it is almost a duty in most religions, and the acceptance that knowledge will make you better as both as person and a devotee of your faith. 

Now you can argue about it the nature of the knowledge, and the ideas of truth - but to argue that Religion stops you seeking it is just not materially true if one bothered to think about these things without the ironically dogmatic insistence that ""religion is against science"" that seems to cloud debates on this issue.

&gt; Where do people get this idea religion is 'searching' for anything.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They aren't searching for anything that isn't already written in their daft books. 

With this:

&gt;when it comes to this argument , a cursory examination of the text themselves are about exploration and discovery. They're meditations on existence, regardless of whether you believe them to be divinely inspired or not, and they delve into what it means to be a society. This , by it's very nature, means they encourage a person to explore.

&gt;This is the kind of impulse that has led to many human beings seeking knowledge, and expanding their understanding further. If you look at the Old Testament , Genesis is about encounters with others and encounters with yourself. The New Testament challenges things like the idea of wealth and attainment, it asks people to look at what the society around them means.

&gt;If you look at the Quran it is full of direct questions about the material universe that ask you - ""is that all there is?"" In Islam there is a hadith, which are the sayings of the Prophet, that says ""Seek knowledge , even if you must go to China"" - which commentators say means find knowledge even if it takes you places that are alien to you.

Its generally self policed and they seem to have agreed to turn a blind eye to us all standing, makes it almost like a good ol' terrace. Unfortunately thanks to Rangers and Celtic fans using flares at matches they can't go into the 'old stand' as its a fire hazard so we are moved out for games against Celtic and any future games against Rangers. 

Due to this we are now being told we will be moved out of the North Stand and a new 'singing section' will be in the North end of the Old Stand, which as you may know if you've been to firhill has massive pillars blocking the view. We are pretty pissed off at this plan and I don't think the issue is going to die down going into the start of next season.

I'd just like to thank all the Rangers and Celtic fans that have ruined that for us (the ones that brought flares). I'm aware we could build a new South Stand or replace the old stand but unfortunately we almost bankrupt ourselves building the Jackie Husband stand to bring our stadium up to the now defunct 10,000 seater rule, so we are kind of skint.

I'd also like to thank old Firm fans for bringing bigotry to such a point that Thistle fans have actually been arrested for singing our age old song about our antipathy to both teams and their respective figureheads. My personal opinion of that song is that its condemning bigotry, I'm not sure what the official line on that one is but there have been sporadic arrests. 

Our attendance is up but that's not surprising after promotion. I personally believe that if it wasn't for the old firm we could all happily go stand at a game with a pint in a plastic glass which would make it a hell of a lot better. If watching football has been ruined (though I don't think it has) its because of the old firm bigotry. Maybe things will relax if the clampdown eventually gets through some very thick skulls and then we can all start to enjoy it a bit more.

In saying that these last two seasons have been the most I've enjoyed it in a long time. The playoff saved this season for the bottom 6, without it the season was almost over before it began.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; I totally disagree. Protest voting just confuses the results. It leads to arguments that a party's success is because of another's failure rather than their own merits. 

There will be more of a positive change if a protest party get a big vote and those arguments are thrown about than if they get a very small vote and nobody even needs to acknowledge them.

&gt; If there is a huge group of people that are apathetic, why aren't they trying to find out why and engage with that group? They are a sleeping dragon and could turn a tide if someone were to wake them. 

Because we have a long history of terrible turnout in younger demographics, and that has never happened. It's much easier to appeal to swing voters with some token gestures than it is to convince young people they're really different from what has come before.

The green's make quite radical steps in that direction (no tuition fees, legalising cannabis, basic income) and nobody's voting them. It's partly that politicians don't pay attention, but it's significantly young peoples' failure to engage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The fact that your average person is either seriously struggling or finds it impossible to afford a decent home is one of our society's worst failings.

But there's plenty of affordable homes all over the UK. The problem is that people seem hell bent on all wanting to live in the south east. The majority of people in the UK live in an area where they can afford to buy a house. Shit, there's still plenty of places where you can buy a flat or a house with a full time job on NMW with the standard 3.5x income multiplier and that's outright, not shared ownership. Hell there was a 2 bed flat for sale near Glasgow for the price of a second hand car!

&gt; Honestly I'm having a hard time trying to think of a down-side to a 'severe correction' in the housing market.

As someone who was around in the early 90's and witnessed a recession and Black Wednesday as the final kick in the teeth the downside was lots of people having their homes repossessed and a decade or more later still repaying the shortfall.

Another downside you've not thought of is that the negative equity traps people in their current house. ""You've got a home so where's the problem"" I hear you cry? Say you and your partner bought a small 1 or 2 bed house,  you then have kids and want to move for more room or say you changed jobs and need to move for work. How are you going to do it if your house has devalued by 30% and you're in negative equity? First of all you're going to have to get permission from your mortgage company to sell. Then you're not only going to have to come up with a deposit for a new home but you're also going to have to find the money to repay the outstanding 
mortgage. 

Or what if you're on a crap rate for your mortgage and want to remortgage? You won't be able to because the amount you'll need is going to be more than the value of your house?

What if you want or need to get a secured loan because you need to do some essential repairs like a new roof or want to improve your home? You won't be able to because its in negative equity.

Lots and lots of downsides to a severe correction. ",0,1400854957,null,0,1400855769,0,chp8x8v,t3_26acpy,t1_chp8x8v,t1_chp7i4p,null,1433922416,-13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-13

**Defender B:** Has a mid-high pass completion rate but we have only lost 1 game when he has played

true,[deleted],null,null,"It won't top out because the top (like £50m-£100m per home) is dominated by rich people who are literally only here because it is 'safe'.  It is a market that exists for the sake of being a market.  The other places they could park their cash would be other rich cities like LA, Singapore, Hong Kong and New York, and those cities have the same problem.  

The upper-middle area, which is the area that is actually pushing up prices for ordinary people (because let's face it the price of a 16 room mansion on the King's Road doesn't affect you that much) is buoyed because a lot of the world's highest paying jobs are in London.  More than 100 of the top 500 biggest businesses in Europe have their headquarters in London, and more than 75% of the world's top 500 biggest companies have offices in London, usually as their entire European or even EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) headquarters.  Not to mention the entire financial industry, the consulting industry, corporate law and accounting, as well as creative stuff like high paying tech companies, advertising and marketing firms, fashion companies, film studios/production companies, and so on and so forth.  

Basically, a huge number of people earning between £150k and £500k a year live in London, and that group takes over all the former middle-class areas because the actual rich people are holed up in Chelsea/Kensington/Mayfair. 

These prices will continue to remain relatively high, because the average senior banker or ad exec doesn't want to live at the end of the Jubilee line in a modern block of flats, he wants his nice smart regency style house in Maida Vale or Hampstead or St John's Wood or wherever.  

There are, however, actions that could be taken to reduce the house costs for people earning between say £35k and £100k a year, by building massive new developments outside the city.  There are massive problems with planning permission there, not least because no one wants a skyscraper in their back yard and the government demands that property companies also build schools, roads, hospitals and other things for free, as well as houses. 

But even that would likely cause a slow contraction of values in the middle of the market, rather than a total crash.  The very pinnacle of the high end might also crash, if something like a global wealth tax Piketty-style were introduced but that's unlikely at this stage.   

Really the only way the london market will crash soon is if all the high paying jobs leave the capital.  That would require an exodus of the entire financial industry.  The only party stupid enough to propose policies that would lead to that are the Greens,and they aren't going to come to power any time soon.   Given that lots of Labour's leaders own million pound+ properties in the capital, it's unlikely they would do anything major either.

---

&gt;The __hundredth monkey effect__ is a studied [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon)  in which a new behavior or idea is claimed to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit the new behavior or acknowledge the new idea. The theory behind this phenomenon originated with [Lawrence Blair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Blair) and [Lyall Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyall_Watson) in the mid-to-late 1970s, who claimed that it was the observation of Japanese scientists. One of the primary factors in the promulgation of the story is that many authors quote secondary, tertiary or post-tertiary sources who have themselves misrepresented the original observations.

Someone who has presumably migrated to the UK and is now chipping in their 2 cents that, unsurprisingly, they favor immigration... I dare say it may well be primarily for this reason that London ironically seems to be one of the few parts of the Country to not come out flying UKIPs colours.

At any rate, I do agree with you that there is a sort of sieve effect where non-anglophile economic migrants will probably move on eventually while those that wish to integrate tend to settle. Indeed there is some evidence to support that already, for example the numbers of people coming in from Poland seems to be tailing off, while it is rising from new areas of economic hardship like Portugal and Spain. I don't think that is necessarily the entire story though broadly it holds true, exceptions for example include areas that are so heavily populated with migrants from a single location that it holds back integration. Parts of Birmingham were always the classic example.

The issue is, that kind of movement is a bad kind of immigration. It means we have decent volumes of migrants who earn money in the UK, from British companies, then send it back or take it back to their home nations. Anything they earn here like a pension, is going to end up funding a retirement in another nation. It's a minor form of capital flight as money that would have gone to UK citizens to spend in the UK, is lost from the system. It is for this reason that there probably ought to have been some sort of GDP-ratio lock on EU immigration.

&gt;

&gt;__Metacognition__ is defined as ""[cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) about cognition"", or ""knowing about knowing"". It comes from the root word ""__meta"",__ meaning beyond.  It can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or for problem solving.  There are generally two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation of cognition. 

&gt;[Metamemory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamemory), defined as knowing about memory and [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) strategies, is an especially important form of metacognition.  Differences in metacognitive processing across cultures have not been widely studied, but could provide better outcomes in cross-cultural learning between teachers and students. 

&gt;Some [evolutionary psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) hypothesize that metacognition is used as a survival tool, which would make metacognition the same across cultures.  Writings on metacognition can be traced back at least as far as *[Perì Psūchês;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Soul)* and the *[Parva Naturalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parva_Naturalia)* of the Greek philosopher [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle).

Why the Hell would you be defensive if you've done nothing wrong? Just answer the questions without trying to affirm your superior knowledge of law, whether you know it better than the officer or not. And you're right, they're not reason to suggest he's in the wrong; but they aren't going to endear you or your case to anybody. The police are just doing their jobs, they're not the ones making accusations. SO don't act like an insufferable prick.

Well, they tried, didn't they? Except it was difficult for them to complete a sentence without the guy telling them they were wrong cos he'd read it today!

1. We helped to build this company into what it is today.
2. They constantly sent us emails telling us how we are 'winning the work back from PHV' and then plaster London in ads which say 'back in black'

End of the day all the major radio circuits have PHV departments working for them. However the way Hailo went about it was wrong. Some drivers plastered their cabs in Hailo livery to advertise them and they decide to annouce this, I can understand the anger and yes some cabbies are pricks but the vast majority of us are regular guys. Same as every line of work. 

Everyone always mentions how expensive black cabs are and yes on rate 3 we are expensive. However on rate 1 we are actually very cheap and I believe the best thing to do is scrap rate 3 and just have rate 2 for work after 10pm and everything else ve rate 1. We are actually cheaper than minicab firms for trips in central it's only when you go long distance does it jump up in price. 

Truth be told, there is more street work now then I have seen in the last few years. My dad has been driving a cab for 45 years and in that time they predicted the death of the black cab a bunch a times but it still rolls on. I believe that to pick someone of the street you should have a measurable education on the streets around you, I don't even own a GPS everything I do at work is from my brain or a quick peek at map for a tiny side street.  GPS fails from time to time or can send you to the wrong place and people who want to get somewhere fast with minimum fuss want the ease of a black cab. 

God I wish I could run the PCO, LTDA or a trade body. This trade needs new blood and ideas and I want to help it change as I love this job. Anyone wanna help me become emperor?

If we don't sign him we will still be okay, if we do sign him then great.

If you consider the £30m + lost by being out of the champions league and the £7m or so lost by league placing, £5m-£10m compensation to Moyes and the cost of replacing Vidic, Fedinand and (possibly) Evra on top of the proposed £100m-£150m, it is a big throw of the dice.

Bullshit. They're the police asking him questions about a disturbance someone has suggested he caused. Tell the truth, be honest and polite and if you have done nothing wrong nothing will come of it. Cos let's face it, the police have got it spot on here. They get a call from someone stating that they had a voter acting like a dick, and when they ask the guy for his version of events, he acts like a dick!

&gt; He answered the questions and when told it was against the law he told them it wasn't - why shouldn't he affirm his knowledge if they have it wrong - should he just shut up because they happen to be police officers?

There's better ways of doing it than by aggressively asserting his knowledge. If you disagree on a point of law, yes, say so but be polite about it. Describe what you've done and why you've done it without getting aggressive about it.

Because that's how people have voted?  There's nothing saying people have to blindly vote on party lines; it's perfectly legitimate to vote for party A for Westminster and party B for your local councillor(s).

Also does your local authority's area consist of exactly one parliamentary constituency?  I bet it doesn't.  My LA contains 6 parliamentary constituencies, currently represented by MPs from 2 different parties so inevitably some people are going to be in the position of having the council led by one party and an MP from another.

This requires a rather large social upheaval if not consciousness shift and we're getting the very first glimpse of this now with climate change where human activity of the past continuing to the present has reaped what is currently presenting as extreme weather events and will one day present itself as a terrible disasters for entire nations; so our politics is either going to maintain the current short sightedness of not only 1-2 terms but even single human life spans in which our great, great grandchildren will live in a very harsh environment and brand our generations criminals for our inactions ... or we start planting those trees for who's shade we shall not sit.

When he says that they spend £80 a week on shopping then I actually believe him - he eats in a subsidised canteen at work and when he doesn't, he will be attending functions and evening events with catering. Why would he need to spend more than £80?

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"Unfortunately, if the arse did fall out of the housing market, I can almost guarantee you will not be able to buy your dream 2-bed place. Here's why:

* Supply would dry up. People living in houses would be simply unable and/or unwilling to sell. No one wants to sell when they'll be faced with a £30,000 bill to pay on the remainder of their mortgage, so they'll just wait it out like they did in 2008. Additionally, developers would stop building because it would not be financially viable, like they did in 2008. Quite simply, it's incredibly unlikely that your house would be available at all unless you were a cash buyer, which you're clearly not.

* mortgages would become incredibly hard to come by. If the arse did fall out of the housing market, the banks would find themselves with a vast portfolio of mortgages that are on properties worth less than the value of the mortgage. This is very dangerous territory for them as it's damaging to their liquidity, so the demands they will make before they offer you a mortgage (on a house that is very unlikely to be available to buy anyway) will be so onerous that it'll probably be out of your price-range. Do you have a 50% deposit? too bad, no mortgage for you.

* To follow on from the above point, property prices are linked to economic activity. As house prices rise, so does spending, and therefore so does growth. A huge drop in house prices would be economically damaging for the UK, leading to job losses and increasing the risk of repossessions, which exposes the banks to real losses on those negative equity mortgages. This drop in economic activity and damaging of the banking sector will lead to a *further* drop in prices, meaning that if you do get a mortgage on this house that is most likely not for sale, and after you've had to jump through so many hoops that I suspect it'll be out of your reach, guess what's next? You have a £20,000 deposit? Good for you! Now, you get to watch this money disappear in depreciation over the next year or two? You *sure* you want to buy?

So what's the result of your wish for the arse to fall out of the market so you can buy your 2-bed? Well, the owner of that 2-bed doesn't want to sell, because he's in negative equity and will be without a home and a £30k bill to cover. The banks wouldn't finance you anyway unless you had *at least* half the purchase price up front, and were so well off you probably didn't need the mortgage anyway, your job would probably be at risk (as well as millions of others around the country who will no doubt be grateful) and you'll get to sit and watch the deposit you *do* have disappear over the years.",0,1400860029,null,0,false,0,chpb3af,t3_26acpy,t1_chpb3af,t1_chp8yjr,null,1433923438,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

From most of the reports I've seen in the Economist it shows that immigrants actually are a net gain to the UK economy due to being:

* employed (hard to move here without a job and survive)
* Paying more tax 
* Eligible to less in benefits, no matter what the DM tells you.
* Increase spending in local area
* Average stay is about 3 years so long term NHS bills etc become less of an issue when compared to say, UK Pensioners in Spain.

Also look at history - it's a lot easier to assign blame to a certain group or single issue rather than understanding that identity is a complex issue.

Well, thank you for admitting you might have been mistaken in your initial contention that religious texts don't allow the seeking and exploration of knowledge. 

So let's take it that this point is now beyond contention.

But you're still determined to have a debate about the objective truth of religion aren't you when you say this: 

&gt;Now what if you follow that path and realise that there is no room in all of physics for a deity (at least, not in the timespan of this universe) and ultimately there is little evidence for such a deity.

The debate we're having is about knowledge and whether scripture prevents its development. However, here we hit a road block with your perception of what knowledge is:

a) the assumption that the only knowledge is positivist science

b) and thus the only useful positivist knowledge is that which can be utilised by you

Both of which are incredibly shaky intellectual foundations and are fundamentally undermined by the very simple contention that knowledge isn't just positivist science and it does not have to be of any material utility.

Knowledge can be an expression of an ethical framework, or a mode of thinking, or a perception of events. Knowledge in of itself is separate from the act of gather specific facts by scientific method and/or the development of an understanding of those facts. 

Knowledge of good and evil is still knowledge. Knowledge of the nature of man and meditation on the actions of man is still knowledge. Such knowledge still has a material effect, such knowledge can still have utility. 

Even if this knowledge has no utility and material effect, the presence of it, it's mere existence means it is still knowledge. I know of the pain of Job, Jesus' struggle with doubt, of Mohammad's fears in the case, of Sidharta's rejection of materialism, of Krishna's quest for virtue. 

These may not help me build a spaceship, but they exist as knowledge of the human spirit, regardless of either their current utility to me, and whether or not they prove to me the existence of God or not.

true,RealPool,lfc99,,"There is nothing new wrong with our defence. It is the same problem lot of exciting coaches had before. 

1. Our defenders especially Skertel, Agger, and Kolo like to sit deep and defend. they like to defend on the last line right in front of the goalkeeper. Brendan likes our midfield to press higher and win balls higher up the pitch. Now in an ideal scenario, when the midfield moved out, the defence would move out with it. But, because our defenders like to sit back a little, it leaves lot of space between midfield and defence that can be exploited. This is where we see our midfield not tracking their runner and defenders not knowing whether to come out or stay back to defend against those runners, that causes confusion and lot of mistakes. For example we didn't concede a lot of goals against big teams because Brendan was a little conservative against big teams and our midfield sat a little deeper and broke quickly. This meant that there were less gaps between defence and midfield. Brendan has to work on this and make sure that defence and midfield are moving in tandem.

2. In Brendan's system our fullbacks are very important to the way we play. They are required to cover a lot of ground up and down and do a lot of offensive as well as defensive work. First we didn't have full backs to do both jobs perfectly and secondly they need lot of help from midfield to cover for them when they are out of position. We needed to stop crosses going in so many times this season but a lot of times our fullbacks were out of place and our midfield didn't make enough effort to cover for them. Sometimes fullbacks get double teamed, in those scenarios our midfield have to help our fullbacks out. When Allen and Henderson were playing together in a diamond, they helped out their respective fullbacks to a degree. But we need more.

3. We need better communication between our goalkeeper and defence, they should know who is taking responsibility of a particular situation before it is too late. This one can be worked out most quickly. Constant chopping and changing of back four didn't help Mignolet but a season with these players should have helped him and he should come back better next season.

4. If we keep on playing with 2 strikers (which I don't see why we wouldn't), we would need better defensive work rates from them. Both of them are very good in offence but when it comes to defensive work, they leave a lot to be desired. I am not talking about just tracking back, I am talking about making their presence count defensively. If it's too easy to dribble/pass/cross around them, then they are more of a liability in that position than a help. I remember our match against Stoke away where Suarez lost the ball upfront and then ran with his attacker all the way back to right fullback, that moved Johnson out of his normal position because technically ""Suarez had it covered"", then Suarez didn't stop the cross coming in and that led to their first goal. Now, i am not saying that Johnson would have stopped the cross coming in but I expected better from Suarez in that situation.

Nobody's brought up the issue of Islamism except you and I've seen you do this a number of times when discussions about Islam come up, you play the card so many times it loses its value, whenever someone criticises Islam they are people like you whom are too blinded and narrow minded to see that you're defending something that shouldn't be defended. 

Yes the role of Ofsted is to inspect schools and if necessary they file for certain schools to be placed into a process known as Special Measures where a school will be kept a close eye on from authorities to make sure they're actually functioning properly and not doing something and teaching stuff they shouldn't be doing/teaching.

I'm interested in women's rights full stop, Islam doesn't exactly have a good record for women's rights and so it takes a lot of flak. There's no sentiment of racism or Islamophobia , it's common sense.

As the Scottish Parliament has a mixed-member electoral system I have  constituency MSP and several list MSPs that were elected in a proportional manner.

I called you a racist because you said things that are racist. I know you like to pull out the ""islam isn't a race"" which has become a mantra on the right-wing pages as if it somehow magically waves away the basically discriminatory things you say. 

I present the facts when it comes to Islam, because I have vastly superior amounts of theological and critical knowledge about the subject from various sources including deeply academic or non-muslim ones, compared to the commentator son here who think they can peddle nonsense.  

I've had to live my entire life with people asking me about my faith, and you know what I researched it and I understood it. Both from the inside view and the outside view. I also read up on all the other faiths I could just because I wanted to. I also studied the ME.On top of that I've read most of the European political/intellectual canon as well just being a bit of a history geek.

The reason people like you get upset is that my years of learning make you look like the ignorant, lazy and incurious bunch that bigots tend to be. 

I've had my fair share of battle with extremists, both people like Anjem Chaudhary, Majid Nawaz and others. Argument and time usually prove me right. I'm sure the same will happen to you. 

Why? Because your stance always lacks the moral and intellectual consistency that you think you have. 

It's why I bring up the Polish squadrons... 

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/243fpi/xpost_from_reurope_til_a_polish_fighter_squadron/ch389m4

You let your current attitudes towards immigration colour your response to the historic contribution of the Polish squadrons. 

That is moral inconsistency.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Allen was out for a fair portion of our amazing run, with Coutinho playing central alongside Stevie and Hendo.  I think Coutinho excelled there and really stepped up big time.  I wish we didn't move away from that because it was incredible to watch our play in possession.  He also really brought his defensive work rate + ability up a few notches for us.  He was a beast in the City match aside from those couple of scuffed shots and had no fear to go in hard on the likes of Yaya to win the ball. 

Allen stifled things a bit when he came in. He's not great going forward.  He's definitely a better defender than Coutinho though.  You can look through my post history if you want, I've defended Allen from the moment we signed him.  He's a very tidy player and I like him a lot.  But I don't think he should be getting the nod ahead of Coutinho in the majority of matches at this point, he can't transition play fast enough to keep up.  He's absolutely awesome to have when we are taking a more cautious approach, or when we need to lock a game down.

I also think in the future as Gerrard is forced to take on less responsibility we're going to see a lot more of Allen.  I think our play is going to transition from the kind of long ranged, vicious through play that we see now into something more short, quick, and incisive and Allen will be central to that change.  We saw it a little bit with the Lucas/Hendo/Allen middle when Stevie was injured this season and the 3 of them acquitted themselves extremely well.

I really think that there are big things in store for Allen but we're quite there for him just yet.  He still has an important role to play right now for sure though.",0,1400864083,null,0,false,0,chpcy20,t3_26avsz,t1_chpcy20,t1_chpatmn,null,1433924312,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Reported, Live in guys, just walking past a man in the street on the way to the shops, and I can report going live as I type to you guys, he said ""Suarez is a prick"" when talking about the world cup to his friend. 

I am now, this second going to create a newspaper with the headlines - **Abuse hurled at Injured starlet Suarez in streets**, then hopefully if I scowl the internet long enough I will find a recent comment(recent in journo's standards) that says something really bad about Suarez, in fact one time in the pub, I heard someone say he should be injured, so I can add that to, hopefully find a death threat to pull in the readers,  then I shall get hired by the daily mail, and end up getting paid for such knee jerk stories. 

It will read like -

Injured Liverpool hero was subject to abuse on the streets today as fans hit out at Luis Suarez, one small child was seen to fall over when his mother let go of his hand, clearly imitating Suarez being a diver. 

It was widely reported that a small gathering were standing outside of a van in Manchester appearing to sell burgers, it has been reported that the people eating the burgers were imitating Suarez's viscous bite on Chelsea's Ivanovic.  

One man was seen to be walking the streets hurling abuse saying ""Suarez is a Pr**k' and twitter has exploded at the news of his injury as one person sent a message to him saying ""I wish you well"", clearly a saying recognized in gang and Mafia culture.

The Liverpool forward has this week, just had knee surgery being casting a massive doubt for the world cup, the Liverpool foward declined to comment on the situation, so we asked hundreds of people if they think Suarez will be fit for the world cup, until one of them said ""No I don't think so"" thus signalling that the fans here in UK supporting England at least, are hoping he will be out.

In other news Liverpool are expected to enquire about the availability of Lionel Messi as he looked to be distressed after one reporter caught him off guard, Another option Liverpool are currently looking at is Real Madrid midfielder Ronaldo who was seen wearing a red polo shirt this week and walking alone, reports are that both clubs are willing to take a straight swap for Liverpool ace's Aspas and Johnson, with Neymar thrown in to sweeten the deal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also more seriously, I hope we can buy a real bully central holding midfielder with a defensive mind but also good feet, as I just feel we lack in that department alot, and I do not like what I see from Lucas, probably because he is being expected to play like a regista a lot of the time, and it does not suit him.

Completely disagree.  Rodgers is not bad at defensive organization.  We have locked the gates against teams in the past, and done it very effectively.  The first few months of the season we were solid at the back (minus Hull...fuck that game).

However, in the second half of the season, with SAS in unbelievable- literally, unbelievable- form, Rodgers made the decision to play to our strengths.  It was absolutely the right decision; we won eleven games in a row!  We challenged for the title!  Our defense might've cost us in the end (arguably) but if we had focused more on our defense we would've pulled a Chelsea and never ended up in contention for the title in the first place.

So Rodgers made the decision to focus on our offense.  This means more time spent coaching the team to attack effectively, and play through Sterling/Coutinho up to SAS, and less time spent working on defensive shape.  Obviously our defense suffered.  But again, this isn't because Rodgers *can't* do defensive tactics, but because he chose not to- again, the right decision.

It could be argued that we would've done better if we had adopted a tighter defensive mindset in certain games.  Chelsea, for instance.  But at that point we were in a sense locked into a style of play.  We had been training for and playing balls-out attacking football for months.  It's incredibly difficult to shift tactical gears that quickly, and it is certainly not something you do when you've won eleven games straight and are in a motherfucking title race.

Finally, a big part of our issues with defense come not from the back four, but from the midfield.  There are both personnel and tactical issues here.  With regard to individual players- Gerrard is a great pivot, but not a great defensive mid.  He's strong in the tackle, but is a bit old and doesn't quite have the necessary positional acumen.  We were also playing Allen, Coutinho, and Henderson out of the center, where they aren't really designed to play.  And this intersects with the tactical problems our midfield created defensively.

We had one quality winger- Sterling.  Moreover, to fit both Suarez and Sturridge into the side, we adopted a 4-4-2 diamond for a lot of games, with Sterling (or Coutinho) at the tip of the diamond.  That's fine and it worked well for our attack.  But where it fell down was on the wings, defensively.  For one thing, when you play a diamond in the midfield, you lack width, placing a huge burden on your fullbacks to attack and defend.  This is why Johnson ranged forward so much (also, he does that naturally) and we ended up vulnerable on the right flank both because he has to recover, and because he tires out quickly.  This is also why Flanagan got skinned so badly against So'ton and West Ham (also, he's a bit raw, and not very strong yet).

Clearly, sending your fullbacks forward fucks with your back line, and it has to be covered with good communication and solid discipline and understanding in the midfield.  This didn't happen reliably for a lot of reasons.  One, as mentioned earlier, we clearly placed a greater emphasis on our attack than our defense, and as a result got sloppy.  It happens.  Two, we were playing with CM's (Allen, Hendo) or CAM's (Coutinho) on the sides of the diamond.  All fine, works well for attack, but even if they have the legs, skill, and positioning to defend well, they don't have quite the instincts they need to have in order to shield the flanks when the fullbacks go forward, or even in general.  Three, as mentioned earlier, Gerrard is not a true DM, and can't cover mistakes in the same way that Lucas (or even Allen) can.  Four, Johnson came back a bit late, and we had to slot him into the team fairly quickly- which is an issue given that he has a very different style of play and skillset than our other fullbacks.  We also moved Flanno left to right to left.

**TL;DR: Brendan is good at defense, but chose to emphasize offense in the second half of the season in order to play to our strengths.  It was the right call.  Our defense suffered, but that's the tradeoff.**",0,1400864680,null,0,false,0,chpd833,t3_26avsz,t1_chpd833,t1_chpadwz,null,1433924442,38,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,38

That being said, I enjoy both of them very much in subsequent viewings (now that I can pick out the differences in their portrayal of the doctor.)

So, with that being said, I'd say start your friend off with the 11th doctor. It has very few ties to the previous seasons so it shouldn't ruin anything if your friend ends up liking and wants to go and watch the preceding seasons. 

The 11th doctor episodes have a very 'clean' start to them. All the basics are laid out (aside from how the regeneration works, you may have to lay a bit of groundwork) and it dives straight into a very easy to understand story (no bits about overlapping time lines with the doctor giving himself items in the past to have them in the future and whatnot.)

It also is the start of 2 very good story arcs (the Ponds and River Song.) I find myself very strongly attached to those story arcs. I used to be a big fan of the Rose Tyler story arc, but I think River is my current favorite (though Clara is starting to really grow on me.)

Finally, I find Matt Smiths doctor to be the most ""human"" of the new doctors. Which is neither a good or bad thing, but may make it easier to relate to his character. He is also the goofiest of the recent doctors, which adds a bit more comic relief.

Yeah... Only if you ignore the first three-quarters of the video. And regardless of anything else, even if the officer did indeed mean ""Shut the fuck up"", he has every right to say that to someone who is right on the verge of breaching the peace again.


And, in any case, yes, that's his job: a police man. He does have authority over you in this situation and you must respect that authority. If you don't like it, tough, you need to take it up through the proper channels - which he can do because he is recording the situation. Not take it all into your own hands. If you do that in your job with a manager then you will get disciplined, no matter whether you or your boss is right. There is a procedure to follow.

&gt; That's their fucking job, if they don't like it and can't act accordingly in a professional manner then they should give it up. It is their responsibility to carry themselves professionally at ALL times, the bloke can be as much as a dick as he wants, their job is to remain calm, know the law, and not aggravate the situation. The Male officer did not do this.

Again, this is exactly what the officers were. They were calm and the only one aggravating the situation was the cameraman, not even getting the hints from the officers (who gave him every opportunity) to can it. He had to one-up them at every single opportunity he could.

And no, the man can't be as much as a dick as he wants without the police escalating. 

&gt; This is disingenuous and you know it, she didn't ask him to calm down (which is a fucking dog whistle to anyone!) she said ""you're obviously agitated and upset"" - which made him agitated and upset - like I said before, this is Cop 101 phrase to justify any later actions - ask any copper.

He was agitated well before she said that. You can hear it in his voice. She has every right to call him out on it. It does not justify the cameraman to get more uppity over it. What should he have said? ""I'm sorry, officer"", or something along those lines.

I'm sorry but this guy did everything he could to make this situation as ridiculous as possible; the police could perhaps have done more to diffuse the situation, not that it was likely to have any effect on a man who, consciously or not, created this entire aggravation out of a puerile, selfish sense of entitlement.",0,1400866339,null,0,false,0,chpe035,t3_26abn0,t1_chpe035,t1_chpb8d7,null,1433924809,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

true,Philthy_McNasty,,Belfast,"&gt; To blame an entire religion on a tiny, tiny few fringe extremists

Did you base your whole argument on something you imagined i said?

&gt; It's very worthy to note that the quote from Muhammad which this all grew from, was from the Hadith and not the Quran, The Hadith literature does not qualify as primary source material as it was compiled from oral reports that were present in society around the time of their compilation, well after the death of the Prophet Muhammad.

The Quran was written 20 years after Mohammed died. So again not ""primary source material"". 

&gt; There is also a theory that the promise of 72 virgins is a mistranslation from ""72 angels""

You only highlight the problem with religion, and holy books open to ""interpretation"" like the bible. None of it is the word of any god , only men. And it shows.

&gt; here was a study conducted by terror expert and political scientist Robert Pape which took the data of every suicide attack from 1980 to 2003 and he concluded that 95% of every suicide attack was motivated by nationalism and not religion.

So 5% was motivated by religion, thus you prove my point. And your figures are 11 years old. Very weak argument tbh

Lee Rigbys murderers said they did it because its an ""eye for an eye"" according to Quran. Also because they are soldiers of Allah. They also wanted the cops to kill them so they could go to ""paradise"". Your pretty much defeated at this point.

The average person here is conservative to a degree I can't relate to, especially where I live - Northern Ireland. An ultra-christian Loyalist party will win most seats in my local council, by an absolute landslide. My vote makes no difference. 

In Northern Ireland, gay marriage is still illegal and people riot and disrupt life over a change in scheduling of British flags. Which are everywhere, shitting up the visual tone of the place - and I'm not a big fan of patriotism at the best of times. Everyone looks like a skinhead, ""reformed"" murderers and religious and political extremists are voted in, almost always by overwhelming majorities.

I understand that people have died so we have the freedom to choose our own representatives and I respect that, but I don't think our representatives are representative anymore, at least not to me. I don't think the memory of men who fought for people to have freedom from oppression should be used to emotionally blackmail people into subscribing to a system they don't want to be associated with either.

This price is influenced by supply and by demand. If demand goes up gas gets more expensive. If supply goes up gas gets cheaper.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; How? Sinn Fein are constantly campaigning for equality - equal marriage, equal citizenship, etc, stuff which benefits everybody. And campaigning for an Irish language act doesn't ""make themselves part of one side"" either, it's an equality issue.

Oh, come on. Yes Sinn Fein are definitely substantially more progressive than the DUP, but you can't expect anyone to pretend they're not the Green against the Orange. Not that the Orange has any claim to moral superiority, which they seem to have an abundance of, which is kind of odd when you think about it. 

We're all adults here, or mostly, and we all know Sinn Fein represents the nationalist side just as the DUP/UUP represents the Unionist/Loyalist side (title depending on their level of rioting on any given week.)

Personally I think they're preferable to the DUP in almost every way, but they don't have a glittering past. Even if you think the IRA fought for a righteous cause, which I can see both sides of, they, just like all sides did, engaged in some unimaginable atrocities which Gerry Adams still tries to pretend he was never in anyway involved in. Come on. 

&gt; There was no such thing as Northern Ireland. The Anglo-Irish loyal to the Crown just insisted on partition of an area which they felt they had some right to dominate. It's like Passport to Pimlico. Or Putin getting his Russian kinsmen to take over western territory like we've seen recently

And that wasn't OK. Still, surely you'd have to accept the economic problems that Northern Ireland would face if we actually had a 'United Ireland'? I feel like I'm Irish already, because I was born on the island of Ireland, but I guess I'm more heavily culturally influenced by the UK. I suppose that might be different if I didn't live in Belfast.

Either way, the economic meltdown would be catastrophic beyond belief. We are not at all self-sustainable and we have bugger all to contribute to the South.

They care nothing for the low paid British workers, whatever their ethnic origins , but pretend that , but never spell out how, they want to `help` them .

Obviously that depends how much gas is produced.

&gt;With the UK looking like being one of the few countries set to allow fracking

One or two moratoriums does not equal a europe wide ban.

&gt;surely the amount of gas produced by fracking will be tiny next to the demand of continental europe?

I think you're under-estimating how much gas we have under our feet. You have to understand, there's believed to be (and everything down there is based on beliefs in every part of the world so don't go assuming that's nonsense) as much gas in the bowland shale basin alone as there are proven reserves in all of Russia.

Now of course, only some of that will be economically extractable, but that's just in a single shale basin in the UK, and we have several.

So, that slowed my interest again. I didn't get really intrigued until the Doctor/Rose Tyler relationship was underway. (I admit that I found Jackie to be completely annoying and had a difficult time enjoying nearly every episode she was in.)

&gt;The __wisdom of the crowd__ is the process of taking into account the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than a single expert to answer a question. A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. An intuitive and often-cited explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.  This process, while not new to the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_age), has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) and [Yahoo! Answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Answers), and other web resources that rely on human opinion.

I'm sorry, but in this country people are innocent until proven guilty. Can YOU prove that he took pictures of someone else's vote? If not, good luck getting the CPS to prosecute. Simply saying ""he might have been!!!"" is not going to win you the case.... Especially if you make no effort to gather the evidence beforehand. 

If the police were concerned about him taking pictures of votes, they could have asked him to hand over the phone to view the pictures, take appropriate action if he doesn't comply and gather evidence from there. Even if he deleted the photos you could likely recover them. This is called police work, you need EVIDENCE to prove a crime has been committed. 

I don't think you understand how the law works in this country, you seem to also believe that taking a picture of, for example a wall in a changing room would be illegal. If there are no people in the picture, why on earth would it be illegal...? Is it murder if I stab my door with a knife?

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"I'm hardly a leading expert in this particular market, but I do have some experience here and I did work in the financial industry for a good few years, so forecasts are what I spend a lot of time on.

We're not in a ""crisis"" right now, but it could hit one if we're not careful. Remember, the nationwide rates are fuelled mostly by London, who had 17% growth compared to this time last year. For most other people, it's been inflation-rate growth.

Now if there is no intervention, then quite simply we'll see a return to the 00's property price growth. The market conditions (not enough supply to meet demand, plus the incentive of having one of your biggest purchases appreciate faster than a typical index investment fund) would mean this would continue until either it plateaus way above what the average person can afford, or lack of regulation would allow the sale of poor quality financial products leading to a 2007-style crash.

So we know we really want to avoid an overall drop in prices. While a drop for one quarter would be OK, longer-scale drops tend to snowball as panic sets in and we will see the aforementioned problems occurring. We see this snowball effect when deflation occurs (Japan had years of this), and when stocks drop (that's why Brown banned short-selling for a while in 2008). So, we're looking at a best-case scenario of either prices freezing for a few years, or remaining at a steady inflation-matching (2%-2.5%) growth. Demand for property right now is high, so I suspect the latter is far more likely.

So I suspect we'll definitely see a cutting down on help-to-buy, and if that doesn't stem the tide, I suspect new criteria for mortgage lending may come in. This may entail a minimum deposit, or lending multiple regulation. However, this is pure speculation as when you mix politics with it, it could go anywhere.

But long-term, prices aren't going to come down short of a catastrophe. A drop will hurt the country and most Brits far more than it will help them. The best we can hope for is that regulation will enable a price freeze for a while, letting the income of the average person catch up a bit with prices.",0,1400873988,null,0,false,0,chphhzj,t3_26acpy,t1_chphhzj,t1_chpfh64,null,1433926524,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If we fear a lack of schools / housing / healthcare, then we simply build more schools and houses, and invest in teaching and healthcare instead of crippling our own systems like is happening now.

Concerned that they will just come and leech off our benefits system? Clamp down on benefits cheats and those who refuse to work. All of them. How would we fund this? By clamping down on tax dodgers, and raising taxes for the super rich. They can easily afford it.

We can easily support a huge number of immigrants, we just need to invest in infrastructure and job creation instead of pandering to the already rich and powerful.

Sahko being called shit is just a baffling opinion and based on some people's inability to understand that his balance has nothing to do with how good he is at distribution. Agger looks silky in comparison, so people rate him higher.

The fact is our defensive set up is just...dun dun dun...not good enough. And any CD there would be get caught out for criticism. 

AS FOR your Joe Allen contention. Honestly, I get neither praise or outright hate. I think a fairly balanced thinking person could say that Joe Allen has not shown enough to warrant being a starter. At a moment in time when our targets for positions in the middle of the park are improving in their quality, I think that could spell his end here. 

When an individual like Coutinho, just as small and just as strong (read: weak) can come into that deep position and take it from a true CM, it really doesn't say a lot about Allen.

true,aaulia,null,null,"&gt; You are just as likely to hurt the team by playing inexperienced young players than not letting a younger player in while a player like Lampard is playing just fine. An example being Wenger and his kids.  
  
I think you missed my point, when I say younger, relative to Lampard age, it means Oscar, Matic, Hazard, Van Ginkel, and whoever we will get next young, even if pushed it further to Baker, Ake, Chalobah, these younster is not some nobody. Wenger (and/or Arsenal) problem is they cannot get hold of their prime star (**NOT** the 30+ players), they did let them (30+ players) go, Arshavin and Henry for example. Arsenal ""kids"" problem is because they can't get a hold player like Ashley Cole (back then), Cesc Fabregas, Nasri, Clichy, so they are forced to promote youngster all the time, not to mention their horrible fitness record.  
  
&gt; Even if he splits his 23 games this season with a youngster, he could fill in when the experience is needed. We are on the verge of 200k of wages if Luiz and cole leaves and another 170k if Torres leaves so it's not like we can't adjust the budget to accommodate a club legend. Fuck not even a club legend he will probably go down as our greatest ever player.  

In case of Torres, that is a very **BIG** if. Even if he leave, it depends on the agreement with the club who will ""buy"" him, who knows, maybe we still need to shoulder his remaining wages in order to ship him out. Not to mention, we still will have players coming in, and if we want them to be ""stars"" we should be prepared to offer ""stars"" wages.  
  
Look, I'm not against Lampard, Cole or Terry staying until they retire or something. But it goes both ways. I'm against the club going mad, just agreeing whatever the players ask just because they were/are legends, that stupid, in the end of the day the club still have to be run like business. Wouldn't the criteria for a legend is that they are willing to sacrifice something for the good of the club? Giggs, Scholes, Carrick all got rolling contract at United, they seems to be fine, no drama that I know of. And speaking of United, look how they handle Evra transition, they are forced to bid stupid amount of money for Shaw, not sure how they will replace Giggs, Januzaj? Inexperienced, Carrick? Scholes?. 
  
These ""debate"" has been happening since like two seasons ago. The argument is always the  same, Lampard is still good, experience, etc. I mean by the time Lampard is not ""good"" enough we will already miss the time frame for transition, and we will be left with either inexperienced youngster, or we will, again, splash massive amount of money and take bigger risk in search for new backbone.",0,1400877336,null,0,1400906040,0,chpj0br,t3_26bg8w,t1_chpj0br,t1_chphgsf,null,1433927234,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I've noticed the same too. I sometimes browse the BBC comments sections (up until a few months ago they were rarely open on most major stories). They used to be quite left wing, but occasionally you would turn right wing on stories about things like Muslims ('multiculturalism doesn't work' stuff), or politics ('Still voting UKIP', 'smear campaign' stuff).

Now, there are two answers I could think of. One is that it is a concerted effort to raid the comments sections by groups who support those opinions, such as UKIP supporters organising themselves en masse to upvote all the pro-UKIP comments, and downvote all the critical ones. This would be like what we saw on /r/ukpolitics , where someone on /pol/ would post the thread and because /pol/ supports UKIP, the thread would be skewed. 

Two is that those stories naturally attract the type of people who are willing to make accounts and comment. UKIP are a fairly new party, with lots of new supporters. This means those supporters will likely want to tell others of these views, and try to convince them. I do the same with my views a lot because they are a bit out there and aren't represented by the main parties. This means you'll find proportionally more UKIP supporters willing to make account and comment, because they want to spread the word. You don't find the supporters of the big 3 doing it as often, as their views are quite will known and accepted, and they don't feel the need to convince others.

No, because the plural of police is, in fact, police.  You seem to be under some confusion as to what the word police actually means. The word you *may* be looking for is police officer, the plural of which is indeed police officer**s**.

I don't know what the person complained about exactly, perhaps she mentioned things that prompted the police to visit.  For all you know the guy involved regularly causes fracas about town.  Also, the legality of taking a photo of your ballot paper is dubious.  According to the BBC, the police could choose to prosecute such cases - the law is ambiguous and a case like that would set a precedent in England and Wales, consequently clarifying whether or not it is legal.

Which solution is it that you've imagined?

I'd actually believe in a government that adopts policies aimed at reducing inequality. Higher taxes for the rich. Currently income taxes are way too low. Would it hurt so much to increase them back to the levels they were at under Thatcher? Proper enforcement of inheritance taxes. Cutting back on tax-dodging by multinationals etc. I'd restrict some of the ways in which big businesses and capitalists hold poor people back. Get rid of pay day loans and mega-casinos. Get rid of the false hope of the national lottery that is effectively a tax on the poor and the stupid. Stop advertising of sugary foods that make our nation fat and indolent. Are those the policies you imagined?

I'd initially use the money gained to reduce our national debt, and lower debt levels should make our country more competitive and allow workers such as this one to compete more effectively on the international stage.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt;  I think they're seen as very single issue and it's a single issue no-one really cares about

That's the thing, UKIP were seen as single issue before their extensive TV presence too. It just so happens that their single issue was central to the EU elections and differed from the three main parties, hence why they were able to gain so much support. Now they have that support, and added exposure/coverage from the new Ofcom rules, people are becoming more and more aware of their wider policy ideas. We have seen prominent party members distance themselves from their 2010 manifesto, because before now very few people bothered to read it; the EU issue alone was enough to gain them votes.

Most people are indifferent about it, or feel that Labour/Lib Dems/Conservatives already do enough about environmental issues.

Sorry, what? Were you watching the same video as me? It's pretty obvious who the passive-aggressive actor is here, and it's not more than a little disturbing that you've failed to recognise that. 

&gt; This whole situation could have been so easily diffused if the guy just calmly stated what had happened to the police

That's what he did, even though the police were doing the usual provocation. 

&gt; nstead he decided to exert his obvious superiority of knowledge of the law and its practice.

What a crime!

&gt;  He was speaking belligerently,

No, he wasn't. You're wrong and your interpretation is skewed. 

&gt; he female officer very reasonably, and very nicely, alerted him to the tone in his voice.

Both police officers had a substantially more provocative, passive-aggressive tone of voice. Before, during and after.

&gt; The male officer was also dealing with it calmly - until the guy kept asserting his rights and speaking over the officer.

Talking out of your arse.

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"Finally you've come up with some solutions rather than simply defending a man who has proposed shambolic solutions to the country's problems. 

&gt;Higher taxes for the rich. Currently income taxes are way too low. Would it hurt so much to increase them back to the levels they were at under Thatcher?

Raising income taxes doesn't necessarily increase the amount of tax gained, historically we've seen tax revenue rise when it was slashed from much higher rates previously. UKIP want a flat rate of tax and massive tax cuts for the rich.

&gt; Proper enforcement of inheritance taxes. Cutting back on tax-dodging by multinationals etc.

Okay, you haven't clarified how you'd do this though. There's already been a general anti-abuse rule implemented (which I fully support) to combat aggressive tax avoidance. Better international treaties are required, the EU has helped on this front but obviously UKIP aren't the right party if you want these sorts of things to happen.

&gt; I'd restrict some of the ways in which big businesses and capitalists hold poor people back. Get rid of pay day loans.

UKIP support deregulation so they're opposed to you on this front.

&gt;Get rid of the false hope of the national lottery that is effectively a tax on the poor and the stupid. Stop advertising of sugary foods that make our nation fat and indolent.

I presume you'd fund the programmes currently supported by the national lottery through taxes? UKIP isn't the right party then, on the sugary foods, again UKIP oppose you here.

&gt;I'd initially use the money gained to reduce our national debt, and lower debt levels should make our country more competitive and allow workers such as this one to compete more effectively on the international stage. With debt levels reduced our country will gain greater financial independence and then I'd spend funds on training and reducing green house gas emissions.

Firstly you haven't shown these policies will actually achieve the intended effect of raising more revenue. Lower debt levels don't make the country ""more competitive"" and you'll need to make significant cuts and raise tax revenue at the same time to achieve a budget surplus which would be *extremely* difficult.

On greenhouse gases, UKIP don't believe in climate change or global warming and oppose any measures taken by the government to deal with it. 

I see you've left immigration out of the solution here, if you're not anti-immigration why did you feel the need to defend the UKIP voter's anti-immigration comments?

There would be no way for them to simply re-do their work in a couple of months and put on a new show. Additionally the facilities they needed for their work would be closed due to fire damage and the university will wind down for the summer break. And that's not considering the fact that if you have just had all your work destroyed, it's art. You can't just say ""ok, shit happens, give me a week and I'll get another copy made"", it's going to take at least some of the students some time to get their shit together and start again.

I have no idea how the university would deal with that, they could wave the tuition fees, but then there are things like having to take a 4th year of student loans to cover a 4th year of study. The only choice the university may have here is to let these students re-take their 3rd year for free and give them grants in lieu of loans, maybe even paying for them to attend other universities if logistically having double the number of 3rd year students isn't going to work (as depending on the damage, they may have trouble with the normal intake next year).",0,1400882455,null,0,false,0,chpl6ra,t3_26ali3,t1_chpl6ra,t1_chpekug,null,1433928261,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

              Austin

This is with a view so as to bring Zamora on for perhaps Henry if in the last twenty minutes we're looking for a goal and then put him and Austin up front. Might start O'Neil instead of Hoilett and bring him on at the same time if we need a goal. And BAE is a tough choice, main reason I'd play him is because he wouldn't be phased by the occasion whereas playing a youngster like YSY on such a huge game could be too much for him.

With two right footed CBs in 80% of the pairings, one will obviously have to be played on the left. In the 18% of cases where you have one of each, chances are the leftie will play on the left.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Finally you've come up with some solutions rather than simply defending a man who has proposed shambolic solutions to the country's problems. 

I am defending him as a member of the working class. I'm not defending his opinions, so if you thought so then you misinterpreted me.

&gt; Raising income taxes doesn't necessarily increase the amount of tax gained

But it's equally false that continually reducing tax rates will increase the tax rate. There is an ideal level for taxation, and currently we are below it.

&gt; but obviously UKIP aren't the right party if you want these sorts of things to happen.

Where the hell did I say that I support UKIP? I oppose them!

&gt; I presume you'd fund the programmes currently supported by the national lottery through taxes? 

A few of them. Many would be dropped. Giving proper support to things like the health service would have much higher priority.

&gt; Firstly you haven't shown these policies will actually achieve the intended effect of raising more revenue. 

And you haven't shown they wouldn't. However they would have the effect of reducing inequality, which is a good thing in and of itself.

&gt; Lower debt levels don't make the country ""more competitive""

Ofc they do. Enormous amounts of money go towards servicing debt. They also severely limit the economic freedom of a country by giving international finance the ability to deliver the ultimatum ""Do what we say or we increase interest rates"" (incidentally, that's exactly why many asian states run a surplus - memories of what happened in the SE asian crisis). They haven't had to use such ultimatums on us because the Tories already do their bidding!

&gt; if you're not anti-immigration why did you feel the need to defend the UKIP voter's anti-immigration comments?

You've completely misinterpreted me. Where do you think I defended his comments. I defend him because he (a) has some legitimate grievances and (b) has been unfairly singled out for middle class people to laugh at like some exhibit in a zoo ""and here we can look at the UKIP voter in his native habitat..."".

A flat above a shop might only be accessible via the shop. If the owner chooses not to live there, it might not be practical to rent it out. Some rural properties might be completely useless to someone who can't afford a car.

There are also areas of the country where the chances of getting a job are pretty much zero. There will probably be spare housing there, but moving homeless people into the area en masse isn't going to help anyone.

true,MrJMaxted0291,uk,United Kingdom,"I have been a NEET for about 9 months now since I had a mental breakdown due to chronic loneliness/frustration and locked myself away in my room. There was a period where I was on the fringe of starving myself to death as a form of suicide, and only ate and drank at all because my family hung food under my nose every day until I was mentally fit enough to leave my bed for anything beyond 5 minute toilet breaks when I was certain I wouldn't run into anyone on the landing. I still cannot look anyone in the eye and I have the nagging feeling I'll never get to feel confident or happy with myself again in my whole life. For the record, I'm a 23 year old man who feels used up. How sad is that?

While I wouldn't go far enough to say people are entitled to a job, your comments on what people have a right to in this country has piqued my interest a bit. Where do you draw the line? Education is a sure fire benefit to the state assuming it manages it's educational system properly by supplying the country with a modern, high skilled work force. Without a public education system you'd have great swathes of the public unable to read or write, which would spell disaster for record keeping and drastically increase the amount of exploitation of the lower, now uneducated classes.

Healthcare meanwhile has been proven to be cheaper and more beneficial to society when it's operated publicly. The US doles out several thousand dollars more per patient than we do in the UK, but still can't ensure the same quality of care as the NHS. To add insult to injury, insurance normally defaults in the face of long term or serious conditions like cancer or heart disease, and patients wind up going bust anyway. With this in mind, a national health service seems like the ""sensible"" choice.

Now as for entitlement to a job at a competitive wage, I'm of two minds. On the one hand it's unrealistic to assume we can constantly source the demand for work. If the 2008 crash has taught us anything it's that the world economy is undependable and prone to exploitation by people in positions of authority. With a boom/bust economy we couldn't realistically hope to give *everyone* a good job they'll be happy doing. 

So on the other hand what happens to the masses of people in an unhappy situation? A fair few will wind up taking jobs they are unhappy with, at poor pay, and try to make do. The success of this approach varies. While some will eventually strike an equilibrium and find a way of life they're happy with, many more will wind up compromising more and more until eventually they snap and become unable to do anything, like I have. Should they ever find their feet again they'll be met with barriers barring their reentry to the work force, with a great gap in employment history permanently staining your job prospects at even the lowest McJob.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"The defensive mistakes have been a combination of individual errors and due to a lack of proper organisation at the back. Rodgers has been vocal about wanting a defensive leader - that's why Skrtel was dropped last season and Carragher came in. That's why Kolo was signed for this season. Our organisation when defending set pieces has been suspect, and we've conceded a lot of goals away from home to smaller teams - which suggests it's a mentality problem, either complacency or nervousness.

Keep in mind that Rodgers' system is very demanding in what it expects of its defenders. In addition to their basic defensive duties, fullbacks need to offer width in attack, centre-backs need to be able to pass the ball around, and all the defensive players need to be mobile enough to cover more ground - because the fullbacks are so high up, the centre-backs individually have more ground to cover. It also means that centre-backs need to be well-rounded and able to deal with more 1-on-1 situations, because there's more space between them and other defensive players - if you're weak in the air, you're going to be found out; if your positioning is weak, you're going to be found out; if you're slow, you're going to be found out.

The other thing is that our first line of defence - the pressing done by our front 5 - often wears off as a game goes on, because we have nobody fresh that's good enough to bring on off the bench. Liverpool made the fewest substitutions in the league this season - for a side that presses as much as we do, that's a fucking terrifying statistic. Hopefully with more quality options, Rodgers can rotate players and use substitutes, and thereby keep our pressing game going for 90 minutes, thus shielding the defensive players.

Also, you can't just ""sign a defensive coach"" and it works magic. They have to have the same ideas about playing the game as Rodgers does, and thus coach their defending in that particular style. Otherwise, what's the point? They'll be teaching one thing, Rodgers another, and you'll end up with more confusion, or a broken team. 

Stop looking at individual players; in some cases it's a personnel thing, but I do think that having one vocal CB with leadership quality would improve the performances of the other defensive players around them, as would more consistent pressing over 90 minutes from the front 5.

Obviously we still learn about it in school and it's studied a lot but I don't think there are many overt things. Primary schools focussed on the home effort anyway rather than the front line, it was about how people had to turn all their lights off at night and how they'd have bomb shelters. There certainly isn't a glorification of war.

Clearly the wars started the idea of wearing poppies in November and Remembrance Sunday etc., people are still around who experienced the war first hand and then lived through rationing for a while after 1945.

The war is definitely in our cultural and collective memory. People use the phrase 'Dunkirk Spirit', the Dambusters theme is well known, the whole 'don't mention the war' attitude. The  'keep calm and carry on' (as overused and cliched as that is now) reflects attitudes in general, and did so at the time too. There's perhaps a bit of rivalry with Germany too, but it's almost all very friendly these days. Winston Churchill is going to be on the next £5 note (though not just for being wartime prime minister), and his ""we shall fight on the beaches"" and ""Never was so much owed by so many to so few"" speeches are very famous.

I think it brought people together more. It certainly didn't eradicate class and class culture, but there was a united front amongst people, and it's this that probably led to the formation of the NHS and the decline of maids and butlers amongst other things after the war. The war also led to the formation of the EU and clearly that is very topical right now.

Physical changes happened. It's not too hard to find damage in bombed cities. London has quite a lot of pockmarked walls and missing buildings.

I think the issue with Agger is he struggles with genuine pace, and genuine strength.

On the ball you'll do well to find someone better but he's too easily bullied.

Skrtel is very Jekyll and Hyde. Can be the best CB in the league or the worst, and he can change between the two several times a game. As a defender he's good, committed to tackles and attacks the ball well in the air. However he is at times quite inconsistent. Still our second best CB. Maybe the high line isn't suited to him and brings out the odd mistakes. 

What Sakho has is physical dominance over almost any striker. He may not be quick but he's strong and attacks the ball. Even when he's matched for strength, he adapts (i.e Ba beat him to every header in the 0-2 game and within 10mins Sakho stopped going for the header and won every 'second ball'.)

Sounds about right. I like shiny but not so much in nail varnish, mainly because I have really long nail beds so I can't keep my nails short, I try to cut short and it just cuts into skin, and anything too 'out there' or sparkly just looks like an old lady's desperate effort to be down with the kids rather than actually looking good on me. Strong/long nails are both a blessing and a curse. I usually have to top the edges of nail varnish up at least three times a week (still on the hunt for that perfect top coat). 

I haven't heard of Salon Services - what/when/how?

I'll let you know if they're still any good, because the one I had was absolutely worth it, more like a £40 product than a tenner, but people mess around with their products and it could now be a pile 'o shite.

I don't think border controls are necessary as you make out.

Some parts Europe have higher welfare than the UK and yet they operate within Schengen. Just as someone in Wales can get the same level of healthcare as someone in London (theoretically) despite being different cultures, speaking different languages.

I think border controls are mainly brought about by those desperate to hang on to power and exercise their power over others. Further the real necessity seems to be to prevent espionage, one government stealing another governments secrets. But as far as the commoner goes, there's no real benefit to having restriction on their freedom of movement.

If you want to talk about straw men, the idea that an open border would automatically mean the UK becomes a vending machine of services to the people of the world is farcical.

For a start, economic factors prevent everyone from having autonomy - no border control needed, they simply can't afford to travel - then there are a large majority who don't want to live far from home and family (case in point our resident of Walsall above). But finally, it would not take much to have a more open border (to Schengen at least) and have tightened rules around services that require proof of residency to access them.",0,1400886522,null,0,false,0,chpmrx6,t3_26b18y,t1_chpmrx6,t1_chpmahr,null,1433929010,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't think a list of parties really covers it. We've had just as many factions of the left and far left. Beleive I'm a former Pol Sci student and am quite aware of the diversity of parties that existed. 

Here's what's new, the far-right have been subsumed and subdued by the conservative party to some extent. For two reasons - firstly, we fought a war against the Nazis and the previous two generations had direct experience of it. So, even if the appeal of some of the appeal s to order and historic essentialism aren't that far from Tory rhetoric - the one-nation Tories which was the paternalist branch of the Conservative party was not going to let it have its head.  Even with the death of one-nation Toryism in the 1980s a lot of that accepted abhorrence of the far right still existed in the party itself. 

I don't think that exists right now. I think there are three reasons for this. Firstly, the Tory part like the rest of UK politics has been creeping right since the 1980s with more extreme activism from the grass roots. 

Secondly, conservatism has internationalised and has found common cause with the conservatism in the US thus absorbed some of those notions of what it is to be conservative - you can see it the way Conservative Home talks about ""liberals"" and ""hard left"" or ""Socialists"" = which is more in the manic terms of US based conservatism than what we had before. This started with Thatcher/Keith Joseph and her adoption of trickle down economics because of Reagan.

Thirdly, the far right has changed its tactics and decided to head for the mainstream in palatable ways actively using the internet, presenting itself as compatible with mainstream conservative thought.

Yes, he's grumpy, he even can be mean and selfish. But in general he cares about his companions and likes teaching them stuff. And isn't it really nice to have a main character who ISN'T all good and well meaning?

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Some parts Europe have higher welfare than the UK and yet they operate within Schengen. 

Language differences restricts movement within Europe. But there are still pressures on social support. They just operate more slowly. We should be careful, if we head towards a ""United States of Europe"" not to head towards ""United States of America"" style attitudes towards social support.

It should also be noted that the EC still has external borders, which are actively enforced.

&gt; Further the real necessity seems to be to prevent espionage, one government stealing another governments secrets.

Border controls do very little to stop espionage in the modern age.

&gt; For a start, economic factors prevent everyone from having autonomy - no border control needed, they simply can't afford to travel

That was the main reason why border controls weren't important before the 20th century. However nowadays travel is fairly cheap. Especially for the poor and the desperate.

&gt; case in point our resident of Walsall above

Plenty of people move from Northern towns and cities down to London every year. The current pressure of all the people wanting to live in London has driven property prices up to incredible rates. And you say you want to make it easier?

&gt; But finally, it would not take much to have a more open border (to Schengen at least) 

You say that borders should be removed. However you only justify it with reference to Schengen countries, all of whom have their own welfare states. If borders are entirely removed then there would be far more disparity, and far more incentive for people from poorer countries (e.g. North Africa) to move here.",0,1400888978,null,0,false,0,chpnp90,t3_26b18y,t1_chpnp90,t1_chpmrx6,null,1433929446,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Giving way is actually written, 'give way to vehicles on the major road' you are on the major road.

So it doesnt matter if you were on the wrong side of the road or anything, as long as you were abiding by traffic law. ie, not speeding or crossing a solid white line.

This actually means she hit you after pulling out of the side road into your right of way, meaning she hasn't given the road her due care and attention. 

This could mean she could be cautioned and given points/ disqualified for either careless driving or driving without due care and attention. This will depend on if you decide to take it further or not. 

As for what to do next, as police attended, I assume that they collected details for yourself the driver and witnesses. 

At the end of the day 100% of the fault lies with her, contact your insurance company who will do all the leg work. Or you can have an estimate of price of the damage and she can pay up without a claim on both of your records.

You (or the insurance lawyers) will need to contact the ambulance service to get hold of the patient care record for your treatment, and the hospital for the records they hold.

You can also claim compensation for distress and injury if needed. 

From what I can see, you're perfectly legal, but i'd write a statement for insurance and draw diagrams so when it does go further you dont have to remember the little details.

Any other questions please ask away :)

Ooh, that is entirely dependant on what you're doing. Currently with help-to-buy, you can get a 95% mortgage. However, as I mentioned it looks set for the chop. Outside of that, it entirely depends on your financial circumstances as well as the criteria of the lender. However, I will say this: when you put down larger deposits, you see the mortgage cost drop dramatically. Larger deposits mean lower risk, which means lower APR. My sister-in-law has a house that is worth the same as ours. Her deposit was about 20%, whereas ours was about 35%. even though the difference is 15% of purchase price, our monthly payments are literally half hers.

Or, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. You could look at investing in a rental property.

I haven't really cared to look into the overarching picture of it all, but I would *assume* that scrapping tuition fees would be rather expensive, and overall bad for the country. Yet I still supported libdem because it would have benefited me. Do you think then we should have banned students getting a vote last election?

What about pensions? I *think* labour was going to reduce spending on pensions, which caused a large chunk of the elderly vote to go to the conservatives.

 It's a place that's been ignored for 100 years, or only given after thoughts.  A traditional industrial area, Queen Victoria is commonly thought to have named the region when she refused to even look at it saying I don't own this black country as she pulled down the blind on her train carriage ([though it could be from the red at night, black by day saying or the prominent coal seams in the area] (http://www.sedgleymanor.com/historical/black_country.html)), this despite it being one of the sources of wealth as it made high quality machinery which shipped all over the world in the forge of the industrial revolution at that point, hence Black Country from all the chimney towers in the area.  Funny that, is seen as the high point when in actual fact it was partly the cheap labour there which was part of its success as well as being a hub with canals, railways, roads all leading to the central cog of the country.  They made iron, steel and manufactured nails, saddles, buckles, chains, trains, bricks etc 


Cue a century of slow decline as industries are exported around the world and people bought cheaper foreign made goods rather than from the home of industrial revolution.   In the 1920's and 30's this was a [home to right wing extremism with Mosley and the British Union of Fascists proving popular in the area](http://wlv.openrepository.com/wlv/bitstream/2436/41779/1/Morgan_PhD%2520thesis.pdf) as they started to feel the bite of this process.


[Then in the 80's British Steel was shut down and effectively destroyed any remaining local industrial future and jobs](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/16/why-britain-doesnt-make-things-manufacturing) as Thatcher stripped the country of any manufacturing capability and put the banks in charge of making money for the country.

The various waves of immigration over the years have moved into the cheap housing left by the Victorian Bournville inspired housing complexes.  Not because they wanted to, but because its the only place they could afford. This has led to virtual ghettos where historical immigrants have made their homes.  There is very little mixing, and is far from being a homogenous multicultural society.  It gets to being us and them.

Now the people that are still there hold a grudge, they are clinging on to the marginal existence as one of the historic homes of industry.  Any regeneration money focuses on Birmingham, rarely on the Black Country, [unless the business owners in the area do it for themselves.](http://www.theguardian.com/heartofenterprise/regeneration-game)
The youth have no future, what's the point studying there's no jobs, and if you're not an above average student, a guy who 100 years ago may have machined tools, mined or shovelled coal there's nothing for you and the sadly traditional spiral of decline takes place


Plus this guy probably ate a curry some time in the last week and didn't consider for an instant that he was depriving an honest British fish and shop of a livelihood.

&gt;

&gt;__""Playing doctor""__ is a [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase) used [colloquially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquially) in the [western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) to refer to [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children) examining each other's [genitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitals).  It originates from children using the [pretend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing) roles of [doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician) and [patient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient) as a pretext for such an examination. However, whether or not such role-playing is involved, the phrase is used to refer to any similar examination.     

&gt;Playing doctor is distinguished from [child-on-child sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child-on-child_sexual_abuse) because the latter is an overt and deliberate action directed at [sexual stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation), including [orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm), as compared to anatomical curiosity.  Playing doctor is considered by most [child psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_psychologist) to be a normal step in childhood development between the ages of approximately three and six years, so long as all parties are willing participants and relatively close in age. However, it can be a source of discomfort to some parents to discover their children are engaging in such an activity.  Parenting professionals often advise parents to view such a discovery as an opportunity to calmly teach their children about the differences between the sexes, personal privacy, and respecting the privacy of other children. 

&gt;In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), children, who parents say were playing doctor, have been arrested and put on the [sex offenders registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offenders_registry).

true,Markjake,angel,Weeping Angel,"well here's just my little point out. Hah Little (Thanks to The geeks on TV tropes)

Technically, each regeneration is a response to the faults of the previous version (or what got them killed):

*The First Doctor's body was ""wearing a bit thin""; so he got himself a newer, younger one, which was what he needed for his types of adventures.

*The Second Doctor was forced to regenerate, by the Time Lords, so they made him as far away from his old self and as close to a typical Time Lord as they could; as such, the Third Doctor is more typically heroic, a man of action, and (like his former society) somewhat vain.

*The Third Doctor was too old and stuffy, and his ""man of action""-type escapades were getting worse and worse... so he regenerated into a younger, more bohemian figure, who abhors violence (when he can avoid it) and doesn't mind looking shabby with his infinitely-long scarf.

*The Fourth Doctor didn't know who he was, anymore; he'd grown dark, and old, and his final season had him plagued with doubts about his approach to the Universe; his regeneration, after saving the Universe (which then spited him through his short fall off a tall satellite), transformed him into a younger, even meeker character, much less blustery than he had been, and more relatable to the humans he travelled with so often.

*The Fifth Doctor had lost nearly everyone, and the troubles and travails of The Caves of Androzani had shown him that his peaceful, meek way of dealing with the Universe wasn't working; after trauma like that, who wouldn't want to become a brash, egotistical, sure-of-himself figure who doesn't take guff with anybody over his decisions (even in fashion!), such as we got with the Sixth Doctor?

*The Sixth Doctor's bluster had alienated almost everybody from him, so a softening up seemed in order; a quick bump against the TARDIS console transformed him into the Seventh Doctor, who seemed, at first, to be a much lighter figure than his Sixth self had been; slowly, however, he revealed a much darker, more calculating side of himself — perhaps the Universe had been better off with Six?

*The Seventh Doctor, however he might have calculated, could never have predicted he'd be killed (temporarily) by a gang of street thugs in turn-of-the-century San Francisco; that weakness, as well as the cold way in which he'd treated enemies, changed entirely when he regenerated into Eight, who went completely spur-of-the-moment and had compassion even for the Master (a trait that would be horrifically exaggerated two regenerations later).

*The Eighth Doctor was a suave, gentle figure filled to the brim with compassion for every living being. Yet the Time War turned every Time Lord, including himself, into a despised boogeyman. Dying because of his attempts to save a space pilot who literally allowed herself to die to avoid owing her life to a Time Lord, he was convinced by the Sisterhood of Karn to regenerate as a warrior, 
the War Doctor. It has to be noted that the Sisterhood of Karn granted him the ability to willingly choose and customize fully his regeneration, like Romana did. He still choose to become a Warrior, allowing himself to be involved in the Time War and hoping to end it once and for all.

*The War Doctor even refused to give a number to his reincarnation, and he was reviled from his next two regenerations. He knew nothing but war, and he grew old as a bitter, gruff old soldier. While he believed himself the agent of Gallifrey's ultimate destruction, with the help of the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor he was able to place his homeworld and his peer into a time loop, shunted in another universe. Still, his old age in the end claimed his life. Even knowing his next incarnation would have no memory of him saving Gallifrey, and would believe for many years to have doomed to an eternal death the Time Lords, he died at peace, entrusting the future of his species to his next regenerations.

*The Ninth Doctor, oblivious to the last cathartic actions of the War Doctor, had a revelation at the end of his life: He could be happy, even in the face of death! He needed a self with more brash, more bravado, more emotion... and he got it.

*The Tenth Doctor was afraid of change; all the emotion and brash bravado in the Universe couldn't stop regeneration... but he tried, anyway. He couldn't stand to let go, or to let emotion well out of him; 

*a lesson the Eleventh Doctor took great heed of.
On top of that, the Eleventh Doctor realized Ten was far, far too involved with his Companions, making them fall in romantic love with him. Ten was too human. His solution? Love your Companions, for sure...but act like the crazy alien you are. He also knows what's coming up for him-River Song and a serious relationship, be it sexual or not. Eleven also knows this ends with River dying. Hence him being so curious to find out about their adventures - he wants to change it so she won't die. Furthermore, Ten had been plagued by a long string of losses: Rose shunted in another universe with his Meta Crisis clone, Martha abandoning him because he couldn't stop thinking at Rose, Donna being mindwiped to spare her life and the Master refusing to regenerate to avoid living in his care and then shunted in the Time Lock to help him: so the Doctor brought his ""no one dies"" mantra to his extremes, becoming obsessed with Clara and her long string of apparent deaths and allowing the young girl to get close to him as a way to protect her. Also Eleventh knows he's at his last life, with the War Doctor counting as the ""real Nine"" and Ten having literally burned away a regeneration to enact his ""Meta-Crisis"". So, he tries to make the universe work without him, and erase the former image of the Doctor as a fearless warrior and a Dark Hero, leaving behind himself only a legend of hope.

*The Twelfth Doctor is could be the First Doctor of a new Cycle. He's a reset of the Regeneration Cycle, once again a suave, but a bit grumpy, old man in a box.

OR IN MY OWN OPPINION:

12 Could be the valeyard without directly being him.

since 12 is technically thirteen, a breach of the rules and laws of the timelord race, Calpaldi could have a screw or two loose, resulting in a Darker Doctor who in the way we least expect!

It could be he himself That blows up the Tardis!

Hell he could even be the meanest doctor so far...

I think when he signed from Liverpool, Torres and Liverpool demanded a ridiculous fee with conditions ASKED by Torres and we agreed. Hazard's brother for example had conditions put in his contract that Thorgan didn't even know of, and I just cannot see Roman forcing Torres onto the starting XI.

Yes he's obviously a pushy guy, but to force a player to play Season after Season that has COST you at least one title (this Season, without Torres, I think we would have won the Title) is in my eyes far fetched. - If we were a mid tier club I'd probably sway more towards the Owner pushing the XI, but we are not.

Or, since the mental affects of sexual assault can often be delayed (victims finding themselves powering through the immediate aftermath of it before being hit with a realisation of what happened at a later point), she could, only recently, have begun to accept what happened. She may have finally gathered up the courage to speak to someone about it for the first time, someone who in turn advised them to not keep it quiet any longer. Sometimes victims of sexual assault become frozen at the mere thought of their attacker, and the amount of time this affliction takes to pass is anything but fixed, if it even passes at all. It is possible then that this woman has broken off chains of paralysis induced by the assault and she is ready to talk.


I don't know, but you asked why she would wait, and while you seem to have drawn your conclusion already, I'm trying to give a different view on things. Imo, IF she has been sexually assaulted, then she has the prerogative to come forward with it at any point in time. The only question that needs answering, the only question that matters, is whether it happened or not.

It matters what skills they have and what they bring to the British economy. I fail to see the connection between that statement and saying borders should be abolished. That's a bit of a hyperbolic fallacy you're using there. 

Throwing money at a declining workforce won't solve an ageing population. That's the origin of the decline. Our population is becoming top heavy, and the population of working age is decreasing. How would you solve that without immigration? We need a large workforce to pay for the elderly pensions, and the upbringing of our youth. 

The skill deficit originates from British empathy towards certain job areas. Blue collar work is seen as a failure in modern society, and so we've historically needed immigrants to fill blue collar roles. 

This is a distraction from the main conversation though. Why should the men and women we bring in to fix these problems not have a democratic right if they're here for **at least** 14 years? They work, they pay into the system that is supposed to represent them through taxes. They contribute as much to our society, government, and economic output* as you or I do, so why should they not have democratic representation? You haven't answered that question yet.

I can't stand the DUP leadership, and it's a pity because there's a number of DUP candidates that do an honorable job around the country.  It's too bad they have to stand with the DUP.

The PUP are all about exclusion.  Their leaflet was jam packed with protestant white male this, British flag that.  They aren't a party that I'd ever want to vote for.  Any party that wants to only include a single demographic of this country in its agenda is problematic and the core of the problem if you really think about it.

I think what's difficult for Unionist voters, is that they can't find a party that approaches the problem from a traditional political and economical perspective.

If you assume that BBC &amp; ITV journalists tend to be liberal in their outlook (remember reality has a liberal bias) then they'd quite like Cameron to lose the next election. If nothing else, its a better story.

However, he's doing better and better and there is a real chance he could get back in (particularly if he can exclude scottish MPs, always been plan A).

So, what you do is push the loony far right party, UKIP, who can soak up voters like the racist grannies and dumb working class right who thought maggie was to kind to 'them scroungers'. That way the tories get many less votes and in a first past the post system you get many more Labour MPs.

UKIP can easily deliver a 7% swing away from the tories on their own - enough to scupper Cameron. The greens can only really pick up the ex-lib vote (which they likely will, after they imploded).

In short, it makes total sense for the Beeb to push UKIP and Murdoch to try and find them to be loony idiots.

The reason, it seemed to me, was that a lot of UKIP members were openly and intentionall using the party's semi-respectable face ahead of time to cover their much more unelectable views. When Paul Nuttalls of the UKIPs says that he wants Romanians to stay in Romania to make Romania stronger you know for a fact he doesn't mean that. He doesn't give a toss about Romania; he's from a party whose main policy is exactly paraphrased as 'We don't want anything to do with Romania'. What he really means is I don't want Romanians in my country. 

Farage makes a lot of subtle points and careful distinctions. When he says he wants to lower the aid budget he says this is because a lot of it is spent on political activism and only a small amount is spent on actual aid yet Godfrey Bloom hears that and thinks 'Good, we don't want money going to ""Bongo Bongo Land""' when that's not actually what Farage is saying. Farage can't highlight this problem because it would show division in his party and UKIP members continue under the illusion that their leader doesn't want any immigration, wants Britain to be more militarily active (ruling the waves as the man from Warsall said) etc etc when actually he's being more subtle because he knows that such views without careful alterations are unappealing and unelectable.

I think what got me into Charlie Brooker has to be the same intake but opposite effect, being in hollywood for years and driving 2 hours out of my way on working days to do shakespeare, the Reality TV culture felt personally invasive and offensive to me, I felt like it was unavoidable and deeply resented its presence in my life.  That aside from the fact that I had a friend who was personally just fucked over by Reality TV, a force that does a visible disservice to the artists, while maintaining a veneer of hope and celebrity, really fundamentally bothered me.  That's when I first found some of the works in the link.  I imagine there's a point when I leave that very one-note comedy behind, but for now it's been a cathartic escape from a world that's brought us everything from From Justin To Kelly to Kimye.

However, it is a ""concentrated"" comedy to me.  If I just sit back and relax, I'll take Russell Howard, Lee Mack, or Stephen Fry any day.
