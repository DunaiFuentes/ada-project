Collison is an interesting one, he was, at one point a real player- perfect for a Martinez system, with flair, technique and confidence on the ball.

It ended up being completely unsubstantiated. Schoolkids saying non-PC things and some left-wing teacher getting overly offended is nothing to write home about. The fact that people on here are using UKIP's preference for the sovereignty of the UK parliament is example of fascism shows on what thin grounds people can make these claims.

&gt; Yeah, it is. Post-WW2 we've been warned off fascism with the most extreme examples, but you don't need to emulate Hitler to qualify as fascist. That said, I'm by no means trying to label UKIP as full-blown fascists, or even neo-fascists, but what I described is characteristic of fascism in-utero. There's just an air of it with the public dialogue UKIP are creating and we simply need to be aware of it, because while it's mostly benign, it has the potential to develop into something worse.

So they're not fascist or neo-fascist, but they raise concerns with immigration, so that's 'fascism in utero'. UKIP actively ban BNP members joining their party (something none of the other three parties do), and whenever someone is found guilty of racism in the party, they are kicked out. This whole allegation is just an attempt to smear the party, because they can't deal with UKIP's arguments.

All answers based on the books end up being an exam on ethics and/or political ideology (which is why I liked it so much). Things get convoluted really quickly and there's little ever talked about in terms of the actual literature. A few esoteric comments about socialism and a tenuous link to the novel/play is usually enough for a good grade.

Anyway, at least this time they didn't change the entire syllabus *in the middle of the fucking year.*

true,patrick888,null,null,"&gt; it's a total shithole built by slave labour

It is a common myth that slavery is widespread in Dubai. Although it does exist in small amounts, as it sadly does in every country in the world, [it is actually relatively rare.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/17/this-map-shows-where-the-worlds-30-million-slaves-live-there-are-60000-in-the-u-s/) It is certainly not enough to account for the construction boom, which actually requires many millions of workers.

&gt; These workers have literally no rights, they're imported in from poor countries and once they're done, they get fucked back off again, often without being paid because they have NO rights under the legal system at all.

Actually there are strict regulations regarding labourers. I volunteer for humanitarian charity here in UAE so I see this first hand. There are of course lots of problems but it is not quite the slave-driven hell hole you depict.

You don't have to take my word for it. US-based economist Michael Clemens wrote a report on migrant workers in UAE in 2013 ([source](http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/seize-spotlight-labor-migration.pdf)). He had this to say:

&gt; First, the economic benefit to migrant workers is extraordinarily and systematically large: migration to the UAE for basic construction work causes their daily wage to rise by a factor of five, and causes employment to rise by at least 20 percentage points. Second, there is no sign that many of the commonly-mentioned costs of migration are systematically experienced by migrants' households; migration to the Gulf causes the fraction of households in debt to sharply decline, and there is no evidence of labor force entry by school-age children or labor-force exit by adult family members. Third, households are generally well-informed about working and living conditions in the UAE, and there is no evidence that they enter into migration systematically overestimating the benefits. Households with migrants give estimates of migrants' income that closely reflect true income in UAE administrative records.

[UAE is currently rated the top 14th nation in the world human rights](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/uae-named-top-arab-nation-for-human-rights-523362.html). It still has lots of problems of course, which people are working hard to resolve.

&gt; How about we send every person that thinks workers rights are overrated over to Dubai to do the manual construction work that the Bangladeshi immigrants have to do for 6 months? Live and work in their conditions, no help from daddy, no contacts to get you a cushy do-nothing management job, nothing. 

Of course a British expat would not fare well. But you are ignoring context. The labourers are not from a developed country. They are from some of the world's poorest communites, where they are lucky to get any employment. Even if they do, the average salary in India is $100 a month, so you can see why earning $300 a month in Dubai is so alluring to them. There is of course no excuse for any abuse, and I hope that anyone threating or beating workers is arrested for breaking UAE labour law.",1,1401028264,null,0,1401097251,0,chqpd6f,t3_26fqwj,t1_chqpd6f,t1_chqmnlg,null,1433947529,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

**When you went to secondary, was there a lot of violence or fighting between the boys?...**

Not really, violence was few and far between and never unprovoked. Our head of P.E, Mr Simpson, was built like a brick shit-house and would end fights almost instantly; there was one occasion in Year 7 where a Year 11 punched him when he tried to break up the fight, it didn't end well for him.

**Are state schools generally ""rougher"" than private schools, or is that not the case?...**

I went to a state school, but I had a lot of friends who went to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School so I was pretty up-to-date on their daily happenings. 

To be honest, we're just as bad as each-other, except the private kids tend to be more creative with their pranks/mischief.

I look back on my years fondly, but I do not believe the quality of education being given is the best it could be. Schools prioritise exam results over giving you the best employability/preparation for higher education.

It depends on the kids and how the school deals with them. The school I went to was very high achieving and (looking back through my teacher eyes) I know that the senior leadership team backed the teachers up discipline wise and therefore discipline was good. A school I've just been training at has essentially the opposite- no real back up of discipline, leading to kids doing what the hell they want because the consequences don't bother them.

In addition to that, it depends on the area. If its a semi rural middle class school, issues will be rare. Urban lower class school, issues will be less rare. 

That said, it all boils down to the kids. If you've got kids that want to fight, they'll fight. But I'd say that was rare. 

There is an overlap between private and state schools I think, but mostly private schools are better behaved. Think of it this way- if you were paying £30,000 a term for your kid to go to school and he kept on getting into trouble, wouldn't you kick his arse back into line?

true,Caprylate,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"""Does it benefit everyone"". Yes, do the maths. Anyone who downvoted clearly hasn't done them. You're also wrong for the other reason that low earners actually pay 32% - 20% income tax and 12% NI. 

Currently, £14000 a year (retail min wage full time job) would leave you with £12474 a year net. Given the merging of income tax and NI and the increasing of the threshold to £13000. Only £1000 of income would be taxed at 31% = £310. = £13,690 net. 

Let's take the median income of £26000 which would currently leave you with £20634 net. Flat income tax would leave you with £21970.

Everyone is better off! To say it would not be a cut for low earners is to not understand the current income &amp; NI tax system!

The other benefit is pension tax relief would benefit lower paid more as it'd be 31% tax relief not 20%, where as HRT would get 31% instead of the present 40%. HRT would actually lose out in the regard. 

Cutting taxes in the short term does have a sudden effect on money the government collects, but a UKIP economy would be a lower spending economy (no EU, no foreign aid, smaller public sector etc) so the hole would be smaller. Not to mention, the less money the government steals from low earners, the more they have to spend on themselves! The money still gets used in the economy, the only difference is the individual who earned it retains a larger control of it.

Fights were rare, less than once a month, and never too bit. I managed to get myself into 2. One was not much, other saw me getting knocked out by a punch to the jaw and cutting my lip open on my teeth.



However, even with this, secondary school is one of my best memories. I made some real friends, but most came out with an understanding of what types of people not to make friends with. We all go through stages, and at times I went through depression, bullying, loneliness etc and times where I had many friends and we'd hang out daily and have loads of laughs. 



I remember my time so fondly that it's convinced me that I want to go into teaching, and so maybe I'm a little biased but I'm very sorry that you weren't able to experience secondary school life. Many lessons are learnt there, including pain, joy, standing up for yourself, getting through the day, making and dealing with losing friends, learning respect for authority and most importantly - finding your own personality amongst all your peers.



It also depends where in the country you are, and the school. It is *very* locationally/school dependent. Maybe there were no good schools in your area, maybe your mother was overprotected, I wouldn't like to say.



A small comment on private schools: teaching quality varies between schools, generally its higher quality and provides greater support for special educational needs pupils, but this doesn't stop fights from happening, but they likely happen less often.

Race is ALWAYS a relevant issue, I am very confused as to why you think it isn't in the UK? We have a TON of race issues, and even if we didn't, remembering the past in order to view the present in context is always important to keep us on track. To say that racial issues were NEVER relevant in the UK? I think maybe you should brush up on your history there a little, but let's not get into that here. Regardless, even if you aren't interested in racial issues the book has a lot of merit in other areas. For me in particular, it was the sibling relationship, something which never loses its relevancy, that I found the most appealing. 

I also didn't find the book tedious at ALL. I thought the storyline was pretty action-packed and easy to follow. And I thought it was very well written.

As far as I am concerned, we are pretty much from the same generation. I, and many of my classmates, did not find this book or its themes irrelevant. I can't remember anyone in my class having this reaction. Just because a book was written before your generation doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed by you. As I said, I like to read 19th century books the most. They're DEFINITELY before my time, but I think I learn the most from them.

Cause Lukaku (and Sturridge) are better than Torres

&gt; over a proven goal scorer 

You're calling Torres a proven goal scorer? Do you watch Chelsea games? Or do you actually think performances from the past somehow matter now? Guess what, they don't. Torres is a proven, mediocre, mid-table team performing striker now.

When Chelsea had him Sturridge was outscoring both Drogba and Torres in the PL. End of discussion. We have reason to easily believe Lukaku would too. Chelsea really fucked up and didn't win the title this year because of their striker problem.

Fights...I can't say there were many. I maybe witnessed 5-6 in the 5 years I went there. To be fair, there were probably more than I saw given the group I interacted with. You did hear about them in class...bearing this in mid though, fights were definitely not a daily occurrence. The only ever fight I was in myself was actually in Middle School, and it was less of a fight, more the other girl punching me because I was fat and me just taking it.

Standards...I thought the standards of teaching in my high school was quite good. I felt sorry for the teachers at times; some of kids were less than appreciative of their efforts. I took electronics at GCSE, and the class was full of boys who, quite frankly, didn't give a shit. Lessons were spent dodging resistors and capacitors as they were thrown around the room. Our teacher actually set up an after school session for those of us actually serious about getting a decent grade.

My opinion is that private school would be less like this, but having never been to one, can't really comment any further.

Importance...I do think high school was an important phase of my life and despite things not being perfect at my school, the fond memories far outweigh any of the negative ones. Despite being the fat swot of my year, I had plenty of friends. Bullying was something I didn't really experience; all memories of that stem from middle school rather than high. My POV might be slightly skewed given my home life wasn't great; school was in many ways an escape for me.

I will send any children I eventually have to my local state school, based of my own experiences (which I am well aware, will probably be completely out of date when the time comes :-/ )",0,1401037182,null,0,false,0,chqshn2,t3_26feev,t1_chqshn2,t3_26feev,null,1433949064,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,electricheat,canada,Canada,"&gt;  A judge has ruled that a five-month-old baby boy should be taken away from his parents in part because the child had not yet been given a first name.
&gt; 
&gt; Mrs Justice Parker said one of her concerns in an adoption ruling was that the baby at the centre of the case had not been named by his parents.
&gt; 
&gt; Ordering that the child should be taken into care, the judge said the father had been behind the ""emotionally harmful"" decision not to name the boy.
&gt; 
&gt; ""His father has refused to give him a name,"" said Mrs Justice Parker in her ruling.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I think ideally the mother independently would not have taken that view.""
&gt; 
&gt; The judge said the boy was starting to acquire language, and added: ""Every child needs a name.""
&gt; 
&gt; She went on: ""I truly think that it is emotionally harmful not to give a child a name.""
&gt; 
&gt; The judge decided that the baby should be taken into care after being told how his father had assaulted one social worker and threatened to kill another.
&gt; 
&gt; She said the father appeared to have become frustrated by what he saw as an ""invasive"" approach by social services staff - and she said she thought that he could be ""dangerous"".
&gt; 
&gt; She also had concerns about the vulnerability of the baby's mother, who had been diagnosed with a learning difficulty.
&gt; 
&gt; Mrs Justice Parker outlined her reasoning in a public ruling following a private hearing at a family court in Watford.
&gt; 
&gt; The judge said the couple's two-year-old son was taken into care last year after another judge raised similar fears and described the father's behaviour towards social services staff as ""dangerous"".
&gt; 
&gt; She said the baby had been taken into interim care days after his birth, pending a final court ruling on his future.
&gt; 
&gt; Mrs Justice Parker described a history of problems between the father and social services staff in her ruling.
&gt; 
&gt; The judge said the father did not think his partner needed local authority support when looking after children, and believed he could provide all the support she needed.
&gt; 
&gt; He appeared to have become ""increasingly frustrated and intolerant"" about what he thought was an ""invasive approach"" by social services staff.
&gt; 
&gt; He had punched a male social worker in the face a number of times at a court hearing last year and had been convicted of threatening to kill a female social worker, she said.
&gt; 
&gt; Mrs Justice Parker said there was no evidence that the father or mother had deliberately physically harmed either of their sons.
&gt; 
&gt; ""This is a terribly sad case because father and mother, each of them, have many excellent qualities,"" said the judge. ""It is absolutely plain to me that both of them love each of their sons, their boys, from the bottom of their hearts.""
&gt; 
&gt; But she said she was ""quite clear"" that a placement for adoption was the only answer.
&gt; 
&gt; She said no other family member was available to care for the baby.
&gt; 
&gt; The father says he and his partner aim to appeal.

When someone says some long winded sentence it doesn't sound like a joke we would say today unless you use tone to indicate your intention. Seeing Much Ado About Nothing recently was interesting because some parts I found genuinely funny and I know I never laughed once when I first saw it as a child. You just need to be able to keep up with the words and the play needs to be well acted too. 

I remember being struck by this part in Henry Vth where one of Henry's men catches a French soldier and proceeds to have quite funny series of miscommunications. The English solider asks the French soldier what his name is and the French soldier, not understanding him and upset at his capture, says 'O Seigneur Dieu!' meaning O Lord God! The English soldier then goes on calling him O Signieur Dew. He asks for an 'egregious ransom' from the French soldier and the Frenchman says 'Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?' meaning 'Is it impossible to escape the force of your arm?'. The English soldier replies angrily thinking the soldier is offering him the metal brass as a ransom rather than saying 'bras' meaning arm. They he tries to speak mispronounced French as well. ""Owy, cuppele gorge"". I would imagine it would be hilarious if acted well. I've not yet been able to watch it only read it.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"UKIP don't have an official Brexit plan: Yet. they plan on a more ambitious move more likely.

The above comparison is just to prove that the costs of access to the {single market} vs {political union + single market} include significant political costs and hence in that scenario some savings would be made not to be sniffed at. The EU has huge debt too, so again they're going to be politically agitating to raid member nations' for money (Eg EU budget contributions) in the future also as well as couch that in the language of necessary to afford more ""democratic reforms"". Anyway that's going off on a tangent.

I have no idea what UKIP's Brexit plan looks like. I guess they're saving it for the GE elections to ratchet up the discussion on UK's membership of EU?

In terms of influence, it's negligible in the EU anyway atm (ie UK punches below it's weight). Secondly outside the EU, the future direction to develop another system with those members presents itself as a major opportunity. I think this is a very sound course to navigate in changeable conditions; eg Federal/Fiscal 2-speed EU and other global macro events that influence also.

The ""loss of influence in the EEA"" meme is a fallacy and over-blown. All indications show it's more positive: Cost-saving, Policy powers returned,  Less laws though still acquis laws but still reductions made, Influence where it counts and veto as opposed to QMV and of course democratic (democratic deficit) and sovereignty gains, the most important of the lot.

The other way to look at the EEA is as a ""Reform/Negotiation"" with the EU on steroids that is far more productive, possible and positive than Cameron's feeble non-starter. So it is win-win for UK and EU in the event of a democratic referendum. In the long-term the EU has too many unresolvable problems, so the UK leaving is just a symptom of the foundations being fundamentally flawed.",0,1401038979,null,0,false,0,chqt6cz,t3_26fg8d,t1_chqt6cz,t1_chqs2y0,null,1433949386,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For starters I eat pretty big portions, so all the usual advice of ""make a big pot of something and eat it for 3 days"" just doesn't work. I can fill a large pan with chilli, padded out with beans, and finish it in 2 dinners, 1 lunch, so it doesn't turn out that cheap.

Second, I buy lots of fresh fruit and veg. I spend £20-£30 a week just on fruit and veg, and it always runs out before it goes off.

I see other people my age spend £30 a week on groceries, eat every meal with rice and pasta, then go out and spend £40 a week on drink and eat out twice. I'd much rather just spend that money on nice food from the shops.

I make my own salads for lunch, then cereal or eggs for breakfast, and a home made smoothie/protein shake (frozen fruit, yogurt). Dinner tends to be four or six sausages (16 for £3.50 usually!) with plenty of veg.

I could easily spend over £100 a week on food for myself if I could afford to, and I plan to once I earn a bit more. ",0,1401040455,null,0,false,0,chqtqkp,t3_26fq1v,t1_chqtqkp,t3_26fq1v,null,1433949651,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

In that vein in the 50s/60s and into the early 70s there were massive ""slum"" clearing efforts in a lot of cities where old, small, cramped houses were demolished to make way for new estates and new housing. One of the most visible remnants of this are the tower blocks which are now being removed and replaced.

As for the societal effects, we realised that we weren't invincible, and that we were slowly losing our place and power internationally. This was the time when the USA truly became the world's greatest power, instead of a small collection of nations (The UK, France, Spain etc) being seen as the ruling elite of the world as they had been for hundreds of years.

And in terms of individual ""marks"" I think that in the majority of cases of people who survived the war there is a common thread of ""don't let it happen again"". And, I know this is a generalisation, but most of these people tend to be more conserving with food and resources - they know what it's like to have to live on the [meagre amounts of food and goods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9wNJ78S2GY) provided to them during the war, and this has carried with them. 

They also tend to be more ready and willing to accept other loss and hardship, and can ""make do"" with sometimes very debilitating situations and injuries, like the veteran who has to use two sticks to walk to the post office each week to draw his pension - he copes with it because he has to and ""it's not as bad as some of the things I had to deal with in the war"".

These folk also tend to be more independent and self-sufficient - they've coped with worse before and they don't want to be a burden on society or anyone else.

I honestly cannot see anything redeeming about his game. He is like Francis Jeffers, except without the good things about Franny. 

Even a lot of Sporting fans think he is shite:

&gt; we could create a few oportunities but he misses ALWAYS , he only shots without pointing or something , and that shows the quality of the player , if hes good he would score 50% of that FLAGRANT oppotunities

&gt;He's a flop. Good positioning, but mediocre at everything else. Most of his goals were either spoon-fed to him, or came from penalties. He has the looks, the name, and ""CV"" of goals, but he's pratically a guy walking around with wooden legs in the pitch.

(In response to an 'is it the consensus he sucked at Sporting' question:

&gt;That's definitely consensus, they should make a ""chances missed by RvW at Sporting"" video.

&gt;Only by watching the games one can understand how bad he is. We bought him when we were cash-strapped for 5 or 6 mil because our DOF thought he was kind of a poor-man's Cardozo and we would be able to seel him for around 15 mil. After he started playing most Sporting fans accepted that the money had been wasted. When the news broke that we had sold him for more money than what we had paid all the press were surprised it seemed so implausible that some journos even thought there was something shady going on.

Anyone with the slightest interest in reading can pick them up and read them any time they want, and they'll be in every school library for free or on Amazon for 10p used.

I don't think studying English Literature is just supposed to be about reading a nice book for enjoyment and it encourages lazy teaching if literally 3 or 4 ""old favourites"" get trotted out year after year. When I was at school the only books we ever studied in English were To Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men and Lord of the Files. The teachers had easy lessons because the material was unchallenging, but I don't really feel like I got anything more out of it than I would have done if I'd just read the book at home.

Reading literature often isn't easy. For example, it's often difficult to understand what a passage in a Shakespeare play actually means, but when you do it becomes interesting and engaging. So it takes more effort and understanding on the part of the teachers and the pupils to teach more ""difficult"" literature, but the pupils actually get something out of it that they couldn't get from just reading for pleasure. 

I suppose it really depends on whether you think the purpose of GCSE English Lit is supervised, enforced reading time or the study of literature. I guess that requiring kids to read anything ""difficult"" will turn some of them off reading for good, but it seems a bit sad to suggest that other kids don't get to learn about more interesting writing as a result.

They might vote similar due to economic policies and all that but the stance on nationalism is an important distinction in NI politics. They don't have the same historical baggage as Sinn Féin and won't be as involved in ""take down the flag"" type stuff.

the trouble isn't what the law says - its how its enforced, which is essentially as the king sees fit, i highly doubt a business owned by one of his close friends or relatives would be worrying about labour laws.

the GNRD which you have cited does not seem to be a very well established organisation, i also had a look at their [staff profiles](http://gnrd.net/team.php) and it would not surprise me to find they have a lot of bias.

&gt;the average salary in India is $100 a month, so you can see why earning $300 a month in Dubai is so alluring to them.

nobody doubts that it is alluring, but whether they are being exploited is a different matter.

University of Birmingham is a HUGE campus, very open, loads of different things to do. Chilled out atmosphere, a ton of diversity, awesome academic reputation and great night life. 

Aston University I would say is probably better for Business and it has very good employability/industry links. It is a more closed-off University, kind of like an up-scaled version of College. It's in the City centre, easy to get around.

Birmingham City University - It is the weakest academically of the 3. The campuses are set in different areas depending on what you study. The business one is in the city centre I THINK or if its in Perry Barr then it is about 20-30 minutes from the City Centre. It's an alright Uni, I studied there, my bro studies there too but people from Birmingham only go there if they can't get into UoB or Aston. Decent for Media/Graphics related studies.

NIGHTLIFE : All of the 3 Uni's are pretty similar in terms of nightlife, but UoB would edge it purely because of how big the campus is and it feels as though it is a small village whereas the other two feel like more formal places.

ACADEMIA: Aston for Business. University of Birmingham is excellent too but Aston beats it in this. BCU a distant third. I wouldn't count UCB/Newman.

true,scwol,null,null,"Here's a rough break down of getting your licence:

Item | Cost
-|:-:
Provisional Licence | £50
Theory test practice software | £7
Theory test | £31
Driving Lessons (40 hours @ £23/hour) | £920 
Practical test | £62
TOTAL| £1070

40 hours seems to be a rough average from various figures on the internet, and is roughly what it took me - same with the £23/hr figure. I had 20ish 2-hour lessons once a week and no private practice, some people prefer 1-hour twice a week or something.

I reckon you could bring down the amount of lessons with decent private practice, emphasis on decent. This might not actually save you much money though as you'd have to get yourself insured while learning. It really can be quite hard learning to drive with family members, no matter how well you get on with them normally, which is probably why so many people just learn with an instructor. You might also have an easier time learning with a friend, providing they're 21 or over and held their full licence for at least 3 years. 

You can start practical lessons before you've passed your theory, but you have to pass your theory test before you can apply for a practical test.

I'd definitely recommend getting software to practice the theory test, if only for the hazard perception element - I know I would've failed that if I'd not practiced it. It'll cost you another £31 if you have to resit the theory, consider it a form of insurance.

The problem with crash courses is they leave very little time to correct any issues you might have. If you can't get the hang of something, it could cause you to fail your test leaving you with another £62 test fee and more lessons to pay for. Unless you desperately need your licence by a fixed date, I wouldn't bother.

Insurance can vary wildly based on your postcode and make and model of vehicle - I'd do a few searches on Money Supermarket. Older cars aren't necessarily cheaper to insure, I wouldn't even bother inquiring about something without ABS or airbags. That extra few hundred quid on a car can save you far more in the long run on annual insurance costs.

TBH middle class is a terrible term for what is really a different axis of power. In truth today there is no upper class (that is a meaningless term today). What we have is a dominant middle class. Where middle class are people like Bill Gates rather than somebody who owns their own home. Bill Gates has enough wealth to challenge the very way nations work. That makes him middle class.

FWIW I don't think it is even sensible to call a person middle class if they don't have enough wealth stashed away to effectively live their life as they want.

true,ink_drout,null,null,"I went to a private girls school- there were still fights. There are people who cause violence or upset in all walks of life. School mostly provides a safe place to learn how to cope with interacting with people of all sorts whilst getting an education. I was at senior school from 98-05. I had friends that came in from other private schools, state schools and overseas academies. None of them found our school dramatically different from any other that they had been to.

 I absolutely adored school, but there were people in my year doing similar classes and activites that hated it. I enjoyed the routine, the opportunities, the learning, meals, social aspect. Other people hated the routine, meals, being stuck around the same people for years and knowing they had to see it through until they had their A levels.

 Think later life shaped me more but I still have school friends and go back regularly for events. I think I would have loved any school though. And my school was peculiar in its laid back approach to education and pastoral care though.  Some private schools are much more rigid than state schools. If you don't perform well or don't fit in then you won't have an easy life. 

It's a shame you didn't get the experience but if you got qualifications and are where you want to be in life then I wouldn't dwell too much on what you missed. It was a long time ago and you can learn the same lessons about interacting with peers through work and hobbies.

It is probably always worth putting some money in an ISA. The rates will probably improve, and the interest will always be tax free. You CANNOT put money into last years ISA. I would suggest putting a bit of money in one each year, for long term savings.

Just now the banks offer a terrible interest rate because they don't need your money. The reason for this is:
* The government gave the banks money to try and encourage lending, but they didn't do that so they don't need your money
* The banks are being far too strict about lending money to new business.

&gt;

&gt;__José Alberto ""Pepe"" Mujica Cordano__ (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse muˈxika]; born 20 May 1935) has been [President of Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Uruguay) since 2010. A former guerrilla fighter and a member of the [Broad Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Front_(Uruguay\)) coalition of left-wing parties, Mujica was [Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ministers_of_Livestock,_Agriculture,_and_Fisheries_(Uruguay\)) from 2005 to 2008 and a Senator afterwards. As the candidate of the Broad Front, he won the [2009 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_general_election,_2009) and took office as President on 1 March 2010.

&gt;He has been described as ""the world's 'poorest' president"", due to his austere lifestyle and his donation of around 90 percent of his $12,000 (£7,500) monthly salary to charities that benefit poor people and small entrepreneurs.

true,Boatus,,CO4,"Another Colcestrian here but I grew up on Mersea ( a little island about a half hour from Colchester) and I went to the Gilberd up in Highwoods. I'm probably not that dissimilar in age either (I'm 25) and my friendship group is generally about the same age. So the places I'll mention you'll meet a lot of people about that age.

Firstly I've not seen anyone mention the Vic!?! The Victoria is an awesome pub at the bottom of North hill (near the college... err British college so 16-18 year olds). They mainly sell ales and quality beers. It's not expensive it's just not the usual options of:

* Stella
* Carlsberg
* Strongbow
* Fosters
* Carling

That seem to plague every pub in the country. I suppose you might call it 'craft beer' anyway it's well worth a visit and they change their beers frequently too.

Other places suggested aren't bad either. Purple dog and the hole in the wall are good pubs, I just spend most of my time in the Vic because of the beer! 

If you can drive there's a very quaint but beautiful pub in a place called Edwardstone, about hmmm ~30 minutes outside of Colchester. Well worth the visit and the food there is awesome too. Proper pub 'grub'. Like I said though, you'd need to drive or get a cab (which is about £20 one way I think). they have a beer festival in Summer as well. If you do like beers and ales I'd recommend signing up with [CAMRA](http://www.camra.org.uk/) because they give you discounts of beer and let you know when all the beer festivals and tastings are!

Music shop wise you're pretty limited now but like /u/lukasz90  said you can easily get a train to London. It's about 20 quid return if memory serves and it takes under an hour if you get the fast train. Be warned though, the last train leaves liverpool street at 11pm so going to gigs in places like the Brixton academy could be a bit difficult. You've also, thanks to the underground got Leicester square, Camden... the list goes on. There's a lot to enjoy music wise there. I'd maybe take a look at something like NME magazine when you get here as they often print lists of gigs and venues in them.

Other venues you might want to take a look at are:

* [Norwich Academy \(easier if you can drive but they've got quite a few decent bands that play there.\)](http://www.ueaticketbookings.co.uk/events/default.aspx?v=1)
* [The Bull](http://www.thebullcolchester.co.uk/) (not a bad place actually and I've just noticed that it's linked to another pretty good venue too!)
* [The Arts centre](http://www.colchesterartscentre.com/) (they do everything from spoken word to Reel Big fish! it's a pretty good venue all round)
* [The Mercury theatre](http://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk/) (so named for the statue to the Roman god they found underneath when they were making it, pretty cool place but it's a theatre not a venue)

Now I'll get laughed at by others on here but Mersea does have some things to offer. There's a restaurant called 'The Coast inn' and I can't recommend that place enough. If you like seafood that's the place to go. Nice pub garden, nice atmosphere and if it's sunny/ warm (a rare occurrence I know) it's beautiful. Not to mention that there's a week of racing in August, I know it's after you get here but maybe next year dependent on how long you stay? Just don't get caught by the tide, the strood (the name of the bridge into the island) is kept low enough for it to flood twice a day. I've no idea why the old biddies want to keep it that way but it does mean that twice a day you can't get on or off for about an hour or so each time.

I can't think of much else right now but if you like history Colchester and its surrounding villages have plenty to offer as well .There's loads to do but unfortunately we're used to it so complain there's nothing here! Equally, like I mentioned before, London isn't far and there's all the museums and places to visit there. Most of those are free so a few days in London seeing them is always worth a trip.

I think that's about it, again if I think of anything else I'll let you know and update this.

P.S. A word of advice. The coffee shops here, they're not like 'Tim Hortons' and I'm always incredibly jealous of Canadians for that. I miss 'em and I only go to visit for at most 2 weeks a year!

What troubles me is whether it's true that it was removed simply because Gove ""doesn't like it"".  Which would be ridiculous.

What also troubles me, is that if you read between the lines, it appears that these books haven't been ""removed"" so much as the range of options and breadth of literature to be study broadened so that two of the main core texts (it's not like students get to study that many) aren't from a fairly narrow genre of mid-20th century American novels.

Yeah petrol here is mega expensive. There was a post the other day from a Yank that was saying it costs about £1 for a gallon... here it's about £1.30 for a litre -_- You don't need a car in Colchester if you're even moderately active but it does help. Especially getting to the little villages outside. 

As for beer, trust me, after you've tasted some of the beers at the Vic, you'll never drink the other crap again. I am partial to Coors if it's warm though.

It's probably gone up now but after 9am (it might be 9.30) you can get cheap day returns and they're about that much. It's 55 minutes on the intercity fast train and about 1.15 on the slower ones. Either way, once you get to Liverpool street you can get anywhere. Always buy your tickets in advance though, they're bloody stupid money otherwise. A good website is the [trainline](http://www.thetrainline.com/). Book a few days in advance and it's even cheaper.

 Another option that I use a lot if I head into London is to get dropped off/drive to Redbridge, one of the furthest East underground stations. It has parking and is under an hour from Colchester. Not to mention the last train to head out that way is about 1am I think (again you should check that!)

Colchester is actually quite a cool place for all its faults. It's pretty safe and generally 'all right'. Enjoy your stay!

This has all sorts of flaws but the main ones are **1.** The high odds of executing/castrating an innocent **2.** The fact that ""object rape"" is a thing and fucking with someone's naughty bits won't stop it. and **3.** The various moral arguments regarding government authorised murder etc etc (see a thread regarding the death penalty for details)

If we were to ban parades can you imagine the shitstorm? Better to create an atmosphere of mutual respect (easier said than done).

Parades can come back whenever there is mutual respect. Mutual respect is easier brought around whenever we're not being triumphalist up in everyones faces. Shit storms are temporary, look at the flegger movement; dead on its feet already.

&gt; Opinions and words, whether offensive and damaging or not, should never be banned. This is a democracy and it should stay that way. No censorship.

This is a democracy, yes. You can still be arrested for offensive words and stuff on twitter/facebook though.

&gt; This has all sorts of flaws but the main ones are 1. The high odds of executing/castrating an innocent 2. The fact that ""object rape"" is a thing and fucking with someone's naughty bits won't stop it. and 3. The various moral arguments regarding government authorised murder etc etc (see a thread regarding the death penalty for details)

There would have to be very condemning evidence for either sentence. Death of course would only be used in extreme cases.

&gt; These are very politically driven points that seem more concerned with ideology than the benefit of our people and nation. I do however not wish to dwell on this because god forbid I start an Israel/Palestine argument thread (shudders).

true,uk_finance,null,null,"I have only focused on your initial questions. 

1. You need to differentiate real returns and nominal returns. Nominal return is the quoted rate on the account (in your example an OSA at 1%). Real return is the return left after inflation (in your example the nominal return 1% minus inflation at 2.5%, so a real return of -1.5%). So you are losing money on a real basis yes. The reason you would invest in an ISA is because it is a tax efficient way of saving. You need to compare gross rates (before tax) and net rates (after tax). You are looking at cash ISA rates. Normally interest is taxed at 20%, so a normal current account quoting 3% gross return is actually 2.4% net return whereas a cash ISA quoting 3% gross return is also 3% net return. So you keep more of the return. Although cash ISA rates are currently low they won't always be and there are very few alternatives available with higher rates. Also you lose your ISA allowance if it is unused by the end of the tax year so many people will save into cash ISAs now to make use of the allowance in the hope that rates will improve in the future and they will have more money saved up in their ISA.   
2. Vanguard Lifestrategy funds are widely mentioned because they are relatively cheap and yet diverse. By diverse I mean they are not linked to only one index, they are linked to a number of different worldwide indices. For example you quoted the HSBC FTSE 250 index fund - this is linked only to the FTSE 250, so any problems in the uk means your fund value is highly likely to fall. A vanguard Lifestrategy fund might have some money linked to the FTSE 250 but will also be linked to other indices, so your risk is a bit more spread. The reason for the performance is because you are looking back in hindsight. You can always look back and find a fund that has done better. You need to look into the future instead.   
3. Markets have overall rallied since the crash of 2008-09. Early 2013 saw a massive share market rally between January and April (roughly). Then there was quite a mixed period for the remainder of the year, overall generally up. The start of 2014 has again been mixed, and Russia-Ukraine unsettled the markets. So this last 12 months was not as good as previous years. There are many many reasons for this, and of course it heavily depends on which country you look at and which sectors within those countries. 

Edit 4. Accumulation (acc) units and income (inc) units are both the same, except inc normally pays out any dividends or interest. Some funds only have acc or inc units but most have both. You can often ask your fund provider to reinvest any income paid out of inc units if there is no acc unit available, which has the same effect as owning an acc unit. So yes, if you want capital growth, choose acc units wherever possible. Otherwise you will end up with dividend and interest income sitting in a bank account.

2. Sometimes. I went to museums occasionally, though I also went to them before I was homeschooled. I never really went anywhere as part of the curriculum. I feel like I missed out on a lot. School trips, etc.

3. Tough one to answer. I didn't get any qualifications. I would have had to be in school to do the exams. I couldn't face it though, even if just for one day. By the time I was 16, I was suffering with very bad social anxiety. That only developed when I was homeschooled. The thought of being in a room with a group of other 16 year olds (especially other boys), after being out of school and isolated for so long, was terrifying to me. It might sound like I'm exaggerating, but I'm really not.

4. I definitely wouldn't be homeschooled again. People's responses have just confirmed what I suspected. Secondary school is nowhere near as bad as my mum was making it out to be, even in state schools. I really feel like I should have went to school. My mum's mentality was basically, ""If I can't get you in a private school, you're getting homeschooled"". The state school I was supposed to go to had quite a poor reputation, and was ranked as one of the worst in the city at the time. I know of other people who went to that school who seem to be doing well, though.

I'm not surprised you haven't met anyone who was homeschooled. I haven't either. I've talked to a few people online who were, but they are all American. It just doesn't seem to be nearly as common or accepted in the UK. Based on my experience of it, I can understand why.

Unbelievably ignorant. They also want to get rid of the concept of nationality, and abolish land ownership. There are also a few policies that require other countries to change for them to even be applicable.

Their whole message, effectively a Socialist/Communist one, sounds great. Everyone working together, no competition, no wars, not needing to work all the time, no inequality.... but it completely ignores basic human nature. If people are given income for doing nothing, no-one will work. If big corporations and the extremely wealthy are taxed up to their eyeballs, they will simply emigrate and the UK will end up losing money. The idea that a military, and nuclear deterrents are unnecessary would be nice, but it is human nature to go to war and even though we are unthreatened now, things can change extremely quickly. Leaving 65 million people without a proper defense force is outrageously irresponsible.

I do however feel we need better boarder control - I'm for immigration and believe where ever you relocate you should respect those who already live and work there... This for me is the breakdown and why UKIP are doing so well. Mass immigration has destroyed the UK socially. I think it was Enoch Powell who gave the sentiment that society should feel that it is fighting the same war (Metaphorically speaking) and right now the UK, again I feel, is more divided than ever.

On the bright side - this is what a genuine democracy looks like!  It turns out that the major parties do not have a stranglehold after all on the system and that if enough people want a change then they can get it.

There is no mention of global warming or gay marriage. Although a few weeks ago there was an article stating the discriminating policies of UKIP. They wanted to revert the new laws on marriage and claim that global warming isn't caused by CO2 emissions.

 http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/01/ukips-inconvenient-truth-platform/ 


It outright states that a UKIP member said ""all teaching of global warming being caused in any way by carbon dioxide emissions must also be banned"". This is why we need to get UKIP voters informed of this ridiculous idealism. 95% of people who know what they're talking about believe that the majority of climate change is caused by humans. Yet no politician or journalist has challenged him on this backwards opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFpzaQPKC54

 As an aspiring scientist, Biochemistry, I am taught and shown experiments on how the infrared absorption and reflection by Greenhouse Gases are damaging are environment. I can't stand for the ignorance of the general public nor the idiocies of the other parties to take advantage of this and claim (according to wikipedia) 48% of the voters in one swoop (sort of, more remove the UKIP voters who are in the 48%).
The only arguments I come up against climate change from family members are ""Even scientists aren't sure"", yet 95% are sure.

I predict Conservatives to win next year not by a majority to partner up with UKIP, a referendum will happen and the UK will leave the EU. I'm not well read on the EU but I will believe that we will suffer consequences for it with imported goods costing more.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No worries! But just so you know, this is a benign skin condition. Prior to 1975 it wasn't listed as a STI because of the absence of serious side effects over the long-term. Chlamydia and syphilis are far more dangerous than HSV, and they can even be dealt with. They cause problems with fertility, childbirth, and have other secondary side effects.

Herpes has...an itch...a couple small blisters every year or two that clear up after 3-5 days...and a lot of stigma because pharmaceutical companies needed to sell pills in 1975 and so began a marketing campaign by Burroughs Wellcome to distinguish between ""cold sores"" and ""stigmatizing genital infections."" They began telling people that they had to be ashamed of the condition because it meant they were immoral, unclean, bad, and should be kept away from society. It worked. Overnight acyclovir was making hundreds of millions of dollars, and this signaled the birth of ""disease mongering.""

It's a travesty because the people who suffer from this condition would have a much better quality of life if pharmacos weren't so hellbent on making money and were more interested in improving quality of life.

Outside the U.S. and certain Western European countries, herpes isn't considered a serious condition despite some areas having considerably higher risk of HIV. For example, Brazil has I believe over 30% of the adult female population infected with HSV-2. In Sao Paulo a study was conducted that put the number at 41% of females of child-bearing age. Yet Brazilians are much freer with their sexuality and more liberated than the U.S. and so it isn't seen as a terrible thing.

I'm surprised that you can't conceive how people could be worried about immigration.  The working class are scared that immigrants are taking their jobs for less money, thus driving prices down.  Sure there are statistics showing that immigration may have a net benefit on the economy, but who's benefitting?  The poor and lower middle class who are competing for those jobs are probably the least likely to benefit.  Imagine how you'd feel if you saw that all the jobs in your profession were now going to Polish immigrants.  

And then there's the fears over British culture being eroded.  Some areas are seeing proportionately much higher numbers of immigrants, which has changed the local culture.  It's all very well saying that multiculturalism is great, but given the opportunity, most people who have the money prefer to live among people of a similar cultural background to their own and they don't want to send their children to a school where only 50% are native English speakers.

Also - Islam, which I think poses a particular problem.  Mostly secular societies like the UK are actually very good at supporting a wide variety of different cultures, but what exactly do you do when one of those cultures is in direct opposition to secularist values?   

Finally, there's the problem that immigration tends to erode trust in communities and governments.  I think there's some data which shows that people tend to be more willing to support left-wing big-state governments in homogenous cultures.  But increased immigration tends to adversely affect the sense of trust in society and people start getting nervous that they're being taken advantage of.  Think Daily Mail readers.

I'm not saying I personally agree with all these points, but I do think that they need to be openly discussed.  Both Labour and the Conservatives have failed to answer these concerns.  The attitude seems to be 'we know best' and the left in particular has shown intolerance to those who question the principles of multiculturalism.  For examples - look no further than this subreddit and think of how we treat those who don't agree with ideological leftist point of view on the issue du jour.

That might sound reasonable. However this data will never be deleted.

Worse they could introduce new laws that make something you  have done in the past illegal, which at any point could be used to arrest or manipulate you.

The same is true for votes. Its another data point.

Thats why just because your political believes may not be used against you now doesnt mean they wont be in the future.

Anything?

**Transport:**

Emphasis on a nationwide cycle network with well enforced cycle/bus lanes. Where private parking enforcement is used, if lanes are blocked for any length of time, and no ticket is issued, they should face a fine themselves. Up the fines for parking violations.

It should be possible to have a separated cycle route that covers most of Northern Ireland. See here: http://nigreenways.wordpress.com/ 

Something like that would tie in nicely to a tourist strategy.

Inner city routes should have actual cyclists consulting on them. Because the ones that currently exist clearly have not been thought through.

Speed limits reduced to 20mph in dense housing areas. Speed limits upped by 10Mph on dual carriageways and motorways where safe. (better yet, dynamic speed limit signs that change based on weather conditions).

Public transport franchise opened to bids from other transport providers. If e.g. first direct could run our network for less money than translink, let them. Bring in stiff fines/penalties if the transport provider does not meet service targets.

Extension of rail service to International Airport. Also a feasibility study to see if reopening the line westward is viable.

More park and rides with a 'boris bike' scheme operating at park and rides and in city centre. City centre pedestrianised as much as possible.

**Parades:**

All parades and their organisers to be registered, along with constituent organisations (lodges/bands). All parades must sign up to a code of conduct. All organisations marching must have an up to date register of members to be produced on demand by law enforcement/courts.

Parades have de facto access to main thoroughfares. Blocking or disrupting a lawful parade to be made an offence. Prior to parade commencement, organisers will be told of any contentious areas by the registration body. Music must be scaled back and number of supporters limited through these areas.

Any violation of the code of conduct gets the offending band and it's members banned from parading for a period of time. Repeated offenses results in permanent ban, and possible prosecution for the individuals directly involved in an incident.

Parades may not contain tributes to paramilitary organisations or anyone involved in them, or anyone convicted of murder/terrorism.

Registration body cannot ban parades - only the PSNI can do so when public disorder is highly likely. 

**Economy**

We need more powers over taxation here, not just corporation tax.

Corporation tax needs dropped as far as possible to attract investment. 

Otherwise, I'd largely agree with http://allianceparty.org/page/economy


**Education**

Integrated education needs to be favoured, but parents should also have the choice of Private and church run schools. 

If not an integrated school with cross community attendance, all schools must include a minimum level of 'cross community' activity. Be it joint field trips, joint drama classes, joint debate sessions with other schools.

Again, I'm largely with alliance on this one: http://allianceparty.org/page/education-and-skills

**Health**

I think for this one we need something of a radical approach.

I would first mandate that all employers over a certian size *must* enroll their workforce in a private healthcare plan. Employees must be given a leaflet explaining how this scheme works and how to avail of it. (I suspect there are many in NI and the UK who are taking up NHS beds not realising they could be in a private hospital via their works healthcare plan).

If the healthcare plan has an excess, this will be covered by the employer.

With better taxation powers we'd be able to make most of the extra costs to employers tax deductable. We'd save by freeing up NHS beds and consultant fees.

Should outpatent services be backlogged, the NHS should be able to refer patients to private clinics.

For certian services, specialist clinics should be allowed to bid for the right to handle particular services. If, for example, the Marie Stopes clinic can handle reproductive issues on behalf of the NHS for a comparable price, then they should be allowed to. 

**Broadband**

I think the FTTC rollout is going well, something like 90%. Haven't looked into it for a while. We should be pushing for 100% rollout of this and 21CN, upping the minimum service guarantee from 2Mb to 10Mb, setting up schemes to make sure business parks in towns especially outside of Belfast all have a chance of getting Fibre to the Premises.

Most people don't really care about the EU and local elections (34% voter turnout), General Elections have usually seen at least 50% turnout, often closer to 60%. UKIP have been pushing their ""People's Army"" shtick and trying to make themselves look like the victims of a media witch hunt, so their supporters are very likely to go out and vote for them, whereas your casual lifelong Labour, Conservative or Liberal Democrat didn't vote in this election but will next year. I think UKIP will gain the same amount of votes next year, however the percentage of votes that will be will be much lower if you ask me.

Although, it's possible that UKIP voters will feel the need to tactically vote for the Tories next year, I know I'll be an example of that, I voted Green in both local and European elections on Thursday but will vote Labour next year.

UKIP have ""won"" the European elections, but they EU elections have a different system (a fairer system if you ask me, but not the one we use for everything else). Our general election uses the same system as our local elections. If you look at the results, UKIP came in 4th in our local elections, considerably behind the Lib Dems and miles behind Labour and Conservative, they also didn't win control of a single council, meaning they didn't win a majority in any area, therefore, it's going to be difficult for them to win a large amount of MP seats, even UKIP themselves have said they're only going to target a few.

**TL;DR: Outside of the EU elections, UKIP are the 4th party, behind the Lib Dems, their supporters are too spread out for them to win many MP seats under our current FPTP voting system, they'll be lucky to win more than 5 seats next year**

Immigrants don't steal jobs, they create them. Increasing population does not increase unemployment - if it did, unemployment would increase linearly with population. Which it doesn't obviously. Larger countries do not have higher unemployment than small ones.

Increasing the size of the population increases aggregate demand for goods and services, growing the economy.

Only 6.8% of Britain is urban (i.e. built on). In addition to not impacting jobs, we're also still got plenty of space for population to grow, increasing the absolute size of our economy. Thanks to immigration we're due to overtake Germany, which has low or negative population growth, as the largest economy in Europe.

UKIP people also complain about crime. This is where the racism accusations come in, because UK crime is actually at its lowest for decades. So why do people perceive that crime has increased? Why do people feel unsafe? Could it be that having lots of non-white people around them makes them nervous?

'Harmful' is defined in this context as 'having the potential to cause pain, suffering, distress, lasting harm or death in animals, except where it is designed to benefit the individual animals concerned

That's worrying. It would devastate UK bioscience, which currently punches WAY above its weight internationally and also has some of the strictest animal welfare laws for science in the world. Absolutely shitloads of compounds are animal derived and involve some sort of suffering/distress - such as cells, enzymes, antibodies, serum etc. And animal studies are the best way of studying cancer, an area where the UK currently excels.

From the same policy page (http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ar.html) they would ban all genetic modification of animals and plants, ban all xenotransplantation studies and basically fuck up all UK science.

All that will happen is further brain drain of UK talent for foreign universities. And do the Greens think Asia care anywhere near as much about animal welfare as we do? They don't.

I can't find any other surveys that address that specific question one way or another. But I can find quotes from senior members of the Muslim Council of Great Britain stating that it is ""absolutely disgraceful behaviour… In Britain, no Muslim has the right to harm one hair of someone who decides to leave Islam."" (Ibrahim Mogra) and ""behaviour in Britain is awful and quite wrong. The police should crack down on it. "" (Inayat Bunglawala). Again, I'm not going to claim that intimidation of people wanting to leave Islam doesn't happen - it clearly does. But from a single very small survey, 308 people saying that it should be punished by death is far from proof that this the prevailing attitude of British Muslims.

If you want to see other examples of Muslim attitudes in the UK, how about [Luton's Muslims march for peace](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/26/religion.world] - the 500 there is already larger than the 308 in that survey, or [Muslim peace conference condemns terrorism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15044797) - 12,000 attending an anti-terrorism peace conference, or [One million Muslims will wear Remembrance poppies despite extremists' opposition, say researchers](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/one-million-muslims-will-wear-remembrance-poppies-despite-extremists-opposition-say-researchers-8924933.html) etc. Do the actions of these people come across as radicals looking to destroy Britain's way of life?

&gt;Ah yes, attack the source.

Rather than taking all surveys at face value without bothering to check whether they have an agenda they are trying to push?

&gt;Did you ever take statistics? 308 people is a decent sample size to do a population estimate.

I have quite a lot of involvement in surveys etc, and I know that if you want to push a particular message then it's really not that difficult to select targets and structure questions in such a way that you could get 300 people out of a pool of around two and a half million people to agree with a specific thing.

&gt; Something that around half all of Muslims support, 

Something that at least 308 people in the UK support.

&gt;Please hang around in /r/exmuslim for a few days to understand why I dislike Islam

OK. Let's take the Telegraph story (""I renounced Islam, so my family think I should die"") - yes, it's shocking and it shouldn't happen. But if a Muslim decides to stop being a Muslim and doesn't get threatened by their family (I personally know at least 2 who have done just that), do you think the story ""I renounced Islam and nothing happened"" would ever make it to the papers?

And even in that story, the victim says 

""She is adamant that it is not a problem with Islam, but rather one of intolerant societies.
“If you look at the Old Testament, there are some shocking things there,” she said. “But Jewish society realises that it’s no longer acceptable to stone someone to death, or to cut out their eyes, or enslave them. *And the vast majority of Muslims realise that too*.""

&gt;But Islam is objectively a much worse religion because of how it was formed.

Care to explain?

and

&gt;http://www.scimagojr.com/countrysearch.php?country=GB&amp;area=0

You'll see that the UK is 2nd in the world for the importance of our scientific publications. For the size of our population, we are the highest outputting country in the world. If you go to explore further, you'll see the UK is highly influential in bioscience (and confirms that Japanese freaking love their robots...)

I don't know figures for economic contribution (which I didn't mention in the post you replied to), but the UK consistently publishes high quality, influential and well respected scientific research. For the size of our population and number of institutions, we do very, very well - second to the US who are an absolute powerhouse. Science in the UK does attract a lot of funding and investment, plus many talented people come from around the world to study and research at UK institutions. Also consider that many of the publishing companies are British, some of the best medical journals (Nature, Lancet etc) are British, big pharma companies are British etc etc. There are also tons of small companies, university spinouts, patent applications coming from UK bioscience. Bioscience also seems fairly recession-proof (just look at Cambridge!)

I would say however that the benefits go well beyond purely economic. As well as being fascinating, the research translates into better medicines, vaccines, computing and all sorts of other ways of making our lives better.

As for animals, animal testing or animal-derived products are still pretty important. There are some alternatives, but only in limited fields. For anything complex like cancer, animal research is essential. We still don't have good methods for predicting drug toxicities either - and animals aren't perfect but they're the best we have right now. Animal derived products are widespread through all of bioscience research. Cells are grown in culture media with serum (the liquid part of blood) from cow foetuses. This is a very very basic part of pretty much any research. Alternatives to the serum exist, at 10x the cost and less effectiveness. Antibodies, another basic component of research, are made by injecting proteins into rabbits or mice, making an immune reaction and drawing their blood. (Oh, and the best antibody company in the world is British too!) 

Having worked first hand in the area, working with animals in the UK is not easy. You have to show preliminary data, justify why you need to use animals, say exactly what you are going to do, justify that there are no reasonable alternatives, show that you are using the minimum number required for statistical significance etc etc. I've also worked abroad where they have no such checks and you just do whatever you want. We already have extensive checks and laws in place to minimise use of animals, minimise suffering and there is plenty of research going into alternatives. They just aren't there right now.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There's the denial of French airspace for the American retaliation strike against Libya in 1986.

The US wanted unconditional access to our airspace without giving any reason or justification or even sharing informations. Opening one's airspace to a country so it can attack another country is an agressive act, you cannot ask an ally to do that without giving them any clue on what you are going to do with that. France would have opened its airspace to the US if the US had agreed to at least explain what they were going to do with that. 

&gt;And then there was the fun with de Gaulle in the 60's and France's abrupt withdrawal from NATO.

It was a difference on the way NATO was managed (basically the French thought it was too one-sided), the French-US alliance has never been put into question and there were still protocols concerning France joining the US in the event of a US-USSR war. 

As a result of that France created its very own nuclear arsenal, which meant that the US had more nuclear weapons on its side for no additional cost which in the end was indirectly good for NATO.

&gt;The Americans should probably be a little sore about France trying to hold on to Vietnam and the huge mess that resulted

France was basically fighting a proxy war with China. They never stood a chance, this conflict never was of any concern to the US, they chose to go in Vietnam only because they did not want communism to spread in the region. France being the colonial power was practical because it kept communism out but you could not expect them to keep Vietnam with this kind of odds against them.

&gt;the fallout from Suez in 1956, though the UK played a part in that one too.

Guilty as charged. UK and France had economic interests and decided to launch in this endeavour to try and keep them alive against the US.

&gt;France was somewhat friendly to the Confederates during the 1860's unpleasantness

Partly true, Napoleon III saw in that conflict the People's right to self determination but France remained strictly neutral despite secretly having a preferrence for the South mainly due to commercial reasons.

&gt;And then there's 1798 (XYZ Affair, never forget!)

A consequence of the US betraying France by allying with the Brits (at the time the worst enemies of France) some thirty years after France helped the US kick the Brits out. It would be as if 20 years after D-Day the French said ""Fuck the US I am with USSR now"", it is pretty safe to say the US would not have been really happy.

Clearly - shockingly - the majority don't feel this way. Either it's not working or it's not important enough to think you have a stake in. 

If this were anything else - from getting kids to do some chore in a classroom to getting adults to take part in some voluntary activity at work - such a low response would imply that nobody thinks it's worth it. 

Why should politics be any different? 

Why should we spend time voting for people we don't think are suitable to do the job? There's no 'none of the above' option no the form. Spoiling your ballot vs. not showing up to vote is a technicality - with a turnout of 35% the writing is on the wall, whether you think someone is an arse or not. 

We're taught all through life that it's a privilege and a fought-for right to have the vote. Some aren't so lucky - but that doesn't make us privileged, it makes us at the level everyone ought to be at. Getting a populace to buy into the established system is a stroke of genius - half of them never think that there could be any other way. 

Shaming them for not voting is just another part of that - perhaps it's time to consider that the system as it is *is not engaging people at all*. We're not arses for not voting - that's your buying into the system. We're not obliged, we can say something else is needed instead.

UKIP is eating into traditional labour heartland, and labour can no longer self assure itself that UKIP will take votes mainly from the tories but that they also are starting to eat away working class labour support, especially in the midlands and the north west.

Note that most of this is just due to low turnout and labour defintely will win that region come the GE.

Of Mice and Men actually makes a point of exampling how oppressive, close minded and unfair prejudices are, and how it can ruin someone's life. Shame the message didn't come through to you from the one book you enjoyed throughout school.

Of course the question is what do you replace it with. There literally is no other question here?!

This is an extract from the article linked and a quote from The Department of Education:  
""It does ensure pupils will learn about a wide range of literature, including at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel *written anywhere* and post-1914 fiction or drama written in the British Isles.""

They are not being wholly inclusive to, quote you, ""19th century and earlier only, restrictions on nationality of authors etc"". They are including later works and works from other countries, keeping it somewhat balanced, relevant to Britian's literary history and engaging to pupils through its diversity.

Let's run an example. 20% taxpayer saving £200/month for 40 years at 6% real growth and 4% withdrawal. That's 381k in an ISA, with a net income of £15240 a year. With tax relief they'd be getting £250/month for a total pot of £476k, gross withdrawal of £18680 and a net income of £16944.

It leaves one of the 4 I named to be benched and be an impact sub, or just allow them to rest between games. Also, we have Fabio Borini on the bench who is more than capable of giving us a good run in the cups, without having to use Suarez against the lower league teams.

This gives us 4 top quality forwards with a decent back up. If one of the wingers gets injured, Suarez is capable of covering that position while Sturridge stays up top.

We reject perceptions that deliberately conceal the responsibilities of the policies applied and the interests that benefited from these. It is not the ‘genetic makeup’ of the Greek people that is responsible for the fact that we do not have a decent taxation system or an effective social state. Specific policies and interests are responsible for that. It is precisely those policies which must be overturned.

ii. The crisis in Greece does not constitute a ‘national peculiarity’, but is part of a broader European crisis, with both endogenous and external causes. It is only within a framework of a common European solution that the particular and existing problems of Greece can be dealt with.

iii. Fiscal consolidation and sustainable public debt cannot be achieved in an environment of austerity. It is only under conditions of economic recovery that the necessary reforms can be attempted and sustainable solutions found.

iv. Development presupposes environmental reform, developmental redistribution, and the fighting-off of poverty, unemployment and social inequalities as components of its content.

v. The ‘structural adjustments’ of neoliberal persuasion do not solve social problems, they simply redistribute assets and rights to the detriment of the weak. Exit from the crisis requires overthrows, a new type of structural changes, radical reforms and restructuring of the state, the economy and the political system, such that will tackle the roots of the problems, reduce inequalities and release idle resources within society, opening new paths and prospects.

* Lambert signing makes me [so](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5WmwBKGZfgA/UxoHgIfe0jI/AAAAAAAAAxc/_MSVnDQA7HM/s1600/rocky-training-o.gif) [happy](http://imgur.com/XSxKgQM) on so many levels!  

* I [accidentally](http://imgur.com/zmMLNko) clicked on an 'it's happening' GIF about the Moreno, Lovren and Can signings so I can exclusively tell you [they ain't happening](http://imgur.com/eAaLPBj)!

* [Moreno signing this week!](http://imgur.com/c2R9nAY) [Says the Spanish media.](http://imgur.com/GR9TMM1)

* [Crunch time](http://imgur.com/LSOOKeQ) on the Lallana signing.  I can't decide if this ultimatum puts us in a [strong](http://imgur.com/LoDoFbY) or a [weak](http://giphy.com/gifs/jnAyiKE3uaNgI) position.

* **Elsewhere in sport**- 

Sport| Participants| Time(GMT) |Occasion |
-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
Rugby Union| Saracens vs Northampton Saints| 15:00 | AVIVA Premiership Final
Boxing | Carl Froch vs George Groves | ~ 22:00 | Highly anticipated matchup for IBF and WBA titles

*GIFS return to normal tomorrow.  Next themed day will be 12th June for the World Cup and US Open.

*[Bonus Lambert](http://www.toutlemondesenfoot.fr/wp-content/uploads/Steven-Gerrard-Rickie-Lambert.jpg) (&amp; Stevie).


------------

**30th May**

* €25m for Sanchez?  [I like it!](http://gfycat.com/PinkCraftyEuropeanpolecat)

* It's fine that they want a little more money for Moreno but [don't speak ill of our little Suso](http://gfycat.com/HardHeftyGlassfrog)!

* We're signing Lambert?  OK, [now you've got my attention](http://gfycat.com/PepperySimplisticFlatfish).  What an [unexpected](http://gfycat.com/PolishedSereneCattle) signing!

------------

**29th May**

* So [I don't know who](http://forgifs.com/gallery/d/213118-1/Confused-cats-vs-humidifier.gif) this Fran Villalba character is but I [don't particularly care](http://gfycat.com/SardonicSentimentalBigmouthbass) about Valencia's indignation either!

*  I'd be a little [disappointed](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4quwkYADy1rn95k2o1_500.gif) to see Suso leave us but Moreno would vastly improve the team.  Simply put, we need a solid left back, and Moreno could be our man for [years to come](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~yunfu2/M-Face_files/image008.gif).

* If we lose out on Emre Can due to his own [greed](http://gfycat.com/DesertedUnderstatedKawala) then I won't be too upset.  If a fee's agreed though, I do have [faith](http://gfycat.com/YoungInnocentBats) that they'll get the deal done.  We have a lot more than money to offer as a club.

-------------------------------

**28th May**

* Seems like a lot of press has been saying that the Emre Can deal is imminent recently.  It's actually rather nice to get a bit of a [reality check](http://gfycat.com/UnfortunateTornHeron) from more reliable sources before we get too carried away.

* Yesterday I was seeing reports that Munich wouldn't sell, but if Shaqiri's willing to force a move then they'll just have to [deal with it](http://gfycat.com/HandsomeWeakFritillarybutterfly).  He would [fit in](http://gfycat.com/UnselfishGrimEuropeanpolecat) rather nicely at Anfield!

* We bought Assaidi for £2.4m.  £7m would be a good bit of [business](http://i.imgur.com/XACFK.jpg) in my opinion.  There's no denying he's [improved](http://gfycat.com/BackFatherlyAustrianpinscher) with regular starts in the last year with Stoke.

--------------------------

**27th May**

* Lallana looks a good buy, [but not at £30m!](http://gfycat.com/GiftedAnotherDungenesscrab) It's a sound tactic if they're trying to price us out of moves for Lovren and Clyne too.

* [I'd love to help Derby out with Wisdom, especially after that nasty playoff final defeat, but I feel like we might be able to find a use for him this season.](http://i.imgur.com/agtHYZQ.jpg)

* Would Vorm be willing to play second fiddle to Mignolet?  I know he had an [average season](http://gfycat.com/DifficultDigitalGoosefish) this year but he's still a fantastic keeper.

----------------------------

**26th May**

* If we believe all of the rumours then Brendan Rodgers is going to be [a busy man this summer](http://gfycat.com/PinkSharpHyracotherium)!

* [Rodgers signs new contract](http://gfycat.com/ScornfulPhysicalBellsnake)!
* Nice one Dnipro!  [*Now* you're ready for him to leave!](http://f3.thejournal.ie/media/2014/01/1173.gif)

* Balotelli's done fairly well at AC Milan but I just can't shake the feeling that he [wouldn't play well with Suarez](http://gfycat.com/IllfatedUnequaledAmurratsnake).

* [Really liking](https://31.media.tumblr.com/8ade129ecd3cc2998f39df15190b4bac/tumblr_n4yoxn48IO1rtpfpio1_400.gif) the news about Emre Can.  Looks to be a really [flexible](http://i.imgur.com/GiL70Nl.jpg) player that could plug a number of gaps for us (a 3rd gif would have been NSFW).

Do people even bother to read about their policies, the nature and quality of their candidates or the history of the party.

Personally I blame the shocking lack of representation from to other parties throughout the whole process along side the astounding ignorance of the general population. If something isnt done soon the threat of having UKIP in charge of the country is very real.

If people simply took 5 minutes to do even the most basic re-search sure they could see how truly awfull and utterly stupid UKIP really are. 

For example they 

* Oppose Gay marriage as its ""undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves whom they will and will not marry""

* Dont believe in climate change wanting to ""Ban schools from showing Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth."" and stop investing in green projects all together. 

* Want more Nukes in our military further extending a pointless arms race that will only be used once everyone is already dead.

* Want to end the ""active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism."" How anyone can fail to see the blatant racism in this is beyond me.

* **End the human rights act**. How can anyone read that line and still vote. You are voting to strip away your rights as a human being and to strip away the rights of other human beings just like you. 

I have never considered leaving this country before but i cannot see myself living under a UKIP government.

It was normal beforehand to refer to the country as England, but with the Irish leaving post-WWI and the worry that Scotland might do the same, Churchill (who had been an MP for Dundee in Scotland, and was the first MP to ever talk of home rule for Scotland in Westminster), decided to grow the idea of ""Britishness"" as a rallying point for all the nations in the UK. 

There's some academic material on it [here](http://www.nutshell-videos.ed.ac.uk/wendy-ugolini-identities-in-wwii/) and elsewhere if you have a google. It certainly worked, and even still today many people like to reference WWII when talking of being proud to be British. It's also used a *lot* by British Nationalists, such as the BNP.

That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;

Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;

If it takes me twenty years to pay it off, I pay back about £100k altogether (I guessed at both of those numbers; on my phone). So rich people who go and work in the city end up paying much less than nurses and social care workers, because they earn more money and pay their loan off quicker. Although their is some attempt at progressivity in the system, it doesn't seem to counteract that effect anything like as much as supporters of a graduate tax would hope.

A graduate tax, by contrast, is a pure 'progressive' tax. Anyone who gets a degree pays 3% of their annual income for twenty years to cover. The cost. This - in my opinion - is much better; bankers finance nurses to get their degree. The downside is that bankers also finance Micky Mouse degrees too, so there are a couple of improvements that could be made to this simple system which I won't go into here.

I'm not preaching, it's just my opinion, I'm not sure how I'd have a debate otherwise. No actually it doesn't mean that. The entire student body has been very united around this issue: the current students who marched so well in opposition to the increase of fees were never going to be affected by it. So no, actually I'm older. 

Again I'm not preaching. Also I, and many others, would thoroughly disagree with the idea that you must experience something before you can criticise it. In that case I have no idea how we'd ever have opposition to the death penalty. It's not disgraceful, I'm trying to start debate, I'll apologise if I've offended anyone but I'm passionate, just like every non joke political party. 

I'm not. I don't like what they say but I'll defend to the death their right to say it. And no their views aren't less than mine, I just disagree with them. There's a difference. No, I actually hate those words being bandied about when not necessary. But if they have a racist or intolerant opinion then I'm going to point out that it's racist and intolerant.

'Attitude is terrible'. Really? It was my attitude that got the conversation going, and with everyone else I've had a really nice debate. I think this overall post is enough to prove that point wrong. I actually agree with the next point, I've mentioned it in discussions with friends.

More importantly, the left and tories can't blame the BBC for printing their Farage bashing for months before they realised spouting anti UKIP sentiment still entailed everyone talking about UKIP, constantly. 

You can't try and make people see how racist the party is without covering the party, but the attempt to paint them as racist by the mainstream didn't scare the voters into more normal voting patterns. It was a gamble and it didn't pay off. You can't blame the beeb for the rubbish UKIP centric campaigns of the other parties, the feeding of gaffs to other papers or the rabid fury of the left towards UKIP. 

The BBC analysis of the Labour vote last night is in line with statistical trends. It is an anomaly that a party in opposition to an unpopular government would only beat the government by a couple of points in a national election. We have to conclude it isn't looking as good for an opposition expecting to win as it should at this point. The difference seems to be the coalition.  

My thoughts are that the tories have successfully scapegoated the Lib Dems for the discontent with the cost of living, enough to divert the pro EU, pro referendum vote to themselves as a party capable of renegotiation, while simultaneously taking all credit for the economy.

If your the extreme left then you end up using right wing methods of social control to enforce *your* ideology. I remember learning when i was about 14 that the political spectrum should not be viewed as a line but as a horseshoe where the extreme left and right meet or at least get closer together. It's not until I was about 18 and had studied more history that it really became apparent. Control of one expect of society is difficult to achieve without control of other aspects so enforcing any any extreme ideology requires draconian social and political control to stop dissent. But it also requires control of the economy, of people's wages and of people's ability to incorporate because money = power and if people that disagree with your ideology get money then they will threaten your ideology.

No. Not because of the tuition thing. They should never have promised such largesse to the affluent middle classes and those who feel passionately that they shouldn't pay an additional higher tax when they enter higher paid graduate employment can piss off. All evidence suggests that public money is best spent earlier for better social mobility.

The real issue is this they were given a once in a lifetime opportunity to demand and get PR and finally give democracy back to the electorate this is the only issue that matters right now. There is not a rizal papers difference between labour, tory and lib dem right now. This is due to the mathematical logic of a FPTP system which is equivalent to a guess the weight competition, where the weight is the political position that will get you past the finishing line. Therefore inevitably all parties are fighting over a tiny contrived center ground, with almost all difference based on soundbite posturing. 

For me what Nick Clegg did going for something other than PR was to deliberately blow up the Liberal democratic party therefore the party that was wiped out was an imitation of the Lib Dems in the same way as New Labour is an imitation of Labour. 

Unitil The Libs get a genuinely liberal leader then liberals should not vote for them, same goes for labour.

For me I am delighted that UKIP did so well as its the best chance we have for another hung parliament and another chance for a smaller party to demand PR.

I was just making a kitchen sink list, of every possible American-French conflict I could think of, because I thought it was somewhat funny and in the spirit of this sub to pretend certain ferocious nationalistic rivalries still exist when plainly they don't. And the meta-joke is: Americans have short memories and a terrible knowledge of history, and they generally don't hold grudges for very long. Almost everything on the list is not something the average American thinks about or even knows about.

You have to admit, blaming Vietnam on the French is pretty funny since that's obviously 100% the fault of the Americans for getting involved as deeply as they were. De Gaulle and NATO is also funny to me, mainly because I can imagine him giving LBJ a serious case of heartburn and inducing a long string of obscenities in a deep Texan drawl.

Was really stretching to mention France and the Confederates since it was actually the ruling class in the UK which gave the Southerners any sort of hope from possible foreign allies and Napoleon III was somewhat cool towards them. So thought it would be funny to blame the French and, by implication, absolve the British.

Suez was a fair cop, but it pales considerably compared to the Iraq War, the CIA-engineered coup in Iran, and the heavy American support to various entities in the region which do not have the best interests of their own people at heart. Therefore, I think you'd have to admit bringing up Suez was also hilarious when considering the wider context of the US's missteps.

I brought up the April 1986 raid because, even though it was a minor incident, it was very similar to the arguments of 2003. The French refusal led to some very ugly stuff on American television and unpleasant rhetoric from conservative politicians. And then it was completely forgotten.

--------------------

***Is this always the case?*** Of course not; any information you get from any source shy of the official LFC website has a chance of being wrong, and even reputable sources such as the BBC report deals that have not occurred. Just use common sense, we aren't in the running for Messi's signature any time soon. 

***What if a transfer is being reported by more than one untrustworthy source? Is it more likely?*** No, not at all. Untrustworthy sources tend to quote each other for their ""breaking transfer news"" articles, so even if both Bleacher Report *and* HITC are reporting it, it's more than likely false if it sounds too good to be true. 

***What is the criteria that you base the ""trustworthy"" sources on?*** Mostly reliability, but also much more well-known brands. The BBC does not need to ""click-bait"" with ludicrous speculation like Goal.com does because they're an established company and don't rely solely on the income generated from each page view. Plus, because they're established, they have more to lose from constantly reporting fake stories. Also, as a general rule-of-thumb, any source that states ""[source name here] understands..."" is generally not worth your time -- it means that the editors can simply blame miscommunication or misrepresentation if the deal they're reporting turns out to be nonsense.

***Are all untrustworthy sources wrong all of the time?*** Of course not, they very occasionally do report something that isn't a complete fabrication and has some truth in it. However, usually when an unreliable source such as Goal.com reports a deal, reliable sources such as Sky Sports have already reported it, so checking reliable sources is the best way to find out the latest concrete news fast. However, just because a gossip newspaper may get it right 1 time out of 1000, that doesn't mean they're reliable, it's simply down the probability of them getting it right *at some point*. 

***I think you've missed out some sources. Can you add them?*** Yes, of course. This list is in no way the acme of transfer source lists, so if there's someone you trust or don't trust, please drop me a PM and I'll include it...unless it's your mate Gary from down the pub, because he likely won't be included on the list at all, regardless of whether he predicted we'd put £35m down on Carroll six months before or not.

***So...are you telling me there's no chance we'll sign Messi?*** I didn't think so but then I saw that both Goal.com and Bleacher Report were reporting it, so there might be some truth in it after all.../s

No invocation of violence even if you want to read into it that 'not comfortable' means 'threatened with violence'. There's no problem with using your own free speech and ability to protest to oppose the BNP - yes when UAF gets violent they do themselves a disservice but yelling at someone that they're a Nazi, while vulgar, is not illegal unless it counts as harassment or an threat of imminent violence especially when this man is a politician. People so often say the best way to tackle fascism is to expose it to free debate or, as the Americans would say, to 'the marketplace of ideas'. But the only reason such ideology would crumble if exposed is because ordinary reasonable people would reject and oppose it given all the facts. I don't deny that opposing fascism with violence is self-defeating but to limit people's right to oppose an ideology when they want to is to basically make free speech useless as a defence against extreme views.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I'm not sure that's fair. I think all the parties have a fairly clear view on the EU, it's just UKIP have the easiest point to argue in some respects.

UKIP simply want to leave the EU. They can bring up hard facts of '£55m a day', or appeal to gut feeling of 'too many foreigners'. Because they're arguing against something, they don't have to lay out in detail *how* they are going to guarantee the same level of trade and jobs, so they've got an easier job than the other three parties arguing *for* something.

The Tories, off the top of my head, want renegotiation, probably removing all the social benefits of the EU, like freedom of movement, or at least making it more difficult for people in mainland Europe to live and work in the UK. If they fail at that reform, they want to leave the EU as well. If they want to bring up the benefits of the EU, it is more difficult to get a hard figure on the trade benefits or jobs from the EU, and it's more difficult to argue against this gut feeling xenophobia, especially when another politician is actively stoking that.

The Lib Dems and Labour also support our membership of Europe, but with less reform than the Tories. I think Clegg made the Lib Dem view fairly clear on that debate. 

It's easier to fit 'Farage: We want out of the EU' onto a headline than 'Cameron: We want reform by renegotiating the Treaty of Lisbon' into a headline and have people understand it, which is one major reason why I think people understand UKIPs view more.

That's an interesting point. Farage mentioned twice last night about left wing anti-EU parties getting power in Europe, I'd assume to try and shake the image that UKIP are a right wing party. Now, that's a bit of a lie, or misleading at least. Left wing anti-EU parties and right wing anti-EU parties dislike the EU for completely separate reasons. 

The left wing parties like the social aspects of the EU, and aren't adverse to institutions similar to the EU, but dislike the financial aspects, and that the EU is a big trading block that can force member states to sell off public assets to solve debts. They want those debts completely wiped, and the EU to look out for the people more than the business interests.

Right wing parties, on the other hand, dislike the social aspects of the EU. They don't like have freedom of movement, or having to cooperate with foreigners, which is why they want to leave the EU. They don't care about the money involved, which is why people like Cameron want to renegotiate to introduce border controls. 

It's misleading to assume left wing and right wing anti-EU parties are fighting for the same thing, as they are coming from completely different angles, and a left wing UKIP would be saying completely different things to the current right wing one.",0,1401106860,null,0,false,0,chrdvmr,t3_26h55p,t1_chrdvmr,t1_chrbi3l,null,1433959332,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

A party with actual balls would have mauled David Cameron apart like a pack of lions mauling apart a teenager accidentally falling into their enclosure. Where was Ed Miliband when David Cameron tried to implement on-by-default filters on the web for example? He showed zero opposition to that policy whereas if he was more vocal about it, it would never have been considered let alone implemented.

Liberal Democrats? I voted Clegg in 2010 and had I realized that would be a vote for David Cameron, I would have voted for Gordon Brown instead. The guy is a backstabbing prick who speaks of broken promises then breaks his own promises and never apologizes for it until about 3 years later. This is why the European result feels glorious to me because I can watch the party suffer as they lose all but one of their MEPs.

Conservatives? Should I really have to answer that question? I graduated with a History degree last year. I'm still unemployed on JSA. I apply to several jobs a week, mostly minimum wage inbound call centre, secretary and admin assistant roles which I almost never get a reply for. I've been in despair for almost a year because I feel like I've failed as a human being. If there's anybody who feels disenfranchised in this country, it's me. Can you think of anything more depressing than spending an entire year of your fucking mortal existence trying to find work in a screwed economy where being a chugger is genuinely your brightest prospect?

Some of David Cameron's policies have been hostile to say the least towards young people. Doing nothing about zero-hour contracts, trebling tuition fees, denying students the chance to get funding for a second degree which was available as an option just three years ago and making long-term jobseekers work to keep their JSA as if they're somehow scrounging in a system that already does nothing to find them work, pushes them into roles they'd never touch otherwise and sanctions them for the most trivial shortcoming.

&gt;

&gt;__Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma__ (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpeðɾo roˈðɾiɣeð leˈðezma]; born 28 July 1987), commonly known as __Pedro__ or __Pedrito__, is a Spanish professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays for [FC Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona) in [La Liga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga) and the [Spanish national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team), as a [forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)) or [winger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder#Winger).

&gt;He usually plays the ball with his left foot but is actually right-footed. He can play on either side of the pitch as winger or second striker; he is good at finding the right position and has excellent technique.

&gt;During the [2009–10 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_La_Liga) at his main club, [FC Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona), he became the first player in history to score in six different official club competitions in one season (a feat later matched by teammate [Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi)).

Outside of school, I was subjected to a beating from four or five lads who were coked up and looking to hit someone, egged on by a crowd of 50 or so. Horrible experience, but not one I could blame on the school. It's just what the rough kids did back then. Honestly, probably because they were coked up, they weren't particularly good at it. Got slugged in the jaw, didn't feel it. One tried to shoulder throw me, but I just stood there while he grabbed me and fumbled me into his shoulder...I refused to throw a punch and they eventually got bored and let me out of the crowd. Looking back, it made me scared of large crowds of blokes, but it also gave me confidence that nonviolent reaction to violence actually could work.

Got into a couple of in-school scuffles, but rather than result in anything negative, it made me dislike and work on my own violent tendencies.

All in all, I won't say that getting into fights is character building, although it was in my case, but it's not something to be so scared of that you wrap your kids in cotton wool. There's a line in the movie Dazed and Confused, about most fights only lasting about 30 seconds before someone breaks it up. That's pretty accurate in my experience.

I knew the names of all 94 guys in my year, and a good smattering of the rest of the 500 or so kids in my school.

Excuse me for not thinking it lighthearted and hilarious that you suggested shooting someone over their love of Shakespeare, simply because you don't see the appeal. Don't lay the blame at my feet for your poor jokes.

It wasn't meant to be political at all, I have no political leaning or intention. The UKIP thing was a joke...

My reply was clearly in two very distinct halves, that didn't correlate at all. 

Here, I've aided you by editing it down to the point:

Of course the question is what do you replace it with. There literally is no other question here?!

This is an extract from the article linked and a quote from The Department of Education:
""It does ensure pupils will learn about a wide range of literature, including at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel written anywhere and post-1914 fiction or drama written in the British Isles.""

They are not being wholly inclusive to, quote you, ""19th century and earlier only, restrictions on nationality of authors etc"". They are including later works and works from other countries, keeping it somewhat balanced, relevant to Britian's literary history and engaging to pupils through its diversity.

Don't get me wrong. Steinbeck is my favourite author, and Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has a potent message to be learned, but they aren't to only books that convey such messages.

Change happens and these texts have been studied for years, you have to take into account the teachers who have taught the same book year after year. They need something to keep them engaged with their subject, and therefore the children.


*After reading your comment, I'm still failing to see your issue. So you no longer care for the restriction of the nationality of the author as you term it arbitrary, which it is at the hand of Groves. Then you say a story should be based on its own merits, again true. You bring up accessibility to the students is key, again, valid point, but what's to say a French novel from the 19th century is less accessible to an British pupil from the 21st century than an American novel from the 20th century? True, your point about a teacher's enthusiasm can only aid so much, but I think again you're missing the point. They're not going to pick uninteresting, hard-to-deceiver book for a GCSE audience who have probably never read a piece of 'classical' literature in their academic career thus far! They'll get one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel written anywhere and post-1914 fiction or drama written in the British Isles. I can't see your problem? It's sad that the books are going and the change is difficult since they have been on the syllabus so long and so many people have been exposed to them and had a emotional reaction to them, but your arguments don't match up with the issue?*

Here's an example of what they could be learning:

'A Midsummer's Night Dream' 'Much Ado about Nothing' 'The Tempest' 'The Merchants of Venice' 'Hamlet' 'Henry V' 'Richard III' 'Two Gentlemen of Verona' 'Romeo Juliet' 'Othello' etc - Shakespeare

'Brideshead Revisited' - Evelyn Waugh/ 'A room with a view' - E.M.Foster/'Sons and Lovers' - D.H.Lawrence/'Mrs Dalloway' - Virginia Woolf/'The Heart of the Matter' - Graham Greene/'The Man who was Thursday' - G.K.Chesterton/ 'Equus' - Peter Shaffer/ 'Waiting for Godot' - Samuel Beckett/'The History Boys' - Alan Bennett.

'Frankenstein' - Mary Shelley/ 'Madame Bovary' - Gustave Flaubert/'Dracula' - Bran Stoker/ 'Alice in Wonderland' - Lewis Carrol/'Pickwick Papers' or 'Oliver Twist' Dickens/'Anna Karenina' - Leo Tolstoy/'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' - Robert Stevenson/'Jane Eyre' - Charlotte Bronte/'Wuthering Heights' - Emily Bronte/'Pride and Prejudice' Jane Austen/'The adventures of Huckleberry Finn' - Mark Twain.

What? No. It's one book that many kids study. Kids also study lots of other books. 

It's important to have some degree of similarity in education across borders and across generations. 

&gt;I'm not saying it's the *only* book studied, but it's definitely the most popular by a large margin.

Yes. Pretty much what I said. 

There should be plenty of books to study, and they should be among them.

I am in the Ministry of Labour at least once a week and I see cases each time where workers win cases against their employers. There are over 5 million migrant workers in UAE - they outnumber locals by 6 to 1. The government does not want 5 million pissed off workers on their hands, and [have introduced a raft of legislation to protect workers](http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/uae-sets-example-in-labour-laws-minister-1.1325356), which is actually enforced. There are of course some cases that don't get spotted and the system still needs a lot of work.

&gt; Wow, judging by your history you seem to be a full time UAE shill. 

I wish I was paid to reddit, that would be sweet. But unfortunately that is not the case. The truth is I live and work in UAE, and I volunteer for a humanitarian charity that assists labourers. This puts me in a position where I know a lot more about the situation than the average redditor, so I try to contribute to the discussion when I can.

&gt; You do nothing except spread pro-UAE propaganda. Every single comment. 

I am actually a fierce critic of UAE, but I believe criticism should be based on fact, not media sensationalism. There are plenty of things to criticise without resorting to making things up. My posts are largely responding to incorrect criticisms of the UAE because that is what gets posted on reddit the most. If people were posting incorrect praise of the UAE, I would equally respond pointing out their errors, but such postings hardly ever occur ([here is one example](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/25kali/what_is_it_like_to_live_in_dubai/chige68)).

I didn't get to the third year of my PhD by dismissing all citations that don't correspond to my own worldview...

Now my main research field is Computer Science rather than Natural Sciences, meaning I will not be able to offer unique insights.  However, the general principles of research are about the same, and I suggest any actual Natural Scientists should pitch in if I make erroneous claims. So I will try to see what I can come up with in 10 minutes.  This is of course not going to be at a solid academic piece since, as I said, I'm not a natural scientist but rather a quick survey of available literature (mostly through Google Scholar). Where possible, I will try to provide references not behind a paywall (since I'm off-campus and it seems a lot of these papers are published on Springerlink which I have had constant trouble logging into, I can't get passed the paywall at any rate).

An initial scan took me [Cook (2013)](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article), a study that looked at the general consensus amongst the scientific community about whether climate change is man-made or not.  The results were obtained by reviewing peer-reviewed papers published from 1991-2011 that use the keywords 'global warming' or 'global climate change' and classifying the leanings of their abstracts.  The results found that 32.6% of abstract were in support of the idea that climate change is human caused, 66.4% stated no opinion on the subject, 0.7% rejected the human role in climate change, whilst 0.3% held an undecided opinion.  Filtering out the papers that had no opinion on the subject (since inevitably the reasoning would be because the paper was not addressing that aspect of the climate change problem), that means that 97% of papers endorsed the idea that humans are responsible for climate change whilst 3% either reject/are sceptical of the notion.  Now normally, the fact that there is such a large consensus should speak for itself - the only reason such a large consensus would build is because evidence suggests that it is the most likely theory.  This, of course, is a handwave, so let's instead turn our attention to the remaining 3%.

Now my attempt to find sceptic papers on Google Scholar actually turned out to be difficult since when you have such a large consensus, the majority of papers that will show up will be pro-anthropogenic climate change.  Luckily, the authors of the above study included a 2MB data file containing all their data and classifications, which I will now use.  Since Reddit has a 10000 character limit and I actually don't have time to do a full study into the matter, I will only focus on the three most recent papers.  Now the first paper [""Why is Global Warming Slowing Down?""](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134%2FS1028334X11100023#page-1) I unfortunately can only access the first two pages of.  In the Cook study, it was rated a 5 meaning its abstract implicitly minimises/rejects the anthropogenic contribution to climate change.  However to quote a sentence from the second paragraph ""Evidently, the observed global rise in temperature (Fig. 1) is a response of the climatic system to the combined action of both anthropogenic  and natural impacts.""  In fact, whilst it argues that global warming is slowing own, it explicitly states that it preliminarily removes long-term anthropogenic trends from temperature data.  Essentially, the paper is arguing that the effect of natural causes is diminishing.

Next I will look at [""Is The Recessional Pattern Of Himalayan Glaciers Suggestive Of Anthropogenically Induced Global Warming?""](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12517-010-0155-9#page-1) (again could only access the introduction, ffs researchers switch to open access already!).  Now, I'm already sceptical of the fact that a scientific papers manages to go two pages without actually saying anything of substance, whilst using sensationalist speech. However, I did a bit of reading up on the paper to understand the conclusions drawn, and my understanding is that the crux of the argument is that global warming is probably not human caused because glaciers haven't melted nearly as much as we expected them to... Take from that what you will.

Finally, let us look at [""Is Global Warming Mainly Due To Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions?""](http://franke.nau.edu/images/uploads/fcb/09-14.pdf).  Now, although I would need a climate expert to back me up on this, the author attempts to disprove a correlation between temperature in US states and CO2 emissions. Now, setting aside the fact that this data source is way too localised to measure global trends, his regression model states a number of assumptions without proving that making these assumptions won't have a significant impact on the outcome.  Additionally, he uses a regression model designed for economics without demonstrating that using this model is safe for analysing climate trends. In summary, his methodology is flawed and therefore the results can only be taken with a pinch of salt.

Now if a climate scientists could pitch in and try to argue for/against this, be my guest...

This was years ago so they may have fixed the fence.  

There's also two abandoned Chapels behind Hydebank Prison on the Purdysburn road.  If you check out Google Maps you'll find them easily enough right behind the prison to the East, and be able to figure out how to get to them.

The Ford Factory is another place but it usually has someone inside for night watch.  You can get in via the Blacks Road Entrance, which would probably be safer if you don't want to get spotted or else there's the Finaghy Entrance where you'll most likely be spotted of someone if on night watch.

I don't object to people reading Shakespeare. After I understood *Romeo and Juliet* it was lovely. Considering how little people read, we could do our best to encourage them by giving them intelligible prose.

Analysis of literature is important, of course. I'm not sure if you ever read *The Yellow Wallpaper* for English Literature. I don't think I would've been able to understand its value unless the analysing the teacher helped us with told us so. (Students en masse don't understand the value of analysis, but at some point they will.)

(2) Ah yes—poetry. We need more of that. It's the most hated of the art-forms. I never really enjoyed poetry, though children should be able to come to that conclusion themselves. They have minds too. Prose-dominance isn't what I argue for of course.

Unlike Gove, just because I don't like poetry I wouldn't like to see it eliminated from the National Curriculum.

 Now the right wing 'orange book' bit of the party is running things and as they've been in power they've lost most of the social democratic votes, the ones on their key issues have gone away because they didn't achieve any of them (or didn't want to), the 'none of the above' vote seems like it's going to UKIP and the tory votes have gone back to the tories in lots of places with their more centrist image.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The __Goiânia accident__ was a [radioactive contamination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination) accident that occurred on September 13, 1987, at [Goiânia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia), in the Brazilian state of [Goiás](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A1s), after an old [radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotherapy) source was stolen from an abandoned hospital site in the city. It was subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination and 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their bodies.   In the cleanup operation, [topsoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsoil) had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. *[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine\))* magazine has identified the accident as one of the world's ""worst [nuclear disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disaster)"" and the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency) called it ""one of the world's worst radiological incidents"".

In the Goiânia incident it was caesium-137. The diameter of the ""source"" is 30 mm.*

They are voting for a party headed by a man who ""feels uncomfortable"" when people choose to converse in a language other than English on a train. He ""feels uncomfortable"" around Romanian men, but Germans are perfectly acceptable. The party complains that the EU is passing laws that aren't in the country's interest, and fails to show up to the parliament (you know, what they get paid for) to vote against that legislation. 

If people want out of the EU, vote Tory. They're giving you a referendum. All UKIP are is a populist bullshit party for racists (and seemingly racists who don't want to admit it). All of their policies bar rejecting the EU would drive the country into the dirt. I mean, if you want absolute proof of their idiocy, they are a party for climate change deniers. Somehow people with no academic background in climate science feel that they are qualified to dispute research carried out by groups worldwide, despite having no real understanding of the scientific literature or having carried out any of their own research. They are fruitcakes, and anybody who gives them credibility is a moron, because only a moron would decide that these people will make the right decisions for us.

true,the_leander,null,null,"&gt; You bring up accessibility to the students is key, again, valid point, but what's to say a French novel from the 19th century is less accessible to an British pupil from the 21st century than an American novel from the 20th century?

Absolutely nothing. Which is kind of the point. Why should a well translated French novel be discounted if it fires the kids up? Isn't that the entire point of stories? To fuel peoples imagination? I'd put good money down that there are fewer, better feelings for an English teacher to hear than when one of their students turns around and tells them they love reading.

&gt; They're not going to pick uninteresting, hard-to-deceiver book for a GCSE audience who have probably never read a piece of 'classical' literature in their academic career thus far

And yet, they stick with Shakespeare. Sure, with gobs of education providing background I'm sure Shakespeare can come to life. But it would be better suited to a drama class than an English one. Given the amount of pressure teachers are under, the amount of subjects being crammed in, they simply haven't the time provide enough history to give context to Shakespeare's plays to prevent it ending up a source of misery for millions of kids that effectively kills off interest in literature entirely.

In all honesty even going back to novels written by English authors of the same time period of Steinbeck the difference in language is stark. Thanks to mass importation of American media many early 20th century novelists are easier to read than their British counterparts. Whether you consider that a good or bad thing is another argument for another day.

&gt; but your arguments don't match up with the issue? 

What, that cutting out literary possibilities due to an accident of birth on the part of the author is a really bad idea that smacks of petty nationalism? That Gove has practically made his career by doing very ill advised things to education, and then doubling down to make those situations as bad as they can get? My issue isn't that there is change, which is what you keep repeating, its that the person making the decision isn't known making sound ones. 

Your list of authors represents some of the greatest and most well known stories of all time though I would argue a fair few of them would be tough to get through for a 14 year old. Honestly if the goal was to make English more accessible, dump Shakespeare and pull one of those out of a hat. Dropping of mice and men is bad, as evidenced by the comments in this thread. It is almost universally remembered fondly and cited again and again in people continuing to read books.

Now I could be absolutely 100% wrong and Gove puts in its place something even better from a 14 year olds point of view, in which case everything I've written is moot and I'd never be happier about being wrong.

So although, yes, players like Lallana and Lovren are good players and would make a difference to our squad, the PL is renowned for being overpriced and there are players who for lower prices being quoted for those two who could arguably make as big, or even more of a difference. But I do agree with you, it would make sense to buy these sort of players to add to our squad, but if those were our signings for the summer I would be disappointed, as we are a far more attractive club to players that we missed out on such as Mykhitaryan and Diego Costa now that we are in the Champions League, and we could be targeting players of that ilk this summer.

Everytime they mention UKIP or Farage, they link to a story. BBC news on TV reflects what is seen on their news website (With prominent figures like Nick Robinson making regular contributions to both).

You are partially correct in saying that Tweets are not journalism (They just link to journalism instead), but it does demonstrate that they have had more exposure than the other parties. It's not 'substantial evidence' as you referred to in your other comment, but unless you present some evidence that shows that UKIP were under-represented in the media then i'm going to say that you are wrong.

Your insistence that UKIP was capable of getting these poll results without the extra TV coverage is misguided at best. Media exposure has an enormous effect on elections (There is almost limitless evidence to show this, it's an irrefutable fact) and TV reaches the widest audience meaning it has the largest effect. The TV coverage captures the attention of voters who do not follow politics closely and do not identify with a specific party (Anecdotal, but posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/26h55p/lets_have_a_discussion_on_the_european_election/chrbsdk) show what I mean).

What I do not disagree with you on, is that UKIP deserved TV coverage, nor am I saying that voters were misled.

Noise on a bike in built up traffic is to loud and random to tell any approaching danger.

Breaks are pointless when your bike connects with a motorized vehicle.  But it looks like his bike got tangled somehow. See how his front wheel comes off the ground and into view.

true,leaflace,null,null,"1st things 1st, the writer is employed by Greenpeace, and this is a very one sided piece. 


What people need to remember is that the industrialisation of farming wasn't solely to increase yields. It was also about reducing labour. One farmer and his combine harvester effectively replaced the jobs of a 100 or  so people. That is just one machine, run by fossil fuels that has replaced jobs previously done by hand. 

Reducing costs/labour is one of the main driving forces behind the use of pesticides, herbicides, destruction of hedgerows etc. Used to be a time when people weeded by hand, and birds were useful for eating up insect pests. The invention of the threshing machine and the riots that followed are one example where workers were leaving the fields. 

So one potential fix would be to start reverting back to using less machinery, and employ more farm hands. This would help lower CO2 emissions, and allow for more bio-friendly farming practises. A lot of the equipment is already available. On crop trial farms, a single field will have many trials set up within it, which have to be harvested either by hand or by much smaller combines to keep material separate. 

(that was a bit of a ramble)

Ultimately, I think the main problem is too many people have taken the food we can get in supermarkets for granted. Farming is a fucking tough job, and they are being asked to keep prices as low as possible, while also increasing yield, while also not destroying the environment.

true,AmenteAmant,null,null,"&gt; And yet, they stick with Shakespeare. Sure, with gobs of education providing background I'm sure Shakespeare can come to life. But it would be better suited to a drama class than an English one. Given the amount of pressure teachers are under, the amount of subjects being crammed in, they simply haven't the time provide enough history to give context to Shakespeare's plays to prevent it ending up a source of misery for millions of kids that effectively kills off interest in literature entirely.

I agree. There isn't enough time to educate students about the historic, political, social, religious, economical contexts surrounding ANY novel, Steinbeck included. I also think you'll find Shakespeare has recently risen in popularity with children, and they want to learn in, albeit more in a dramatic environment, but still! Shakespeare is not a misery too millions. Trust me, I did him alongside Chaucer, now that was a misery. 

&gt; In all honesty even going back to novels written by English authors of the same time period of Steinbeck the difference in language is stark. Thanks to mass importation of American media many early 20th century novelists are easier to read than their British counterparts. Whether you consider that a good or bad thing is another argument for another day.

No more stark that Steinbeck's strange dialect. It took me a good while to adjust to reading the language of Grapes of Wrath, as long if not longer than Shakespeare. 

&gt;What, that cutting out literary possibilities due to an accident of birth on the part of the author is a really bad idea that smacks of petty nationalism? 

I think you still haven't actually understood what I'm saying. THIS ISN'T THE CASE. It's not to do with Nationalism, but rather a change of texts. 'Foreign' texts by Author's of various nationalities will be studied from the 19th century. I listed half a dozen possibilities. There is nothing saying they are cutting out these texts because they aren't British.

I have no stance on Gove as I simply don't know enough about him to judge. Yes, from what I've read he's shaking things up a little, perhaps for the wrong reasons. But still, this is not a tragedy. There are plenty great texts for Children to engage with, learn, and take to heart. Nothing has been lost, just changed!

&gt;Your list of authors represents some of the greatest and most well known stories of all time though I would argue a fair few of them would be tough to get through for a 14 year old.

I read many of those texts at the age of 15/16 (GCSE AGE) in part of the syllabus of IGCSE, in class and recreationally including more like Arthur Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, J.D. Salinger and Tennessee Williams. It's when I fell in love with reading, and yes, sometimes it was a little challenging but that's a part of it.

The texts I cited are as accessible as most on the old syllabus. You forget that these students will be coming to the subject fresh, like we all once did, and it'll be hard to leap from pre-GCSE readings to reading classic novels, as it was for us. You had to initially adapt to Steinbeck's language and the period setting, like you would with any novel, unless you leap in their with a great understanding of early 20th century American written slang and the period. It's also a compulsory subject, so it must be accessible. You seem to have this idea that Shakespeare is penetrable to young adults, and maybe you found it a little complex when you studied it at GCSE level, but honestly, it's not inaccessible to the masses and I know many people who delighted in it. The dropping of of mice and men is sad, but change happens. It was going to happen at some point anyhow, you can't expect every UK student to study of Mice and Men until the end of time. I've read it! It was great, I preferred Grapes of Wrath, but that's just me maybe.

We'll see, who knows. Que sera, sera.

You don't. If they go beat him up then you punish them for their actions but people should be free to believe the most offensive, incoherent, incorrect babble they want and they should be free to talk to other people about it. Just don't cause any practical effect on other peoples life.

I've got friends who were in Public schools and they've pretty much said the same thing - there were no fights unless you were a tosser. I think the level of teaching in regular schools differs a lot depending on how responsive you are to academic learning. Unfortunately a lot of people who weren't very academically minded got snubbed. My brother and I went to the same school, within 5 years of each other - I got 10 GCSE's A-C grades and he got 4 GCSE's all C grades. He went AFTER me and the school had supposedly ""improved"". My opinion on the matter is that he just isn't interested in academic learning and because of this wasn't encouraged and was neglected.

Didn't you read the article? He's a journalist reporting news from Africa. Somalia is in Africa in case if you didn't know. 

He was granted an asylum in 2000, so the area in Somalia where he lived may become safe for him to visit, 14 years is long time after all. Even if the area where he originally lived is still dangerous, there are lots of other areas in Somalia where it is safe for him to visit. His family might live in these areas. I couldn't imagine myself not meeting my own family forever.

&gt; The same type of scrutiny needs to be applied to Somalian 'refugees' who have made bogus asylum claims through fear that they or their offspring will be subject to FGM yet their parents happen to book a 'girls only' family holiday in the summer to a country next door to Somalia. 

Where's your evidence of that? Somalis refugees get asylum claim because they're in danger of losing their lives, not losing their clitoris (the latter does get granted but it's not common). 

We realise FGM is a problem, and we're actively combating this problem. Of course there'll be always someone who has slipped through the net.

Confusion seems to be the first response to UKIP getting in, so I might be able to shine a light on their recent success from a fairly neutral point of view (I'm a lost lib dem voter).

Couple of things to note immediately

1) UKIP's manifesto is at odds with a chunk of the policies being attributed to it. Individuals within the party have expressed a number of stupid views on a variety of topics, but the party has successfully distanced itself away from them. Damnable quotes from a few of their members might be enough to sour their name on places like reddit and twitter, but online political culture is vastly at odds with on the ground political culture and it doesn't have the same impact.

2) UKIP - A racist party? The vast majority of their members are about as racist as Jeremy Clarkson is. They're not the rebirth of Hitler that they're sometimes portrayed as but everytime they get publicly called out on racism they gain in the polls. Why? I believe its because the type of people who openly oppose UKIP (Young and Educated was the famous quote about their difficulties in London) are groups like students. It's seem nationally as condescension.

3) UKIP's gaffes feed the machine because the other parties try and be squeaky clean all the time. Things like Ed Millibands recent radio interview (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/uk-politics-video/10844112/Listen-to-Ed-Milibands-excruciating-interview-on-BBC-Radio-Wiltshire.html) really highlight how attempts to seem like they control the situation sound increasingly ridiculous. Farages flaws are attractive to voters because they have no other characters to back. Bring back Charles Kennedy :'(

4) The German wife.

For the love of god people can we please stop going ""Haha! Your wife is German! But you are a racist!"" because it bloody well highlights how UKIP may infact not actually hate all foreigners. A lot of their core experienced campaigners are European (they have a large french and Italian contingent) and they can get them out on a local level which really kneecaps the ""UKIP is highly xenophobic"" argument.

Townsend can cover for both Konoplyanka and Lamela. Holtby has said that he ideally plays in a deeper role, but he is capable of covering for both Dembele or Eriksen. Capoue can cover for either DM role, but primarily for Sandro. Naughton is not allowed to come anywhere close to the LB position, but he's absolutely proven himself as adequate cover for Walker.

In the case of Davies getting injured, we may want to move Vertonghen out on the left for that one match, but we should not keep him there like AVB did.
