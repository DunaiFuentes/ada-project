false,Spankersore,dalek,Dalek,"I have always understood the problem to be that the activity of the Weeping Angels at that particular point in time and space (constantly sending the same individuals back in time; waiting for them to catch back up to the angels; and then sending them back again; rinsing &amp; repeating until the individual finally died of old age) created a complex layering of overlapping time lines and paradoxes that the Tardis could not navigate. The 'homing beacon'  that the Doctor created with River and the vase only existed in one layer of the paradox- the one that Rory and Amy collapsed by committing suicide. Then, at the cemetery, the straggling angel sent them back to a different layer of the paradox. 

Because the Doctor and the Tardis occupy a time line that branches off of the collapsed one, they cannot travel back to the layer of the paradox that Rory and Amy occupy. Travelling to a point in time before the paradox and waiting would not work because the paradox is essentially a break, or a blank space in the Doctor's own time line. Think of the space between these lines: (___   ___). Rory and Amy occupy one of potentially thousands of layers of alternate time lines located in the blank space. If the Doctor were to attempt to enter the paradox from an earlier point in time, it would only create another layer, one in which Amy and Rory did not exist/occupy. Visualize it like this:(__-__) , with the dash over the blank being the new layer that the Doctor just created. No matter how many times he tries to go back and wait, all he does is create another layer to the paradox. 

But what about the last page of the book, written by Amy? Surely if the Doctor is reading it in his time line, then she exists in his time line at some point after the paradox? As with all paradoxical the answer is both yes and no.  Amy and Rory's tombstones do not tell us when they died, only their ages at the time of their deaths. The paradox always begins at the earliest point in time to which an individual was sent by this particular group of Weeping Angels, and always ends with the death of the Ponds. The whole paradox can be vizualized like this: -&lt;=&gt;- (normal time line, paradoxical split, layers of the paradox, the collapse, and then normal time line again). Amy and Rory are always sent to the beginning of the paradox or a point just after it, and the paradox always collapses with their deaths, regardless of whichever layer they occupy. The layer we witness no longer exists because the paradox no longer exists. If the Doctor were to attempt to intercept the Ponds at a point prior to the beginning of the episode, it would only result in the classic ""grandfather paradox""  scenario.

I fundamentally disagree with him that this is an important distinction. While people obviously prefer to experience hope than fear, they are just two sides of the same coin, and both can be exploited to manipulate people's decisions. Neither optimism nor pessimism are good platforms to make important political decisions on, only realism. Though being a truly objective realist is an almost impossible thing to achieve, best just to manage a balance of hope and fear.

With realism must come the acceptance that not everything in this world is good, nor is it necessarily bad. As far as an eu referendum is concerned, I don't see why it makes a difference whether people spread the optimistic message of ""let's liberate ourselves from the EU, to give the UK freedom to flourish"" and the pessimistic message of ""let's escape the EU, it's a bad institution that will ruin us if we remain"". Neither is grounded in reality. If someone feels that the EU is just bad rather than having the greater belief that the UK has better prospects outside it, they're no less entitled to think that way than someone who thinks the EU has potential for good but the UK has more potential outside it.

Still, it is good to see him taking more of an interest in wider UK politics. His popularity seems to be largely on the back of widespread dissatisfaction with the current political 'establishment', a sentiment that also exists widely in the rest of the country.

Indeed. Not because it undermined me, but because it less relevant to my point. I am addressing offensiveness (which can only be applied subjectively) with far less vigour than that of whether the term is racist. We could argue about offensiveness until the cows come home. As offensiveness is a personal choice it is a lot more difficult to come to a concrete understanding of whether something is offensive or not. Hence why I said the listener should understand the context and intent of its use to determine offensiveness.

&gt;But by the rule you just stipulated, since I wasn't trying to be offensive you should understand that I was not actually offensive, so no harm done, right?

I never mentioned I was offended. I was complaining that you were attacking me personally rather than my argument. In doing so, it does a disservice to our otherwise quite polite and reasonable discourse.

&gt;wouldn't you concede your argument breaks down if British people of Chinese origin say, ""That word is pretty offensive"", which they are doing?

It is each individual's right to be offended by whatever they like. I could find blue offensive if I want. However I have no right on the behalf of British people to tell say, Germans, which of their words are offensive to us. What I can do however, is tell them which of their words are offensive to *me*.

If everyone from China found 'chink' offensive as the word itself. All that means is that for everyone in China, 'chick' is offensive to them regardless of the speaker's intent. Which, is irrational, but is their choice. The only test as to whether something is offensive is whether someone got offended by it. It still however, does not mean the term is racist.

&gt;Look, I can concede it is possible to say the word 'chink' without being a racist.

Then we are in agreement. I can also happily agree with you that in all *probability* when spoken it is generally intended offensively. However I am saying that it isn't always. And that it isn't necessarily racist.

&gt;But it is impossible to use it about an Asian woman who you are trying to insult without it being racist;

Probably. But not always. Consider ""That Chinky dresses awfully"". It is an insult, it is quite offensive on several counts (in my opinion), however it is not actually racist. Now consider ""Chinkies can't dress well"" - that, is racist. Kerry, specifically, said ""chinky bird"".

That's the kind of fear that causes people to commit suicide or become dependant on drink or drugs. That's despair - which IDS knows nothing about - and never will.

false,Growlbot_,lfc87,,"Ramblings about our last match:

It was a promising performance against Bournemouth on Wednesday. The brightest we’ve been since away at Tottenham in August. The goals will hopefully have boosted morale. Our line-up was aggressive. It featured five offensive players (if we count Henderson), two being unorthodox wing-backs, Gerrard and Lucas sat in front of a back three of central defenders. I was a little concerned at the amount of playmakers on the field and lack of real width for us, thinking that Bournemouth might overpower us in the opening exchanges. Our wings in particular looked light on defensive cover. As it happened, passing and finishing proved the difference between the two sides. Our intent was possession for the purpose of creating chances, to play like a home side. We kept the ball excellently; a pass success of 88%, our highest for seven games. We also dictated the tempo for the majority of the game.

In the first 10, Kolo gave his often seen up and down arm-signal that says “ keep calm”. The confidence spread and we found pockets to start playing in. Lucas and Gerrard need a mention here, they produced the most passes in the game by a decent margin. It felt a little odd to watch us so much in control for a change, but good-odd. I like three at the back in these types of games. It’s adventurous. It allows us to overload and dominate the midfield and the forwards have more space, not being pushed centrally by overlapping fullbacks. Here it gave Henderson licence to join attacks. Indeed the first goal, after some great patience and ball-retention resulting in 52 consecutive passes, was unlocked by Henderson’s gambling run and facing header across the box. Sterling nodded in:

* [Sterling (20')](http://gfycat.com/AstonishingGrippingAruanas)

A week after his red card against Basel, Markovic displayed composure in the left channel. Surprisingly he also delivered the most successful tackles in the game (with 6). Our second, Marko’s first, illustrated his composure well. At the edge of the box, he calmly side-footed the ball home through a crowd of bodies when most players would have lashed it into the stands. There are shades of Berbatov and Mcmanaman in his playing style. He seems as cool as a cucumber:

* [Markovic (27')](http://gfycat.com/SlushyActualKakarikis)

Another symptom of us playing well is that play goes from defence to attack at speed. The third goal came after the break. Kolo slid-in Lallana, Sterling took over from there. He’s been taking on more responsibility recently.  All game he showed the sign of a good attacker; to always want the ball, to be greedy. A little later he was tearing a strip off Coutinho for not playing him in. It was nice to see, Suarez-level desire, he’s growing into a serious talent: 

* [Sterling (51')](http://gfycat.com/JovialEagerBichonfrise)

On 57, Bournemouth finally found the net. The dragged back cross that worked so well for Valencia and Rooney days earlier was repeated here. For ten minutes afterwards we lost composure as the team from the South Coast had a spell:

* [Gosling (57')](http://gfycat.com/BogusPreciousBrownbear)

They are doing well in the Championship so this was understandable (better teams will kill us in these moments, we’ve seen that too often this season). Bournemouth’s late comeback proved in vain. Overall, they couldn’t live with the movement, the interchangeability, the quickness of thought. Lallana embodied all this. Returning to his former club bought out his best.

Discrimination in itself, is not illegal and nor should it be, and I need to perhaps be a little clearer on when I say it needs legislating against, I mean in very particular instances (such as on grounds of religion, race, gender).

&gt;someone could feel like they're being discriminated against by someone not being PC towards them and using the words that some of the UKIP members have done.

Someone could well feel that. And they'd have every right too. But beyond a feeling of unpleasantness, so?

We have the quality, we have a good manager and we have proven that the lads we have can perform at an amazingly high level against the top teams. Yes, things look like shit when we have just got off the back of a loss to a makeshift Saints team- but remember that this is the same group of lads who finished top of the group of death in the Europa.

Over the last 2 months we have been hit with some horrible injuries, and all this during the most hectic schedule of pretty much any team in world football. Whilst I am not saying this is an excuse (we should still have been more competitive against a lot of what we have faced), it goes some way to throw water onto the flames of doubt. 

We have January coming up, a time when we traditionally turned on the class. With a month of only League and FA Cup commitments, I feel we will be able to work hard on our issues and smash as many out of our game as possible. Martinez and his staff know there are problems, and it is his job as a manager to work to our strengths and not allow the opposition to exploit our weaknesses, and those who are doomsaying are suggesting that Martinez can't do that- and surely that means you want his head on the chopping block?

When has Farage stated that other races are inferior? UKIP and Farage are patriotic but not racist, would you say that all those who are patriotic are racist?

&gt;You are disagreeing with facts. That is dishonest. Or are you going to redefine what honesty is too?

Disagreement is normal in politics, keep in mind that those who have different opinions on things are not lying or deceiving but simply wish to debate.

I've countered those statements and provided sources to back up what I'm saying, if you have further evidence yourself then that is something which we can continue to debate as long as you counter my individual points.

&gt;Im saying having a racist party in power will impact on children. Why dont you understand that? Are you denying the word ""chinky"" is racist? Are you?

I was stating that I didn't understand what you were saying with that question, with the way you used it comes across as if you're degrading Chinese kids. I don't think Chinky is an acceptable word to use in a derogatory way, if you're using it with some friends to say that you're ""going down to the local chinky"" with no mal-intent meant, that's fine.

When Rose saved her father the world started ripping itself apart and the only way to fix that was she had to let her father get hit and die restoring the timeline. Amy &amp; Rory got transported back to the early 20th century the Doctor wasn't able to go pluck them out of it as it would alter the new timeline that was created by sending them back causing a rip in time and space that could lead to tragic events. They no longer became a viewer of history and part of it, in the process making them off-limits.

Nixon records events in the Oval Office -&gt; Doctor comes to the office. Prior to leaving the Doctor mentioned David Frost's name planting the idea that he was a friend of the Doctor which gave him credibility. This is how an entertainment figure got a serious interview with Nixon. -&gt; Nixon deletes/records over the missing 18 minutes  that consisted of the events around the Doctor -&gt; Nixon gets busted for the Watergate -&gt; Gets the Interview with Frost because of the name drop of ""Frost"" from the Doctor.

He didn't cause Nixon to break into the Watergate but changed time to ""how we perceive it"" as our timelines has always known that event but if the Doctor didn't drop his name would he have gotten the interview? He is a Time Lord and they have a different way of seeing what a small change like dropping ""Frost's name"" to Nixon versus causing the TARDIS to blow up and he had to fix the timeline himself causing the second big bang to restore the timeline.

To the exact opposite extreme with Van Gogh as he was brought to the present day allowing him to see how what he thought his meaningless life improved the world. He saw that doing this wouldn't alter the timeline but changed his last month on the earth for the better. If he wouldn't have committed suicide this would have changed a fixed point in time causing alerting time forever how we perceive it. The Doctor is aware of the minor tweak to the timeline but is fully aware and attempts to temper Amy from being too excited about the change that they made to Van Gogh's life. 

It is the Doctor's right to put little tweaks in the timeline but the ""fixed"" points in time are world/universe/galaxy changing events which would cause harm to the time line. He can tweak the direction while not changing major events. Van Gogh could have painted a masterpiece that altered the universe from its sheer beauty which impacted WW2 which impacted... etc... The same reasoning that when River goes back to kill hitler she is unable to change this no matter how much she tries. Some events have to happen no matter how hard the observer wants to change it. The butterfly effect is strongly real when dealing with Time Travel but the minor events seem to work themselves out on their own as long as you don't alter a fixed point.

Hopefully this makes some crazy sense to the situation and there is an absurd logic to the events but isn't apparent without knowing what to look for.

p.s. if you read the first paragraph it was total rubbish just to start me writing but I kind of like it now that I re-read it so I left it in and didn't alter that fixed point in time.

&gt;

&gt;__Nationalism__ is a belief, [creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed) or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation). Nationalism involves [national identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity), by contrast with the related construct of [patriotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism), which involves the [social conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conditioning) and personal behaviors that support a state's decisions and actions. 

&gt;From a political or sociological perspective, there are two main perspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism. One is the [primordialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordialism) perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of birth. The other is the [modernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism) perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist. 

&gt;An alternative perspective to both of these lineages comes out of [Engaged theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engaged_theory), and argues that while the form of nationalism is modern, the content and subjective reach of nationalism depends upon 'primordial' sentiments. 

&gt;There are various definitions for what constitutes a nation, however, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a belief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural, religious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities.  The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has commonly been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of [anomie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie) that nationalists seek to resolve.  This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community).  This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them. 

&gt;[National flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag), [national anthems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem) and other symbols of national identity are commonly considered highly important symbols of the national community.

false,alsorobots,mcgannnew,new McGann,"To clarify, what happened in that episode is a science-fiction trope called a predestination paradox.  It wasn't the location that was locked away, it was Amy and Rory's timelines.  By jumping off the building at the end (hope I'm not spoiling) they created a paradox where the Doctor had already observed Rory on his deathbed and yet had to witness them jumping to their deaths.  Rory was right that creating two seperate observed deaths would collapse that particular timestream (leaving them back at the beginning of those events).

The reason the TARDIS can't save Amy and Rory is because the Angel collapsed the divergent time streams by zapping Rory at the end of the episode.  If the TARDIS tries to go back and save them, it will hit a dead end as the events in the timestream the TARDIS is in are different than the events that the Angel caused to occur.

It realy all comes back to that book the Doctor had read.  If River hadn't written that book, then the Doctor probably would have been able to save Amy and Rory.  This is why River broke her wrist in the episode.  She was terrifyed because it dawned on her that the Doctor was furious at her for writing that book, setting the events in stone (literally).  The paradox is similar to Back to the Future's events only in reverse.  Instead of travelling back in time and changing events, Rory's suicide jumped everything forward to the present day again and the Angel changed the events.  Regardless of the direction of the time stream, those events became established.

The reason they traveled back to 1955 in the sequel to Back to the Future was (1.) it was a sequel that needed call backs to the first film and... (2.) the characters were careful not to alter the events of the first movie.  If they had changed what happened, like when the clocktower was struck by lightning or something, it would have effectively destroyed the universe.  (Remember Doc Brown saying it would??)

Same deal with the Doctor in that episode.  If he had gone back to save Amy and Rory, the universe would have blinked out of existence.",0,1419103241,null,0,false,0,cn0no2t,t3_2pvzyt,t1_cn0no2t,t1_cn0kt76,null,1425299360,63,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,63

I don't see the problem in acknowledging how most of the bodies that define racism and dish out the punishments are mostly white. Now, I'm not one of these people that scream ""white privilege"" but on this issue, the sensitivities involved are rather complex and unless you've properly experienced ethnic racism (and I'm betting most white people haven't experienced the type of racism I'm talking about) then it is very easy to get the judgement calls wrong. The punishment of Balotelli was harsh in context of him posting something that was clearly satirical. 

Unfortunately, white people (I said it) kind of struggle to understand the difference between harmless mocking of one's own stereotypes and actual racism. I had a white friend who used to joke with a really good black friend of his at work - a white secretary overheard and complained and he was summonsed to his manager's office (upon hearing that he was being disciplined, he went to a competitor THAT DAY during his lunch break, got a new job, walked back in and told them to go fuck themselves lololol - boss)

Balotelli has suffered on and off the pitch and I think it is unbelievable that a panel of disassociated upper class whites have decided to make a point with him effectively shutting down any avenues of satirical response to racism that can often trivialise the stereotypes - in a good way. I 100% stand by my comment above, there is nothing racist about it and I appreciate your words.

Let's say you work part time, maybe 8 hours a week (although I used to work with a mother of two who'd just had her hours cut down to 4 a week, so even this is somewhat generous).

Minimum wage for anyone older than 21 is 6.50, meaning you'd bring in £52 a week.

Now lets assume you work in the next town over- taking the bus to work where I used to live was £7 return. Working 8 hours a week most likely means two shifts, so that's £14 gone leaving you with £38.

Maybe the kids also need to get to school and don't qualify for the school bus. Assuming they're too young to travel by themselves, you're then paying for two returns for yourself + 2 kids on the bus. Again using the town I used to live in as an example, that would cost me £8.60, and probably around £10 for the children together, leaving you with £19.40.

Bills could be a fiver a week, leaving you with around £5 a head a week for food, assuming you don't have to pay for your housing. 

Unexpected bill? Boiler breaks? Having to pay for the desk little Billy wrote his name on in school? Purse Stolen? Exceeded the threshold on your gas bill? Suddenly there's just no money left for food.

In all seriousness, we didn't have a lot of offensive spark, but that's to be expected considering our run of form. What this game did do was surely put a lot of confidence back into the team. All over the pitch, players were at top quality.

I think everyone played great, but some players stood out. Toby is a shutdown defender...get him signed Koeman! Yoshida has really improved his game and I really don't care that we will have to run out Yoshida/Toby as a pairing next game (might even be better!). Reed was a workhorse...backing up the claims that a lot of us had that he should have started a few games ago instead of Mane. JWP turns this team's set pieces from shite to consistently threatening. And Long is a straight menace. Doesn't score much, but he had a heavy contribution in the first two.

I can also see from this game that Mane needs to be kept out. Long's play today is what he needs to do. Run all over the pitch, annoy the defenders, and threaten goal. Unfortunately, Mane only annoys the fans. I hope he is able to find some form because having him and Long running down both wings with Pelle in the middle will be a fantastic threat.

I really have to credit Koeman for the shift in formation. What we had wasn't working and it was a stroke of genius to run out the 3-5-2 for this. Quite obvious Everton was not prepared for that and they could just not penetrate the defense.

So despite our down form, we are still 5th. Fantastic! We have another tough run after Palace but suspensions will be over and injuries will have healed (except for J Rod).

It's frustrating to have to do this, since you're coming out with positions I'm not all that far away from myself- and lord only knows I've been less than civil to UKIP folks outside this board. 

But. 

This is /r/BritishPolitics. And you're going a bit far. You've had repeated warnings to be less uncivilly aggressive towards fellow users- and even a brief ban, which I must stress was a courtesy that would ordinarily not be extended to users causing problems- on the grounds that you do, sincerely, make some good points and put in genuine effort to contribute. 

But I've had so many complaints concerning your conduct across this past week alone (easily into the double figures) that I'm compelled to take action here. This subreddit exists to avoid the creation of this kind of toxic atmosphere- you owe it to your peers to treat them with courtesy. You've repeatedly neglected that obligation, and this multiple-comment case is the final straw that's broken the camel's back- we've held out out of consideration for the fact that you're sometimes a decent poster, but you really do need to take some time out. 

For that reason, I'm afraid you've landed yourself another ban. It's set to expire on New Year's Day- this is the shortest ban I feel I can justify, given the circumstances, but *please* understand that this isn't something that I can justify being lenient about again. If things come to a head again, it's a permanent ban from the subreddit.

There y'go, the UK Chinese community state definitively that ""Chink"" *is* racist and people who say it's not are simply failing to understand the nature of racism and racists, or are in fact racists.

If you feel the need to argue, go argue with them, I don't have time to argue the semantics of the term, I posted my experience (that you dismissed out of hand) there's the UK Chinese community's (I feel sure you will attempt to dismiss that too as it doesn't conform to your view).

We have the mess with the commission and council because it's the closest to a workable solution in an environment where constitutional changes would be unlikely to fly in most member states, and the prevailing mood of the governing parties of the member states have been in favour of further integration. 

But it's an alternative that satisfies pretty much nobody except people with a bureaucracy fetish. If you want the EU, but have issues with the bureaucracy and power structures, then supporting federalism is a pretty logical step to resolving a huge number of the structural issues that for EU opponents often are the reason to want out. 

The US faced similar issues during the time of the Articles of Confederation, and the problems led fairly directly to federation because the two obvious alternatives were federation or dissolution and federalism won.

1) Fiscal conservatism - essentially the belief that expendature should be focussed on generating more wealth, typically by helping the already wealthy generate more money, the current con party in the UK is significantly fiscally conservative.

2) Social conservatism - encourages stagnation of social change and in extreme cases has a lot of parallels with fascism/nationalism - and racism. The current tory govt has some back-benchers who are socially conservative, but Cameron's very public backing of gay marriage shows that the party is moving away from that stance.  

3) federal conservatism - the desire to consolidate power into smaller and smaller states. Shares a lot in common with Social conservatism when taken to its extreme.

If the government were a loan shark the banks wouldn't have kneecaps by now.  Nothing happens because the politicians are all tied up in the wealth system, whether it's being bought (cash for questions), straight up fraud (the expenses scandal) or the fact that the City boys and politicians frequently have the same alma maters?

I'm sick of being told by those in power that immigration is an issue. It's not, a tax system that's so easily exploited with a little cash and a corrupt government are the problem with this country, stirring up those in society who are easily led into shouting about whatever issue they're told is the cause of their problems.

It is in your interest as a small company to be VAT registered, because you then don't pay VAT on expenses like office space and hardware. The flip side is that you have to collect VAT from non-VAT-registered customers inside the EU, keep track of the customers address so you know their country, and just total up the amount of collected VAT for each country.

For us this was as simple as changing the VAT percentage in our licencing system from a fixed 20% constant to a method that gets the appropriate VAT rate depending on the customers country. Not a big deal.

The only time you lose out is if you want to keep charging the same price regardless of region and swallow the VAT, in which case you lose out on customers in countries with rates higher than 20%, and gain on those in countries with rates lower than 20%.

So this is actually a budgetary concern too, women will take longer to train to the same standard as men for infantry roles, this means increased cost due to the increasing the time in training or an increased drop out rate due to medical discharges neither of which are desirable, for example  increasing the time for the men so the women don't get medically discharged is not a good choice either is it?

We have 3 players for that position, Bentaleb, Stambouli and Capoue, but neither have shown enough yet. The ""Sandro"" mentality is severely lacking in midfield. Sandro was injury prone and not the most comfortable player on the ball and i think we had hoped that one of our current guys would have that spark + better in possession. Neither have shown to be an upgrade to Sandro and i think we are playing Bentaleb because he have the highest potential. There is a reason why we are linked to Schneiderlin, because that is the type we need. He would walk straight into our starting eleven. Someone who can bring some fight into the midfield, but also be able to pass the ball to our forward line and keep possession.

Dembele and Paulinho are fighting with Mason over the other midfield spot, the more offensive B2B position. I think we would have seen Dembele instead of Stambouli if we had needed a Goal when Mason went out injured. I think Mason has been chosen because he offers more in the possession game. He is a better passer than Dembele and Paulinho, who is more likely to lose the ball. Mason has also been better defensively, although he has declined lately and Dembele has actually showed us that he has some fight left in him. Poch would probably be more inclined to start Dembele or Paulinho if he had a better DM beside them. Right now, Dembele and Paulinho is better used as a backup CAM, but it could change if we get a good DM.

Going back to todays game, i think we struggled when Burnley pressed high and when we couldn't get the ball to the front four, especially to Eriksen.

The police rang the insurance company who said 'oh no, it must have it's own policy in place'. They seized it and the owner took them to court. The judge said 

""The police constables' belief, misled as they may have been by some person within Saga that the cover was only extended if the car actually being driven was itself insured by its owner, was flatly contradicted by the plain words of the certificate"" and goes on to say that the matter is ""as plain as a pikestaff""

Basically, you need to refer to your certificate of motor insurance. If you're allowing someone to drive your vehicle, you need to specifically ask ""do you have insurance"", and you *should* be able to rely on the driver's word.

People I know have been sanctioned because they were 2 minutes late due to bad traffic or shitty bus service. 

One person was sanctioned because they had an interview when they were meant to sign, they called to rearrange their signing time and were told that was fine, only for the person failing to properly commit the change on the system.

Another was sanctioned because the Job Centre refused to change their signing appointment that coincided with a family member's funeral.

Another has been sanctioned because the Job Centre have sent them on a course that is extremely difficult for him to get to as he needs to get two buses and their timings are so close where he needs to change he'd need to get the first bus a half hour earlier and then stand at the other stop for 28 to 32 minutes...a stop that is in a quiet residential area so it's literally a half hour wait twiddling fingers, not even a cafe to maybe grab a coffee in... In order to lessen this he's stayed at his girlfriend's a few nights a week. When asked how the course was going, as a truthful guy, he explained the difficulties with travel and that he'd arranged to stay at his girlfriend's so he wouldn't miss or be late for any days...apparently he now has to make a joint claim with his girlfriend because they class him as cohabiting...

Actually they say ""at worst it is racist"" in the context of calling someone it. Not quite the same, but still incorrect.

The ""UK Chinese Community"" are wrong. Sorry. They are not an authority which has the ability to define English words. They have completely misunderstood what something has to be to qualify as 'racist'. The person speaking, like many others here, are drawing a relationship between victimisation, offence, and racism. Which is fine if the given situation is representative of it. I have absolutely no doubt, that they have experienced racism and can thus discuss it subjectively. However, I am not entirely sure the situation as applies to Kerry, is racist.

However that does not mean they have applied the term correctly for this individual noun. Yes, they find chink offensive, as many people do. That doesn't change the fact that it isn't racist, though. Disparaging yes. Racist no. People's *use* of it may well be, just as use of 'American' may well be, but that very much depends on the context.

What does ""chink"" mean? Does it mean ""a contemptuous term used to refer to a Chinese person."". Or does it mean something else? Is this always the case? Has it always been the case? The etymology of the word is of importance here. 

&gt;Mr. Whelan tried to draw a parallel between using the term “chinks” in relation to Chinese people and using the term “Brits” to refer to British people. To draw such a parallel is ignorant and offensive as it fails to understand the nature of racism 

It would be nice if the speaker could explain that part. But to take a guess, he means the word is often applied in a racist/offensive context whereas Brit is not (which actually, would also be wrong, and to suggest otherwise is equally ignorant on his part). Again however, that would not make the word racist.",0,1419110755,null,0,false,0,cn0qy6z,t3_2pseco,t1_cn0qy6z,t1_cn0ow9v,null,1425297828,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

What I guess you were wondering is whether a different shape would be more economical, as it might lead to a smaller amount of material being excavated.

In that you are partially right, a half-circle tunnel, where the roof is curved and the floor is flat is in fact the most common type of tunnel.

Why they don't make them like this for Crossrail likely has something to do with the machines that are boring through the ground.  That is, it is harder or more expensive to make a machine that will cut a half-circle through the ground.

Also, the lower part of a full circle tunnel is not without it's uses, and can be used for conduits for electrical, drainage, and other services.

I'd like to point out now that when you have difficulty with the events in that episode, it's probably because you're seeing time in a straight line, like watching a movie and skipping forward and back in the events of a movie, but time would be more like having a Blu-Ray disc for every single perspective of every single character in a movie, so instead of traveling through time linearly, you're skipping through many many different time streams (one for each person experiencing the events).

Time Travel is way more complicated and Doctor Who isn't an easy show like Breaking Bad.  It messes with continuity through time travel and choices and pocket universes and erased time lines.

The alternative back four Arsenal used against Newcastle and possibly in play at Anfield but unlikely IMO:

Bellerin - Mertesacker - Debuchy - Gibbs. 

Areas to exploit here are Bellerin's inexperience and Debuchy's unfamiliarity with the CB position, although he performed admirably against Newcastle.

&gt;A __pitchfork__ is an agricultural tool with a long handle and long, thick, widely separated pointed [tines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tine_(structural\)) (also called prongs) used to lift and pitch (throw) loose material, such as [hay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay), straw or [leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf). Pitchforks typically have only two, three or four tines while dung forks have four or five, other types of fork even up to ten tines with different lengths and spacing depending on purpose. They are usually made of steel with a long wooden handle, but may also be made from wood, [wrought iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrought_iron), [bamboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo), [alloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy), etc. In some parts of England a pitchfork is known as a *prong*  and, in parts of Ireland, a *sprong* refers to a 4-pronged pitchfork.  The pitchfork is similar to the shorter and sturdier [garden fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_fork).

Heh. Now I wish I had said 'arse'.

But yes, you can use a DVB-S card. However you will only get Free-to-air channels. Until about March-August this year it was possible to use a CAM and some software to use your subscription card to decode Sky channels. However modified encryption using Card-to-Box pairing put an end to that for now. That said, there are still some card sharers offering the service iirc.

Roberto seems to love Barca so much and you always hear about him emulating Barca– there seem to be two large problems coming out of that fact:

1) what we're talking about, when you watch Barca play any player will run into space as if they're a forward when it's there, they'll always take advantage of the opportunity. That's why you'll see Iniesta or Xavi running into attacking opportunities in the box frequently. 

2) The main *problem* with barca's system that they've been widely criticized for is, hahaha, that they use too many central players and they get in each other's way.

I would suspect (though I don't know; not my area of law) that loss of benefits is akin to losing a job - you don't need to be convicted of, say, non-performance of work duties before the company stops paying you.

The difference (IMO of course) being the word ""sanction"" it is by definition a fine or forfeiture in advance of conviction and would as such appear to be unlawful (unless they revoke the Bill of Rights of course).

The Bill of Rights is specific ""*Any* threat or promise of fine or forfeiture in advance of conviction""

DWP sanctions then clearly fall within it's remit (and it cannot be superseded by any DWP rules or regulations as they are at best only ordinary Acts or Statutes).

I would suggest anyone currently sanctioned appeals on the grounds the sanction is unlawful for the reasons I have given above.

It's not like they can be sanctioned for appealing against the sanction (so there is clearly nothing to lose by so doing).

&gt;

&gt;The __Goliath tracked mine__ - complete German name: *Leichter Ladungsträger Goliath* (*Sd.Kfz. 302/303a/303b*) - was a remote controlled German-engineered demolition vehicle, also known as the __beetle tank__to the Allies.

&gt;Employed by the [Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht) during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). It carried 60 or 100 kilograms (130 or 220 lb) of [high explosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_explosive), depending on the model, and was intended to be used for multiple purposes, such as destroying tanks, disrupting dense infantry formations, and demolition of buildings and bridges.

I am no stranger to the phenomenon. At least in /r/ukpolitics we have a warning over the downvote button to instruct people how to use it. This sub is getting worse for it as we get bigger.

&gt;they don't get a choice

Well. They could remove themselves from the situation or draw attention to the agitators problematic behaviour. That is a choice. Although admittedly not really a choice over whether to hear it in the first instance, but none of us get that.

&gt;I think it's unfair that some people have to go through that their whole life while others will never, due to something as random as skin colour

Discrimination on the grounds of race is illegal. However on a personal level, a racist remark should hopefully be no more hurtful than any other unpleasantry. It is up to an individual how much they let it get to them. Sure it is unpleasant but that is something under ones own control. We for example, have no laws about insulting someone's shape, yet we do for race. Obviously, I doubt there have been all too many instances of shape-hatred on the same sort of level that has been historically applied to race. But hopefully you see my point there.

&gt;I'm sure many women do speak out to men about that but I wouldn't say it's discriminatory, it's their ""type"", what they prefer in a woman, it doesn't mean that they will discriminate against them because of their hair colour! If they were discriminating against them, like making fun of it or making it sound like a bad thing, then they would. Even I would...and I'm blonde

Woah there. That is *precisely* what discrimination is (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discrimination)! Choosing one thing over another... for any reason, whatsoever. Choosing a hair colour out of reproductive preference is a perfect example of discrimination. But it doesn't make it wrong as it isn't a protected class.

Now making fun of something, that isn't strictly discrimination at all. It is however likely offensive (probably). ",0,1419113903,null,0,false,0,cn0scd8,t3_2pt5nq,t1_cn0scd8,t1_cn0rusg,null,1425297178,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Here's the story, sorry if this becomes a wall of text.

I used to be what was known as a mosher. We were teenagers who would wear black and listen to like rap-rock and stuff. We were named after the act of moshing. We all used to hang around the crown courts in Liverpool which was basically a few huge buildings with a patch of grass round the back and a lot of paved area where kids would sit and smoke or drink booze surreptitiously. 

There would often be a few hundred of us there on a Saturday.

Our direct enemies were known as scallies. These were kids who would wear label clothes and listened to dance music and rap. We would often have little scuffles between us. A few kids kicking off and then it would be over in minutes.

One time a group of about 20 scallies entered the courts (which was a big deal) but we were largely peace loving and didn't really do anything about it. 

That was until they attacked a kid (who happened to be in my school a couple of years younger than me) with a chain.

They started to run away immediately after and that was when all hundred of us or so chased after them. 

I was in the chase trying to grab the scallies just in front of us but it all got lost in the shuffle. What happened was that the group of scallies got onto a bus that happened to be broken down and the doors shut. None of us moshers got on board so we started rocking the double decker bus. Just as it really started to go the riot police showed up. 

Myself and my friend then backed the fuck up after I caught a crack on the chin and climbed up on a couple of bottle banks and watched it all play out. Basically we scattered and the scally kids got away.

Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.

Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is His reward.

As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.

Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

Will see what I can find about the meaning as it applies to pubs, though.

.

EDIT: I've found the following:

""The name has a general appeal because it invokes in us something that we've all experienced at some time or another. The phrase also features in the bible in Psalm 127 verse 1""

ALSO: ""The LABOUR IN VAIN occurs among the trades tokens, and such a sign gave its name to Old Fish Street, which Hatton in his ""New View of London,"" 1708, p.405, calls ""Old Fish Street, or Labour in Vain Hill."" The sign represented two women scrubbing a negro; hence it was called by the lower classes, the DEVIL IN A TUB. ""To wash an Æthiop,"" is a proverbial expression, often met with in ancient dramitists[sic], for labour in vain.""

An Æthiop is an Ethiope/Ethiopian, or most likely any black person. I think this pub sign is becoming more uncommon now, but is certainly something I've seen before.

It's likely that your map is labelled as such because there was a Labour in Vain pub near there. Before literacy was widespread, pubs had signs with easily-recognised pictures out the front so that people could say to one another ""let's go to the King's Head/Dolphin/White Hart/Red Lion"" and everyone would know what they're on about.

false,B23vital,null,null,"I got beat to a sale of a property today. The person viewed a booking for the property i wanted, along with 5 others.
She put a bid in on the property i wanted the same day, as a cash bid. It was rejected so she put a higher bid in the following day for a higher amount and the seller accepted.
Now this is absolutely fine, as she is more than entitled to do so.
But my issue is, that as a first time buyer, i was unable to even get a booking with the bank before she had instigated a purchase of the property. 
A landlord does not need to do the background research that a new home owner does. Their research is mainly location and how much yearly yield the property could potentially generate. 
For me, i need to research the neighbours, the local area/amenities (school, doctors, crime rate ect). The landlord isn't interested in that as she/he isn't the one dealing with the problems that may arise.   
Also as a cash buyer it creates a better incentive for the seller, as the sale is made quicker, so long as the cash income can be proved. There is no real messing around with mortgages and banks, and makes the sale much quicker. 
She literally looked at 5 properties in a day, purchased the best one the following day, and i have no doubt it will be back on the market to rent within a month or two. 
Whats so infuriating is how quickly a landlord can purchase a property in comparison to first time buyers and people wanting to live in the home. Its annoying as hell that i can be pushed out of a bidding process, with no prior knowledge to someone that isn't going to live in that home. 
How am i meant to compete with people that are running a business, while im trying to find the place i will live for the next 10-20years. 
For me, buying a home is something i don't want to turn that into a mistake.

Okay, your points aren't wrong by any stretch but it is all uncomfortable and nobody wants any sort of discrimination towards them. 

It may be illegal but still happens! And it's illegal for a reason! Maybe there have been just as many but people were affected by it and were too ashamed to speak out about it. That's just an idea but some people really are that insecure.

I guess you are right about that last part but people don't get offended by hair colour, it's not like any blonde haired person ever used a ginger person as a slave because they were ginger, I guess it's just a less touchy subject. But like I said it's preference over a definite rule, if your usual type was a brunette, people wouldn't usually **only** not go out with someone because they seemed perfect but had blonde hair, for example. I don't know, but that really doesn't link with discrimination in my mind- I'm not really sure why. It's just not a big issue.

Bruising will heal but the costs of fixing are more annoying :/ After moving up to a bigger bike I got some RST leather jeans (Tractech Evo or something) no road rash but like you the bike landed on my leg. Don't regret spending money on half decent protection.

I've got some Triumph Kevlar jeans which are great because they look like normal jeans and come in three different lengths for each waist size. Though I rarely wear them when riding for fun.

Totally unnecessary spill since I stayed out riding on country roads in the dark. The only thing I've learnt is to de-risk winter riding since I'm still a 'new' rider there are so many more variables compared with summer riding. For me the bike is a toy and riding wet roads in the dark is probably one step too far. If it were a supermoto, the answer would be different.

Let me twist that. I'd love some discrimination. Discrimination that chooses me for positive reasons, like my gorgeous hair.

But I see what you meant, and no, no one wants that. But that is the choice of a society or individual as to whether they permit it. It shouldn't be up to the government. It would not take them long to go from stopping us from being offensive, to stopping us criticizing the current administration.

&gt;That's just an idea but some people really are that insecure.

So we should be protecting people because they are *insecure*?! God no. To take that to its bitter end, how long would it be before it was illegal to look at someone in case they took offence to it?

&gt;that really doesn't link with discrimination in my mind

I can see that you did it with ‘with’, but it isn’t how you primarily use semicolons. So forget the prep.phrase thing and just look at semicolons:

First and foremost: a semicolon can only connect two complete sentences. You can never use a semicolon where you could not also choose to use a period. http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/how-to-use-semicolons

I was trying to write out a breakdown of your sentence to explain prep. phases but the whole thing got unruly and confusing. So, just learn the semicolon rule for now :D  Check out Grammar Girl and Purdue OWL for help when you need it. They rock.

Check out the [Cowley Club](http://cowleyclub.org.uk/)... it's an co-op bookshop/cafe/venue. Lots of punk and hardcore shows there and it's also a great hub to meet people and hang out.  
[The Haunt](http://www.thehauntbrighton.co.uk/), [Sticky Mikes Frog Bar](http://www.drinkinbrighton.co.uk/stickymikesfrogbar), [the Albert](https://www.facebook.com/ThePrinceAlbert) (it's a great pub, with a venue upstairs) and the [Green Door Store](http://www.thegreendoorstore.co.uk/) all have a lot of gigs that should be right up your street. If you want bigger bands, [Concorde 2](http://www.concorde2.co.uk/) is a better bet.

So I was having a rubbish time and was basically going back and forth to the bar the whole time. I was pretty well oiled and so my memory of the whole incident is muddled, but I remember getting in some kind of confrontation at the bar with a local - a fairly well built young chap, probably a couple of years older than myself, who proceeded to grab me by the neck and push me against a wall. I'm fairly certain he had good reason to do this but for the life of me I can't remember what I did to him.

Anyway we both got chucked out via different exits, but somehow (and this is where my memory briefly fades again) I ended up in the car park with him and a few of his pals. I recall trying to leg it, and one of his compadres was urging me just to take my beating and get it done with, before moving off to block the steps back down to the SU entrance. There was another matey blocking the vehicle entrance/exit to the car park, so I was basically fucked. I'm absolutely bricking it at this point, frantic apologies are spewing forth from my drunken trap. 

Then I vaguely recall the first guy, who has worked himself up into a bit of a tizzy by this point, coming up to me. I take a swing at him which connected but did absolutely fuck all to stop him (I'm a pretty puny guy and he probably had at least 2 years and a couple of stone on me), then it all goes blank. 

Next thing I know is I'm lying on the ground in the car park and they've all gone - the area is deserted. I can't get hold of my mates as they're all still inside, so I stumble back into town, get home and go to sleep, waking up next morning with a jaw that doesn't want to open and that aches like fuckery.

I DO think that we're better at dealing with hunger on a national level than we used to be, but I still maintain that the stats from the food bank are correct, and it's mainly down to some seriously harsh policies from the government about sanctions and delays.  Many, (not you) keep saying how if you can't eat on £50 a week, you're not trying, but its a case of living on zero pence a week in many cases.

The fitness idea I'd consider being a sensible thing, again, so long as it's not mandatory, as it won't be right for everyone.

You're also right, I believe, about the damaging effects of long term worklessness, it doesn't have to mean that they're not doing anything useful with their time, but getting told on a pretty much daily basis, that you're not good enough, that others have been chosen before you, or that you didn't even warrant a reply to your application, well, that is going to break your morale over time.

I do think that we're nearing the point where the number of employed people is around the number of employed people we need however, and just artificially making up busy work jobs, just so they can be 'employed' isn't helpful, and I include workfare in that, as you don't even get the pride of earning a pay cheque.

Given the rise of food banks and zero hour contracts under the Tory government why wouldn't this occur under a UKIP government who wish to also revise employment laws in favour of employers: http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/ukip/ukip-business-spokesman-wants-to-abolish-workers-rights-3698

Heh thank you :). But are you sure you meant positive discrimination, as that's a whole different ball game entirely too? (For example, choosing a disabled person during an interview process because you need to boost your disabled employment numbers). http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/positive%20discrimination. Tbh I'm not sure where I stand on that one.

&gt;They haven't done anything but they get angry and intimidating men shouting at them for something they, most of the time, can't control. Please try and qualify that and tell me how exactly that leads to the government turning into a dictatorship

Dictatorship is a bit far. But I could do that as a thought exercise too! Not atm though.

Of course, that is awful. But to go back to your original point, you believe that because they are (quite understandably) hurt, we should prevent this behaviour at a national level.

So we petition the Government to limit our free speech rights so people can be prosecuted on the basis of 'shouting at people for things they cannot control'. Imagine that phrase as a piece of legislation. Someone goes down the street and has a racial slur hurled at them by an 'angry intimidating man'. That man gets fined/jailed/etc. Your legislation has worked.

Next week. Joe Reporter shouts across a Party HQ press event to Jill Politician to ask 'is your &lt;insert mental condition&gt; responsible for your decision to bomb Kibland?'. Joe consequently is prosecuted under the same legislation. Discussion of the bombing is thus stifled.

We could also apply the slippery slope argument. The fact that once a Government has powers, it tends to either abuse them or add to them slowly (see how broadly our Terror legislation has been applied).

To go back to my original point. It would be better, if people simply didn't take offence. Thus we wouldn't need such blunt instruments to ensure it.

Now, I like you, understand that living in a place where everyone is horrible to each other isn't pleasant. But I think where we differ is who is responsible for ensuring the place is pleasant. I don't believe the Government has any business in ensuring that. I believe society does. If in your example people are being given abuse, it would be societies job to let it be known that the behaviour is not tolerable nor welcome.

&gt;You've never felt offended? Never even that people were attempting to offend you? 

No. Not in memory, anyway. Sure I can tell when people are being offensive and/or trying to offend.

I'm not saying it solely relies on the government but it can't only rely on society.

Yes, I did GCSE RS, I know what the slippery slope argument is but I don't think that really applies here- the government already has the power, granted it's not always particularly effective, they know that they have the governing rule over the country and if someone disobeys the law they can be imprisoned in the name of that law, which the government put in place. You know, they do also have this thing called a judge and funnily enough, the judge judges actions and decides whether the punishment fits the ""crime"" and interprets the laws in the ways the seem to fit (just like Christians interpreting that Bible thing, a lot of them aren't going around telling all gay people they're going to hell but they make their decisions ""in light of the Christian faith""- another gold medal if you can guess who I was quoting).

You're right, if nobody got offended it would be fine! But obviously, life just isn't that simple.

That's the thing...

He couldn't 

He'd be stymied.

IDS simply does not have the power to rewrite the UK's constitution (nor would the judiciary allow him to, it's against the law)

Here's an excerpt from [Select Committee on Transport: Appendix 8](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmtran/748/748we10.htm) (Now this was a hearing in relation to parking tickets but the same principles in law would clearly still apply)...

&gt;APPENDIX 8

&gt;Memorandum submitted by Neil Herron on behalf of the Metric Martyrs Defence Fund ...

SNIP!

&gt;""... As no doubt members will be aware, on 21 July 1993, the Speaker of The House of Commons issued a reminder to the courts. Betty Boothroyd said:

&gt;""There has of course been no amendment to The Bill of Rights . . . the House is entitled to expect that The Bill of Rights will be fully respected by all those appearing before the courts.""

&gt;There is a provision in the Bill of Rights Act 1689 which states:

&gt;""That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of a particular person before conviction are illegal and void.""

&gt;This states that a conviction is necessary before a fine or forfeit can be imposed. As you will be aware, the Bill of Rights is a ""constitutional statue"" and may not be repealed impliedly. This was stated in the case Thoburn v City of Sunderland, the decision commonly referred to as the ""Metric Martyrs"" Judgment. This was handed down in the Divisional Court (18 February 2002) by Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Crane (I will paraphrase, but have included a copy of the judgment's relevant sections 62 and 63).

&gt;62.  ""We should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament: as it were ""ordinary"" statutes and ""constitutional statutes."" The special status of constitutional statutes follows the special status of constitutional rights. Examples are the . . . Bill of Rights 1689 . . .""

&gt;63. ""Ordinary statutes may be impliedly repealed. Constitutional statutes may not . . .""

&gt;This was upheld by Lords Bingham, Scott and Steyn in an appeal which went to the House of Lords on Monday 15 July 2002...""(sic)



So unless the Bill of Rights has been revoked (and we know it hasn't, -the judiciary would be up in arms if it had. ;) ) IDS would be stumped....



If someone appeals on grounds that sanctions are unlawful because the Bill of Rights makes it illegal, and they toss the appeal at 1st tier, then the appellant should ask for a 2nd tier appeal, and then a judicial review in the result of a 2nd tier dismissal of the appeal...

FWIW: Appeals are a right, the DWP cannot refuse an appeal, that would be an abuse of process because the appeals are a right (and therefore not subject to sanction ;) ).

I would suggest as soon as any self-respecting judge got jurisdiction, he/she would rule that sanctions are clearly a forfeiture of benefit. 

It's clear that all UK subjects have a *right* to benefits, and because the Bill of Rights states categorically *all* forfeitures prior to conviction are illegal and void, it seems entirely reasonable that benefit sanctions as framed under the current Act are unlawful as they are irrefutably forfeiture (of a right or part thereof) without a prior conviction.

If a person on benefits was sanctioned it'd clearly be worth a punt and it'd probably end up in the Court of Appeal as there's nearly a million people been sanctioned so far. 

If the judgement were the Bill of Rights *did* (and does) apply there's the repayment of all sanctioned benefit payments, so the Govt would be likely to defend it rigorously to save having to make 900,000+ humiliating (to IDS and Tory benefits policy) repayments.

In the 1960s after homosexuality was legalised, people said eventually gay men would be able to marry. They were scoffed at and told not to fall victim to the slippery slope fallacy. Hmmmm. So, after the debate happens for a few years, usually a consensus/middle ground is reached. So the radical progressives enter the debate deliberately setting their targets or demands too high, for example, wanting 0.5% of combat roles to be women. 0.1% is seen as a ""concession"", but still a victory. We must also consider that every ""debate"" that happens nowadays happens within the narrow framework of political correctness. To go against the current PC line of thinking is to risk your career or livelihood. So we aren't getting an accurate view of people's thoughts. If you oppose women in combat roles you are a pathetic misogynist, a perpetrator of continued historical injustice. If you oppose gays in the military you are a backwards reactionary homophobe. If you oppose gay people adopting children you are a heartless, homophobic bastard. Politically correct agenda sets the agenda and controls the entire narrative.

1.  The conversation in Blink was another causality loop.  Again, we don't have these in real life because time travel is impossible (into the past, at least)

2.  What's stopping them is the Doctor.  He could try and break the laws of time and it may or may not work, but if you had to make a decision and it could go one of two ways: 1.  The Ponds are fine and the TARDIS is fine and everything works or... 2.  The Universe ends and all life is sniffed out in a moment due to the space-time continuum being ripped apart... the Doctor chose to play it safe and it broke his hearts because of that.

Keep in mind, if the Time Lords were still around, then they could have reset the temporal loop and rescued Amy and Rory from the Angel feeding on them.  

the Doctor's ""death"" wasn't a fixed point in time due to the fact that the Kovarian Silence didn't know that the Tesselecta existed and could perfectly imitate the Doctor.  That was the little loophole that allowed the Doctor to escape that event.  

Finally, to your question about what's stopping them from pulling a Tesselecta with Amy and Rory is that it already happened.  They're not just stone slabs with their names on them, the bodies of Amy and Rory were under those graves.  The ONLY thing that could have saved them was if Rory didn't see the gravestone.  

The quantum nature of that information would have stayed in flux, Amy and Rory get on the TARDIS and bang, series 7 never gets a Clara.  

It was a reference to Schrödinger's cat.  Rory existed in a quantum state until he observed his own demise.  Then the timelines collapsed, the quantum flux solidified and the Angel zapped Rory back in time to feed off his potential energy.

You bring up very good questions, by the way, but that's the nature of the Weeping Angels.  They feed off potential energy.  All those timelines where Amy and Rory are fine and travel with the Doctor after the events of that episode were ""eaten"" by the Angel that zapped him.  What's stopping them from pulling off what you suggest?  The fact that the Angel is eating those events and, as far as we know at this point, there's no way to destroy an Angel, only freeze them in a state of quantum rigidity.

Why not? We have the mixed approach at present. But we're talking about doing away with ensuring conventional freedom from aggressive abuse through the Judiciary at all. Do you believe our country, given the type of people which exist within it, would descend freely into a place which regularly abuses people? It would be quite the reflection on your opinion of our society if you did, surely.

I personally don't think so. I am sure there will be plenty of people which did of course, but they as now, will be the minority. And they, as now, will rightly be shunned. A free society like ours is typically good at enforcing its own social norms. But we are also a nation which prides itself on the freedom of its citizens, within reason. Reducing our ability to speak, no matter how offensive it is, is a restriction on such freedoms (like all laws, of course).

&gt;leaving anything up to society doesn't usually end well 

Probably best not to use a work of fiction to demonstrate a point. But I see what you're getting at, however I am not advocating total freedom from law in all senses. Just in the sense of freedom to be offensive and that alone.

&gt;You know, they do also have this thing called a judge and funnily enough, the judge judges actions and decides whether the punishment fits the ""crime"" and interprets the laws in the ways the seem to fit

In your scenario of creating laws to stop further offensiveness, the judges would be interpreting legislation created by the Executive. While they have some ability to interpret legislation where it isn't clear, this can be extremely limited where the legislation is specific and the case clear-cut.

&gt;You're right, if nobody got offended it would be fine! But obviously, life just isn't that simple.

Well then. We're agreed! Naturally, it isn't as simple as that at all. But as a hypothetical goes, it is interesting to think about. It is nice to be able to talk about ideas like this, regardless of feasibility. (/r/HistoricalWhatIf, /r/FutureWhatIf). So thank you for taking the time to engage it with me.

It's due to what I call 'Tradition Dilution' in which traditional views dilute over time due to exposure to different ideas and discussion with less emphasis on these traditions and more emphasis on prosperity in the free market. Political correctness doesn't control the agenda it is what is used by people who wish to set the agenda and control it (only ever on social or economic issues that have social inputs).",0,1419125238,null,0,false,0,cn0xd0x,t3_2pvrhp,t1_cn0xd0x,t1_cn0wwfq,null,1425294766,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

false,Bend2Squares,newcr-1,Could Be Worse,"I'd be more inclined to have:

----------------Howard----------------

Coleman--Stones--Jagielka--Garbutt

---------Besic----------McCarthy-----

Mirallas-------Barkley---------Oviedo

----------------Eto'o-------------------

Bench: Robles, Baines, McGeady, Lukaku, Naismith, Pienaar, Alcaraz

If Stones, McCarthy, and Mirallas aren't fit enough to start, then put in Alcaraz for Stones, McGeady for Mirallas, and put Barkley next to Besic and Naismith behind the striker.

Howard's had a poor year, but who else are we going to put there? Robles? I don't think so. We need another keeper to challenge and eventually replace Howard. I've heard rumors of Loris Karius, which would be amazing, he looks like the next Neuer. That said, there's no way we're getting him in January. A keeper's going to be way too expensive in that window. Gonna have to wait 'til Summer. Howard for now.

Someone needs to replace Distin. I want it to be Stones, but if he's not fit, Alcaraz will have to do. He wasn't awful in what we saw from him this year (better than Distin). We need to get another young centre back in January. Who? No idea. I'm not a football manager, I'm an idiot.

I really want to see more of Garbutt, both because his performances so far have been quality, and because I think he's very handsome. We need someone besides Baines taking corners and Garbutt's are things of beauty. Baines need to be challenged.

Besic and McCarthy are the duo of the future. Barry's getting old, he should be a sub most days. He doesn't have the stamina to play 90 minutes every week.

People have commented on Coleman's mediocrity this season, and I think that has to do with the lack of a real decent winger playing in front of him. Mirallas's style on the left doesn't work with Baines, and I don't think it would work with Garbutt either. Coleman and Mirallas are a great combo.

Naismith's mega behind the striker, but I think Barkley's better. Naismith is tough, pushes forward, and scores goals, but Barkley opens things up and makes the rest of the team play better.

The left wing is the biggest problem area on the whole squad. Mirallas doesn't fit in there under our system, and Pienaar will probably die on the pitch if he plays more than a half. Atsu's obviously going back at the end of the year (though I've heard some calling for him to be sent back immediately). He hasn't been great so far, but I really want to see more of him. From what I remember, he looked good at the world cup. At the moment, if we want everyone else starting in their best positions, it's Oviedo, baby. I've always liked the guy, and he's played pretty well on the left wing in the past. If he's shit, sub Pienaar on for the last thirty minutes. We really need to bring in a proper left winger, and if Bobby's not going to play Atsu, it needs to happen in January.

I'm honestly least sure about who to put in the striker role. Contrary to popular belief, I thought Eto'o performed better against Southampton than Lukaku. Lukaku will have his confidence shaken after a performance like that, give him a week to get his composure together. I think Eto'o will play much better as a striker than as a midfielder anyway. And once again, if he's shit, put Lukaku in at the half.

That's what I've got to say. Keep in mind that I'm an idiot who knows nothing.",0,1419125386,null,0,1419125698,0,cn0xfa1,t3_2pw9py,t1_cn0xfa1,t1_cn0k01v,null,1425294737,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1
false,bloatyfloat,null,null,"Apologies for referring you to a non-existent manifesto for an election due in 6 months. Any policies discussed in the year running upto an election I tend to file mentally as manifesto, because, you know, if they get in, that's the last clue they gave about it.  I feel this is fair.

I'm not a labour supporter (disclosure, likely to vote Green in the next elections). I didn't say labour were perfect, I disagreed with the Iraq war, and I'd probably suggest that the economic debts were related to the global economic crash caused by, you guessed it, bankers gambling and losing.  Bailing them out wasn't cheap, but was chosen in lieu of what would likely have been an economic meltdown.  Labour were still more intent on protecting the less well off in society, compared to the horrific welfare cuts, ATOS checks, public sector workers pay - failure to keep in line with inflation.

Linking to a page is not an endorsement of the politics of the page, it was a simple link to facts, you're free to go off and counter it any way you want with facts, rather than questioning the politics of the site.

Now for your last points; if you don't have a manifesto 6 months before an election, then you are pretty much making them on impulse, especially if the heart of your campaign is abandoning Europe and it's human rights act, replacing it with your own that doesn't currently exist.  Who knows what the fuck they'll put in. They mention some vague things, sure, but why aren't they getting it written down? I mean they SAY it'll be pretty much the same as the EHR, right?

UKIP wish to change employment laws to protect the employer, not the employee.  So that's not really protecting the poor, is it? An increase in the tax allowances will doubtless be mitigated by cuts to welfare as part of their integration of welfare payments.

Women will lose maternity leave, men paternity leave. They might not have misogynistic policies now, but as you point out; no manifesto!  Their leader and members have certainly been caught on record making misogynistic statements (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11285529/What-woman-could-ever-vote-Ukip.html)

Can you explain to me how Grammar schools will allow the poor to earn more? For a start these are TARGETED primarily at middle classes and above, not the working classes.  What actual assurances have UKIP said (because obviously THEY won't have written it down) that the spaces in these schools will go to working class children? Any? I'd also like to take this time to say that I got a good education at a comprehensive secondary school, helped by the fact I was a relatively willing student.  

Just one last question; why is it acceptable now that UKIP had misogynistic policies in their previous election campaign? Everyone involved in that campaign gone now?

We'd love to educate English people for free but it isn't realistic, refusing is purely a budgeting decision. The EU requires by law that services provided to our own students are provided to EU students, so Polish people get the same free education opportunities. However, the EU doesn't really recognise the Scotland/England division and there are no laws about who of your own citizenry gets free education as that's internal politics stuff.

Foreign students we support because the cost is relatively negligible (£18m/y if I remember correctly), there are many barriers to entry for people coming from Europe. Language, culture, distance etc. No such barriers exist for English students, the system would be absolutely flooded if we opened it up.

The costs for English students would *not* be negligible, estimated somewhere around a £250m/y and it would cause the ratio of Scottish to English in our universities to tip. 

Remember Scotland isn't subsidised, so effectively you want us to educate your students for free, to the detriment of our own students as well as our own services even though you're 10 times the size and won't pay for it in your own country? It's just patently absurd and risks the whole system.

Now I *know* it was Scottish MP's that tipped the balance for raising tuition fee's in England and believe me **nobody** in Scotland appreciates the shower of cunts for that *but* at the same time as long as our funding is directly tied to yours our MP's should have the right to do it. They shouldn't fuck you over in the process but we're concerned this rushed EVEL thing is going to cut us out of things we should have some sort of say in.

I will acknowledge that Moffat has broken his own rules in the past but it's a tv show, not reality.  Also, don't bash Moffat too much as the Ninth Doctor almost got eaten by a bat creature for letting Pete Tyler live and then a few seasons later an alternate universe Pete Tyler pops up as Rose's new dad from another universe with no consequences.

false,Viking18,cnty-wales,Wales,"I think that /u/xu85 made a valid point, but failed to word it right. First, combat teams are tight, and the language is coarse. They'd probably need to watch it around females - ie, if that female has a vindictive streak, it's going to escalate,  and end up badly - remember that woman from the US airforce that made up a story about being raped on deployment and then went to the press? the airforce proved she was never even deployed, but the shitstorm still occured. 

Second, trust. Can the female be trusted to say, run across a hundred meters of ppen ground,  whilst under heavy fire, without any hesitation, in a live fire situation? Not according to any test ever published on the matter.

Third, the men worrying thing - That's a problem with society.  It's something that parents drum into their kids - don't hit girls. Stop other people hitting girls. Although that's something for someone more qualified to talk about. 

Other than that, sex, relationships, and jealousy.   Presumably, these would be banned immediately,  but the possibility they could exist is alone a legitimate reason to block women from being in a front line combat unit. But what happens if soldier A gets shot and soldier B is too busy crying to continue the mission? if A won't move because it means they won't be protecting B? what if C doesn't protect B because they had a thing for A but B, their best mate, shagged them first  causing jealousy and 3 members of the unit who won't communicate? Non-communication means death. Not immediately following orders means death. Conclusion: adding women to an all male combat unit is a bad idea. Historical data tends to back this, also. That's not to say that women on the front lines aren't a viable thing, though, just look at WWII russia.

They'd probably start by trying to change the system so it can continue. During the independence stuff there was discussion of this but there's nothing particularly solid because theres never had to be. If that doesn't work.. I don't know. Scrapping free university is basically not up for discussion in Scottish politics by any party (including the Tories) so some serious soul searching would need to be done.

&gt; Anybody from the EU can study in Scotland for free The EU population is a lot bigger than 10 times Scotlands size.

Right but there are barriers. Language, culture, distance, closer alternatives, weather even. English students have *none* of those barriers.

At any one time there is about 6,000 EU students in Scottish universities (if I remember correctly off the top of my head). Costs us £20m/y or thereabouts.

There are similar numbers of paying English students so effectively they pay for the foreign students while Scotland pays for its own.

Research into what would happen if English students got it free says we'd have up to 30,000 English students, cost us ~£200m/y and would take places from Scottish students. Same (or similar) research suggested that it's potentially an extreme enough situation to have the EU grant special exception to Scotland on the EU tuition rights laws, no other country deals with that proportion entering their system.

&gt; Because that is the intent of the EU legislation. EU citizens to get the same treatment as national citizens.

Scotland isn't *really* an EU member, the UK is and its government policy is to charge for university so that's the policy the EU demands be offered. What power the UK government chooses to devolve internally and what those devolved areas do with it isn't anything to do with the EU.

false,somebooksplease,null,null,"100% of the negative things said about one religion can be applied to them all in one way or another, these institutions have been around for long enough to have gone through multiple versions of beliefs - usually tempered over time to more moderate versions of themselves as all societies drift towards being more accepting of differences. 

Radical Islam does just as much harm  as fundamental Christianity to the world today,  and likely in the years to come we'll see and hear just as many terrible things about Scientology.

If you believe that one is dangerous then you cannot simply pick and choose which is good and which is bad, you have to accept they are all flawed methods of controlling a population. 

That said, religion and faith are different things.  Comparable, perhaps, to party politics and activism. 

Politics is a monolithic entity that is inextricably tied to our society, yet does not necessarily provide the best outcomes for us. 

Activists generally see a problem that they wish to solve, and look to exert influence on the world to acknowledge the problem exists and (sometimes) offer a solution. 

Personal faith is like that,  it doesn't require the financial backing of a religious entity to support it.  Personal faith, when non - toxic, is fine.  It's like supporting your local football club. It provides solace for those who need it,  it provides social interaction and community building.

In the end, organized/institutionalised religion when viewed objectively is exactly the same as political tribalism. Both forget that they have ideals when money and corruption are involved. The honest and worthy causes that any group can champion are lost along the way. 

Any group that is steered by greedy and corrupt people inevitably becomes greedy and corrupt.

Don't turn your back on the people who want to live their lives in their own way,  instead look for the people who gain most when religious/political tensions are thrown at us in the media and evaluate just what it is they are after. 

It's usually cash. And they won't share it with you.

&gt; -       Play from the back when possible, having knowledge of why we shift the press, how to play against various systems and all pressing styles

BR clearly loves playing from the back and relies heavily on CBs to keep possession and recycle the ball.

&gt; -       Play with width, depth and five receiving lines
&gt; -       Trade spaces through interchange and rotation
&gt; -       Have knowledge of how to drag opponents out of all defensive shapes
&gt; -       Create overloads and find the spare player

When we're firing on all cylinders (ala Tottenham, Bournemouth, and a lot of games last season) I can see these principles. Using Bournemouth as an example since it's fresh, our formation seemed to have 5 distinct  (Skrtel/Lovren/Toure-Lucas/Gerrard-Henderson/Markovic-Lallana/Coutinho-Sterling). The first goal was definitely cased by dragging the defense over to the left side of the pitch and then floating the ball over Hendo, who was the spare player.

&gt; -       Be comfortable receiving in all types of individual pressure
&gt; -       Be comfortable receiving in high pressure zones
&gt; -       Trust each other to play out of pressure

We've seen this a lot, for example, with Gerrard being the furthest man back last season (which led to you know what). The centerbacks are constantly entrusted with the ball in vulnerable positions.
&gt; -       Possess tactical flexibility in terms of movement and positions
&gt; -       Foster a system that allows for multiple players on higher lines whilst not being outnumbered centrally
&gt; -       Progress overloads in wide areas
&gt; -          Recognise where the spaces are
&gt; -          Promote a high focus on creating space through individual domination without the ball
&gt; -          Dominate all five 1v1 situations

Again, I think we see a lot of these in BR's philosophy, maybe not all in the exact same form, but I can see where Tim Lees's philosophy would fit in. Not sure about the other youth coaches though, but I'd imagine they would be similar.",0,1419136593,null,0,false,0,cn121l1,t3_2pvliu,t1_cn121l1,t1_cn0lqmz,null,1425292511,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;

&gt;__Ruby Wax__ (born __Ruby Wachs__, 19 April 1953)  is an American born, naturalised British comedian.

&gt;A classically trained actress, she came to prominence as a comic interviewer, playing up to British perceptions of the strident American style, which she replicated in the TV sitcom *[Girls on Top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_on_Top_(TV_series\))*. She also appeared in *[Absolutely Fabulous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_Fabulous)*, where she doubled as script editor.

&gt;Wax has since been in steady demand as an interviewer of celebrities, a game show contestant, and a supporter of Comic Relief and other charities. Her memoirs, *How Do You Want Me?*, reached the Sunday Times best-seller list.

&gt;A __color commentator__ (__color analyst__, __analyst__, __summariser__) is a [sports commentator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportscaster) who assists the [play-by-play announcer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator), often by filling in any time when play is not in progress.   The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action.  The color commentator provides expert [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis) and background information, such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), strategy and injury reports on the [teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team) and [athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson), and occasionally [anecdotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote) or light humor. Color commentators are often former [athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson) or [coaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport\)) of the sport being broadcast.

Not to mention RLC from the academy. i know it's not proven depth per say, but if mourinho wants to start placing his trust in our academy players that the club has put so much money behind developing these past 10 years, then buying older squad players isn't the way to go.

If this were Pogba we were talking about i'd reconsider, seeing as he's homegrown and a supremely talented young footballer who's proven his worth against senior opposition. But not a late 20's khedira.

Edit: forgot about Ramires, who obviously is another experienced player who can cover there.

as we saw today vs Crystal and over the past years, kolarov has the crossing ability that i believe is the best at city, with navas and milner close. the whip that aleks gets is unreal, especially on that left hand side. but again, as others here and in that quote, kolarov is slow. also, has a temperament problem when he doesnt get the ball for those crosses early and seems to always get a yellow card from a unnecessary tackle. much more physical than clichy. 

Clichy is much pacier, more attentive and aware defensively, he rarely gets carded. might be kinda slight for a defender but his pace and his leaping ability help with headers. 

overall, clichy's Defensive and pace prowess are more important on the wings when playing the big boys of Euro/Eng than the godly crosses of kolarov. however, it is no wonder that when behind, pelle has been known to throw in kolarov as a LM, to free him of his D responsibilities and get those whips into the box.",0,1419145626,null,0,false,0,cn15620,t3_2pxhhn,t1_cn15620,t3_2pxhhn,null,1425291054,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

We do know from observation on 7/7 that the emergency services and other priority individuals can effectively be given priority usage of the mobile phone networks, and also looking at where armed police were deployed on 7/7 gives some indication of what the government thinks are targets worth protecting -- national and local government offices, major police stations, BBC broadcasting studios, and probably key transport hubs (airports and major rail stations).

An old-fashioned mechanical accelerator (or gas pedal, for Americans) simply moved a very small throttle butterfly, and had very little feel. So when modern pedals started being connected to the ECU, there was no need to worry about the feel.

Whereas the clutch gives quite a lot of feedback through its feel. I imagine finding the biting point would be hard doing what you said - at least without some kind of assistance.

Interestingly, I believe Formula 1 cars work as you describe. They use paddles for gear changes, and the clutch is applied automatically - but for moving off, the driver uses an extra paddle-thing on his steering wheel to control the clutch.

As a long time Liverpool supporter, seeing Garcia lift the trophy with ATK just felt so, so right. We started out on a blaze, were immediately termed the favourites and on our way to glory.

Suddenly, the tables turned. Our main striker Fikru who had been amazing so far got an extended suspension. Garcia got injured. Our keeper Subhasish's performance dropped, so Edel stepped into goal. Everywhere, in street corners, cafes, pubs, offices, was one discussion. Something had to change, ATK were sinking like the titanic.

We held on, didn't lose heart and kept pushing. The free flowing goals got replaced by scrappy draws , but we picked up the odd points. We scrambled through to the knock out stages , being the last team to qualify, even thought we were on top of the league table a month ago.

We gritted our teeth in the semis, 180 laborious minutes of stalemate football where we just would not give up. It went to penalties and we clinched the victory. The dream finals were upon us.

Remember Edel in goal like I talked about? If there was a moment to shine, this what it. He went into Neur mode in the final. Kerela attacked and attacked and attacked while Edel kept making save after save after save. Going into the backfoot, ATK kept making counter runs, never giving up or stopping to believe.

Mohammed Rafique, a guy with 0 goals for ATK in the league was subbed in around the 80th. This was a man that had played just 20 minutes for ATK before, his second appearance in the league. Many people pointed out, desperate times called for desperate measures.

Barely 15 minutes later, he smashed in a curling header from the corner with 5 seconds remaining, the goal to make ATK champions in the inagural ISL season. The dream had come true. I remember screaming and jumping out of my couch when it went in and others did the same.

A small note about attendance. ISL brought back football love to India like never before. Kolkata has the biggest stadium and got some of the best crowds. I took a leave from office to catch the Kolkata-Pune game. Mind you it was a working day, normal match.

44,000 people turned up to see it. The final, in a 36,000 seater at Mumbai was packed to the brim.

The passion, the songs, the support, it might seem distant in other parts but for us at the games in Kolkata, it was like a premier league night at Anfield.

In the end, stories have a happy ending. So did ours. I'll leave you with our closing tagline that ATK used in Bengali (Kolkata's native language):

To address the question...I just don't know. I like the ending, and the episode itself is decent enough, but when you think about it it doesn't make much sense.

I'd have preferred it if the Doctor *didn't know* where/when she was being sent. Then she would have at least been 'lost' to him, that would have been pretty good actually. At first he doesn't know, but I think he finds out when he reads her note in River's book.

IMHO, they should have made the graveyard goodbye a little more final, and given Rory a goodbye somehow, and not have the epilogue note scene at the end. Then just leave it a complete mystery as to where they were and if they were OK. That would have been even more moving, and would have made more sense.

Correct the quarry you are shooting is also included.

&gt;The type of gun also depends on whether you're part of a club too.  You can easily get a low powered rifle and shotgun without too much hassle.

Correct

&gt;Pistols and semi automatic rifles HAVE to be kept in a gunclub (unless you have a ppw permit,  in which case you can get a low powered pistol).  

Incorrect, pistols don't have to be kept at a club, just in a gun safe. There are no legal limits on pistol calibre.
Semiautomatic rifles are easy to get and you can keep them at home but the maximum size calibre you can have is a .22 in rimfire. Which is quite small, but the .17 hornets are quite zippy. You can get other semiautomatic rifles if you get special permission from the Secretary of state.

&gt;The safety laws are well enforced and random unannounced checks are carried out by the police.  All ammo is also recorded by the gunshops when sold so if ya go in and buy a butt-load out of the blue the cops are sometimes notified.

We do have limits on how much ammunition you can hold, which is recorded on your certificate, so a firearms dealer isn't allowed to sell you more than what is on your certificate, and would be in his right to deny sale if he noticed there were quite a few sales in a short period of time. Each sale is recorded on your certificate.

&gt;In addition, firearm ownership can also make your house a target for break-ins, as happens all too often. 

Which is the main reason for that a gun safe is a requirement. ",0,1419162241,null,0,false,0,cn18fk2,t3_2pyp11,t1_cn18fk2,t1_cn18191,null,1425289531,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5

false,walgman,english,London,"I won a tribunal about 15 years ago. It was free back then. The employer in question used to just fire people at will because he knew virtually none of them would take it further. I remember sitting in the room being sacked and thinking see you in court. I was fired for being late on one occasion. Certainly not a case for summary dismissal.

I went alone to  the tribunal and I was initially confident I was going to win. Their barrister came to see me in my waiting room and I told him to his face I would beat him. I knew the law and I couldn't see how they could win. Also I wasn't presented with their statements until 5 mins before the hearing which caused me an issue. I basically only half listened to the proceedings whilst combing their statements for anything I could jump on.

However the questions and statements rocked me. A lawyer vs me wasn't the fairest battle but just when I thought I was out of my depth and going down I noticed an incorrect date on the bosses statement. I jumped on it. ""Is your statement incorrect, I want a yes or no answer?"" He wouldn't answer me so the chairman lowered his glasses and said 'if you won't answer Mr.Walgman you will answer me, yes or no or leave the stand'. The boss stuttered and the chairman dismissed him.

Various witnesses carried on calling me slovenly, late and lazy even smelly but then I produced a glowing reference which the boss had written for me not believing this would go to tribunal. I pointed out that the statements contradicted the reference and basically said either way I have proved my boss is untruthful. One of the bosses properly lost his cool and started shouting at me and calling me names. This didn't go down well. I remember the female member of the board giving me smiles of encouragement. 

Then the icing on the cake. When I won the time comes to calculate how much the payout was. I had been out of work for 11 months and had proof that I had applied for a few jobs. Again their legal team had nothing to say to the contrary so I literally got what I asked for. 11 months gross.

If you passed your car driving test prior to 1/1/1997 you will have Cat C1 on your license already. Anyone who passed their test after that will not.

Artics are C+E, rigids are C, 7.5t are C1. If you get Cat C it gives C1 entitlement. It also costs the same to do a Cat C and a Cat C1 course so there is no advantage to doing Cat C1. 

A bus for personal use would still require Cat D as that is for passenger carrying vehicles and is required because of what the vehicle is registered as, not what its use is. If you refit that bus to be a large mobile home it can be a bus or a lorry however it would need to go to DVSA to be reclassified and re-registered as a lorry if you want to drive it on Cat C. The only time you can drive a bus on a Cat C license is for the purposes of repair and testing, i.e you're a mechanic at a bus/truck garage.

Quotas were introduced to combat overfishing - I wouldn't be surprised if we had no fishing industry at all now, had they not been adopted.

That a Dutch ship catches so much of the British quota is due to the way the British government - that cunt Blair - allocated the British quota.

My understanding is that the Blair government dished out the quota amongst established fishermen, but then allowed those quotas to be sold and leased on the open market.

So the old boys who were reaching retirement were gifted a big asset - their fishing quota was worth even more than their boat, and they could sell it and go retire on the Costa Del Sol.

Younger fishermen, if their boat got repossessed because they had trouble making their mortgage payments, well, at least they were able to sell their quota and start a new trade.

So half this story is no more than capitalism - wealth accumulating in the hands of those who can afford to invest.

The other half is that overfishing is a real thing, not something the EU made up to make our lives more difficult - it has destroyed the fishing industries in plenty of other places, too, and we can't afford to ignore it.",0,1419164480,null,0,false,0,cn18sgt,t3_2pyn06,t1_cn18sgt,t3_2pyn06,null,1425289364,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;It's completely unreasonable to expect Scotland to have to support two countries.

""HE WAS clearly something special,"" Gareth Southgate recalls. ""He was more slim and rangy than now, but his physical stature was obvious. So was his talent. As youd expect, he trained well.""

Managers see scores of triallists and for Southgate, at Middlesbrough in December 2008, this one seemed too good to be true. In fact, he was Southgate found the young Serb was already promised to Chelsea.

""He came over with another youngster from [the Slovakian club] Kosice, but it turned out only the other lad, who we didnt want, was available,"" says Southgate.

That ""trial"" at Middlesbrough might be the only recorded instance of Nemanja Matic getting in a bad position. How Southgate would love to have signed him; Chelsea did, then let him go, then brought him back again. Now they wouldnt swap him even if Claude Makelele were 25 again.

Part bouncer, part middle-distance runner, part technician, part machine: Matic, 26, has spent the year redefining and upgrading the role of the anchor player in midfield. In the 2014-15 Premier League he has missed one game and its the only one Chelsea have lost.

Tomorrow Chelsea visit Britannia stadium, scene of a 3-2 defeat last December. That came at a point when Jose Mourinho was worried about his sides ability to balance attack and defence. No longer is that a concern.

Last years defeat by Stoke was also the last time Chelsea conceded more than twice in a domestic game. In 2014, theyve let in a meagre 21 Premier League goals. The return of Matic last January was a catalyst. ""Chelsea have a number of massively important players but hes the one they dont want to do without,"" says Pat Nevin.

There is a case for saying Matic has become the most important player in the Premier League. He gives the title favourites excellence in the exact department where rivals lack it. Matic is in his prime at a time when the deep midfielders at other clubs are aged or unproven or limited or, in Michael Carricks case, being used elsewhere.

And he is an all-rounder in a way perhaps no other in his position has been. ""Theres the holding role and the sitting player and the deep-lying midfielder. Everyone thinks theyre the same but theyre not. Theyre slightly different types,"" says Nevin.

""Makelele played the holding role. Carrick is a deep-lying midfielder. But Matic does everything. His tackling and closing down is phenomenal, but so is his passing. He doesnt play the ball sideways, but hits the through pass. Size-wise, hes brilliant and can become an extra centre-half. This season hes even added a few goals, which is ridiculous.

""Hes Makelele with bells on. If you were choosing player of the year in the Premier League so far youd have to think of [Sergio] Aguero but hes right up there.""

For all the discussion about Frank Lampards renaissance, Mourinho wont be unhappy about the transfer dealings that have brought him a midfield of Matic and Cesc Fabregas.

Mourinho characterised his team last week as having its ""own identity. We play beautiful football and thats what we want to do but we can compete with physicality.""

Only Manchester City blend toughness and loveliness the way Chelsea can. Matic is a former No 10. Its hard to imagine he would have been a world-beater there, but you can see why he played there.

""The deep midfielder who gets the ball and hits it 60 yards, like Steven Gerrard, catches the eye, but how about one who can break forward 25 yards then slip a pass through, like Matic? Not as spectacular but perhaps an even better skill,"" says Nevin.

When Martin Jol converted Carrick into a deep midfielder it was because he did not see the sense of having a player in that position given they get so much ball without penetrating passing. For Mourinho, Matic fits that mould.

""Matic is a football player. You can be a big guy and be a fantastic football player. You can be a big guy and not be physical or overly aggressive,"" Mourinho says. ""Matic plays. Look what he does on the pitch. He plays. A beautiful left foot. At this moment, the way Chelsea plays, we have no space for physical players without technical quality. We are a technical side.""

Southgate remembers the professionalism of the young player he encountered six years ago and such is Matics dedication the story goes that, when he played for a boys team in Serbia, hed walk the kilometre from his house to the practice ground doing keepy-ups. If the ball hit the ground hed go back and start the walk again.

See above. Other places I like are
Pompoko in the North Lanes/Pav area (Japanese)
Pizza 500 between Preston Circus and Preston Park
VIP (Very Italian Pizza), fantastic pizza and the sandwhiches are great too on homemade bread. Big portions cooked in a wood fired oven.
The Basketmakers arms for traditional pub food. Always seems to have a nice fish special on too.
Brighton Burger and Burger Brothers do great burgers.

Saver ticket via the mobile app, or a bicycle and a strong lock.

* Can you recommend a good/cheap mobile operator in the UK?

Either 3 or Virgin Mobile for sim only 1 month contracts.

The Jubilee Library has a good selection of fiction books and you can use the computers for free.

There's many charity shops about, and the lanes have some ""vintage"" or ""thrift"" type shops.

Bristol- nice, always loads of festivals and community things on, lots of nice greenery. Don't live in Filton, public transport is iffy and it's a bit too quiet.

Newcastle- jesmond is lovely, town is beautiful, public transport means greenery, jobs and the airport are all easily reached. Would move back up there in a heartbeat.

Glasgow- Partick and hyndland are nice but getting a wee bit crowded. Nice urban city, subway is good. Live in west or South.

Cardiff - feels quite small for a capital city, public transport isn't great but you can walk most of it, good nightlife, cheap to rent and buy property, lots of room compared to the others (parking never an issue), check out roath or cathays, some bits of splott are nice too.

Its European law to allow other EU countries to pay the same fees as students from that country. So anyone coming from the EU gets it free in Scotland, I'm sure they would charge if they could, just like student from outside the EU pay like 30k. England is in the same country, not another EU country so they don't get that privilege. Its the UK government that made you pay fees in england. So don't make this into a Scotland vs england thing.

So you finish the tutorial cave and get to the first city after a fight on the beach, and then every fight in the surrounding area just seems to insta-kill you (I assume this is what you're talking about). The first thing to do is to recruit Jahan (from the library) and then one other companion (you can find them outside the legion headquarters, in the tavern or in the tunnel under the graveyard). Next do as much of the murder mystery plotline as you are able, and pick up a spade so you can go to the graveyard and dig up corpses for easy one-on-one fights. Jahan is really useful because he starts with a teleport spell and can crowd control enemies if you get in over your head.

Hopefully you can pick up a couple of levels in Cyseal and begin to expand outwards from the town. The North (I think) gate is the best to start with; there's a safe-ish fight with three ghouls and some bears and wolves in the forest nearby. If you're really struggling you can cheat - start a fight near the town then run towards the guards while still in combat (remember to use Jahan for cc if things get out of hand). The guards will eventually turn hostile to the monsters chasing you but you still get the items and experience for the fight.

This can help avoid even going to a tribunal, mean agreements can be arrive at between employer and employee and also sifting out the weak cases. 

Also, the role of insurance within the legal sector was slightly underplayed. The article mentioned insurance for employers but not employees. It can be obtained either through unions of home insurance and can provide initial advice and support - again to hopefully help avoid legal action - but also cover legal fees.

Because Scotland is the one demonstrably behaving in a prejudicial manner against a specific *people*. It is the fact that it is excluding a specific people while preferring another which is the problem. 

&gt;The system works fine why should they change it because the rest of the UK students are offended?

Forgive me for straw-manning. But as long as something works that is *ok*? If enslaving an entire nation works for me, is that *ok*?

But they shouldn't change it because of any offence. They should change it because its prejudicial, a slap in the face, and unfair.

&gt;Why shouldn't England just not charge like any sane country?

How is this relevant? England's educational policy does not treat Scotland any different to any other Home Nation or EU state, why does Scotland?

&gt;This problem is created by England charging for uni.

Is it? If Scotland were to do as I proposed above. Would the problem still exist or not? You have not addressed that idea whatsoever despite it solving the issue of prejudice and fairness while maintaining preferential treatment to Scottish students.

&gt;The Republic of Ireland isn't a part of the UK nor does it share a currency, no one wants to go there.

But your point was you don't see ""the English"" flooding other EU states due to their cost. Ireland doesn't cost. Currency is irrelevant in this case. But it is English speaking and has none of the factors you earlier listed as being detrimental to ""English students"" studying abroad.

&gt;no one wants to go there.

Offensive to the Irish I imagine, but factually accurate. Lets look at a hypothetical based on that...

If SoAS charged £5000 a year to American students, but £9000 a year to Malaysian students, simply because there was more Malaysian students than American students wishing to enrol, is that *fair*? How long do you think it would take before that policy is challenged legally on the basis of race?

It is also not far from the Gower Peninsula (the first AONB in the UK) and is on the coast so has easy access to the Wales Coastal Path (a walking / cycling path that follows the entirety of Wales' coastline).  Travel a bit further and you can go to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, or Snowdonia National Park.

Wales also has the most Castles per square mile in the World if you're in to that (I mention it because a lot are in the countryside), and there is also a great deal of Industrial Heritage in the area.  Also, Cardiff is affordable, the transport links are OK (direct trains to London and Manchester, and it's Eastly in Wales so not too far if travelling to family or whatever in England).  The people are generally friendly, and it is an amazing place to be when the Welsh Rugby team hammers another international team in the Millenium Stadium.

The housing market is insane, but I think this is more due to the effects of speculation than due to immigration. I disagree that the rental market is completely detached from the housing market as when house prices increase, it forces more people into renting than buying as people can't afford a mortgage. Buy to let also has upwards pressure on rents when house prices rise as the landlords need a return on their investments.

With respect to integration and mass immigration (which we need to prop up our services/industry), I think, as you mention that inequality is a serious problem, and I suggest focusing on this will bring greater success than nearly anything else, and there are no parties on the right that plan to combat this.

I mean, even if we could have all the benefits of being in the EU and sensible immigration controls, that pales in importance compared to the effects of thing like inequality in terms of keeping things 'muddling along' hence why I believe that the whole immigration debate is distracting people from the more important issues.

First off, we have the impatience of a fool. 

&gt;Apologies for referring you to a non-existent manifesto for an election due in 6 months

Please could you refer me to the 2015 manifesto's of the other parties  then. You can take what the parties say as their manifesto policies, and yes that would give a general, but subject to change idea of it. I cannot find the manifesto's for the main parties for the 2015 elections.

&gt;if you don't have a manifesto 6 months before an election, then you are pretty much making them on impulse,

Similar to the other parties, no?

&gt;Can you explain to me how Grammar schools will allow the poor to earn more? For a start these are TARGETED primarily at middle classes and above

I did not state that grammar schools would allow the poor to earn more money. I said no taxation on the minimum wage would do so. Grammar schools are currently targeted at the middle classes and above, because there are so few of them around, which drives the housing prices up in the area etc. Having grammar schools all around the country, making them common, would mean that it's available to everyone, not just the kids with wealthy parents.

&gt;Just one last question; why is it acceptable now that UKIP had misogynistic policies in their previous election campaign? Everyone involved in that campaign gone now? 

It isn't acceptable, and rightly the manifesto has been scrapped completely. In four years, the party has went from 3% in 2010 to 15%-20%ish. They have made huge changes in their party, they won a national election, the first party to do so in 100 years. UKIP aren't the same party they were in 2010.

There will be no reduction in crime for ordinary citizens who have no interest in drugs...It's people addicted to drugs who commit the majority of crime that affect these people. Housebreakings, thefts etc

You want drugs legalised so you can take them, or your mates can  take them. Don't pretend you're doing it for the good of normal people. Normal people will feel absolutely no difference to society post legalisation of drugs.

Legalisation would improve the health of addicts (due to a regulated supply), but it could mean that even rehab would fail and they get stuck in addiction (much like alcoholics) - I see this as an acceptable loss (these people chose to engage in drug use) given the reduced expenditure of law enforcement and reduced criminal activity due to drug gangs.",0,1419180176,null,0,false,0,cn1cy6r,t3_2pyy16,t1_cn1cy6r,t1_cn1cowe,null,1425287354,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

Wasn't it in 1912 the British Navy switched from coal to oil?

 ... And wasn't it in 1913 the German Navy also switched from coal to oil?

Wasn't one of the first British deployments of WW1 to send the 2nd battalion of the Dorset regiment and 51 other divisions to Basra to protect the UK/US oil fields?

Wasn't WW1 all about stopping the Germans building the Berlin to Baghdad railway and thus preventing them breaking the Anglo-American oil cartel?

QED the bullshit you got taught at school just doesn't ring true when you look at the bigger picture (and of course *knowing* that the victor *always* writes the history, it seems clear what you learned was *just* propaganda made to look like it *was* history)

Just throwing it out there, y'know ...  ;)

Depress it right to the floor, put the car into gear, release the handbrake and then, millimetre-by-millimetre (or as close as you can manage), release the clutch.  As you approach the biting point you'll feel things start to engage, and then the car will start to creep forwards.  You shouldn't need any gas at all, on a level road.  Try to refine your ability to gauge this point, so you can stop and start the car with minimal clutch movement.

This ability will be extremely useful when creeping in traffic jams, or when approaching blind junctions, or for hill starts.  It also makes a huge difference to the smoothness of your gear changes.  Frankly, refined clutch control is an incredibly useful skill and is definitely worth an hour or so of feeling like an idiot creeping along a road at slower-than-walking pace.

At present you're stalling, which is probably because you're nervous.  It's quite common to feel less at-ease when driving with parents than with professional instructors.  You should get used to stalling -- it's quite common for learners, especially when you do hill starts at traffic lights in busy conditions.  The most important lesson is to remain calm.

Do you think this is helpful? Giving something a social stigma prevents people (in this case, drug addicts) from seeking help when they need it. Also the idea that drugs are hard to acquire because of prohibition, and that there aren't legal alternatives that are *even easier* to acquire and a lot of the time more harmful than the illegal drug they are meant to mimic, is imo laughable. 

Some reading to put this in context:

Decriminalising is a half-arsed way of doing it which will only endanger more people. We have to go all the way on this.

Also,

&gt;making addictive drugs readily available and removing any stigma from society.

We already have highly addictive and dangerous drugs completely legal in this country, with little stigma attached. Tobacco and alcohol. They are far more dangerous than many of the currently illegal drugs out there.

Why fight the stereotype and the media? Sure they can put pressure on self-image and sexuality, but there's nothing stopping me from letting a boy prefer pink from blue.

Instead of stepping on egg shells trying to provide 'gender-neutral toys' and a 'gender-neutral upbringing' (whatever that means), just let them decide what they want. It's really that straight forward.

This idea wants to encourage tolerance by advising everyone to just sit on the fence. That doesn't work at all; you can't just meet in the middle to avoid being in a certain crowd. That's like dressing all boys and girls the same. Forget buying dresses because that wouldn't be fair on boys, forget blue, because that's too damn masculine.

Just bring them up to be happy, who the fuck gives a shit about anything else? If Spider-Man is cool for a girl then fine, and if she gets insulted by it, it's not because the other kids have had a one-sided upbringing, it's because that's how Spider-Man toys are marketed. The blame isn't wrong parents or arsehole kids; it's the adverts exclusively targeting genders.

Not just Elliot Lee up  front, but Sean Maguire (out on loan), Paul McCallum, Jaanai Gordon and Kieran Sadlier. They've all been prolific for the U21s these last couple of seasons, and were prolific as U18s. As well as that in the U21s there is Nathan Mavila on the wing, Moses Makasi and Amos Nasha in defensive midfield, Kieran Bywater in attacking midifeld (he scores a lot, too), central midfielder Josh Cullen, another winger in Dymon Labonne (who has been injured recently, sadly), and then of course Matthias Fanimo, Seb Lletget and Blair Turgott. Then defenders Danny Potts, Leo Chambers and Reece Burke, all on the verge of the first team, and Sam Westley, Lewis Page and Kyle Knoyle, who all could step up pretty soon.

And there's more - the U18s. Goalkeeper Sam Howes, defenders Reece Oxford and Tunji Akinola and Vashon Neufville (these three are in the U16s technically, but oh well), defender/midfield Josh Pask (recently signed a pro contract), have all been in the news lately. Not forgetting other defenders such as Emmanuel Onariase, Alex Pike and Oscar Borg. Then talented midfielders such as Noha Sylvestre, Grady Diangana, Marcus Browne, prolific strikers such as Jordan Brown, Jeremiah Amoo, Djair Parfitt-Williams, U16 striker Jahmal Hector-Ingram, I can name much more.

Instead of leaving them to play regularly for the U21s, why not loan them out? Yes, first team experience at a Championship/L1/L2 club could do them quite well. It doesn't harm to loan out quite a few - some clubs loan around eight out. Seeing as we have such a talented and prestigious academy, why not do that?

And regarding releasing of players, yes. They don't go to Dagenham and Redbridge. Oh no. AFC Hornchurch, Canvey Island, Concord Rangers, Billericay Town, Bishop's Stortford - they've all got quite a few ex-academy players. Some recent released players (not Collison or Sears) are doing alright. Nana Boakye-Yiadom will be breaking into Barnsley's first team pretty soon, Courtney Homans and Thomas Gogo are both regulars in AFC Hornchurch's first team (Non-League, I know, but they've played really well).
