This a thousand times over.

But I still think he uses his body very intelligently for a modestly talented player.  He does run and lose the ball a lot, but like I said, he often buys our team time.  He might run and run and then fuck it up, but Lamela often just dives straight to fucking it up, losing the ball before our team even has time to transition from defence to attack and back again.  Usually when Kane loses the ball, it's much further up the pitch and less in danger of coming straight back at our defenders again.

I think our first choice XI ideally has Lamela in it, but he needs to get much smarter with what he does and doesn't try to do when he gets the ball.

&gt;Is Europa League that important?

This depends on who you ask.  If I had to guess most big 4 supporters (and Spurs) couldn't care less about Europa.  However I find it to be a great competition and especially with the new rule that the winner gets CL, makes it more of an incentive to win.  If we were constantly in and out of Europa for the better part of a decade then I might change my mind but for the foreseeable future I hope we always make it and try and win it.

&gt;Why can't they seem to transfer that energy to league play?

Once again everyone has their opinion on why this is true.  However history tells us that most EPL teams that compete in Europa don't do well domestically.  IMO it is because of fatigue.  Soccer takes a lot out of you and I can't imagine what playing 90+ minutes of top level competition does to one's legs if you have to play multiple times a week over the course of several months.  Not to derail this but this is why (IMO) the English national team will never do well at the WC, their players are just too tired at the end of the year from not having any extended breaks and playing in a more physical league.  And also why Arsenal has always started out hot and cooled off as the year goes on.  You have to have depth which most EPL Europa qualifying teams do not have.

As someone who used to play in a similar position, I'm always looking at how our players perform in the middle of the park, specifically defensively-which is why I'm at times critical of yaya. Fernandinho had an amazing game, yet again..

Yaya played quite well also. Navas worked extremely hard, he's a very tough player.

Jovetic always links up well..he's more of a 10/second forward than a striker.. he's definitely a good player, but I'm still not quite sure if he's the type of player to rely on with European ambitions. Hopefully I'm wrong, still feel as if he's a bit too predictable with his one-two's and his constant checking to the ball and running into other people's space.  He forces things a bit too much for my liking.

No need to talk about aguero..we all know how great of a player he is. We are incredibly lucky to have him, our best purchase in the mansour era along with Silva.

The Doctor does not have a job at all.  All of his traveling is brought on by his love of adventure and compulsion to never stay long in one place.  The reason that he helps people on his journeys is because he has a kind heart and feels that it's the right thing to do.  However, in no way does he seek out disaster.  The TARDIS, on the other hand, is a different matter.  There have been numerous occasions over time where it has sent him to places where his help was required.

There are a lot of reasons why the Doctor might have disliked the notion of having a new family.  The one that most closely applies to the instance you described is that it would be unfair to him, as human lives are so short when compared to his own.  You bring up the example of his companions, but there is a big difference between a friend and spouse.

The whole Doctor-companion romance thing is basically an aspect of the show during and after the revival.  It's something that happens to the younger-looking incarnations of the Doctor, but not to the older-looking ones (most of the time).  Since the Doctor has looked middle aged or elderly for most of the show's duration, romance has not been an element for very long at all.

As far as sharing his exploits with the rest of the universe goes, there are a number of reasons that the Doctor doesn't do it.  First of all, to say he doesn't is a bit of a stretch.  For many years now, the Doctor has worked on and off with an organization called UNIT (I won't say whether or not UNIT ever shows up post-revival).  When he works with UNIT, the Doctor is willing to give them any amount of knowledge based on how he feels they will make use of it.

Outside his relationship with UNIT, the Doctor has no real allegiance to any specific group in the universe.  He is basically independent.  Even his loyalty to his own people was questionable at best.  So no, he doesn't really share his discoveries with anyone.  But that's probably not out of selfishness, it's more likely because he doesn't want anyone to misuse the knowledge he can give, and/or doesn't ever think of sharing with anyone.  Honestly, the latter is the most likely.  It may not seem like it from where you are now, but the Doctor is really quite absent-minded.

I can't give too much advice on becoming accustomed to the characters, other than to say you'll get used to the flow of faces in and out of the show after a while.  It also gets better once you're caught up with the show due to the greater amount of time between episodes.  I might also point out that so far you have seen a lot of characters who were on for a very short amount of time.  The average tenure of a companion is about two seasons (in contrast to Martha's one), while the average tenure of a Doctor is about four (in contrast to Nine's one).  While this may seem like nothing next to shows where characters regularly last over five seasons, it's certainly better than having them disappear after a single season.

I think you should keep watching Doctor Who, but then again I may be a little biased.  Whether or not you stick with it is your decision, but in my experience, this show typically works like this.  You don't really get it until you watch it.  Once you watch it you start to get it, but with every episode you get it a little more.  And the more you get it, the more you like it.  So I believe that if you keep watching this show, a time will eventually come when you really do like it.  The question you need to answer is whether or not it's worth the time it will take to reach that point, and that's up to you.  If you're unsure, I suggest that you keep watching it (maybe break it up a bit with an older episode or two to give you a wider perspective on the show as a whole) and maybe you will find your answer that way.",0,1417666065,null,0,false,0,cmknb11,t3_2o0whq,t1_cmknb11,t3_2o0whq,null,1425690965,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Councils are (sort of) responsible for education in their areas. Traditionally they run the state schools, although the money for that is given to the council by central government, it doesn't come out of council tax.  And central government (specifically the DfE) also sets overall education policy, things like the national curriculum. However the council can still set broad aims for its schools, and is responsible for hiring a headteacher.

However schools that have become Academies, or been set up as Free Schools, get their funding direct from the DfE, so cutting the council out of the loop.

Colleges are still generally council-run, although sometimes a few neighbouring councils will get together for provision of education at this level.

And social care. Councils are responsible for social care of their residents, including social workers, community mental health provision (jointly with a local NHS Trust), and care of the elderly and socially vulnerable.

false,MorboDestroyer,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire is where the heart is,"A member of staff was purportedly assaulted and the police were called, fair enough. However, the police response to this was incredibly heavy-handed when you consider that the protesters weren't warned that the police were coming or supposedly why the police were there. Surely it would have made sense for security to point out who assaulted their member of staff and then the police explain what had happened; then and ONLY then with a refusal to surrender that person should they have been met with intervention. 

However, throwing someone around like that policeman does, by their neck and hair is completely uncalled for, in ANY situation, except ""life-or-death"" and the use of a taser (as other people have pointed out unholstering it AND discharging it constitutes a ""use"") is well beyond a proportional measure of the situation presented within the videos, especially as it is a potentially lethal weapon, though relatively safe. 

You have five policemen there, against 20 or so protesters; there are far, far more protesters to police at protests in London, and the policemen here should have been able to keep their cool, as that is what they're paid to do! 

The students themselves were in a section of the university that's open to the public, and they weren't blocking any fire exits; a few photos have surfaced of where they're sat, illustrating they're not blocking any particular section of senate house. 

In addition to this, security were, supposedly, blocking the students from exiting the building. 

My two cents: TL:DR: staff member was assaulted and police were called, however, police handling of the situation was grossly inadequate ESPECIALLY from officer baldy, and the video is a bit biased although the students weren't blocking any fire exits.

As for why films like 50 Shades of Grey have never been affected by these restrictions, the BBFC guidelines aren't actually as strict as some are implying. The relevent sections:

&gt; The following content is not allowed
&gt;
&gt; The infliction of pain or acts which may cause lasting physical harm, whether real or (in a sexual context) simulated. *Some allowance may be made for moderate, non-abusive, consensual activity.*
&gt;
&gt; Sexual threats, humiliation or abuse *which do not form part of a clearly consenting role-playing game.* Strong physical or verbal abuse, even if consensual, is unlikely to be acceptable.

Look at John Lennon, the CIA did NOT like John Lennon, one of the biggest stars in the world, talking shit about the US and the Vietnam war and challenging the system and speaking out against the establishment, because they recognised the potency and power of his celebrity was far greater than any politician and immediately understood the risks should his millions of followers copy him like they so often do because he is an idol. 

Idols are dangerous because they can influence people. Look at someone like Malcolm X when he waved a crowd away and the police man said ""that's too much power for one man"". Right then they knew Malcolm was a risk and Malcolm should be taken out and silenced as fast as possible 

It doesn't matter if Russell Brand doesn't have solutions or anything else, he is a celebrity who has a lot of influence over people, especially young people, and him encouraging ""smashing the system"" is dangerous and people do NOT want celebrities like brand going on TV and going on question time and going on tour and propagating his anti-establishment sentiment. No politician in the world is ignorant to the power of celebrity endorsement 

People like brand are dangerous and a threat to the system merely by speaking like he does and propagating himself as someone who speaks out against the establishment. It doesn't matter if he's not offering solutions or actually telling people ""go do this"", him merely speaking about it makes him dangerous, because he is a celebrity and he's on TV and no prime minister in the world would see someone ""cool"" and famous like Russell Brand on TV propagating an anti-establishment worldview on TV and not immediately acknowledge the dangers and risks of him and his views becoming popular and influencing people 

People like Lennon and Brand who talk about revolution and can influence millions of pent up teenagers with the wave of a finger are always considered a threat and routinely crucified in the media and have their characters assassinated to make their attitudes and opinions unpopular. 

Like how people avoid being skeptical of the government so they don't get lumped in with ""tin foil hatters"" or the examples made of occupy and pussy riot, brand is the perfect example to raise up and smash down in the public eye to set an example and squash dissent by making it unfashionable and socially toxic 

It's not about brand, it's about personifying the anti-establishment movement through Brand by making him an example and the face of the movement, and then squashing the movement by assassinating the character of the example, discrediting their sanity, pummelling the face of the movement and creating a piece of propaganda which causes people to distance themselves from the example and everything the example represents by making them unfashionable, socially toxic, mentally unhinged and a laughing stock",0,1417680958,null,0,1417682020,0,cmksls3,t3_2o54wx,t1_cmksls3,t1_cmjx4uq,null,1425614610,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I will instead suggest that more charismatic leaders, who appear decisive and different (even when there may be evidence to the contrary) attract voters and admirers from all parts of the spectrum.

I think it's downright bloody stupid to compare Farage with Hitler; it's ignorant and foolish, and gets us nowhere. It would be more meaningful to look at contemporaries rather than historical outliers. I would say that another modern day policitican who attracts the same support but also has his detractors would be dear old Bozzer himself. Johnson is also charismatic, claims to be different, but is still very much a part of the establishment and has also been the target of criticisms similar to Ickle Niggle.

Bear with me.

Both Farage and Johnson are very conservative politicians, darlings of the neolibs but old-school enough to attract the Telegraph harrumphers. Both have questionable viewpoints with regard to some sections of society. Both are outspoken enough to be seen as rebels. Both know how to play the media game, and both are able to bluster their way out of public mistakes. The neolib dream ticket would undoubtedly be Nige and Bojo together, but their respective egos clashing together would end in disaster.

The loyal Tories would dearly love Boris to pick up the pieces from Cameron's train wreck, but the revolutionary, reactionary Tories would quite happily have Nigel dismantle the party from outside, then rejoin a more traditionalist, conservative Conservative party.

I don't think you are similar to the suporters of the nazis, I don't think other Kippers are, either. I see the majority of UKIP supporters as modern-day Thatcherites, desperate for a figurehead as charismatic as Lady Margaret of Hagton to lead them out of the EU and back to some rose-tinted view of Britannia that never really existed in the first place. With Bojo and Nigel both competing for the Thatcherite support it means that the Tory party itself is splitting itself into several pieces as it can't decide which is the lesser of two evils.

Joe, I disagree with many of your views and posts but don't let others tar you with the nazi brush. You've certainly got a pretty thick skin I've noticed, long may it continue.

false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"Well, Sweden is very different to the rest of Europe in many regards. Here they are very isolationist, but love to put on this front of being progressive and liberal. The underlying political mood has been Socialist for many years, but their model of Socialism suits closed borders and a static infrastructure better than one that is constantly being challenged.

Their system was fine while the population remained constant, but now that the population is increasing the system has not. There are 6 people in my office, three of them are Swedes. In addition to the sole Brit (me) there is a Pole and an Italian. My laboratory also has a Turk, a Sri Lankan, another Pole, four more Brits and two Germans. The Swedes may mutter and grumble during *fika* but as long as we make an attempt to speak Swedish it's not too bad. But while the company is becoming more international / multicultural / whatever it is worth pointing out that private firms have always been more adaptable than public.

So it's no surprise to me that the Sweden Democrats (the UKIP equivalent) are gaining ground rapidly. They have a charismatic leader (who has recently taken a break for a few months due to nervous exhaustion) and appeal to the more traditionalist sections of society. However should Sweden close their gates the large multinational companies that make up the bulk of industry here would in all likelihood bugger off back to Germany, the USA or the UK leaving just Volvo and Indesit to prop up the economy. OK, that may be an exaggeration (sp?) but those are the arguments that Big Businesses are putting forward to try and stop the swing to the right.

Finally, the headline is a bit misleading. The Sweden Democrats didn't bring down the coalition government here, what happened was that the entire house failed to agree on the budget and so Löfven called the election. Where the SD's came in was that they offered to vote for the budget if Löfven did a deal with them and invited them to join the coalition. Löfven refused, and so the budget wasn't passed.

false,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"It's less that he is anti-Monk and more that he is loyal to Laudrup. A lot of Laudrup's signings, particularly the Spaniards, ended up becoming very cliquey and we found ourselves with a very divided dressing room. Not necessarily in a hostile manner either - it just wasn't a whole club spirit that we had. 

Laudrup struggled with man management, it seems. That's why Ki and Bartley were shipped out on loan - the rumour is that Ki was sick of being played with no allowance for attacking play (as well as being banned from attending a charity event in Korea while not being selected), while Laudrup and Bartley's dad had an alleged bust-up over the player's future - I think the issue was he wasn't even getting cup minutes. 

Now you could argue that Monk too has man management issues as he shipped all the Laudrup boys out rather than get them on board... But then again, the end result is that we're higher in the table and have a whole squad unity, so in terms of end result Monk has played the situation well. 

I suppose that's an inherent flaw inking signings based on the reputation of your manager - you can draw them in to play for Laudrup, but you can't necessarily hold them when he leaves. Monk certainly has a reputation in the game (it's not like the football community doesn't get to know each other in ways you wouldn't expect, like for example how Rangel went to watch the European Super Cup with Barcelona players), but his signings are made more on selling the club to players rather than the manager. Michu came to Swansea because Laudrup was a footballing idol to him - Siggy came back to Swansea because he knows the football we play and the general club culture we have.

Of course this isn't a hard and fast rule - Amat was a Laudrup Spanish signing but has got his head down and gets on well with the new regime - I wonder if it might be because Rangel took him under his wing rather than falling in with Cañas and Pozuelo... I also know he still gets a lot of support from his parents so that might help him make more grounded decisions.

The thing that people aren't accepting is that the club already do set money aside. Yes, tickets are expensive, but every game is still almost an instant sell-out. There are people who are paying money to be on a scheme where they can get tickets and they *still* struggle to actually get their hands on any. And the club will absolutely have the data and know this. 

If the club was really just working on ""what's the highest price we can charge and still sell out Anfield?"" then the prices would be a good chunk higher than they are, because it's obvious that demand is way higher than supply right now. There are still hundreds if not thousands of people for every game who want to get tickets, at current prices, and can't get them.

There's already a reasonable cut on the ticket price from what it *could* be, the argument from SOS is that the cut needs to be more. Which is fair enough, in my opinion. But claims that the club are cut-throat and just squeezing every last penny they can from supporters is definitely wide of the mark, because they could be bleeding out a lot more if they wanted to.",0,1417686547,null,0,1417687530,0,cmktrre,t3_2o6a1v,t1_cmktrre,t1_cmkh661,null,1425614064,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

It's not football without beer, says German league chief 


HELMUT SANDROCK, the general secretary of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DfB), has urged Scotland's administrators to copy the three-point Bundesliga blueprint to football success. 

The economies of scale between the nations of Scotland and Germany are hardly the same, but safe standing areas, modest ticket pricing and selling alcohol within stadia are all part of the formula behind the buoyant German football culture which propelled Joachim Loew's side all the way to become world champions in Brazil this summer.

I am not quite sure what the average price is in Scotland but our average ticket price is €25, said Sandrock, addressing the SFA convention at Hampden. The Bundesliga, if I am right, is the only top league which allows people to stand at low prices, which allows people with not so much money to follow their teams. This is part of our culture and part of our success in Germany.
 
When I see this famous south tribune in Dortmund, it houses approximately 30,000 spectators, and all of these spectators pay, I don??t know, €150 or €180 a season, so per match that is €10 or €12. This is still a big amount of cash for sure so Dortmund are able to improve. But German clubs get most of their money from TV, not so much from the fans.
 
Consumption of beer within the packed German stadia is permitted, apart from certain matches which are classed as high risk. Such a model, exempting powder-keg fixtures such as Old Firm games, would also seem a reasonable way for Scottish teams to increase their revenue.
 
It is also part of our culture and tradition to drink beer, added Sandrock, a former managing director of Celtic's Europa League opponents, Red Bull Salzburg. This is normal but when it comes to high risk matches and so on then it is forbidden all over the stadium. 

""It is difficult for me, because I don't know the exact situation in Scotland. Does this rule come from the league or the police? Maybe one, two or three fans drink too much but normally I would say it should be allowed. Look at the World Cup and so on, where it is also allowed to drink beer.

I am very guilty of wanting Britain to hark back to the good 'ole days of yesteryear. I don't want a charismatic leader though, Nigel's charisma is the icing on the cake really. I support UKIP because of their policy and have ceased by Labour support for the same reason. Practical policy is often very different from the words politicians say and I think UKIP will deliver their promises. 

I keep posting primarily to keep the sub from being an echo chamber, sometimes the lefty circle jerk gets a bit out of hand from time to time. It's amazing what crap people will spout when they know everyone will pat them on the back for their non-controversial comments that toe the party line.

Green party support for instance. They plan on taxing us to the hilt in almost every single way with every effort at wealth generation getting a new, higher tax. They wish to renationalise large swathes of infrastructure, nevermind the cost. Borders would be completely open with far fewer security checks. Nuclear power gone entirely, fracking out of the question and renewables to be 50% of energy needs is just 6 years from now. Only violent women would go to jail, all other crimes would result in non-custodial sentences. Almost all of these examples are taken from their manifesto. Any sane person would question very strongly the economic or social integrity of these policies, yet they are so blindly supported by many on the left.

And part of that power comes with the realistic alternative that they provide. John Lennon's alternative was pretty similar except for a more restrained US foreign policy. Malcolm X's world *broadly* was the same except black people would be equal in their situation to whites. 

Brand may have a limited following that I think is mainly composed on the people who are anti-establishment anyway, or are young enough to not know or understand much about politics but he doesn't have the realistic alternative. Malcolm X had power because there was a well defined and achieveable goal. Brand doesn't have either, and while he is a charismatic comedian, he isn't a leader most people would believe in. His charisma comes from being instantly friendly, not being inspirationally passionate like Malcolm X. Malcolm X is a guy you would follow to hell and back, Russell Brand is a guy you might want a pint with when you get back. 

This isn't about the suddenly competent and coherrent establishment trying to discredit a new threat, because if they were, they are doing an unbelievably shit job of it. Occupy was a joke because it had no well defined and achievable aims, other than to sit somewhere for a while. Pussy Riot are entirely different as they are in Russia where the culture surrounding being anti-establishment doesn't exist in the same way. You can change the world if you truly understand the world as it is, and the world you are changing it to, however Brand understands neither. 

His only really dangerous power is to ""introduce young people to politics"" by introducing them to his politics in a completely biased and uncritical way. He's not getting anyone to think, he's just getting people to think like him, which is frankly a terrible things to do, regardless of whether you agree with those views or not.

I am trying to make some sense of [this letter by JWH already linked above](http://www.theanfieldwrap.com/2012/06/john-w-henry-on-the-stadium-question/)  
  
Let's compare Arsenal's and Liverpool's average matchday ticket cost. I am using data provided in the table in the link above which is of the 10/11 season. Number of matches played at home is found using Wikipedia. [Arsenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Arsenal_F.C._season) and [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Liverpool_F.C._season)  
  
Arsenal played 28 home matches and earned annual revenue £1543 per seat. ie 1543/28 = £55 per seat per match.
Liverpool played 25 home matches and earned annual revenue £898 per seat. ie 898/25 = £36 per seat per match.  
  
These numbers are pretty close to what the actual ticket value is.  
What I conclude from this is that we(or Arsenal) cannot decrease the general ticket prices and solely rely on executive boxes. Matchdays revenue are a decent source of income for all premier league clubs nowadays and a decision to reduce prices should be for all clubs so that it does not affect a particular club more.",0,1417689265,null,0,false,0,cmku9oe,t3_2o5jri,t1_cmku9oe,t1_cmkdv0n,null,1425613832,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You are assuming anything is available.  I fall under North London Mental Health Trust and they are currently not accepting new patients.  So You or Me or Anyone else can go to our doctors all we like, no services beyond a prescription are available at this time.

I sat in my doctors office with him till 9pm while he argued that I needed in patient treatment.  They declined to take me.  After a suicide attempt I was (technically still am I think?) sectioned.  But when the police took me to Goodmayes hospital, the people inside refused to open the door.

Really Man Utd were probably the first club to really get into it in a big way when they remodelled Old Trafford.

My core point though was if the total revenue from matchdays is still less than a quarter of the overall revenue, and of that ticket sales to fans will be a smaller proportion still, things like raising or lowering ticket prices by £5 are a fairly small percentage in the grander scheme of things.

1. The CICA administers a scheme which considers claims for compensation ""from people who have been physically or mentally injured because they were the innocent victim of a violent crime ..."" (paragraph 6);
2. The mother was alleged to have committed is from s23 of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861: ""Whosoever shall unlawfully administer to ... any other person, any poison or destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby ... to inflict upon such person any grievous bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony"" (paragraph 12);
3. The House of Lords has previously judged that although a foetus is a ""unique organism and ... neither a distinct person nor an adjunct of the mother"" there can be charges of manslaughter in where damage to the foetus is concerned, although there cannot be charges of murder (paragraph 18);
4. One of the established rules of criminal liability is ""in the absence of a specific statutory provision, an embryo or foetus in utero does not have a human personality and cannot be the victim of a crime of violence. Although the foetus is a unique organism it does not have the attributes that make it a person."" (paragraph 19);

Conclusion: Because the foetus cannot be said to be 'any other person' under s23 of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861, and because the case does not involve manslaughter but only damage to the child, in this case it is not possible to claim for compensation ""from people who have been physically or mentally injured because they were the innocent victim of a violent crime ...""

&gt; 6.  Applying for a passport in a fun, temporary or trade marked name

&gt; HM Passport Office have introduced a policy for inappropriate and temporary name changes in passports.  Under this policy, HM Passport Office will not issue a passport in a name that is temporary or contains: a political statement, a string of words that will not normally be considered a name or a trade marked name (there are other restrictions in IPS's policy but our own restrictions on new names mean that a Deed Poll issued by us would not be in breach of the other restrictions in their policy).  However, if you provide HM Passport Office with documentary evidence that you are using your new name for all purpose, HM Passport Office will issue you a passport (in your current name) with an observation stating ""The holder is also known as new name"".

&gt; Therefore, when you apply for your new passport, you will need to enclose at least two documents you have changed to your new name to demonstrate you are using your new name for all purposes e.g. your driving licence and a utility bill.  We will also enclose with your Deed Poll documentation, the suggested wording of a letter you should enclose with your passport application in support of your request for a passport in your new name.

I think the signature is the problem, because L Skywalker must be at least very close to the trademarked name.

You can see some of this stories on this forum: http://www.immigrationboards.com/british-citizenship/unsuccessful-applications-t90623.html

This is something I've seen happen quite often, its fucking disgusting:

Serina26:

My application was turned down because of a congestion charge that I appealed.

1. On 15th July I entered the congestion charge to visit a clinic in central london. This was to sort out the final preparations (sign paperwork, consent forms, etc) related to an important (invasive) surgery I was due to have early the next day. This surgery was vital for me. It required overnight hospitalisation

After my visit to the clinic, I drove back home, packed my suitcase and went to bed very early as I had be up at 5:30 for I to be at hospital at 7am in the next morning. In the process it slipped my mind that I had to pay for congestion charge. I was very anxious and nervous; I had a lot on my mind as - just like all other surgeries- I had to go through this one on my own, for I don't have anyone in this country to take care of me post surgery. 

While waiting for surgery early morning in my operating gown, I remembered I had to make a payment. I run to my locker and tried make a payment on my mobile phone but my phone internet connection was not very good in the hospital building. I tried to make a payment but had a few error messages coming up on the screen. I could not call congestion charge to make a payment over the phone as it was quite early in the morning and they were still not open. I went through surgery that day. It lasted about 8 hours, during which I was under general anaestehia. I woke up feeling very drowsy and sick, unable to move. The following day, I got discharged late afternoon and -despite the dizziness and drownsiness caused by the powerful general anesthesia- I called Congestion charge as soon as I got back home. I was told the 48 hours allowed to make a payment for the CT had lapsed and that I had to wait for the penalty charge to arrive in the post to be able to ask for a reconsideration. I tried to explain that due to my surgery circumstances, I was not in a position to make a payment for most of the 48 hours allowed to make a payment and that I should be given an extension of 24 hours for my extenuating circumstances. But the operator advised there was nothing that could be done,; that I had to wait until I received the penalty in the post before I could ask for it to be reconsidered.

On the same day I received the penalty, I wrote the Congestion Charge explaining my circumstances (see attached evidence on 24th July 2013), but they dismissed it. I ten was given the OPTION to appeal it to the Traffic Appelate Authority. 

Since I genuinely felt I had a fair case, I referred the matter to the Traffic Appelate Authority by completing the necessary forms and posting them. I did this on the same day I received the response (within the time frame allowed). However the my appeal was turned down and I had to pay. However, in the decision letter, the adjudicator stated he did not rule on any malice intent (This was stated in the decision letter); that he could only dismiss the penalty if: 

(a) The appelant was not the registered keeper of the vehicle at the time of the contravention.
(b) The relevant charge was paid at the time and in the manner required
(c)No penalty is payable under the congestion charging scheme.
(d) The vehicle was used without the consent of the registered keeper.
(e) The penalty charge exceeded the amount applicable in the circumstances of the case
(d) The appelant if a vehicle-hire firm



Not only I accepted th the adjudicator's decision and I made a payment to Congestion Charge straight away, but I also set up Auto-Pay with them so that in the future my payment would be made automatically should I have to go through similar extenuating circumstances in the future. I was also allowed to pay the reduced amount of £65 (instead of £130) as I paid within the next 15 days allowed.

From the above, it is clear that there was no malicious intent establised in the adjudicator's letter regarding the way I handled the CT charge. No malicious intent on my behalf not to pay the CT or avoid the penalty notice. I just followed the process in place to have a chance of my case being heard and adjudicated. Once it was, I accepted the findings and took steps to prevent the sitaution from occuring in the future.

I am self-employed, and this is the only penalty charge I've had during the last 12 years I've been in the UK

I just think it's really hard to deny that we have far more freedom outside of prison than we have inside of it. I have a friend who struggles greatly with her mental health, and she calls this emergency line when she's in trouble. Their level of usefulness and responsiveness varies, but she has that option. Prisoners do not have that option. And the same is true for many, many other services.

Of course there are problems, and people are severely let down by the system. My anxiety is spiraling down and down but I can't seek real help because the mental health clinic is only open 9-5 Mon-Fri and for various reasons I just can't make those hours. But I still have the ability to go online whenever I want, the ability to call whoever I want whenever I want, the ability to investigate private options (I can't afford them, but the option's there), and so on. I can't imagine being stuck in prison with the way my brain works at the moment.

Mental health care sucks all round, but we have more options out here. That's all I'm saying.  The options may not be enough, and are definitely not accessible to everyone, but they're there.

George Osborne on Wednesday delivered his penultimate set-piece statement of this parliament. It was not the one he hoped to make when he became UK chancellor four years ago, nor even the one he expected at the Budget in March.
Mr Osborne may preside over a British economy that is expanding and generating jobs at an enviable pace. But in one critical regard it is not delivering what he needs. Renewed activity is failing to fill the Treasury’s coffers. In just eight months future tax revenues have been revised down by an astonishing £20bn, and for the next two years borrowing has been revised up. The UK’s books will only be balanced through an unprecedented further squeeze on public spending.

Nor does the difficult news stop there. After an impressive spurt this year, the UK economy is expected to inch along at a slower rate than before. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s independent fiscal watchdog, expects nothing like the sort of lively economic rebound that normally follows an economic slump, but rather a sluggish advance towards recovery.

In the past two years, Mr Osborne has learnt to play a weak economic hand well, scattering before the House both popular measures and significant reforms. This year he has already shaken up the pensions industry by scrapping the requirement to buy an annuity on retirement. He showed similar zeal on Wednesday reforming stamp duty on property and making its structure radically more progressive.

The chancellor showed that he had more than one eye on the next election. In spite of marginally tightening the fiscal stance, he rolled out a series of catchy announcements, abolishing air passenger duty for children, freezing fuel duty, and slapping new taxes on such non-voting and unpopular constituents as the banks, tax avoiding multinationals and “non-dom” residents. Other favoured interests included apprenticeships, army veterans and the chancellor’s “northern powerhouse”, a nascent project to reinvigorate the regions around Manchester and Leeds.

The chancellor kept his poise, helped by an opposition Labour party that has little substantial to say on the difficult fiscal questions. Economic policy will remain the Tories’ strongest card going into the election and Mr Osborne’s statement will help them keep the topic at the forefront of the political debate.

But a closer look at the figures still confirms the tightness of the chancellor’s position. The economy is not only far less productive, but stubbornly unbalanced. Trade continues to disappoint; British exports are expanding more slowly than the world markets into which they sell. Reformed stamp duty will pep up an already buoyant housing market, where prices are expected to outpace wages into the future. For all his worthy measures for boosting science and productivity, the economy remains as reliant on household spending and debt as ever.

The irony is that despite Mr Osborne’s deserved reputation for steadfast focus on the public finances, they represent the greatest weakness to his so-called “long-term economic plan”. Throughout this parliament, departmental spending has remained constant at about £315bn in cash terms without impairing the quality of public services. In real terms, this has been an unprecedented squeeze, and has fallen very heavily on some departments given the protections granted to the budgets for health, education and overseas aid.

Holding this figure constant for a few more years would be impressive, particularly given the pressure on the health budget. But Mr Osborne’s repeated promise to deliver a fiscal surplus by 2018-19 requires the next government to cut a further £30bn in three years. It is easy to see the political attraction of the Conservatives’ promise not to resort to taxation but harder to see how.

No chancellor since the second world war has had such a difficult inheritance. What Mr Osborne has achieved deserves praise. He has shown admirable pragmatism when the occasion has demanded. He should not abandon this flexibility just at a time when the situation ahead demands it most.

Debt: The amount of money owed by the UK government. The total debt minus the government's liquid assets.  

Deficit: The difference between the government's everyday expenses and its revenues.  

Structural Deficit: The current deficit adjusted to strip out the cyclical nature of the economy.  

Borrowing: Is borrowing. Governments borrow in order to pay back the deficit, but also in order to invest. So even while running a budget surplus, borrowing (and therefore the debt) can increase if the government is heavily invested.  
  
There is a direct link between the current budget and debt. If the government runs a deficit, it is effectively overspending and, therefore, in most cases adding to the overall pile of debt.

FWIW I'm very suspicious of the Greens as well. I was a member a few years back after I left the LD's, but after turning up to a few of the Kent branch meetings I realised that I was in with a bunch of jokers and animal rights activists. I'm all for renationalisation *within limits* and over time, but you're right about the darker sections of their manifesto.

Many years ago while at Uni I flirted with joining the SSWP but they were pretty damn insane as well. Turned me off socialism for years but these days I would far rather a genuine socialist alternative. Trouble is no such thing really exists in force in the UK and I can barely be bothered with the mainstream. All I can do now is to vote for whoever I think would do best for my constituency as I think the whole country is fucked. That person is not Nigel Farage (I don't even know if he's visited Thanet South yet...) so for me it will have to be the Labour guy, who's name I can't even remember.

I have a very bitter taste when I think of the current incumbent, Laura Sandys, who has spent the last 4.5 years gurning and grimacing while getting fuck all done. Her 2010 promise? Channel 5 to be available to TV licence payers by 2015. Since then she's overseen the sell-off of London Manston airport and the closure of Pfizer. Two of the biggest employers in the region, gone.

Yes I'd negotiate a discount or walk away if a survey picked up on a problem which I hadn't been made aware of. However, this is something to do with the item I am buying - a defect. A change in tax situation between me and HMRC is nothing to do with the seller. Sure it may end up leading to house price increases in the future, but that is an unknown. If the seller truly believes that they will get a better price due to the tax change then they can walk away too - that's their right as much as it is mine.

I am aware of who an agent works for, but their job isn't entirely black and white - if they get a reputation for moving the goalposts at any opportunity then sensible buyers will look at houses with other agents and that will affect their ability to generate commission.

That said, people in strong seller's markets get away with this because the competition is so high and the stream of buyers is so strong - they will eventually find someone who will put up with it so they can do these things. I'm lucky enough not to be in one of these markets (at least for now).

I think the advice of the other posters here is spot on (/u/brightlightsturnon, /u/cametosayshadk, /u/para_padre) - only buy a house based on whether it makes the most sense for you, not because of what the market might do. Quite simply it can't be predicted (especially in an era of such blatant government meddling) and if housing in our areas (Bristol, Brighton) goes up from here then there are many more than us who will be completely unable to afford it - we both have a lot of money saved and historically speaking we should be in a great position - hopefully the fact that it doesn't feel like we are will just be a blip!

The match day tickets are truly a travesty though. Of course Hull are charging their fans top money to see us - that's the whole point of category A games. We used to do that when we were shit. What annoys me that is even now our lowest category games are costing us the same price other clubs charge to see the champions. How is that fair.

We are one of the most expensive clubs, and if it wasn't for the london bubble I seriously think we'd be right up there at the top. You mention Hull charging £50 as though they're more expensive than us. Not at all. Looking on their site their category C games are £16. Sixteen. Pounds. Sunderland charge £25. Looking at Uniteds site, the cheapest games are £31. I've picked 3 clubs there (2 at random), and all three (including the self-titled 'biggest club in the world') all offer tickets much cheaper than us. £47 to watch the worst team in the league is a fucking travesty.

I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm getting a bit heated by this. I had a season ticket for years and had to quit it after moving down south due to my job. Now I get to about 5 home games a season (I focus mainly on the southern aways now), and including travel I end up paying more than I do to watch city at home than I did when I had a fucking season ticket.

I'm also 100% certain that the city images aren't yours, so I really hope you have permission to use them, otherwise you're going to have a hard time when the photographer finds out. I know you probably don't have much of a budget, but please consider investing in a designer/coder. I guarantee you it'll be worth the money.

* I'm sure you're already promoting the site everywhere already, but a Liverpool box probably isn't going to be very popular with Liverpudlian people and so advertising it here probably isn't going to get you much in the way of sales. Tell America about it, tell Japan about it. They'll lap it up.

* Your prices are skyhigh. £35 for ten items? Including sugar packets, an echo and some badges? And then £15 on top of that to ship internationally. The fact that that price is ""introductory"" worries me. You're in dreamland currently. I know you're trying to increase your profit margins, but as nostalgic and touristy as people are, they're not stupid - a sugar packet is still a sugar packet.

* At first it was cringeworthy to see sugar packets in the contents, but I can certainly see the appeal to a tourist. My concerns with many of the contents is ""Does someone who isn't from Liverpool/UK know why Tate&amp;Lyle is in this box?""

* A Sayers sausage roll. I'm still undecided whether that's hilarious bad or genuinely good.

false,[deleted],null,null,"My GP prescribed them and I took them,  we worked through 8 different drugs/combos of drugs to get to what I am on now (225mg Venlafaxine 30mg Mitrazapine).  No improvement (they make me sleepy and I have no interest in sex, if I'd been a hyperactive nymphomaniac I'd be cured!).  Apparently that is standard for about 50% of people prescribed anti-depressants.  So I was unlucky but it's not like I am the only one...

Mental Health people were involved in 4 of these changes but wouldn't write a prescription so I had to go back to the GP.  I don't care who wrote the script, I just want to be clear all they did was work down the list of anti-depressants my GP was already working down.

Best of all, they would change it *every time* I saw someone - so when I was moved from Citralpam to Sertraline, and then to Venlafaxine, I was only on Sertraline for about three weeks.  They (SSRIs) are meant to take 4-8 weeks (not a doctor, but that is what they said) to take effect, so moving my onto another one after three weeks without side effects just wasted 3 weeks of everyone's time.  I got the impression I was not meant to realise this despite being told it.  I didn't pressure or demand or ask for different pills.  I was and am quite down on the whole SSRI thing (personal opinion, I am sure they are great for other people).  But if you have a patient and they want treatment and you really can't be arsed then change their meds and maybe they will go away for another three weeks and maybe you can get on with your crossword?

All of this was after the GP and Mental Health people agreed I had ""clinical severe depression"".  NICE is crystal clear that at that point (stage 3) you need ""intensive psychological interventions"".  I got initial assessments.  At one point I had 6 initial assessments in 3 months.  It's like walking into A&amp;E with a broken bone and being asked you DoB over and over and over again.  ""Did your symptoms still ""

Never took anti-schizods.  GP didn't want to prescribe them because he didn't feel it was his diagnosis to make and if he did make it, he'd want me treated as an in-patient, not given pills and left to it.  I didn't want to take them (already on other pills that were not working plus in a bad place mentally and increasingly with mental health team.  The closest we made it to getting them was when the home visit team said they would totally definitely bring them tomorrow, then came back the next day and didn't have them and didn't know why (fair game, they agreed they were meant to bring them, I guess someone forgot).  Then they stopped coming (and I didn't even get the chance to say goodbye!).

That's the madness of being crazy in North London.

I don't expect you to buy this, it's just my ravings.  And even if you do, you're right to say it's just one (bad) experience.  But I think everyone should be aware of how poor mental health ""care"" can be.  In prison or not, there are too many people needing it, too little resources and no respect or help for many people...

Now, they are human and they do understand that policies need to be changed when the truth emerges or public mood swings, but in order to avoid not looking like a 'true leader', they instead try to bury and distance themselves from the past policy as much as possible - and act as though this is always what they intended.

I happen to think that if a politician held a press conference and straight up confronted the issue - explaining: why they thought like they did, what has occurred to make them think differently, and therefore this is now the decision they're making and the reason they're making it - they would have a lot more respect.

Why risk announcing a radical policy if you'll be prosecuted for failing to implement it, even if it's due to factors outwith your control?

Instead, I'd expect to see manifestos full of vacillation and provisos. ""We'll try to do X! But only if  Y happens, Z doesn't happen..."". Which sounds like a great way to reduce accountability, not increase it. No firm pledges make it much easier to ignore your manifesto.

But then again, the petition also rails against double speak, so I'd suspect that these campaigners wouldn't permit anything other than firm pledges. Which would totally destroy any chance of policy that the party wasn't 100% sure they could implement.

I'd also like to give a shout out to Cottee, Moncur, Steve Potts, Hartson and Kitson, Boogers, Noble, and Miklosko (he plays in goal for West Ham).

Why? Glad you asked.

Cottee. Obvious reasons aside, scored 2 goals in five minutes to rescue a draw at home vs Norwich (my first match).

Moncur. Moncur.

Potts. No specific reason, great side parting. He sticks out in my memory, shit control against Luton(?) in the cup once.

Hartson and Kitson. Saved us from relegation. 4-3 vs Spurs.

Boogers. Fuck G. Nev.

Noble. Seems to genuinely care about the club. Turned in some great performances over the years.

Miklosko. That draw against Man U to stop them winnng the title, I'm from the south of England so everyone at school supported Man U. Great day until I got punched by an older kid.

Even if they then go on to play rugby or cricket or whatever, they would still play football. I have no idea how kids in America get by on sports which seem to take so much equipment or organising. 

Then from childhood up people will have a team they support. This is traditionally a local or team fairly close which could be anywhere in the league system. Although many kids will pick a random team from miles away (a ""glory supporter"") especially if the local team are pretty shit. They may go to games with their parents or watch them on TV. 

Football games are usually quite low on glitz and glamour compared to American sports, you don't really get cheerleaders or fireworks, it is a more gritty feel to it. It is taken seriously, almost angry at times (just take a look on any article about football hooliganism, although this is dying out thankfully). It can revolve a lot around drinking, you may go to the pub before and after.

Footballers can be iconic, Bobby Moore for example as he won the World Cup and few would say a bad word about him. Living / playing footballers it can be a fine line. Beckham was a hero until he got sent off in the World Cup against Argentina, I remember he was a hate figure for a while. He is now generally respected again, but it may not be the same for a Man City or Liverpool fan. You can tell a player is really respected if the opposition fans applaud them, which isn't very often. Maybe at the end of their career after being substituted for example.

Rents actual (or imputed) are set by the demand for the number of units of accommodation (which is essentially fixed in the short term and changes only by a small amount over the medium to longer term).

There is a market by which investors can buy or sell properties.

The value of these is determined by the investors' rate of return (assumed to be dermined exogenously) and rental income (net of expenss,taxes etc.

Thus if the rent of the property is £10,000 and the investor has a required return of 5%, he will be willing to pay £200,000 for the property.

That is the amount after expenses-i.e stamp duty, fees etc. If these are £20k, then the investor will pay only £180k.

If instead, they were zero, the investor would be willing to pay £200k.

As there is a fixed number of properties (owned either by third party investors or people who are in effect renting from themselves), the market value is detemined by the amount investors are willing to pay. 

Hence, a change in stamp duty will be reflected entirely in the price of the houses.

Firstly thank you for taking the time to review and comment on the site. It's a great help to have another perspective on it. I'll do my best to answer the points you raised:

&gt;The site, although now working better, doesn't look as good.

The site is the same template as earlier, with more media and information. I've used Squarespace, and would love more than anything to invest in a developer. That's the plan for 2015 as I expand and include more cities. The photos used are mainly from commercial use image banks. I'm planning to photograph the city myself in the near future also. 

&gt;A Liverpool box probably isn't going to be very popular with Liverpudlian people

While I agree people living in Liverpool may not buy it for themselves, most of my orders (circa 70%) are shipped to addresses in Liverpool as gifts for friends and family who have either left the city or visited in the past. I will look to sell more to international markets too, good idea.  

&gt;Your prices are skyhigh. £35 for ten items?

We have a suggestion box, and a potential customer wanted to order 3 boxes with 10 items in each for friends in Miami. I added this premium option for him initially and have seen a demand at this price-point from international customers mainly. After the Christmas period, I'll be sending a survey to all customers in order to improve the product and price will be discussed. If the feedback is it's too expensive, I'm more than happy to keep the prices as they are. As my relationships improve with local wholesalers, the margin will increase also, which would lead to a price drop.

&gt;they're not stupid - a sugar packet is still a sugar packet.

The great thing about the box is that it's fully customisable. I completely agree a sugar packet is a sugar packet, however they don't have to choose it. It's there in case the recipient has a link to the factory, a funny story or affiliation to the brand. If not, I doubt they will be choosing them for their box! 

For context, we add an info leaflet explaining each item in their box and why it's iconic to Liverpool. 

&gt;A Sayers sausage roll. I'm still undecided whether that's hilarious bad or genuinely good.

Aha! A few of these items are tests, I've only had one box requesting the Sayers item so far so it could be discontinued! It's also not easy to ship the more perishable goods, especially worldwide. 

The great thing for me about starting the business is the amount of local craft, art and other small businesses that have approached me to add their items to the box. Where possible I keep everything in the local economy - our boxes are made in Speke, we use old copies of the Echo for shredded paper etc. 

Thanks again for your very helpful pointers.

Well that's exactly the point isn't it? The politicians present them as real promises, but as you've pointed out they are not, so they are liars.

&gt;But what else is a party supposed to do? 

I already said it mate.

If a party makes a commitment, and is changing it for a reason that is not guided by emergency necessity (like a war or financial crisis or natural disaster), but instead by an entirely predictable circumstance (joining a coalition) they should make clear what ideas are ones they will compromise on and what ones they won't.

I've also clearly said only on key pledges. The Lib Dems ""free tuition fees"" was a key pledge that got them votes. They would not be in power without it &amp; it was a lie.

The Lib Dems were never going to be in power without joining a coalition. They should make clear to their voters which of the pledges is least meaningless.

&gt;""Vote for us, everyone. We will try our hardest. We'll do what we can!""

Only if they want to make up a nonsensical possible solution, in order to try and win an argument by presenting the most absurd alternative possible.

being slapped, hit or indulging in watersports is quite niche and believe it or not some people enjoy this. it isn't degrading for them at all, its enjoyable. so yes, if I enjoyed it I would accept that job. Please don't project your prudishness on everyone else.

Use a bit of logic please. 

since when has sex been logical? surely saying people do sex work because they enjoy it is more logical than saying people do it because their desperate, because desperate people could turn to anything for money. crime, drugs, etc. why turn to sex?

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"But how far do you continue that? Should the club just give away tickets for free and ignore all matchday revenues because that gives everyone who supports the club a chance to go? It's bullshit for you to say that the club already keeping ticket prices lower than they could ""holds little weight"" when you're criticising them for basically not going even lower. There's very little financial difference between choosing not to make extra money that you obviously and absolutely could, and choosing to make less money than you already do. You're basically complaining that a store isn't giving you a 30% discount when they're already essentially providing you a 10% one. 

At the end of the day LFC are a business like any other top football club, whether you like it or not, and they'll be run like one. They're also a business that's losing £40m a year, and I don't think it's reasonable for them if they'd rather be losing £35m a year instead. Easy for fans to claim they want cheaper tickets, but the money has to come from *somewhere*. Every million they shave off ticket revenue is a million off their annual profit or loss.

We've been happy losing money every year because things like the new TV deals, Champions League and commercial deals were coming and hopefully mean we can break back into the right side of FFP regulations. If we just throw a lot of that money back away by lowering ticket prices then we're not helping anything and the club isn't running sustainably.

Even if we break even, you're pretty much asking FSG to run the club at a loss by subsidising matchday ticket prices. Which is fine, but I don't get how you can claim it's disgraceful if they don't want to agree to that, because very few investment companies would. The concept of ""free money"" doesn't exist.

Emmanuel Goldstein =  Ayman al-Zawahiri/Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (insert bad-guy of choice once the current one's been killed -They already used up Saddam, OB-L, Gadaffi etc) 

Big Brother = GCHQ/NSA

Thought Crime = Political correctness (and anyone thinking outside current corporate (fascist) dogma is clearly a ""terrorist"")

We are in an everlasting war against an invisible enemy ...


 .. The enemy can only be identified by their thoughts until such time as they actually do something of course, indeed many jailed haven't *acted* at all, they're jailed to prevent them acting, like Minority Report's pre-crime, they are shipped to Belmarsh, and then to Guantanamo Bay, and they are then held without rights and tortured and beaten until presumably the Americans tire of it (that'd be about the same time hell freezes over I imagine ;) )

History *is* being revised/rewritten to suit the political narrative (an example would be the episode of ""Saddam's WMDs"", that became ""Yellow Cake Uranium"", that became ""A-Q in Iraq"", that begat  ""OB-L is in Iraq"", that led to the invasion of Afghanistan etc etc etc).

There is constant mission creep by the right-wing Govt (at the bidding of their corporate masters) to take more and more of our freedoms ""for our own good"" of course...

In [Utopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rN-QddB4Hc) they simply want to kill us all (or the majority of us anyway)

Because without the Lib Dems, the policy could not be enacted. Simple.

It was a core pledge, it was front and centre in the campaign and drew in many young voters.

&gt;Some people may have voted on that, but if those people can't accept that a party with less than 9% of the political power of our country may not be able to enact all of their policies, they are a little naive.

If it was only the case that they failed to enact their policy because the Tories overruled and hiked fees that would be fine, but what they actually did was help the Tories enact a policy which was exactly the opposite to their promise.

More likely is: if you are caught by a Guard or a Conductor, you will be sold the full, un-discounted First Anytime Single fare for you journey, and you will not be entitled to a refund on the Standard Class ticket either.

If you are caught by a ticket inspector (Revenue Protection Officer), you will have your details taken. Depending on which train company and which route, you will either:

* be charged a Penalty Fare (£20 or twice the full single fare to the next station, whichever is greater) and also have to buy a full un-discounted First Class ticket for the rest of your journey; or
* you will get a letter in the post asking for your version of events, which is a preamble for them taking you to Court.

If you don't pay a penalty fare, or don't settle out of court, or lie about your name or address, you get taken to Court. It would be an open-and-shut case, you would receive a fine proportional to your income, be ordered to pay costs and the unpaid fare, and also (depending on if they can show you intended to defraud the train company, which would seem relatively easy—particularly if they found you had been asking about this online beforehand) a criminal record.

my problem with the whole issue though is that although racial tensions do exist, the narritive against all cops is ridiculous. im sorry but i have never once seen a national headline of a white cop saving a black man's life. i would like to see the other side of the coin to ensure that we are not shoving this narrative down people's necks. cops are there to save lives and help people. all cops don't do that. but all cops don't hate black guys. there is definitely tension between the two, profiling that occurs, but not all cops engage in this type of policing. charles barkley wrote a great article on sports line about it and coming from a black man himself, it seems very reasonable and rational for him to express those feelings. but what does barkley get? ""you turned you back on blacks"" ""I can't believe you would say that about your people!"" etc etc...the black vs. white narrative is built up just as much by blacks as it is whites in many cases and its disgusting. this country will never be united as long as issues like this persist, and trust me it spans across many facets outside of just black vs white.

The Lib Dems entered into the coalition agreement after the election in 2010, they had an agreement with the Conservatives about what policies to give and concede.

People might be unhappy that the fees went up, but that falls generally under ""your party lost, that's democracy"".

What the Lib Dems did was hang the threat of an impotent government (without their support) for a few political concessions by the Conservatives, such as boundary changes and the AV vote (which seemed like a waste of political capital to me, even if it IS a better voting system, which I don't know).

The decision about tuition fees was considered not within Lib Dem's power to demand after the 2010 election, and any Lib Dem voters who turn on them because of that one issue are being manipulated by an exceptional PR strategy by the Conservatives to point the finger at the Lib Dems as to blame for their own unpopular policy. Whether it was needed or not is irrelevant.

The fallout for not following their post-election agreement could have been dramatically worse for the Lib Dems, had they chose to abandon the Coalition the Conservatives would brand them as unreliable, unfit for government, having a hissy fit, more concerned with their own politics than what's best for the country.

To me, it's not inconceivable that someone advised David Cameron to give absolutely no ground on tuition fees during those agreements, knowing that it would strike at the heart of their young liberal following, weakening their position in the future.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;FYI I know a couple of sex workers and have collaborated(wrote for) a sex worker.

I hope you don't let your limited experience bias you view of the industry as a whole.

&gt; being slapped, hit or indulging in watersports is quite niche and believe it or not some people enjoy this. it isn't degrading for them at all, its enjoyable. so yes, if I enjoyed it I would accept that job. Please don't project your prudishness on everyone else.

How many people enjoy every part of their jobs? There are a huge number of people who are not doing what they would like to be doing for a living, and simply work to survive. How many people grow up dreaming of being porn actors? It is absolutely ridiculous to say that ""if you enjoyed it"" you would do it for a job. I don't enjoy paperwork, but I do it because I have to. Do you only do the things you enjoy at work? If you you are in a tiny minority of workers. 

What is more likely, that porn actors are in the tiny minority of people who enjoy all the work that they do, or that they are like most everyone else, and do things that they don't enjoy to get by. 

If you accept they do things they don't enjoy to get by, isn't it quite likely that getting pissed on, slapped, hit and spat on are some of those things that they might might do because they feel they have to, and not because they want to. And even af there are some who enjoy it, are you seriously going to argue that there are no actors who feel pressured into doing these things. That the porn industry is a bastion of workers rights that puts its employees first at all times? 

There is noting prudish about wanting to protect people from abuse in the workplace, its just simple human decency. Perhaps try to have a bit of empathy for these people. 

&gt;since when has sex been logical? surely saying people do sex work because they enjoy it is more logical than saying people do it because their desperate, because desperate people could turn to anything for money. crime, drugs, etc. why turn to sex?

There are lots of reasons why you might turn to sex. The first being that it probably does not start with sex, but nude modelling or something like that, and gradually becomes more extreme. Not all desperate people want to be criminals, all of the alternatives you mentioned are illegal, which might help you see why some people choose to get into pornography, it might be their only legal option. 

&gt;for awhile? I hate to tell you this but quite a few sex workers like it for more than a while. some of them only stop because of age and even then they get work on phone lines.

Does that knowledge come from the huge wealth of experience you have amassed knowing three sex workers? 

If you had done something that you were ashamed of, isn't it possible you would act like you were proud of it, so that you did not look weak or foolish to the people around you? I know I've done things like that in the past. 

Again, I'm not saying everyone regrets it, but you only have to search on-line to see a huge number of people do regret what they did. That is enough evidence for me to see that it is vulnerable people being targeted, and that they need greater protection. 

&gt;that is an idiotic statement. of course they are real people and for them it's a job. for most it's a job they like, for some it's boring and for a few it's desperation. 

And just like any job they deserve protection from abuse. If someone at work spits on you its abuse, if they slap or hit you its abuse, if they piss on you its abuse. There is no getting around these facts. It is a very good thing they have now been banned.  

&gt;yes I do, everything you write points to a hyper Christianized view of sex and the belief that people only do it because their desperate.

Well you are wrong. Do what you want at home with whoever you want, I won't judge anyone for that. But any employee in any industry deserves protection. 

If even one person feels pressured into doing something like this, and there is no legal protection for them, then we as a society have failed that person. 

Can you really argue that no one has ever been pressured into doing one of these acts, even though they did not really want to? If so you are just plain wrong. There are people who are pressured into such things, and they deserve protection. 

&gt;of course they are. but you know porn isn't real sex right? a porn film isn't what happens in normal everyday humping. it's a fantasy. female porn stars in the industry are often treated better than the men.

When one actor violently inserts an object into another, it is real, it can cause real pain, discomfort and damage.

When an actor is smacked round the face so hard it leaves a mark, the pain is real. 

I find it shocking you refer to these acts as fantasy. They are absolutely real to the person being abused. It does help to explain your opinion on the situation though.

British politics is not accustomed to coalition government.

Hence it is -- or was, until 2010 -- customary to make clear cut, wide ranging pledges and manifesto promises on the assumption of single-party government.

That's what the Lib Dems did, because even though it was near inconcievable they'd win a majority, it is simply the custom and tradition in British politics.

So you can hardly blame the Lib Dems for having done it. (That is, make lots and lots of promises).

And you absolutely can't blame them for breaking plenty of those. Of course they had to. For so many reasons: 

1) They were perfectly well justified in entering a coalition. Holding endless elections until one party gained a majority would be far from pretty, and lead to a less representative government anyway. Moreover, the Lib Dems could obviously best serve their voters by entering government (rather than remaining mostly powerless backbenchers), even if it meant compromise.

2) Having entered a coalition, compromise is necessary and justified. Especially given the Lib Dems have 1/6th the MP's of the Conservatives.

So in what way, again, were the Lib Dems unjustified in making or breaking promises?

Promises are customary because of Britain's history of single party governance, but in the context of coalition government, they obviously have to be broken.

Expect long-term returns from UK equity to be ~3% ahead of inflation, and *possibly* expect a sliver of outperformance from a ""value"" bias.

It would definitely make a sensible part of a diversified portfolio, but for low-touch, 18-year exposure, consider either a globally diversified set of ETFs/OEICs (which your favoured choice could be a part of), or a ""do-it-all"" fund like any of the Vanguard Lifestrategy funds (they have flavours from 100% equity to 20% equity).

But even with my Taoist leanings I think that's bollocks.

I'm with you, I think politicians should be held to account. But our system is too complicated to just hold a General Election if a party goes back on a promise. It's pretty foolish to vote for a party on one key issue (looking at you, UKIP voters); what if a party's decision (for example) to renege on their promise to cut tuition fees turned out to be wildly popular with everyone who didn't vote for them? What if the majority of the electorate was in favour of the now broken promise? Remember, we don't have PR, or even AV, so it's entirely possible that a minority-backed party can get into power (a la 2010).

And what about party rebels? Those who vote against the party line would have to fight for their seat in a GE, even though they voted against breaking the promise.

Also, its quite common for people to act very proud of their decisions on the outside, while regretting them privately. This is very common in the porn industry, where actors do not want their fans to see that they do not enjoy their work, as that might make them feel bad about consuming their work. 

The point is it is ridiculous to say that every person who gets into the porn industry does it because they wan't to, and that none of those people ever feel pressured into doing anything they do not want to do. 

Porn actors are just doing a job at the end of the day, and they deserve the same level of protection against abuse as everyone else.

Why do you think when you see current actors asked if they enjoy their work they all so enthusiastically say that they do? Can you not see that that is part of the act, because if you knew the person you were watching did not enjoy it, you might feel conflicted and switch off. 

I'm sure it would be convenient for everyone who consumes porn to think that everyone involved was there because they absolutely wanted to be, but unfortunately that is not the case, and people should be grown up enough to admit that they are supporting an industry that often involves the abuse of people.

&gt;Nowhere did I say everyone, I said everyone I knew. They are into it because they're making money from something they do in their personal life anyway.

Good for them, but like I said, their experience is not a reflection of the industry as a whole, and so is entirely irrelevant.

You haven't actually read anything I have said. You have taken a brief look at my comment and then gone off in a huff, telling me how ignorant I am, what a prude I must be. What don't you respond to what I actually said. 

There are lots of people who do enjoy these things in their own homes and relationships, and they can do as they please, but hopefully they are not feeling pressured into doing these things against their wishes. 

Many people in these films will feel pressured into doing these things, because they are doing them as part of a job, NOT because they want to be doing them. Even if they do enjoy them, do you think they enjoy doing them with strangers three times a day in front of a room full of strangers. Most likely not. These are the people who deserve protection from abuse.

Would you accept a job where your boss could piss or spit on you? Or hit or slap you? No you would not. So why on earth do you think anyone else would actually want a job like that? Grow up. These people do what they do for the money, and they deserve the same amount of protection from abuse as everyone else.

Spitting on someone in the workplace is abuse, pissing on them is abuse, hitting or slapping them is abuse. Its very simple.

When I was a kid we lived near a nowhere station without a ticket office, from there it was a few stations down to the main central station in town. In theory you could buy a ticket from a conductor but one never came round and you couldn't always physically make it throigh the train to buy one even if you wanted to. When we got off the train, we used to buy one from a bloke as we exited. If we went to another unmanned station, we often did it for free. This was all 20 years ago now, I am unsure how things work and am always paranoid about a ticket collector coming round and giving me a ticket which is why I always pre-buy one now. It has been tempting to risk it, especially as the faff of the machine can take ages, but I just wonder what they would actually do.

A couple recent performances have got this sub singing, but that was against Real Madrid in the CL 2nd leg (who had been distracted by their next match against Barca and who already lead us from the first leg and who still beat us in that game anyways). And that was against *Leicester*, who are propping up the table.

If you say ""I will not increase tuition fees"" and then there comes a time in the not so distant future where your stance was proven to be wrong... do you have to stick with your initial decision / policy / idea? Or can your MP never change their mind on an issue?

I agree with your viewpoint. The problem with politics is -- or maybe it's not a problem -- you can't just do what you want, even if you want to. Supposing you're a politician, and you don't want to increase tuition, but then everyone votes against you, then what do you do? 

If any laws were in place to prevent lying that would just mean semantical changes in how people make their speeches. If anything it's up to the people to make the right decisions. Be an informed voter.

But I guess that wouldn't be on trend, because that's not how England seems to works. It seems the English want a nanny state, where the government, and law, has their hands in everything, making sure everyone is proper, and saying, and doing exactly the right things.

However, it's still a problem. So, what solutions are people offering besides complaining, and commenting on the internet? The main thing, as I see it is, once you get someone in, it's hard to kick them out. They're guaranteed an X amount of years. Well, that shouldn't be the case. The process to remove politicians, like firing an employee, ought to be a lot easier.

There should be a reverse electoral process that's done via online voting. (The old method of paper and pencil would be too financially prohibitive.) Don't like someone? They're fucking up? Toss them out with a vote. Because behaviour will only change with consequences.

Yes, entering a coalition requires compromise, of course it does. You seem to think compromise means ""give up all your ideals and submit to the bigger party""... That's not what it means. It means bend on the things you don't care much about to get results on the things you do.

So if Labour enter a coalition with a senior partner I assume you would be happy if they abolished unions, and that you would feel it would be completely justified despite being the opposite to their core principles - and that their voters should not be annoyed, after all, they would have had to do it? 

But at least they compromised right?

The Lib Dems made it a key pledge. If they hadn't made it a key pledge I wouldn't be making the point. What is the point of a key pledge if it turns out you will turn on it at the drop of a hat? Then it wasn't a key pledge, it was a lie. This is really simple stuff.

I don't have a problem with porn in principle, but the way it is produced at the moment in many cases is sickening. Making it illegal to physically and mentally abuse actors is a very good step in the right direction. 

I also don't think my views are particularly unusual. I think everyone would agree with me if we were talking about any other industry. I just think that many people have a very warped sense of what it is like for the people working in the porn industry, and that is intentional.

Producers do not want people to know the actors are not enjoying themselves. They present a fantasy where everyone loves their jobs, so no-one feels bad about what they are consuming. And most people fall for it. 

&gt;that's becouse they are. would you say someone getting shot on film is real? would you say killing someone in a game is real? 

When someone shoots someone in a film, they don't actually die, its all an act. When someone slap's someone hard across the face in porn, so that it leaves a red mark or bruise, that actually happened. They actually feel the pain. Is that really so hard to understand? Or do you think that that is all faked? Because you would be wrong. 

&gt;someone doing a porn shoot is acting out a fantasy, sometimes for themselves... porn stars who act out watersports and bdsm are doing it because they enjoy that fantasy...

Wow you  really are too far gone aren't you. I will try one more time. A minority of actors will enjoy all the things they do on camera. The vast majority will find themselves doing things the do not enjoy.

 Many will not enjoy being slapped across the face, but will do it because the director wants it, and they will loose the job if they refuse. That is pressure.

I do not enjoy being slapped across the face either, but I will not lose out financially if I tell my boss to fuck off if he suggests it. These new rules bring porn actors in line with what is acceptable for all other careers.

Yes it was, they could have walked away. What if the Tories were to try to reintroduce the death penalty and the Lib Dems helped them? Would we say the decision was not within the Lib Dems power and then say nothing about their votes which enabled it?

Sorry, that is a rubbish defence IMO. A coalition partner isn't forced to vote for anything they disagree with, they can walk away from the coalition.

I think I'm making a very simple point. The Lib Dems made free tuition fees **a key promise** in their campaign. The fact they then enabled a government to enact **exactly the opposite** is a scandal. So not only did the fail to deliver which would be fine... without them the raise would not have passed. How is that anything other than a complete betrayal of the people they made promises to?

If it had been a minor policy suggestion from them, a white paper, or a throwaway comment by a Lib Dem cadidiate, I wouldn't be so annoyed. But it was a core promise, specifically designed to get the student vote, which it did.

It was a blatant lie to win votes. I know they had to compromise to get in the coalition. Obviously they do.

Its not as simple as that. They can be put forward for roles without knowing the full extent of what's expected. There can be changes made mid shoot. They can be offered multiple films if they do more extreme shoots. There are hundreds of ways in which someone can be coerced into doing something they don' really want to do.

The herd trust the stockman, does that surprise you?

Do you somehow think the herds on farms *know* they are being farmed for their meat/produce?

As Rob Newman said the British are uniquely naive about their history and the way things *really* are.

Ask people who owns the Bank of England (the majority think the nation owns it, that's not so, it is privately owned)

Privately owned central banks like the Bank of England, and the Fed are run for profit.

As a consequence there is always more owed to the central bank than actually exists, the debt can never be repaid.

The old system of ""fractional reserve banking"" is now defunct and obsolete, the banks now engage in ""no reserve banking"" by keeping it off the books (deposits kept off the balance sheets), recursive rehypothecation is going to cause a complete financial meltdown sooner rather than later.

This has created (IMO) an almost feudal system of economic slavery (and the serfs are clearly in the main ignorant of their total serfdom).

People are clearly being farmed in the same way livestock are, the fleece in this case would be the loans and interest repayments made by and to the banks, which are in fact a source of perpetual income generated from *absolutely nothing* ([Max Keiser explains ""no reserve banking"" here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKF8XHeQHpU)).



Cameron, Clegg, Miliband, Farage et al all work for the same people (the bankers)** , they are in simple terms the farm managers, does it matter to sheep what colour the jacket and tie are that the farm manager wears (or is it of any significance whatsoever to him what the sheep think, they *are* just livestock) as he makes the decisions about the destiny of the the flock?

 ** The proof of this would be that the £80 billion taken in ""Austerity measures"" by Cocaine-Chancellor-Osborn was given to the banks who paid out £81 billion in *bonus payments to bankers*, not *wages*, **banker's bonuses** when they had clearly just created ""Austerity"" for us by their actions, the Austerity-Tax (because that's what it was) paid their bonuses!!!

The bankers must be laughing their fucking arses off, because they've succeeded in the realisation of a version of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" the banker Alphas (by way of their servants the politicians) have got society running on a tread-mill generating wealth for *them*, and the rest of us should consider ourselves very lucky indeed to get the crumbs from their table if any should come our way...


&gt;""It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison, and yet not free -- to be under no physical constraint and yet to be a psychological captive, compelled to think, feel and act as the representatives of the national State, or of some private interest within the nation, want him to think, feel and act. There will never be such a thing as a writ of habeas mentem; for no sheriff or jailer can bring an illegally imprisoned mind into court, and no person whose mind had been made captive by the methods outlined in earlier articles would be in a position to complain of his captivity. The nature of psychological compulsion is such that those who act under constraint remain under the impression that they are acting on their own initiative. The vic­tim of mind-manipulation does not know that he is a victim. To him, the walls of his prison are invisible, and he believes himself to be free. That he is not free is apparent only to other people. His servitude is strictly objective."" (sic: Aldous Huxley)

Ask this:

""Before you go any further, other than leaving the EU and cutting immigration, What are UKIP's other policies?""

I once asked this to Nigel Farage himself, on camera, on live television, and he refused to tell me saying ""those two issues are the most important"".

I asked this to some kneejerk guy I met on Holiday, he just stood there speechless.

I asked this to my Godmother, she said ""UKIP doesn't have any other Policies.""

Even UKIP politicians can be a bit confused on some policies, like Mark Reckless when he thought that once out of the EU we'd eventually deport EU immigrants. [He was wrong, and this surprised him and many of those who voted for him.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-mp-mark-reckless-left-feeling-sore-after-nigel-farage-changed-immigration-policy-9877429.html)

&gt;""Mr Reckless had on Tuesday said EU migrants who had resided in the UK for long periods of time would be considered ""sympathetically"", but others could be told to leave after the transitional period.""

&gt;""Until Nigel changed it on Wednesday, the policy of the party was everyone can stay for the transitional period, no doubt about that, that there would then be a permanent arrangement which would be part of the EU negotiation.""

If you are wondering what UKIP believes in apart from immigration and the EU, here are some highlights.

&gt;UKIP will abolish the Department of Energy and Climate Change and scrap green subsidies (so basically official government ignorance of man made climate change).

&gt;We will repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new British Bill of Rights. The interests of law-abiding citizens &amp; victims will always take precedence over those of criminals. (As Dangerous as touching human rights is, having one set of rights for one group and another for others is never a good idea. Rights are called rights because they are universal, you can't have another set for people you do not like).

&gt;UKIP will reduce Barnett Formula spending and give devolved parliaments and assemblies further tax powers to compensate. (Which in reality would mean Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pay the same in tax but get even less back and have to pay for more tax to compensate).

On top of that, Farage has claimed £2 Million, higher than most MPs expenses in Westminster, which he funneled into his party. Despite complaining about the EU gravy train, he, and all UKIP MEPs voted against a motion to cut MEPs wages.

false,kde01,king,,"&gt; It is obvious by now you have no grasp of what FFP is. It is short for Financial Fair Play. And it has nothing to do with whether we (Spurs) have to pay more or less for players than PSG does. FFP basically states a club has to make as much revenue as it spends (revenue here excluding cash injections from wealthy owners).
&gt; 
Excluding certain cash injections. As in personal money put into the club. There are many ways around this, as has been show with City.
 
 
&gt; PSG won't sell players on the cheap as they have to show UEFA they have some balance in their books. UEFA is already upset by the 1bn $ ""revenue"" they got from their owner last season.

11m for a 19 year old isn't cheap. I didn't say they were going to sell anyone cheap. 'Good bit of money' means a high selling price, not a low one.
 
&gt; This is the reason they didn't sign Di Maria in the summer. He wanted to go, PSG had the money, but it would be a breach of FFP. It is also the reason why Real Madrid held out for such a hefty fee, they don't really need the money--but they do need to satisfy FFP.

They didn't sign Di Maria because the summer of 2013 they spent 110M and the summer of 2014 they spend around 50M without selling anyone of note, making 20 in 2013 and nothing this past summer. 

If they sold a couple players then they could have brought Di Maria in but decided it wasn't worth getting rid of what they already have, I'm assuming. 

&gt; EDIT: Your last point is just blatantly false. The big clubs always have to overpay compared to us. Be that Real Madrid for Bale, or PSG that last season spent 50m euros on two 19 year olds that hadn't even made their full international debuts.

Not always. I think you're completely misunderstanding my comment, which may be my fault for not using clearer wording. Young players will push to go to PSG, not to us, because PSG offers bigger competitions, higher profile players, and more possibilities for playing on the big stage. We offer Europa League and 5th place. We have to offer higher wages to get these players while they will push for a move to PSG and, most likely, be willing to take a lower wage at the outset. We also have less players like Gotze or Lewandowski saying they only one to come to us and no one else. When that is the case the price is lower.

We got less from Real than we would have from United. Why did United offer so much? Because they knew they had stiff competition from Real. If there's no competition for a player, and a player only wants to go to one club, then the purchase price will be lower.

Comparing the death penalty to raising tuition fees is ridiculous. More proof you can't make this argument without considering the circumstances.

As I mentioned in my last post, leaving the coalition was not an option, because they already agreed to it at the start. To then leave after you agreed to it makes no sense. It would also be politically catastrophic. How would anyone take the Lib Dem's seriously as a governing force if they spit their dummy out because they didn't get tuition fees.

In any case, there WAS a comment, Nick Clegg apologised, effectively admitting he didn't realise the issue was so important to Lib Dem voters at the time. I also think it's unfair to criticize his apology as too late, because you can't know how things will turn out until after the fact.

You seem unhappy that the Lib Dems voted to change the tuition fees when it came up for vote in the house of commons. Consider the alternatives.

Immediately after 2010, sitting in Nick Clegg's position, would you really have thrown away the chance to moderate a highly conservative government by conceding something that is NOT a key promise (despite how much you put it in bold) that is likely to succeed anyway. If not now, then in the future.

Can you not see how much worse off we might have been with a Conservative minority government, or worse, no government.

I should point out at this moment, when the vote was actually cast, 28 Lib Dems voted for, and 21 voted against, including the abstinations, less than half of Lib Dem MPs voted to up the fees, despite agreeing to support it in the 2010 agreement. I suspect Clegg and Cameron both knew it wouldn't be 100% Lib Dem support on that one.

Your only suggestions of an alternative either don't take into account the fact that splitting the coalition after the fact is damaging to just about everyone in the country except Labour MPs and the realism of being in government.

I was a student in 2010 and I voted Lib Dem and I didn't feel betrayed, I could see the alternatives of the Lib Dems making that agreement were far worse than more expensive tuition fees.",0,1417711600,null,0,false,0,cml1sck,t3_2o8z6v,t1_cml1sck,t1_cmkzzma,null,1425610228,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I thought the whole point of teaching the [""idealised"" model of supply and demand](http://i.imgur.com/4uNE90s.jpg) in high school economics classes is that reality is never actually so simple. I understood that economists study markets to see why they behave so differently in reality.

In the case of the rental market, isn't it inherently tied to the house-buying market?

People need roofs over their heads - either they buy or they rent, and thus consumers are creators of demand in either one of those markets.

Houses can be owned by owner-occupiers or by landlords, so the supply of houses is shared between the two markets.

As people are are unable to afford to buy homes, it creates more demand in the rental sector, which makes houses more attractive as buy-to-let investments. I see no downward pressure on property prices that way.

It seems to me like supply is the primary constraint on home pricing - planning permission and how few places are available for building on.

I think there are loads of other factors that affect all this, complicating the matter, yet you make it sound so simple. You didn't say ""house prices may go up or down"", you said ""the market will correct"", and I'd just like to know why you think so.

It seems to me that prices could easily rise long term, and that housing (whether rent or mortgage repayments) may become a larger proportion of consumers' wages.

* Labour don't have economic credibility so they are trying to convince the electorate that **they will** make cuts and see austerity through. The reality we all know from experience is that labour will not make cuts as aggressively as the Torys have so far, and in reality are more likely to aim for a more gradual reduction in the deficit while they role back the welfare state to some extent. 

* The Torys do have economic credibility (sort of) so they are trying to convince the electorate **they won't** just levy another 5 years of punitive cuts that kill the NHS and welfare state. The reality is I don't think they *can* make the sort of cuts the article suggests in that time period. It would reach a point where it becomes counter productive and actually causes so much economic harm it reduces tax receipts and worsens the deficit. 

So the common route both parties will probably take is a more gradual reduction of the deficit over a period of another 10+ years. It means we'll probably be stuck with lower wage progression, growth rates that are modest or up and down like a yo-yo and a general sense of state austerity for at least another decade.

Its not a complete overhaul, but does bring in players the manager has worked with before and clearly has a desire to work with again. Could bring some more stability into positions we have seen some weaknesses in.

&gt; 

No, and I agree with a few things in UKIP's manifesto, but just because I agree with two policies and disagree with others doesn't mean I'll vote for them. I prefer to vote for a party who I agree with on most points. If we all voted for parties we didn't agree with on most issues except on two points, we'd end up with parties in power that we hate more than usual. UKIP seems to be relying on those two policies to get them votes *and* on their voters not reading their manifesto or (dare I say) not being 100% clear on their policies. They're relying on image and spin, and isn't that something people tend to *hate* about politics?

&gt;There aren't that many parties, you've sort of got to make some sacrifices. Do you agree with every Green party policy?

I don't agree with everything in the Scottish Green party (the English greens seem slightly nuts) but I agree with their policy of cutting the power the EU has down to size for example, and I agree trident is effectively a pointless waste of money and resources.

There are a lot of areas in the commuter belt like Woking, Reading, Farnborough/Camberley, Redhill, Reigate, Crawley, Southampton, Brighton etc. that are **full** of absolutely dilapidated post war social housing. The council need to be force-buying up these areas and demolishing them. They were never meant to last 60 years in the first place. Instead of replacing them with poncey eco-shit **[like this](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/24dash-media/image/2013/11/22/52690/580_Image_Woking_PFI_CGI.jpg)**, they need to be building upwards with more ambitious developments **[like this](http://i2.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article5873341.ece/alternates/s615/woking-victoria-square.jpg)**. In some places (like Woking) this is actually happening. But in a lot of other areas it isn't.

The UK doesn't need Garden Cities with 10,000 houses... it needs to upgrade its existing conurbations with millions of new houses, particularly those cities that are within commuting distance from London like Reading, Slough, Bracknell, Guildford, Southampton, Brighton etc. 

Obviously I'd rather live in the first example, but the bottom line is the only way people like us in our late 20s are ever going to have our own homes is if the government start building them... and precious little developments of several hundreds to several thousand homes isn't going to dent the numbers that are needed... we need to be talking about hundreds of thousands **per year**. The only way they are going to achieve those sorts of numbers is by building upwards in city centres, not outwards on the green belt - although i do agree that is also needed particularly in areas like Oxford.

&gt;

&gt;__Gary James Cahill__ /ˈkeɪhɪl/ (born 19 December 1985) is an English professional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays for [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) and the [England national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) as a [central defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)#Centre-back). He usually plays centre back for both club and country. Despite being a defender, Cahill is noted for his technical ability, and occasional finishing prowess, with a strength in headers.

&gt;Cahill began his career playing for the AFC Dronfield youth set-system in [Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire). In 2000, he joined the [Aston Villa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.) [Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C._Reserves_and_Academy) and continued his development. In 2004 he joined [Burnley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) on a season-long [loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports\)), where he performed well before returning to make his Aston Villa debut. Later, he signed for hometown club [Sheffield United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.) on a three-month loan deal. On 30 January 2008, he signed for [Bolton Wanderers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.) for approximately £5 million. Cahill performed well for Bolton through the years, cementing a place in the first-team and becoming vice-captain. He made 130 league appearances and scored 13 league goals for Bolton. In January 2012, Cahill signed for Chelsea for approximately £7 million. Cahill won the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_UEFA_Champions_League) and the [FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_FA_Cup) in his debut season at Chelsea.

&gt;Cahill is an English international with over 30 caps and represented the nation at the [2014 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup). He was eligible to play for either England or the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team), but chose to play for England. On 6 February 2007, he made his [under-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team) debut for England, coming on as a substitute against [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_under-21_football_team). On 4 June 2009, Cahill was called up to the England squad for the match against [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan_national_football_team). However, he only made his debut on 3 September 2010, coming on as a substitute against [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria_national_football_team). On 29 March 2011, Cahill made his first start for the national team in the friendly against [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team). He scored his first international goal against [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria_national_football_team) in a [UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012_qualifying). In September 2014 he was named England's vice-captain to [Wayne Rooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney), after the international retirements of [Steven Gerrard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard) and [Frank Lampard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard).

Plenty of US shale producers have hedged their output into next year and beyond.  They won't take a loss, but that doesn't mean someone else won't.

I'll try a explanation. The socks are 72 stitches around. In order to knit 2 windows per side, with blue lines dividing them, the windows would be about 16 stitches wide. When knitting a single row, you'd knit 2 blue, 16 white, 2 blue, 16 white. You would drop the blue yarn, knit 16 stitches in white, then pick up the blue yarn again to knit 2 blue. The blue yarn would have to run across those 16 white stitches on the inside of the sock, this is called a ""float"". Think of it as a loose strand on the inside of the sock. This would happen for each window, and for each row of knitting to make the windows, say 20 rows. So inside your sock you would have a total of 80 loose strands of blue that would catch on your toes when putting them on, or get out of shape over time ruining the look of the socks. To keep this from happening, floats are recommended to be no more than 6-8 stitches long. A knitter can sorta ""lock"" the loose strand while knitting, but it can cause the blue to show through a bit on the front.

So, to keep the windows looking neat and tidy, the designer made them smaller, keeping the over all appearance of Tardis windows, even though they're not to scale. Does that help? :)

However there may be some truth to that, considering that a landlord who charges too much may have to deal with losses and costs of eviction, should a tenant default.

Bear in mind as well that LVT is for precisely that situation -- you didn't earn the increase in value on your house, rather the increase is because of society in general making the area as a whole more attractive.

No one would ever be forced out of their house; they just don't get to keep the unearned windfalls.  Those windfalls at present are being paid by the next generation; often the children of the very people who are so delighted that their houses have gone up in value so much.  The idea is to redress that inter-generational imbalance.

Also, LVT proponents usually want LVT to replace other taxes, so you would, in fact, have all the income tax, VAT, inheritance tax, capital gains, and NI available for paying LVT.

Did a few modules on conflict resolution last year and my lecturer was involved with former combatants here in NI and South Africa, etc. but said that one of the greatest problems for moving on was what defined a victim. Some argued that anyone related to anyone that was killed by any of the active bodies (IRA, INLA, UDA, UFF, UVF, RHC, LVF, RUC, Army, B Specials, UDR, etc.) during the Troubles was to be considered a victim.

Others said that you couldn't be a victim if you were participating in terrorist activities, i.e all volunteers of proscribed organisations killed would not be considered victims.

Then there are Unionists/Loyalists that would say that IRA/INLA volunteers/sympathisers could not be considered victims as they took part in illegal activities against the state (bit hypocritical given the fact that UDA, UVF, etc. were engaging in equally illegal activities.

Overall, some victims groups try to place their grief above the grief of others (prime example would be Mr. Frazer and FAIR) and because of that, we cannot move on until there is a consensus reached on the status of victims and dealing with the past.

Are you going to present an argument or keep spouting bullshit statements but back them up with no evidence?

&gt; Please tell me what conflict the UN has prevented.

This highlights so succinctly how little you know about the UN.

Did you go to school btw?

When i went we had a class called *History* where we learnt about the previous attempts at creating supranational organisations in order to *stabilise nations* and *resolve conflict*.

Its not only about conflict prevention (although that is a part of it), it is about conflict *resolution*. It is about preventing the average citizen from being needlessly killed. It is about facilitating diplomacy between nations that do not normally see eye to eye rather than them having to take up arms against each other. It is about promoting human rights and it is a center for harmonizing nations efforts in fighting global crises.

&gt; International law predated the UN.

Yes i have previously pointed to the league of nations which you seem to ignore.

&gt; The revisions – which balance out at £100 million a year until 2019 – follow a controversial recalculation of EU member states’ budget contributions. That was based on how each European economy is performing, meaning Britain is effectively being punished for success.

So that's £100m averaged over 5 years. The UK Government's annual contribution is (according to that article) around £10bn per year. So that's an increase of 1%. Which is a bit lower than the forecasts for inflation over that period.

The second point is that this isn't some magic £100m that's appeared. This is a projected increase in the UK's GNI-based contribution based on the new projections for the UK's GNI - which have increased (net, over 5 years) according to the ONS. Whether or not it actually does remains to be seen.

As for this nonsense about the UK (rather than Britain) being ""punished for success"" - isn't that the way income-based taxes always work? You do better, you contribute more.

-------------

Yet for some reason most of this is missing from the articles headline.

Clubs in the top two tiers must only have a bronze license which requires a minimum of 500 capacity covered areas only.

[You can find it on page 34 of the SPFL rule book](http://spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthespfl_1375800603.pdf)

&gt; with respect to Clubs entitled to play in Divisions One and Two
have achieved and maintain with respect to stadia criteria at least
the Bronze Standard set out in The Scottish Football Association
National Club Licensing Manual in force and as amended or
supplemented from time to time;

&gt;with respect to Clubs entitled to play in Divisions One and Two
have had and have adequate winter pitch protection, as provided
in Rule H10; and

You have to look up the SFA rule book to find out how they classify their licenses. [Here is the classification rules here (part that's relevant is on page 16).](http://tinyurl.com/ldffu53)

&gt;Seats or Standing Places
There may be seats and standing. There shall be provision for wheelchairs and accessible seating places available.
Level of Cover
There shall be an adequate level of cover available for both home and away spectators. Minimum level of capacity is 500 covered places.
Documented Capacity The ground will have a capacity calculated by a
competent person in accordance with the Green Guide.

Neil Doncaster informed us at a fans meeting last season that every second tier ground is compatible for the top tier.

The issue with Celtic is that their stadium is already developed and so big that they can't actually put in standard terracing since it'd be in between seated areas (and would probably be too big to be deemed safe). They could do it with the rail seating in Germany and that's the path they went down but [Glasgow City Council turned it down.]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28777621)

Basically, any top tier side is not restricted by league regulations to put standing sections in but they may be issues with getting safety certificates. Dundee were going to do it at the start of the season but decided it'd cost too much for what we'd be getting out of it.

Dundee, Ross County, Inverness, Hamilton and Partick Thistle could probably manage it relatively easily if they wanted it (due to unused sections). Dundee United probably could do the same but might want to use the rail type at the Shed end. Hardest to do it in is Celtic Park and they are the only team to have tried it!

One was stood next to an PO who had boiling water thrown in his face.  One guy had his thumb removed by a improved razor.

People often forget the cons and staff have to live together.  These cuts are going to get people killed.

Certain prisons have had an influx in lower paid new PO's, these people need guiding, but there's already so much work.  There's often times when just a couple of PO's are looking after an entire wing now.

false,UncleArthur,null,null,"&gt;More importantly, effective immediately ISAs become transferrable by a spouse or civil partner upon death. The tax advantages within the wrapper are retained when inherited and will have no impact on their own ISA allowances.

There might be a bit of a catch there:


""When the saver with £100,000 dies the ISA tax wrapper will fall away and the £100,000 of investments added to their estate for probate purposes. Once the estate is settled and any IHT paid the investments pass on to the spouse outside of the ISA wrapper – as before.

The change that has been introduced means that the spouse is also given a £100,000 one-off, additional ISA allowance.

The spouse can use this ISA in any way they want so they could put cash or stocks and shares in it. However, if they do not have a spare £100,000 to use the ISA they would have to encash their deceased spouse’s investment and then reinvest them – known as ‘bed and breakfasting’ - either in a new ISA with the £100,000 allowance, or their own existing ISA which will have the additional £100,000 allowance added to it.

Cox said the investment would not be able to be transferred automatically to a spouse within the ISA – known as 'in specie' transfer.

‘[If a spouse wanted to replicate their deceased partner’s investments] the assets would need to be sold and repurchased,’ said Cox. ‘We are going to take that up with the Treasury – I would like to see ISA [investments] be able to be transferred in specie…it would save people a lot of cost on exiting, repurchasing and market timing.’

He added that the Treasury had not confirmed how long a spouse would have to make use of the allowance.""

false,angelkimne,null,null,"&gt; Sorry, this has no credibility - you try to dismiss it, but the core point is the Lib Dems were NEVER going to have a majority and should plan accordingly. 

You're right, the Lib Dems were never going to get a majority.

So perhaps they should have walked around at election time saying -- ""these are my favourite policies, but I can't promise anything"".

That would have been the ""honest"" thing to do. You're right.

But nobody expected nor asked the Lib Dems to say that. Everybody expected and wanted them to say ""these are my policies and *I will implement them*"", like the other parties did and always have done (due to our history of single-party governance). ""Here's my manifesto with all my policies and promises"" -- that's what all the parties say.

Nobody expected, asked, or wanted the Lib Dems to break with custom in 2010, and start being all vague and wishy-washy (like US presidents before election time). Resultantly, they weren't. 

*They made lots of clear cut and wide ranging promises, they published a definitive manifesto, they did what Labour and the Tories did, they did what they always had done, they did what everybody expected and wanted them to do*.

I don't blame them.

&gt; And as we know, customs and traditions can never change or be questioned. That's why we still have the death pen... oh wait. This is the system you are defending?! Tradition? Jesus wept.

I am defending the Lib Dems decision to make lots of promises in 2010, and their decision to break lots of those promises.

I am not defending the traditions underlying the promise-making of UK general elections.

It's generally a good thing insofar as it allows us a choice between a set of clear policies proposed by Labour and the Conservatives, but of course it runs into trouble when a third party actually gets into coalition government and has to abandon lots of those promises. Which finally happened in 2010.

&gt; You seem to have no idea about core principles. Yes, entering a coalition requires compromise, of course it does. You seem to think compromise means ""give up all your ideals and submit to the bigger party""... That's not what it means. It means bend on the things you don't care much about to get results on the things you do.

The Lib Dems had a number of core policies (I wouldn't call them 'principles' or 'ideals'). As you'd expect, only a few got implemented (e.g. an AV referendum, pupil premiums, £10k personal income allowance). That is a necessary compromise, and coalition would have been impossible otherwise.

They aren't exactly sacred 'ideals'. An 'ideal' would be more like ""encouraging more young people to access higher education regardless of their background"" or ""improving education for the less advantaged"", which the Lib Dems can fairly claim they've done.

I don't see what more you expected them to do. 

I guess they *could* have refused to enter a coalition without all their core policies being fully implemented, but that would make coalition impossible, and it wouldn't serve the best interests of their voters, or the country. Plus, it's more than slightly absurd given their actual representation in Parliament (50 MPs vs the Tories' 300)

&gt; In that they broke a key promise they made, on a key pledge which won them votes. The blatantly lied to get elected. What exactly are you not understanding?

I understand. They lied. They broke a key promise.

But I am arguing they were perfectly justified in making key promises, and perfectly justified in breaking some of them. In other words, they were justified in lying. It might seem incredible to claim such a thing, but I really think it's difficult to blame the Lib Dems for having done much (or anything) wrong in light of my points.

Just because someone is a love interest doesn't make them not a main character. Hence the phrase Pond Era:) After season 5, it was more the Ponds as companions rather than just Amy.
