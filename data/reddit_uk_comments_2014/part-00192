*Bearing in mind I can't speak directly for the Home Office:*

Prior to the Freedom of Information Act coming into full effect many government offices were instructed to 'weed' old files.

This essentially meant to go through files removing and eradicating old documents.  Now, it's important to to appreciate that this wasn't precisely, *""9/11 was a false flag op!""* territory.  Some of it was that some documents should have been disposed of years before.  Some of it was about moving documents that shouldn't be subject to FoIA disclosures out of the rest of the documentation.

If you were weeding a file including this stuff *(say a file with allegations about Cyril Smith)* and as far as you were aware and concerned they had been fully considered and found to be unwarranted, you might consider that it was a appropriate to destroy them.

Looks as though we've agreed fees with one/both's club(s), but until its official I'm not counting our chickens.

As for my opinions on our acquisitions, I'm over the moon with all of them. Aside from Lambert, they're all young (Lallana being the oldest, just having turned 26), they're all versatile and they all appear to come from similar systems to what we've been playing under Rodgers anyway, so hopefully the transition will be minimal for each.

Admittedly I know a lot more about Lambert and Lallana than Markovic and Origi, but I've been impressed with the latter 2 as well and can't wait for them to sign. Lovren was class for Southampton last year too and so I hope the board don't listen to their fans and they do sell him to us anyway, rather than have him rot in their ressies like most Saints fans want for him right now.

Origi is raw and won't be a part of our team this season, but a loan back to Lille could be fantastic. From my limited time watching him, he seems to fit Rodger's bill exactly though. He has all the skills and tendencies we look for. He just needs minutes, which we won't be able to guarantee him next season.

Markovic has been far and away the best player on the pitch every time I've watched Benfica play. He's always been the one who stood out for me, months before we were even linked with him. I think Spurs are dreading the thought of facing him twice a year from now on!

Lallana I've wanted since I first saw him in the Prem. I see him and Hendo as the future of our midfield. He might be 26 but he's got a good 8 years left in him. I'm pleased for England too as I think the playing together every week will only benefit the national side as well for once.

Lambert won't be a starter but I fully expect him to be a magnificent option off the bench. Last season we only ever had one player capable of scoring off the bench...and that was Sterling (when Coutinho started), or vice versa. I don't expect him to start many matches, but Sturridge is quite injury prone and I have full faith in Lambert to score a few whether he comes off the bench or starts in place of Sturridge.",0,1404696623,null,0,false,0,ciq9wbk,t3_2a0ed5,t1_ciq9wbk,t3_2a0ed5,null,1434585822,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

He got so much stick for his shoot on (barely any) sight policy, ignoring the fact that AVB's tactics, and his lacklustre teammates weren't really giving him any better opportunities 80% of the time.  No wonder he just had a whack.

Poch gets directness much better, and you feel Townsend's skill set will suit him to a tee.  Rodgers has done wonders with Sterling, who for my money actually has a worse first touch and less dribbling ability than Townsend.  Where Sterling excels - movement, finishing and interplay with teammates - are things that Townsend can grow into if put into the right system and coached by a manager who actually has a clue about how to organise an attack.

He added: ""We are head sponsors there now, and of course we have discussed this. Lille is close to the Belgian border -- many fans come from Belgium to watch the games -- so having a Red Devil there is a massive asset.

""Of course, with everything that happens at the World Cup, you can never be completely certain. There are enormous amounts being offered, so it is not certain that he will be Lille's player next season, but in all talks held with every club, it has been agreed that he will play there for at least another season.""

Origi had spent most of his time playing on the left wing with Lille but has made his name at the World Cup as a central striker.

""The evolution from the left side of the pitch to the striker position is a logical step,"" Coucke said.

&gt; British citizenship - born on or after 1 January 1983
Being born in the UK doesn’t automatically give you British citizenship.

&gt; If you were born on or after 1 January 1983, you will be a British citizen if your mother or father was either:

&gt; a British citizen when you were born

&gt; ‘settled’ in the UK when you were born

&gt;In most cases you will be a British citizen if your mother or father was born or naturalised in the UK.

&gt; If you were born before July 2006, your father’s British nationality will pass to you only if he was married to your mother at any time.


are you under 18? There are special circumstances for children who have been living here for a long time.

&gt; Apply to stay in the UK without time restrictions ('indefinite leave to remain') after being in the UK for 10 years - eligibility, documents you need, how to apply, family members

Once you are ""settled"" in the UK for a certain time, you can usually apply for citizenship.

&gt; You can apply to settle in the UK if you’ve been in the UK legally for 10 continuous years (known as ‘long residence’).

&gt; Settling (known as ‘indefinite leave to remain’) means you can stay in the UK without any time restrictions.

You can only apply for citizenship if you're allowed to stay in the country without time restrictions. Therefore it's important to get the ""indefinite leave to remain"" ILR.

After you've successfully sent your packet claiming to be from the Daily Mail, then the forum sends back all sorts of queries *to the genuine IP* replying to the packet, handshaking received packets, and all that jazz. Unless you're also receiving the Daily Mail's internet traffic (either because you're working from the Mail itself, or you're some 'man in the middle' who controls part of the internet's infrastructure), then it would require a *serious* amount of clever technical knowhow and trickery to be able to second-guess the returning traffic and spoof enough replies to set up a web forum account. It's not unprecedented - I think Mitnick managed it, once - but it's really hard to do 

IP spoofing is mostly only useful for masking your IP address when performing DDOS type attacks, where you don't care what the victim is saying. The problem with 'identifying anyone on the basis of IP address' has little to do with spoofing IP addresses, and much to do with not knowing if the guy to whom the computer is registered is the guy actually sitting at his computer..

It's far more likely that the post really did hail from the Daily Mail's IP cluster, and if that's not the case, then perhaps the forum admin is lying. A distant third possibility is that someone who admins some serious chunk of the internet decided to do a man-in-the-middle attack, and way off the scale at the unlikely end is that some teenage hacker with a grudge against the Daily Mail, and an IQ of 250 managed to suss out the TCP protocol and spoof IP addresses in the way you suggest.",0,1404717942,null,0,false,0,ciqhekw,t3_29zb6q,t1_ciqhekw,t1_ciq5j0j,null,1434589835,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,alexatd,null,null,"It would depend on your friend and their taste/personality and what you think they're likely to get into. I just experimented with a linear approach with two friends this weekend--started with Rose with the intention of a straight watch through. It was a couple, and the husband, who is really into comics and has watched Torchwood, was committed to giving Doctor Who a go. As a Torchwood fan, he was familiar with RTD and Captain Jack. I gave a disclaimer about cheesy special effects and just getting one season of Nine, and went for it. Husband loved it--we got up to series 3 in one weekend! His wife gave up on episode three of series 1. She found it too slow--funny, but slow. In hindsight, I would have done the out of order approach with her--start with Blink, then pull out the Greatest Hits from series 1-4.

I personally prefer a linear watch because that is how I experienced Doctor Who--started watching series 1 in 2005 and fell in love with Rose and Nine. I'm patient for the duller/weirder episodes and personally think you need to watch them all in order to get the full emotional impact of the arcs RTD sets up, especially in series 1 &amp; 2. But some people just can't connect to it. My boss from work was the same--she didn't care for Rose (the episode) much and gave up on series 1 mid-way through. I think with series 1, you have to at least get people to watch Father's Day and The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances before they make any decisions, but if a certain type of person starts a linear watch, they'll give up on either Dickens or the Slitheen--cheesy episodes that are a little slow and OTT.

So you have to make a judgment call on what type of viewer your friend might be and go from there. I think Blink is a great stand alone episode/starter episode not to show someone the flavor of Doctor Who as a whole, but to get them engaged in how tightly plotted/exciting an episode can be. Then I do recommend Rose because it's a great introduction to the characters, though the plot itself isn't great (the plastic men are pure cheese)... The End of the World, I think, is a better ep than Rose, technically, in terms of introducing the cool stuff that DW can do. Then I'd do The Long Game, Father's Day, The Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways. (I only suggest The Long Game b/c it sets up Bad Wolf, but you could probably get away with skipping it in a pinch) Dalek is a fantastic primer for Daleks, but I think for impatient viewers it comes across as slow. You can just give them the Dalek elevator pitch before jumping into Bad Wolf and be fine. 
 
Then I'd roll right into series 2 if they've liked the series 1 highlights: New Earth, The Girl In the Fireplace, Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel, Army of Ghosts/Doomsday (optional, IMO: The Idiot's Lantern. It's kind of fun, but not for everyone. School Reunion is of course essential for introducing Sarah Jane to a new gen, but if you've got an impatient viewer on your hand, they can go back to it). Series 3, IMO, has a lot of really terrible episodes and I'd skip most of them (sorry Martha). If the friend is kind of hooked, it's worth showing them Smith &amp; Jones so they know who Martha is, then Human Nature/Family of Blood and the Master 3-parter from the end... but if you've got someone who isn't sure they love DW yet, I would skip to series 4 (either way, never ever ever show them Daleks of Manhattan. Ever.). If you think they'll like Donna and/or they want/need to see the immediate aftermath of Rose, they can watch The Runaway Bride. Honestly, series 4 was incredibly tight and I'd watch the whole thing... Come to think of it, if you think your friend won't care for Rose/Martha at all, you could do Blink and then roll right into series 4. Depends on their taste/style. Ditto if you think they'll fall for Eleven--you could do Blink + linear watch of Moffat Who, though I'm partial to Ten &amp; RTD, myself. Moffat Who is great for wackadoodle, cinematic plots and a fun Doctor, but I think someone who goes into stories looking for great characters will gravitate towards RTD Who. I think if I hadn't fallen in love with and related to Rose back in 2005, I probably wouldn't be a DW fan.

Sorry for tl;dr! Just brimming with ideas on the heels of my current rewatch/indoctrinating of friends :)

true,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"In 1795 when the order was formalised, there were no police and sectarian attacks on both sides were rife. Fortunately we do not need to protect Protestants physically any more.

The Orange today has the charge to support the Protestant religion (there is plenty of literature published by the Chaplins), it also celebrates and promotes liberty and freedom of religion for all. 

The Orange is non-party political so it's existence doesn't help anyone in particular, but does allow a forum for debate between members, some of whom may be members of political parties, most of whom are not. It's unique within Protestantism and growingly unique within unionism as its the only thing that unites Protestants across the country, who all have their own churches. The idea that it encourages the rise of right wing views is bollocks, where they're is a most notable rise in that sort of thing is in Belfast where we a few and far between and has more to do with the fact Belfast is quite ghettoised and has large paramilitary influences, compare that to Co. Armagh where Orange membership is much higher and there is much better community relations and less paramilitary involvement.

Its estimated that the PUL parading sector contribute £39 million to the economy £15 million of that directly to the local economy, and these are conservative estimates. Northern Ireland is on the rise economically but certainly the annual issues with a single parade does create a negative image which doesn't help the economy but its also doesn't help that the media doesn't look at the wider picture and focuses on this single parade, not that I'm blaming the media you can't blame them from wanting to sell exciting stories. 
But that is being offset by the Flagship Twelfth programming were Grand Lodge designates a few twelfths each year which are better prepared for tourists, this year there are 3: Limavady, Markethill and I think Larne but I'm not sure about that last one.

There is nothing in Orange doctrine that encourages a fear of the other, it is explained that the teachings of the Catholic church are not wholly biblical and that the reformation happened for a reason, but any issues we have is with their doctrine not their members. 

Comparing us to the KKK is entirely disingenuous, we do not attack anyone's individual right to life, or freedom of religion, we do not exclude people on matters where they have no choice (race, lodges around the world in Canada where native Americans have their own lodges, Africa, in one instance a the grand Master of Togo has had to leave due to political persecution, apparently there were representatives from a lodge in Las Vegas in Sandy Row yesterday), but do exclude people on matters were they have choice (religion) but this not a permanent exclusion anyone who becomes a member of a reformed Christian church may join the Orange.",0,1404719180,null,0,false,0,ciqhoa7,t3_29ujnk,t1_ciqhoa7,t1_ciq3812,null,1434589864,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

You want people like Cech, Terry, Lampard, Pirlo, Xavi, Lahm etc.. People who can remain calm while others can't. Someone that can pick up a team when they can't do it themselves. I remember just this season Ivanovic getting out of position for some reason and leaving a huge space behind him and although the other team didn't score (almost did iirc), Cech and Mourinho were both instructing him to watch that space and he just completely lost it and had a go at *both* of them, can't remember what game it was but someone here probably could recall it but it's one of the many moments that Ivanovic has had that has proven he simply isn't captain material. 

Also, cards and fouls really don't mean anything when it comes to this stuff. For example,  Suarez has never got sent off with Liverpool,  yet if it was up to me he would never even smell a captains armband..

As far as the Ramires comparison goes I think it's pretty spot on, Ramires does a lot of petty shit but he would never lose his temper with Cech or Terry, let alone Mourinho.

* The Market – worth a walk around, lots of crafts and things you didn’t know you wanted. Also some decent street food for a lunch

* A walk around the Old Royal Naval College. Definitely make the time to see the Painted Hall and the old Chapel

* The National Maritime Museum – worth a visit, but my favourite bit is the gift shop

* The Queens House – the earliest neo-classical architecture in the UK, check out the main hall and staircase, now a decent art gallery with some Turners and lots of Tudor art

* The park and a nice stroll up the hill (and maybe a visit to the deer at the back of the park if you have time). Keep an eye out for the flocks of green parrots that inhabit many of the trees

* The Royal Observatory including bestriding the Prime Meridian, and then soaking up the view from the top of the hill. It’s also worth taking in the view of Greenwich from the other side of the river, which you can reach from the foot tunnel next to the Cutty Sark

* Walk along the river front until you get to the Cutty Sark Pub on Ballast Quay – IMHO much better than the tourist traps in the town centre and you can sit with your feet dangling over the river wall

* For an evening meal the chains on the waterfront are OK, but for something a bit more interesting (and populated by locals not tourists) I would recommend heading slightly west out of the town centre to either Inside, the Hill or the Guildford Arms, all of which have good higher-end food 

* Also up in the West of town you’ll find the Cooperage Cocktail bar, which serves great cocktails and has fashionable speakeasy vibe 

* Also for dinner consider Bianco 43 for pizza, San Miguel for Tapas or Ajiichiban for Japanese. I would avoid the Chinese places unless you are really on a budget. If you want cheap beer but want to avoid Weatherspoon’s (recommended), then the Lost Hour is a great student pub. If you want to sample endless craft beers, then the Greenwich Union is your destination, but is slightly more expensive.

It doesn't mean that European networks don't suffer from that too.

I was in Germany recently, taking the Deutsche Bahn and not a regional private company, and the first train was delayed by 50 minutes then cancelled, then the returning train was delayed by 20 minutes. Our train from where we were staying to the airport was delayed by 10 minutes.

Another time we took an IC and oh boy was that crowded. You could hardly walk down the aisles, there were so many people sitting in them. Ended up sitting on the ground near the door to leave the carriage.

Only experienced that once in the UK, and that's when I was in the South West going to Salisbury (South Western Trains is it? Something like that).",0,1404722347,null,0,1404722541,0,ciqiamz,t3_29z075,t1_ciqiamz,t1_cipyfzi,null,1434589992,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,TopTrumpWANKER,null,null,"I know a common argument is 'well, we let in all Europeans!', but I think this is a much bigger issue - in trying to tackle immigration of non-EU people, the government is punishing British people who happen to have a spouse - married or not, children or not - who was born outside of Europe. 

There are stories of married couples with children being split apart because the British citizen side of the couple is not the breadwinner so is therefore not able to bring in the required wage. 

The situation is a lot easier in a lot of other countries. In Australia, for instance, you need proof you've been together (fair enough) and enough savings to be able to fly back to your country of origin if the Visa is refused (you can apply for the Visa in Australia).

In the UK, you need to have a job that earns over £18,600, have been in that job more than six months (the foreign partner must not be with you during that time) or have earned that amount in the 12 months prior (plus going forward) BUT income from outside of the country doesn't count - so if you are living with your partner outside of the UK but want to move back to the UK, then you need to have had a UK job earning £18k for six months before your partner (who has to be outside the UK) can apply for that Visa (which takes another 3 months to process). There are numerous other problems (the website is a joke, there's no clear objective checklist of things you need (vague statements like 'proof your a couple', other countries tell you exactly what you need to prove you're a couple) and numerous other complication that are seemingly designed to make it difficult for couples to apply.

Yes, if you don't have a partner from outside Europe this probably won't bother you. But there are thousands of couples, especially young couples or those that simply struggle to get a job worth that amount, that are affected and are being forced apart by Visa restrictions. It's a horrible situation.

EDIT: As you can tell, I'm currently going through this process, and have been split from my partner a month-and-a-half, with around seven-nine months still to go. And it is really really shitty - I actually meet the wage requirement, but because it is a new job (and my previous job was in my partner's home country, so that income - despite being over it just about - doesn't count because it's not in the UK) I have to be in it for six months before we can apply for the Visa. I'm just glad we don't have children (the wage requirement goes up with each child), but we've been together and lived together for five years and this is the first time we've been apart (for more than a couple of weeks). So I'm glad a media article has picked up this, and I really want people to know what this Visa restriction is doing to couples who's only crime is that one of them is foreign.

EDIT 2: Sorry, one more thing - these restrictions are literally class-based too, and the government admitted recently that it set the wage restriction because (I paraphrase) 'Poorer people don't fit in with the community as quickly as more well off people' (sorry, I can't find the link where the government said this, it was from June, I'll keep looking for it).

http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/23/students-married-couple-separated-immigration-laws

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-26424647

EDIT 3: Found it! Here: *The Home Office has staunchly defended their policy, and did so in the Court of Appeal earlier this month, justifying the financial requirement as being part of an effort to help immigrants to integrate. When asked by a judge if the Home Office was suggesting that an affluent person would integrate more easily than a poor person, the response was “yes”.* From: http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/kirsten-han/britains-new-visa-laws-are-breaking-families-and-hearts

See, I am not 'poor', I am just fairly young and therefore at the start of my career - my partner is also fairly young and will also have a job (has finished Uni).

That's actually good, but it goes to highlight my exact point. Why is a C+ considered expected, when in fact in all other walks of life where a letter grading system is relevant a C+ would actually be considered mediocre and below reasonable expectations? The fact they have to ""clarify"" what it really means in itself exposes the flaws there.

&gt;What's a better way to judge them?

Anything but fucking roundabout, confusing, ""requires clarification"" letter-grading system that is so ridiculous on the surface but marginally less ridiculous once you find out why. 

How about instead they rate them on their potential, and not by individual seasons. If they have *CONSISTENTLY* (2-3) poor seasons, then lower their grade.

It's the most idiotic thing to brand a low letter grades based on an individual poor(er) season for a youngster. That's their most inconsistent seasons in their career. That fucking is supposed to happen.

* The Cutty Sark Pub - great food and right by the river.
* Greenwich Market – Weekends see Greenwich Market packed with international tourists enjoying arts, craft and food stalls. Some of the offerings (logo T-shirts, 'art' canvases, leather bags) can seem a little unimaginative if you're used to the plentiful and varied markets of central London, but the covered arcade still holds a certain charm. While the market is on all week (Tue-Sun), antiques and collectible dealers dominate on Tuesdays, Thursdays
* The Queen's House - The art collection of the Royal Museums Greenwich is displayed in what was formerly the summer villa of Charles I’s queen, Henrietta Maria. Completed in 1638 by Inigo Jones, the house has an interior as impressive as the paintings on the walls. As well as the stunning 1635 marble floor, look for Britain’s first centrally unsupported spiral stair, fine painted woodwork and ceilings, and the Great Hall, which is a perfect cube.
* The Old Royal Naval College - go and visit the Painted Hall and Chapel.
* Greenwich Park - buy some raw, unsalted peanuts and head up the hill t the Flower Garden to feed the squirrels, go and find the herd of deer hidden right at the back and stretch your legs. Find the statue of General Woolfe outside the Observatory and see the damage from a WWII bomb still evident on it.
* The Royal Observatory - Contains one of the very few surviving Christopher Wren interiors and the well worth a visit planetarium, take in the views from the top of the observatory dome and have a look at the 27"" telescope.

Pretty much deals with your question.

Some republicans and nationalists feel the treatment of palestinians is abhorable and identify with them for a few reasons around that and the idea of occupation and disputed land. The PLO also gave the IRA a lot of money and guns. 

Loyalists side with Israelis mainly as a counter-stance to republicans and palestinians, and because they identify with being a small state dealing with a hostile presence throughout its history. Some Loyalist nutjobs think they are the last lost tribe of Israel, but protestant. Theres also a very tiny element that look at it from a white supremacist point of view where they oddly side with Israel and Jews because its a barrier against the middle east, Arabs and Islam. 

Many nationalists and many unionists identify with neither, both, or the opposite. I've been to Israel and enjoyed it, I like the attitude of the Israelis to every day life and its a very very nice country. Theres a massive difference in the every day attitude of Palestinians and Israelis, Palestinians are probably more openly friendly.

That said I abhor the treatment of Palestinians and still support the right of both states to exist. With some of the people I know thats just not the case. ",0,1404723402,null,0,1404723855,0,ciqihgw,t3_29zmp7,t1_ciqihgw,t1_ciq22dv,null,1434590081,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

Mayonnaise.,"One of the largest groups in Northern Ireland is working using peaceful means to change politics in Northern Ireland, as they are in titled to do as equal citizens of the united kingdom. Pressure groups exist the world over often at the request of big business, here we have a grass roots movement to change something that effects everyone and some actual leadership.

There is no accountability to the parades commission and it needs reform. The nationalist parties and the Alliance refused to deal with the Ardoyne dispute during the most recent session of talks, if a fair agreement could have been reached on that issue it could be a basis for future plans to deal with contentious parades. As there was no desire outside of unionism to work on this together, so we have to deal with it in house. 

There will be a meeting this week, between all the county grand masters and district masters (who have all been elected from within their own communities) about how we will specifically deal with the Ardoyne determination, and what are long term strategy will be, all we know at this stage is that it will be lawful and peaceful, whether that be an increase in marshals at the Ardoyne shops followed up with a targeted political campaign or large scale petition like what stopped the Maze 'peace' centre, its all still up in the air. Personally id like to see all of these options used.

Any future body to deal with parades has to be fair, efficient and have the opportunity to be publicly scrutinised, 28 days notice although doesn't effect Orange parades, being widely planned well in advance, but protest marches against current issues are hindered by such a policy as by the time a parade is given the go ahead then the issue may have blown over.

true,SexLiesAndExercise,null,null,"I met my American girlfriend at university in 2010. In 2012 she had a job offer for a £24k grad job in Edinburgh, had graduated at Edinburgh university, and was married to a British citizen. 

The same summer, the visa rules changed. Because I had been a student for the past four years and had only been working part-time in a bar, I didn't come close to meeting the requirements of having made £18,600 for the past six months.

So she had to go back to America. And because her student loan payments automatically kick in after six months, she *had* to get a graduate job in the states. That obviously made it a lot more difficult to plan for her moving back here.

So we decided it would be easier for me to move to the US. It took us a while to figure that out, to save money for the application, and to get the relevant forms and supporting documentation ready, and so we applied for a marriage visa for me in April 2013. But I was going to need to save money to move over there, so I had to move to London and find a decent-paying grad job.

I started earning over £18,600 in November of last year, so we wouldn't even have been able to *apply* for a UK visa for her until June this year. It costs over £1,500 total and takes a few months to process. My US visa is already close to being granted, although is a massive bureaucratic pain in the arse.

We've now been apart for almost two years, and the main requirements for us staying together (aside from blinding love) were sheer stubbornness combined with a relatively fortunate financial position.

The UK government has successfully incentivised both domestic and foreign talent to take advantage of the UK's great universities and university system and then leave the country afterwards, adding almost nothing to the economy. I had my tuition fees paid for by the Scottish government.

true,thespeedoghost,lfc68,,"It's an interesting comparison, although I'd argue that Suarez was even more important to the team than Rush in 1986. Clearly we would all be delighted if Rodgers could replicate that summer and see the same success that we enjoyed as fans watching that superlative Beardsley, Barnes, Aldo, McMahon and co steamroll their way to the title, but it very much depends on who we can get into replace Suarez. Not just his goals, but his assists and quite ferocious desire to win.

So who have we got in so far?

Lallana is a decent Premiership player who we overpaid for by about £10m. He's skilful and bright in possession and can score a decent amount of goals from midfield, but his lack of pace is a concern.

Can is an unknown quantity, but should hopefully ensure we don't see much of Lucas next season. Seems physically imposing and fairly mobile. Be interesting to watch him play: Sami seems to be a big fan.

Lambert is also interesting: not a typical ""big man"" in many ways, some similar qualities to Crouch, although better in the air and a better finisher. Although not much quicker. Not sure where he will play, although if we don't get another top, top striker in, he may well play more than we would like.

Markovic is another we clearly want badly. Lots of pace, but no idea how good a finisher he is. 20 years old, so he has plenty of time ahead of him, but £20m is a lkot of money.

It's also a lot of money for a CB, if we indeed did offer £20m for Lovrens, but it's very clear we need more defensive quality. And probably a LB too.

So is that going to be it? I'm not sure that we can afford to lose a player like Suarez and just rely on Sturridge up top next season. It seems to me that in this comparison with Rush/ Beardo/ Aldo/ Barnes we haven't really addressed the ""Aldo"" part yet.

Very much depends on how willing you are to get out and really sell yourself.

I got my last job as a temp with Blue Arrow at the west end, the rate of pay was fine for basic office work (£9.50 p/h or thereabouts) and I've now been made permanent.  Getting the job happened within 2 weeks of contacting the agency.

Before that I used Manpower who did find me a job but honestly couldn't find their arse with both hands.

Neighbourhoods are subjective.  I live outside the city centre - 15 minutes by bus and that vastly increased the space I get and the amount I pay.  I have a mortgage though so can't answer the renting thing.  I'm not close to ""interesting venues, architecture, restaurants"" because I'm in a residential neighbourhood, but can be in town quickly by bus because I'm on the 22 bus route and then all that is at my doorstep.

If we had been physically apart for 2 continuous years between the age of 21-23, I don't think we'd have made it.

With regards to university places - the UK students who are already **at** university are certainly better off without the competition, but the kids who didn't get a place at uni here because a Chinese kid was paying £50k to do it and then leaving the country aren't exactly better off. 

The system worked financially without foreign-students-as-an-investment for a *long time* before the last couple of decades, and I'm fairly sure we would manage without this ridiculous cash-grab at the expense of our own citizens. Hell, even if it wouldn't, our university system isn't supposed to be a fucking income stream to fix our balance of trade.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"Yes this in true in principle but for a player like Suarez you would need 3 players as good as Sterling or two players as good as Sturridge to compensate for his departure. We are talking about a significant upgrade in multiple positions to equate for the statistical loss (goals, assists, chance creation, penalties won, etc.).

However this does not account for a player's influence in winning. Yes Suarez scores goals, but he also wins games. Liverpool were 16-2-0 in matches that Suarez scored in last season, in other words when Suarez plays well, Liverpool win (The two draws were both 3-3 draws against Everton and Crystal Palace). When you watch Messi play, or Ronaldo, or even Zlatan, there is a sense that if they are on their game the rest of the players are irrelevant - they will bring their team victory. Suarez is this type of player.

Do I think Liverpool can be better without Suarez? Yes. Will they regress next season without him? Yes. Is Suarez bigger than the club? No, but but it's close. The thing is Moneyball only gets you so far. The Red Sox had Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz on their first World Series winning team who were at the time the two best power hitters in all of baseball. They also had Pedro Martinez and Curt Schilling as their top two starting pitchers, who were respectively the most dominant pitcher of the era (possibly ever) and a former World Series MVP. Yes there were guys like Bill Mueller who won the batting title from the 9th spot in the lineup, but they had their fair share of stars as well - I guarantee that the Red Sox do not win the World Series if one of those fours players is missing unless the rest of the team steps up in a big way. When Liverpool lose Suarez they will become on paper a worse team than City, Chelsea, Arsenal and even United, the only way to change this is to bring in another star player (like Sanchez) or for the rest of the team to improve comprehensively and completely. This doesn't mean Liverpool won't be as successful next year as they were this year, but it does greatly narrow the margin of error for achieving CL for 2016 (practically this means that guys like Sturridge or Gerrard can't get injured or lose form for any significant time).

We are no longer competitive internationally for low-skilled labour. We will never be able to support 70% of the country working in low-skilled jobs again. We just can't. Developing countries are annihalting us on the baseline cost of labour. Our economy needs to be revamped in the way that Germany's was.

And the UK immediately implemented it to the maximum 2 years.

But earlier this year the CJEU ruled that the law was disproportionate, overly broad and vague, and struck it down as illegal. Which arguably made the UK's implementation (the Data Retention Regulations) illegal, and thus made much of the retention done by ISPs and phone companies illegal (under both domestic and EU law).

Some ISPs wanted to stop retaining the data, but the Government told them (in a very Emperor-like ""I will make it legal"" way) that they should keep doing it, and this is their plan to make it legal by passing a replacement law.

The only differences between a savings account and an ISA account are these:

1. You're only allowed to deposit a maximum of £15,000 a year into the ISA, but a regular savings account is unlimited. This should not concern you as you're only planning to save £4,800/year

2. You don't pay tax on the interest that accrues in an ISA. You do on the regular savings account.

In your situation paying in £400/month, the regular savings account will pay a net of 1.48% according to http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/regular-savings/rates-and-information

On the 1st April the special deal you open your account with will end, and your account will be moved to being a regular ISA account which pays 1.5% assuming you have a balance over £1,000 according to http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/instant-isa-saver/rates-and-information

In short, the long term sensible decision for you is to open the ISA, allow it to transfer in April and keep paying in.

Sure, you'd be apart for 6 months (after you'd got a graduate job), but that would be it. No ~2-year seperation.

&gt; as a country we should be subsidising higher education the same way we subsidise general education - it's free or affordable for anyone who wants it.

We do. The only thing that differs is what counts as ""affordable"". It used to be ~£1000 per year, then £3000, now £9000. Even then, university education still costs more than the student fees+government subsidies provide. That's why foreign students are essential. Their high fees cover that gap in funding. While it might be preferred if government funding paid the whole cost, universities would then have no reason to recruit students internationally and this could easily harm the quality of education (since high-quality lecturers and researchers from other countries would be less inclined to come to the UK). It's a very complex issue.

&gt; Keeping our kids out of university because it's a bit cheaper for us to sell their places to Chinese kids does not benefit us thirty years down the line.

Who's ""keeping our kids out of university""? I don't think you're understanding; more high-fee-paying foreign students results in more (subsidised) places for UK students. Not less. Student places are limited by the funds a university has, more foreign students means more funds, meaning more places.

&gt;__Rennet__ /ˈrɛnɨt/ is a complex of [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) produced in any [mammalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) [stomach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach), and is often used in the production of [cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese). Rennet contains many enzymes, including a [proteolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolytic) enzyme ([protease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease)) that [coagulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation_(milk\)) the milk, causing it to separate into solids ([curds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curds)) and liquid ([whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey)). They are also very important in the stomach of young mammals as they digest their mothers' milk. The active [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) in rennet is called *[chymosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chymosin)* or *rennin* ([EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number) [3.4.23.4](http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/3.4.23.4)) but there are also other important enzymes in it, e.g., [pepsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin) and [lipase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase). There are non-animal sources for rennet that are suitable for consumption by [vegetarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism).

The only consideration should be usefulness to the community. It wouldn't be maximally useful to unfairly exclude or include sites in the sidebar, but fairness is not the prime concern, so we don't need to be too worried about it.

Related to this, it may be tempting to try to form a written policy to govern what goes in the sidebar. There's a risk here that there are just as many arguments over what the policy should be, plus additional arguments over what satisfies the policy. Broadly, I think mod discretion is sufficient here. (Not many people read the sidebar until directed to it anyway, arguments are often from the people who want links rather than the people who might find links useful.)

We don't want long lists in the sidebar. A comprehensive list of comparison sites (I'm assuming there are lots of small ones?) might be good for a wiki page, but would just clutter the sidebar.

I kinda wonder how critical comparison sites are for sidebar links anyway. Comparison sites generally have advertising budgets and are well known. Personally, I wouldn't feel the need to go to this sub's sidebar if I was shopping for something and wanted a comparison site (or two). It might be more useful if there's some information re what they're good for (if they're not all the same - it seems to be the major ones used to specialise in particular markets, eg utilities, insurance, etc, but are all going broad now).

I think the most useful sidebar links are the those to other sources of information and government/charity advice services (perhaps we could have more on debt issues?). Perhaps some links to some *good* UK-oriented personal finance blogs would be good too. (Not you, redttr.)

A link to something (wiki page or an article somewhere else) covering the basic ""usual"" financial planning advice/options (pay off consumer debt, emergency fund, ISAs, SIPPs/pensions, index investments) would perhaps be one of the most useful things.

I'm fine with commercial posters so long as they're transparent and don't get spammy. Again, re spammyness I think mod discretion is better than a written policy which will be argued over in intense detail - either posters are here for the right reason or they're not, and that usually becomes clear.

You also need to be careful that anyone claiming to represent a third-party organisation and gets flaired as such actually does and is not an imposter. It looks like moneysavingexpert forums has some process for this.

Players can adapt and are highly prized these days for being versatile so I stand by my opinion that this particular topic is given far too much though these days. 

Think about this, were we to play Sakho and Agger, who takes LCB? Both are lefties who have a history at covering LB too. Maybe Sakho because of the two he is quicker and could make up for a mistake coming from his lack of understanding of the right side? Or Agger solely for his general experience as a defensive unit? Agger is the answer because he has been a defender longer and will have a better understanding of what could happen and how to react. 

But even then, playing a CB on a side he is less familiar is less of a tactical error than people think because players learn all throughout their careers.

At the moment, we (as a subreddit) ""promote"" 3 comparison websites on the sidebar, even though there are several others out there with enough clout/ambition to run national ad campaigns and be fairly well known (and arguably better known than the 2nd and 3rd links).  notoriety doesn't equate to quality, but i see no reason to promote moneysupermarket and not gocompare (for example).

I would say that if you/we want to remain independent (and surely you do), then you have to either give sidebar access to any comparison site which passes some sort of simple test (eg: # website hits per day), or none at all.

i don't particularly like either solution. these companies are providing a valuable service, and we shouldn't really ignore their existence, but equally, it would be unhelpful to have a list of 20+ comparison websites (which could conceivably happen).  even if you do limit it to the 5 biggest sites (as i suggested), then you'd be open to people asking for their website to be re-rated, or for accusations that the way the decision is made favours one over the other. 

as for the rest of the post, do we allow companies to add content etc? i think the answer should be yes, but as suggested by wallyflops, they should be clearly labelled.  ultimately if a company wants something to reach the front page of a sub like this, they can easily achieve it, so better to have a productive relationship with them where users are protected by having interests clearly labelled. it's also less work than trying to police content too strictly...",0,1404734170,null,0,false,0,ciqkfew,t3_2a164q,t1_ciqkfew,t3_2a164q,null,1434591052,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; Firstly, its not about climate change, but the whole content of BBC science coverage. They end up with an expert in the field, put up against a crank who just sits there and throws out misleading or just plain wrong 'factlets'.

&gt; In some areas (e.g. Fracking), there is genuine discussion to be had between experts, but instead they pitch a geologist against a protester or industry spokesman. With Climate Change (and MMR these days), the science is pretty much nailed on. Because they cannot find an expert with a dissenting opinion they just put up a paid spokesman for a lobby group.

It is inevitable with many debates that at least one side will mislead in one way or the other, and it is also very often the case that those willing to debate are affiliated with an interested group, though this does not invalidate their opinion.

There are huge questions of process here that you are skating over. First, who decides what constitutes a ""genuine discussion""? Who would you trust to do that? Do we pick a few worthies from the Royal Society and stick them on an arbitration panel? Academia rarely attains the standards of objectivity it sets out to achieve, and there are plenty of interested parties in every debate. There is also the not irrelevant question of cost and timeliness, which is important in journalism.

My opinion of the public's critical thinking skill is quite low, but the potential for censoring unpopular opinions without pitting one side against another seems high. The climate change debate may be a one-sided example, but there are plenty of other issues where people look to quash opposing views by saying they are not based in fact which are less clear cut.

&gt;Absolutely not. But you can't threaten to bring the country to a standstill everytime there is a move towards equality and inclusion. 

This is not a move towards equality or inclusion, how could it be when the ruling is specifically keeping two sides apart?

&gt;This happened when a democratic decision was made to fly the Union flag in line with the rest of the UK. And it wouldnt matter who made the decision to ban the Parade, you would find some way to throw the toys out.

This is a separate issue to the flags dispute. If there were another body that made this decision then all legal and responsible means would be used to challenge it. There is no method of legal means to challenge the parades commission ruling other than active participation in politics, there is no option for judicial or legal review on any of its determinations. There needs to be some authority to decide on parade disputes, but this one is not fit for purpose.

&gt;And please, for the last fucking time, stop comparing sectarian marches to things like universal suffrage, gay rights and apartheid. It's disgraceful. You get to go to work or school everyday a free man with equal rights. 

I was referencing these to your suggestion of not being allowed to change any democratically enacted state of affairs to these things, which were democratically decided, but by protest and activism were changed. Flat out denying protest or discussion about an issue is a challenge to democracy

&gt; You just can't have this PARTICULAR one parade along a contentious route.

I don't, I'm pointing out the cruel nature of separating families on a literally arbitrary financial requirement. I AGREE there needs to be some proof of support, but I also think there needs to be other considerations - I don't agree with splitting up couples and families. I hate the 'people like me to pay for the privilege' - if the partner is not on the dole, how are you paying for the privilege? NHS? (Visa requires some medical checking, so it won't be intentional)

And AGAIN I don't see why it should be a privilege for a UK citizen to be allowed to live with his partner and/or children!

And your background, as much as it involves moving to another country, is not really comparable. 

*just because you want something, and think it to be right for whatever reason for your own personal happiness and wellbeing, doesn't make it okay to be selfish by putting that on others - which if you realise it or not is what you're saying when you argue for lower or no limits/checks on immigration.*

I have never argued for no limits, at any point. I agree there should be limits, but I also think there should be compassion to and some of the current requirements are splitting up couples - most countries allow the partner to be in the country during the Visa process, so not to split them up, on a 'bridging visa', for example. Being away from your partner for nine months if a fucking long time, and people have pointed out that there COULD be human rights issues on this (I've not read about this enough to know, but there is an ongoing court case).

*Any number is very high for tonnes of couples but the line has to be drawn somewhere, if you drew it at a point where it included everyone in society then there would be no point in having a limit at all, no?*

Yes, but why is that line made at seemingly random? Why have a savings requirement that is really fucking high? This particularly threshold is very very high for a high proportion of industries for anyone below the age of 25 - probably near-impossible for most graduates. 

*The six month wait (and entire thing) is obviously designed to have you prove that you have steady, consistent income, in Britain, above the threshold.*

Again, I repeat the statement about why can't the partner be here on a bridging Visa during that time (not on any benefits)? Why force a couple (perhaps with children) apart to tick a box?

Markovic will need at least a half a season to get himself situated in the EPL and even then, he will have some developing to do to catch our other young players. What we're buying with Markovic is his obvious and immense potential, and we'll have to be careful to make sure he reaches that potential. He isn't coming into the team as a player who is already better than our current options. He may well get better than them quickly, but definitely not yet.

With that in mind, I'd shift Lallana to the left and play Coutinho through the middle. Lallana and Enrique should work very well together and we looked our deadliest playing Coutinho centrally last season. He just makes our transitions so smooth and fast. Once we swapped him for Allen things moved slower and we didn't seem to have as much of a cutting edge when moving forward. He really improved defensively too and I see no reason why that wouldn't continue. We also know that Lallana is very effective playing to one side as he often did for Soton and that Coutinho is diminished a bit when confined to the flank. 

I think Johnson is ultimately better than Flanagan right now too. Maybe he's been a bit too comfortable and the fact that Flano is able to put pressure on him now will get him back into gear, because he is definitely a much better player than he's shown us the past couple of seasons.

If it's a decision between eating healthy food or going out and getting pissed, I'll take the healthy food option. If it's a question of getting fat or doing a bit of sport to stay in shape, I'll take doing a bit of sport. No matter how pissed I have been, I have never had a kebab or other shit takeaway food.

Making decisions is hard. A lot of people make easy decisions but these are often the poor decisions.

In my world, if I ran the NHS and people were showing up drunk or with injuries caused by drinking, I would charge them for any care they receive. That would be one way to start tackiling this disease we have amongst us at present. And it is a disease. A social one.

I am not discussing climate change. My question is who exactly decides when the debate is over. Do we have to wait for 97% of those surveyed by the Journal of Whatever to agree?

There are many marvellous examples of dissenters overturning a previous consensus, but there are plenty of academic fields which claim scientific authority that reinforce a given worldview by snuffing out dissenters, for instance by refusing to publish their work in respected journals or granting them tenure.

Science should be predicated on the notion that no theory is safe, and it is resoundingly unscientific to prevent the airing of dissent. The attitude that the public should be insulated from hearing opposition views, however crankish, is authoritarian, and not a move any liberal should celebrate.

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"i set myself an ultimatum last night;

im so horrified with the extent of this latest scandal that if by next election, this has no ballooned into something huge and overarching, touching all areas of government and power where this stuff seems rife, then i will completely remove myself from this society. 

im so sick and tired of being labelled a conspiracy nut, or a cynic or just ignorant because i believe in theories that hint at major conspiracies involving the world power elite, especially in the UK and USA. I for one have already become so disenfranchised with politics and austerity and all the other bullshit we are fed to distract from the fact that the world is a playground for the rich and powerful, whilst the poor are institutionalised or bargained with in order to provide statistics or figures that serve to get stricter laws passed. i am sick to death of reading that the same people my parents voted for, that their parents voted for or supported or just looked up to as role models are turning out to be filthy old men with too much money and power and not nearly enough oversight. 

many more people should be taking far bigger issues with this whole scandal. to think that some tv show nonce and a few old dead politicians are being thrown under the bus to wall off and protect the far more serious cases is anything but a cover up, then you are deluded.

whilst i realise it is a major logical fallacy to assume that because this one conspiracy is evidently very much real that this means all other conspiracies must also be true.... i still feel very strongly that this kind of far reaching scandal is only evidence of a much greater crime, one perpetrated by the very people in society we should be able to look to for protection and as advocates for us, not for themselves and their ill intentions.

how more people are not grabbing pitchforks and demanding massive political shakeup is beyond me. this stuff makes me seriously angry and it is fast approaching a pinnacle where i personally feel that violent political upheaval will be the only possibility of any kind of reform from here on.

as i see it, if we let this slide, let the politicians named in these dossier files who are still living and holding seats of power continue to hold those seats, then we are sealing our own fate for generations to come. never before has ""out with the old, in with the new"" been more relevant than it is now. we need these monsters outed, hung, drawn and quartered before all of society. only through making examples of every one of these scumbags can we hope to move to a better society. it is my oppinion that the interests of these minorities are obviously being catered to in ways that regular citizens cannot begin to imagine. how it has gone on so long is not really the issue, the issue is now why non child abusers are covering up for the real abusers. to me this speaks volumes about how far into the top tiers of politics and power this thing really goes. i would not be at all surprised to hear that someone like David Cameron himself, or maybe Tony Blair or another major political figure from the past decades is heavily implicated in all of this.

I cannot express enough how angry i am. im angry at our parents generations for voting these people in, and again for now shrugging this off as some ""dark days"" of british politics that we have now moved on from, and that simply by exposing a few names here and there that we can hope to right these wrongs. there will never be any justice for the untold number of victims. the only thing we can strive for now is complete overhaul of the system, either by systematic purging of our government, lords and possibly more, or by complete and utter destruction of the power elite.

We paid £800, in Feb this year. Now I think we got an absolute bargain at that price, for what he did and the hours he worked, but I still reckon you could do better than £2000. 

I think the cost is based largely on the size of the kitchen, as in how many units they'll be installing. You also see to pay a ""convenience"" premium by using the shop's tradesmen. While I can't remember how many units ours was exactly, maybe 9/10, we paid about £5k all in (including white goods etc) from Magnet Trade and didn't go for the cheapest options. Dimensions wise, it's probably about the same size as yours is, maybe a touch larger. 

Magnet estimated £2k for fitting, with a huge delay on start time. Other shops we'd previously looked at before settling on Magnet (*Wiiiiiicks*, Homebase, Ikea, etc) quoted similar, so we hired privately. The work took 4 days, two of which were 7am to 7pm, and our guy also did the elec and water fitting. We paid an extra £95 for a gas safe fitter (essential!) and we did most of the the wall-prep prior to the fit and tiling afterwards. If you're in Essex/East London I can recommend a guy...

So yes, my advice would be budget £2k, aim to spend half that and end up with a spare grand. Picking independant tradesmen is hard, sure, but can pay off.

Anyone on a spouse visa is unable to claim state benefits for 2-5 years if I remember correctly (depends on the route but in either case it requires a new visa/permit), so that's a load of shite. The idea is that after 2.5 years, the visa is extended and the process to have indefinite leave to remain is started. Seem perfectly reasonable that someone who has come to join their husband/wife would be prepared to go out and work. I understand why they're saying the income should be there, but there should be a means for special circumstances to allow for recent graduates who can reasonably expect to find a job not being shut out by it. 

The point you make about immigration being a huge issue is because people are fucking morons and have no view beyond the end of their nose. What we've ended up with is (as you rightly say) a very harsh limit on skilled/educated workers based on the perception that unskilled labour from Eastern Europe is ruining the country (mostly because there's a Polish shop on the high street).

They have no interest in taking part in political discourse, because they don't care about listening to other views apart from their own. They are exactly the same as the people they complain about, except with slightly different political views.

This isn't about borders - it's about the rights of BRITISH citizens and fellow human beings. It should be a natural right to be in any sort of consensual relationship. If the state then recognises the lifetime commitment of a marriage or partnership , regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation then it has accepted that right. 

Stopping people living together because their partner isn't born here is a basic contradiction of that right. It's against the human rights and the liberal values WE defined for ourselves. 

The rights to services are separate and secondary but UNDERPINNED by primary rights of a) equality under the law and b) freedom from discrimination. So even with benefits and contribution - if it's the right of a BRITISH citizen to have access to services by dint of being British then the BRITISH side of the partnership should not be discriminated against. If it's contribution that entitles one to benefits - then anyone who makes a contribution should have access to those services. 

If you accept the liberal values of this country, then logical end point of those values is to let people marry who they want, and if they have the right by contribution/ or by citizenship be able to access services. 

If those aren't the positions that people hold then there's something intellectually dishonest about the argument they are making. That means that the laws that were passed were done so with political intent and that political intent has nothing to do with fairness or liberal values.

Meeting the guy up front and chatting helped us decide if we wanted to hire him.

When we needed some repointing done we found someone on checkatrade, or a similar site. We then rang round a bunch of his previous clients who said he'd done good work. I appreciate that they could all be plants, but we thought the chances of that were so slim that we just went and hired him.

We found our gas fitters by seeing a gas van parked up in the village. We called the number on the van and he was too busy, so suggested a mate.

KK and Carroll was a mistake that happened because JH was new to ""the game"" and let other members of the organization make a decision out of panic of losing Torres so late in the transfer window with no replacement.

It's a nice thought that he'd want to come fill Suarez's boots but I don't think he's capable of that, not to the extent that we grew accustom to last season. That being said, Luis didn't set the world ablaze until fairly recently, he was our most threatening player for a long time, yes, but he's just recently grown into it.

With Brendan fostering the talent that will be the future of this club, Markovic excites me a lot more than Sanchez. The kid wants to play here for one thing. He gives me visions of Bale with that knack he has for keeping the ball glued to his boot despite all of that pace. Like Suarez, it will take time. If there's one thing our fanbase loves though, it's watching a player rise to the top. We've been very fortunate in the past and that's what I see in Markovic's pace.

I think the sentiment around this sub is that there is a Suarez sized hole in Liverpool's embodiment that needs patched immediately, and I'd only like to remind them that this has happened time and time again with our prized players. The team isn't moving. Stevie isn't hanging his boots up. Trust Brendan sees even more than I do in Markovic and Shaqiri. Frankly, with the signings we've already made I think we're a stronger team than last year, with or without Sanchez or Suarez; I will defend myself from the incoming attack by saying that a lot of Suarez's production was excessive. Lots of times he scored multiple goals in the drubbings we grew fond of handing out around the league. This team may not run the score up, as often, just yet but it will win as many or more games because of the mindness that FSG are paying for on both sides of the ball. If we continue to employ last year's 'team' ethic and buy into what BR is selling, I don't think anyone will be worried about Sanchez in a few months.

The lady he called a bigot had genuine issues, real complaints about pensions and education and training, and because the were valid Brown had some solutions and answers to the queries, but then she undermined all that by suddenly and randomly saying ""oh, and all them Polish...where are they all coming from?!"". That's the irrationality you're saying must be engaged seriously. It's a lose lose as those people can't be convinced their issues can't all be solved by closing borders.

A great example is the recent [khat ban](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-27991393). Despite scientific evidence allaying the fears of the drug the government went ahead and pandered to the fears of the uninformed, because it's good politics. Because those are the people that will complain you're some liberal elitist looking down on them if you don't ""listen to them"".

&gt;

&gt;The __Time War__, more specifically called __The Last Great Time War__, is a conflict within the 50 year old fictional [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoniverse) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. The conflict pitted the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) against the [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;In the *Doctor Who* continuity, the war occurs between the events of the [1996 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and the [2005 revived series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)). It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not thoroughly talked about until the [2007 series finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_of_the_Time_Lords); the two-part special *[The End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time)* (2009) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the anniversary special *[The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor)* which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate.

Sakho, Skrtel and Agger are excellent defenders. We have Illori and maybe Kelly and Wisdom to supplement their numbers. I still can't make my mind up about Toure. Whilst we should always be looking to improve the squad in all positions, it's not a bad crew.

When we gave up goals unnecessarily last year, it seemed to me it was mostly from lofted balls to the post on Glen Johnson's side, or from players being able to run straight up our middle essentially unchallenged. The problem is from a lack of a true defensive midfielder, and from asking full backs to provide attacking width.

Fixing the problem is going to mean Gerrard continuing to improve in a defensive midfield role (or Can or Lucas taking over that duty) and a bit of tactical work on who is supposed to cover what when we lose possession with the full-backs high up the pitch.

He is also a player who didn't really play in any set formation, indeed Rodgers admitted that the team was built around his talent, allowing him movement pretty much anywhere across the front third, so talk about ""changing"" to a 4-3-3 is moot anyway.

The fact is, we aren't going to get in one single player who will score 30 goals (and no penalties). That's the biggest issue for me, because it's certain that Lallana, Lambert and whoever else comes in won't score that many.

It's hardly as if Sturridge can ""step out his shadows"" and score more either, given what a fantastic season he had too.
It would seem to me that we have to accept that we will struggle to score as many goals in the Premiership as last season, and the only way to stay the course as challengers is fix what cost us the title last season: the frankly absurd amount of goals we conceded.

If we get Lallana (meh), Markovic and, say,  Lovrens to come in as first team players, with Lambert and Can as back-up, it would seem that would be as good as it gets.

We have had our fingers burnt badly when given a big chunk of change to replace our top striker before, and I don't think Rodgers will even try.

I would of course be delighted if we did sign a fantastic goalscorer to try and replace Suarez's tally, but I just don't see that player being affordable or available. If he even exists outside of Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo and Luis himself.

I don't think it's a cause for excitement or celebration, regardless of how much Barca give us though, because the team will be weaker without Suarez whoever we buy.

Cambridge has a very large Biotech industry, and there's probably a lot of programming based jobs related to it.  Your experience in the healthcare startup sector will probably serve you well there.

Getting a work visa is going to be a pain.  There's a lot of anti-immigration sentiment built up in the UK (although it's pretty much entirely at the political level, not at the personal level, the british are too polite to dislike people to their face), and it's resulted in a tightening of visa applications.  Any employer going for one has to prove that they can't hire an equally qualified candidate from inside the UK first- which means your best bet is looking for a job that you're highly qualified for, in a niche that you fit perfectly.  It will also cost you a decent chunk of money to get the visa.  With just a Bachelors, you probably don't qualify for a different type of visa, however it might be worth looking into.

Make sure you're aware of visa regulations.  Last I checked, you cannot come in as a tourist, and then try to get a work visa once you're here- you have to apply from outside the country (although that was a few years ago, and they change the regulations on visas frequently, with a full system overhaul about once a year).

Most jobs in the UK have significantly better benefits packages than in the US, and because there's a single payer healthcare system insurance isn't something to worry about.

I sell stuff on eBay, but that has recently gone completely to the dogs, so I'm going back to the UK with no job, nowhere to live and have to hope I can sort things out pretty quickly.  Despite my wife being on the equivalent of 30,000 UK pounds per year with her job she has been refused even a tourist visa because I haven't got an income in the UK.  So, I have to go back, land a better job than I've ever had in my life, get a flat and then hope I can sponsor her over here.  Her work is all online so it makes zero difference where in the world she lives.  

We would like to try for a family visa but it's the same rules and takes even longer.  The thing that irritates me is that we wouldn't claim any welfare and her medical insurance covers her in the UK too (BUPA).  She would be an asset to anywhere, it's me who's the dead loss.  Oh well, I go back on the first of August so I'll see how it goes.  I wish I could stay in Thailand but there's nothing worth getting out of bed for work wise.  I've tried doing several things but nothing does very well.  The eBay thing was good for about a year, but then everyone in Thailand copied me, now it's flooded with Thai vendors.

I'm lucky in that my wife is paying for everything for me while I'm in the UK trying to establish myself, others aren't quite so lucky and have a wife who earns nothing or next to nothing and need to get a job to support their wife too.  Although, I do think this is make or break for me.  If I don't get things sorted she'll no doubt dump me (I can't blame her).  She can't keep hanging on forever and if the UK say no once I have a job then that'll be lights out on our relationship too.  I just can't believe that four years of living with her counts for jack shit.  What infuriates me most is my best friend is Indian and her husband got into the UK on a tourist visa and was granted a family visa almost automatically.  They're both skint.

It is bleeding obvious that academics are not on the same level as journalists. 

You've implied that academics have careers that depend on funding from interested parties, but in truth if they wanted money, they'd take their valuable maths skills into industry. 

You've likened them to journalists who are notorious for misrepresenting the facts and outright lying. When academia is geared around exposing misrepresentation and fabrication of evidence.

So anyone debating with you immediately has to explain to the audience that your statements are emotive, manipulative and wrong. Which takes time: time that is not available in the 5 minute radio slot, and time which people can better spend on work rather than explaining how rhetorical tricks work on the internet.

Government spending is higher in Scotland currently than the UK average, but tax revenue is also higher. Historically, over the past 20 years, the ratio has been lower than the UK average. 

&gt;The upshot being that in an independant Scotland the government would be running up a significantly larger deficit (per capita) than the UK as a whole does currently if spending were to be maintained at current levels.

Very few in the independence debate are calling for funding priorities to remain the same. The UK is extremely wasteful on many counts, a key argument for independence is that a smaller country would be more efficient. Spending on areas falling under the broad category of social provision are what the Scottish Government is aiming to maintain or increase.

Not only do most small companies' HR departments not have the kind of budget to add £310 to their hiring costs for a graduate, the criteria they need to meet are actually very strict. On top of this, they're a paperwork nightmare and end up costing a lot most in man-hours.

One friend (/u/subrosis) was working as an intern at a marketing firm near Covent Garden, who actually told him they'd be able to hire him and sponsor a visa, as they had done so in the past. 

When it came to actually going through with it, they discovered that they now had to prove to some level that they couldn't find *anyone* else who didn't require a visa to do the job. This is unsurprisingly quite difficult for graduate positions as they mostly don't require much experience. 

IIRC, they also didn't mean ""small company"" status and the license would cost the higher band of £1,025. *Additionally*, applying for the license itself also takes some time, adding to the length of the hiring process, which pretty much rules out any company that doesn't already have a license.

The one friend from uni I have who did get a job to sponsor her had to take a job doing an auditing grad scheme for Grant Thornton, having spent a year working for a think tank in Hong Kong. *""No one else qualified to do the job""* generally means they require at least a year of experience.

She didn't really want to do audit, and doesn't particularly enjoy it, and could be doing something much better, if it weren't for the fact that no one except huge companies with established grad schemes were able to hire someone with only a year of experience on a work visa.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"Spurs downfall was that they replaced their main goal scorer, with players who were unable to score goals. Soldado was brought in, but failed to hit the ground running, in fact he hit the ground and never moved for half the season, which caused a huge amount of pressure on the manager because Soldado was supposed to be the marquee signing. 

Then they brought in Erik Lamela, a player who was fantastic for Roma, and he arrived with a price tag of £30M but was rarely played and struggled to make any impact due to injuries and such.

So overall when you look at it, that's 60M of 100M spent and the fans are seeing nothing from it.

Soldado goes on to net 30 goals for Tottenham, and suddenly the fee was nothing, and Soldado is a capable player, its not beyond his reach. Same with Lamela, he plays and creates goals, grabs attention and suddenly the money is not so bad after all. 

Marquee signings only help with the temporary feeling of fans seeing their main man leave, it is always easier to see say a Sanchez or something come in, when you have just lost a top player like Suarez, than it is a few unproven players, if nothing else there is a big assumption that once you have sold your best player, you must replace him using that money by buying an equal player or better player, and that is a lot of pressure on the manager, because football does not work like FM2014.

The facts are Suarez has few if any equal in his overall ability for his position, but there *are* footballers who can score goals, And when you are half way through the season, that is what people will care about. If the club fails to recapture the amount of goals that one player scored, then you are in a very bad position ergo Gareth Bale, who not only scored goals, but scored very important ones too. 

Our problem over the last few years has been that we relied on one player too much, we have done it for Gerrard for years, and I personally would like to see a team develop where goals can come from many sources, not just one person, that way you never end up in positions like this, or positions where the main striker is injured and the whole club looks clueless. So if it means we end up signing a Marokvic and maybe Shaqiri, instead of Sanchez then I think I am OK with that actually. 

I think its all about weighing up the now Vs the future, for now a marquee signing would be great, but if that one marquee signing fails to score or perform to the ability three or four verge of top class players could, then you have a big problem. 


Its the way I see it anyway.

true,Joomes,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Government spending is higher in Scotland currently than the UK average, but tax revenue is also higher. Historically, over the past 20 years, the ratio has been lower than the UK average.

You're, uh... wrong here. If you really want I can dig through my comment history to find links to government spending and taxation reports that show this, but I cba unless you actually want me to go get the links.

&gt; a key argument for independence is that a smaller country would be more efficient.

But would it actually be in reality? I've never seen any studies or data to suggest that government waste (which is enormously hard to quantify in the first place, as it is largely subjective) is smaller in smaller countries or constituencies, nor have I seen anything to suggest that the UK government is unusually wasteful in the scheme of things (in fact, given that the largest 'waste' of public funds worldwide is corruption, the UK actually scores fairly low on that count).

EDIT: Apparently Scotland [has higher than UK average GDP per capita if you include North Sea Oil](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26326117) but lower than average if you do not. Given that currently government calculations put North Sea oil GDP numbers into the total, but not any specific regional GDP, and Scotland receives more government money per capita than the UK average, government figures therefore put Scotland at levels of expenditure over taxation that are higher than the UK average.

This isn't actually necessarily incorrect. There's no good reason to assume that Scotland will just get all of the North Sea oil rights in the event of secession.",1,1404747130,null,0,1404747678,0,ciqos7r,t3_2a18t5,t1_ciqos7r,t1_ciqoldr,null,1434593452,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

&gt; 6.3

&gt; Are there any rules regarding campaign materials?

&gt; Yes. By law, campaigners must use “imprints” on all their campaign material.

&gt; 6.4
&gt; What is an “imprint”?
&gt; All printed material (i.e. posters, placards and leaflets) must include the name and address of the printer and promoter. This is so that electors can be clear about the source of campaign material.
Campaigners must include an imprint on electronic material, such as websites and emails, unless it is impracticable to do so.

That said, their guide notes to campaigners at http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/164422/to-ris-ref-campaigning.pdf do include this in a sidebar:
&gt; We regulate
compliance with
imprints at
referendums.
However, we will not
usually consider
taking enforcement
action where it is
clear from the

true,Rebelius,cnty-uk,Edinburgh,"You're right, the headline is written so that people jump straight to ""tax dodging scum!"". But it says they sold £100m of goods.

There is no mention of how much running a business that sells £100m of shirts costs. If it costs £99m, then they probably shouldn't pay very much tax. If it costs £110m then they shouldn't pay any.

We tax corporations based on their profit, not the value of their sales (revenue). We tax them in a number of other ways, but they're never considered relevant (business rates, income tax, national insurance etc).

International Corporations take advantage of this by artificially moving profits from parts of the company in high corporation tax areas to parts of the company in lower corporation tax areas. They can do this by charging themselves ""royalties"" and licensing fees and things like that. E.g. Dutch Nike charges British Nike almost the same as British Nike's profit for some service, which means British Nike makes no profit and Dutch Nike does make profit (because the service they provide costs very little to them) but pays lower corporation tax. 

This is not illegal. It is not tax evasion. Nike have no legal or moral obligation to pay more tax than they do.

Yes do catch al uncivil discourse. One of the mods q-pop in fact supported [u/QueryingQuail](http://www.reddit.com/user/QueryingQuail) despite the fact that he openly accepted abusing others. Despite this, q_pop or some other mod actually banned the person who was abused.

If the owner cannot be reached after a further period, then the council may apply to the court for a possession order. The council would then effectively become the property owner and landlord, and would be able to rent the property out to private tenants and/or social tenants, depending on the property suitability.

Some portion of rents would by law be be paid into an insurance scheme, which would be used to reimburse anyone who came to claim a property after many years. People would only be entitled to whatever value the property had at the time the council seized it, however - the same as any dormant bank accounts you aren't entitled to interest.

true,heavymetalengineer,null,null,"Here's the problem I had, smoking weed is illegal. Giving 24 blowjobs is not. So there is a bit of a difference. 

also the pretense between the two acts is different. the girl was giving the blowjobs for perceived gain (which turned out to be false) where as you are smoking weed for your own pleasure. 

So, while I don't care if someone wants to smoke, and don't think it should be illegal I still feel differently on these two issues. I feel like the girl was exploited and is now being shamed for her actions while people smoking weed are just getting high and there's not really that huge of a stigma against it, it's only if you get caught and arrested you have a problem. 

I'm finding it hard to make sense here since the parallels between the two things aren't as close as you think. If someone uploaded a youtube video of you smoking weed, chances are it wouldn't go viral and no one would care. This on the other hand has people up in arms calling for this girl to be labelled and shamed for ever, not due to breaking laws, but just due to outsiders' morality. 

So as you can see, there are pretty vast differences.

The other issue is by you lumping them together in your argument you have to ""convince"" people  that both drugs and sexual acts aren't bad. This is the main flaw in your argument, you're making it harder on yourself because you can see parallelisms and you think it's obviously fine, but others may not.

true,ErroneousBee,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; Are you seriously suggesting that academics careers do not depend on funding from interested parties?

Yes. They are funded by disinterested parties. I.e. parties who do not have an agenda other than finding out the answers to specific questions. Parties that want a specific answer won't waste the money on the research.

&gt; Are you also suggesting that the incentives in academia perfectly align with truth? 

No. They align with a preponderance of evidence. Truth is a mathematical or philosophical concept. 

&gt; Plenty of academics have distorted and misrepresented facts on the basis of ideology or the constraints of their trade.

And they get called on it pretty swiftly. E.g. Andrew Wakefield.

Individual academics can go nuts and insist black is white in the face of mounting evidence. [Fred Hoyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#Rejection_of_the_Big_Bang) was one noted Yorkshireman who could not accept a changing cosmos.

Current GERS report puts the UK deficit at 7.3% of national output with
Scotland at 8.3%.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-26541575

However this is in the wake of account Osbourn's oil tax
rise (which disproportional affects Scotland with ~90% of
the UK's oilfields and for which oil revenue contributes ~10% of
the Scottish economy)

http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/110496/uk-legislative-update-uk-oil-and-gas-bareboat-chartering

(An excellent example of heavy handed Westminster policy
having a disproportionate effect on the Scottish economy)

The GERS prior to this put the Scottish deficit at 5%. 


http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scotland-public-spending-deficit-better-than-uk-1-2821963

For the historical data I refer you to the citations collected on Wings.

http://wingsoverscotland.com/information-retrieval/


&gt;I've never seen any studies or data to suggest that government
 waste (which is enormously hard to quantify in the first place,
 as it is largely subjective) is smaller in smaller countries or
 constituencies, nor have I seen anything to suggest that the UK
 government is unusually wasteful in the scheme of things

I was thinking of this and the responses that European countries
were able to take after the financial crash. The UK is expecting
to continue with austerity till after 2018 now.

http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/uploads/downloads/Flotilla_Effect_-_Adam_Price_and_Ben_Levinger.pdf

But there are obvious examples in the context of Scotland and the
rUK in things like prescriptions (I don't have the the source for
this to hand) and university fees.

http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/419954.article#.T7Tcu-Cl6H8

I recall also that Scottish Water and SPT perform better than the
average privatized counterparts in England. To a small extent
Government spending counts higher here than in rUK as a result of
keeping these bodies public. This can make for misleading
comparisons. People in England have to pay seperatly for certain
services which are provided publically in Scotland.

And, to show my politics here, the UK is overfond of overpriced
military projects that are little use in practice. 

Besides, with proportional voting systems and smaller
jurisdictions you are able to attract a better type of
politics. UK funding priorities change course every change of
Government and cross-party cooperation is much poorer in a
two-party system than one that constantly encourages coalition or
minority governments.

Edit: On your edit

&gt;This isn't actually necessarily incorrect. There's no good reason to assume that Scotland will just get all of the North Sea oil rights in the event of secession.

The assumption that is worked on is 90% of oil fields (I don't know the numbers for gas off the top of my head, the majority are in England but there are considerably less of them) based on how national waters are designated between countries. That 90% is what the GERs reports means by ""geographical share"".

Edit: yeah, this is a different form.

In fact, the specific type of form we used doesn't seem to fall under any of the types listed on the site anymore.

Lambert, Lallana and Markovic (hopefully) should be able to bag us a good amount of chances and goals. It may not equal Suarez's total from last season (probably won't), but it should keep the loss manageable.

What I think we definitely need to do with the Suarez money, however, is use at least half of it on our defense. I would rather see us after a center back that is better than Lovren, and at least one fullback that is world class.

We can make up for some of the loss of Suarez on the other end of the field by not conceding as many. That will earn us points too.

So you listed 2 DM's (one of which isn't good enough for us, Mikel) and 3 CM's (one of which could very easily be dropped if we get Pogba, Rami). Then listed Oscar? Why did you do the? He played maybe one or two games at CM. That's dumb.

2. We wouldn't have to move on Mikel. Depending on if he wouldn't mind being a very rare back up, he's someone I'd trust in lesser important cup matches. Although we could bring up a youth for that spot if sold and I wouldn't be mad. I'd really rather sell Rami and keep MvG around for the year in the first team. I was really sick of Rami being a total idiot in nearly every game he plays. If he sorts his shit out, he can maybe take the same place as Mikel, but more as a super sub with more appearances. He can give a big spark to the team whether I like his defensive doings or not.

&gt;Oscar may have to be sold, as I'm not sure where he fits in the team

Why the ***FUCK*** would we sell Oscar? Why the fuck are you even putting him in the discussion of CM's and DM's? He's an attacking midfielder all day, don't be daft. Who would you fill in the AM spot for him? Willian? Then push Schurrle outside? Who's going to back them up for other games? That's just plain stupid.

* The average number of deaths in adults aged 15-64 was 1419 per week between weeks 18 and 25 of this year (2nd May to 18th June). **[Reference - ONS Excel Spreadsheet](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob2/weekly-provisional-figures-on-deaths-registered-in-england-and-wales/week-ending-20-06-2014/weekly-deaths---week-25-2014.xls)**

* That was out of a total working age (16-64) population of 40,373,000. **[Reference - Another ONS Spreadsheet](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/june-2014/table-a04.xls)**

* So from that we can establish that each week 0.0035% of the working age population dies... or about 1400 people. (100/40373000 x 1419 = 0.0035%)

* NOW, if you ignore the fact that people going for ATOS assessments are intrinsically more likely to be unwell, and by extension more likely to die... we also know the unemployment rate for the UK as a whole is about 6.8% (**[Reference - ONS PDF](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_361188.pdf)**). If we expect 6.8% of the 1400 deaths per week to occur in unemployed people... we would expect them to account for about 95 deaths per week.... or 570 deaths every 6 weeks.

* So, we know that in 2011/12 ATOS were paid to carry out 738,000 assessments. Assuming they distributed these evenly across the year, that would mean at any one time about 85,000 people were within 6 weeks of their assessment. 

* So in the 3 years ATOS have been running we would anticipate 14,820 unemployed would people have died. These guys are suggesting in that period about 10,000 people died within 6 weeks of their ATOS assessment. And if at any one time 85,000 (or 3.86%) of them are within 6 weeks of their assessment this isn't necessarily unreasonable once you take into account the fact unemployed people are statistically more likely to die anyway. 

* **tl;dr** My suspicion is that if you look into this further you will find that although there may be one or two exceptional deaths the number is broadly in keeping with the number of people you would expect to die. People who have killed themselves for example as a result of their ATOS assessment have tended to have existing mental health issues. It's very sad, and its very easy to blame ATOS... but its also worth remembering that employed people have mental health issues to, and employed people also kill themselves. They also get hit by cars and they also die of illnesses. ATOS probably do have issues with service provision and quality... but I think this argument that they are causing people to die is absolutely absurd... and any attempt to prove it with roses is using deceptive emotional imagery to convey statistics that are not born out in reality.

I graduated in 2012 as well, right when they tossed the Post Study Work visa out of the window. It destroyed any chance I had of getting a job in the UK because hiring foreign nationals with tier 2 visas weren't worth the money in engineering.

2012-2013 I lived with my british girlfriend out of my savings, applying for jobs and helping her with her medical degree. By Feb 2013 I was empty handed and desperate.

By april I was back in Asia, weeping, raging and living empty. I couldn't hang on any longer just in case the gov wanted to decide I overstayed and blacklist me. I've heard blacklisting carries a 10 year ban from entry. In the end, I paid 400 pounds to move my flight by 3 days to get every last hour with my girlfriend.

There's not a day I wake up and I don't miss her. We gave up sticking together 9 months ago. I still have dreams about us walking around yorkshire together. I miss climbing the hills in a hot breeze, just the 2 of us wondering how we'll find our way back to town once there's no more buses.

When I first started my job here as an engineer, I thought daily how much I'd lost, the frustration and anger still comes back every time I hear the fucking politicians gearing up for another dick move.

I was even willing to go back to my temp job which I had from uni. Wiping hospital beds, scrubbing toilets, and getting shouted at by nurses for 8 quid per hour seemed like a fantastic career choice just to reposition myself in the UK. However, with the govt's idea of how we're unworthy scum and their cancellation of our visa schemes, there are no opportunities any more.

By my current reckoning, to score enough points for re-entry on a working visa it'll be 10 years from now.

I may not have been born in the UK, but on the day I left, it felt like I was being ripped from my mother's arms as a child. I was a part of it and it was a part of me. I was acclimatised. I built myself in. I didn't hole up in the local chinese community and avoid learning English. I went out, and met people. Local people. I met the love of my life in 2010, by 2011 we were inseparable. It felt like such a waste that after I grew a Yorkshire accent, it was time to go.

They benefit politically and financially from filling up empty homes (putting people in temp accommodation isn't cheap...), they also have ways of encouraging properties to be occupied (higher empty charges, higher 2nd home charges, gently poking owners to ""remind"" them that the prop is empty). All of this is supported by laws currently in place, so clearly central government DOES think that local Councils should be getting involved with this issue...

What you're saying is as stupid as saying that the local school shouldn't be involved with hosting after school clubs. It's literally part of their fucking remit, it doesn't get any-more ""to do with"" than that... This isn't Somalia, the government is always trying to influence peoples actions. Increasing/decreasing tax is an absolutely basic, thousand year old way of influencing the actions that people make. 

In addition to subtle incentives the Councils can enact, they do also potentially have the power to force an owner to rent out the long term empty property (not 2nd homes) to a tenant,  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/14949/152870.pdf

Honestly, this subreddit right here. I like liverpooloffside.sbnation.com as well; you'll see news faster on here but if you prefer reading something a bit more professional or only want to see the most important stuff, that's a good filter. 

&gt;  the players

In terms of who they are, you can find the squad list on the official LFC site. The top players right now (not counting Suarez, who is out the door) are probably: Gerrard, Sturridge, Sterling, Lallana (new), Coutinho, Skrtel, Sakho, Agger, and Mignolet. But since it's the off-seasons transfer window right now, the next couple months will be mostly full of new signings, players getting sold, and lots of bullshit rumors about transfers. The key here: don't believe anything is a done deal until it has been officially announced by the club. We've all seen lots of deals that journalists said were ""done"" fall through. Also, NEVER post that Ron Paul gif in this sub. 

&gt; Premier League

Here are the teams this year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Premier_League#Teams

The format is a 38-game season; every team plays every other team twice (once home, once away). 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, zero for a loss. At the end of the season, whichever team has the most points wins the league. If two teams have the same number of points, the winner is chosen by goal difference. There is no playoff system, but there are two domestic competitions (the FA Cup and the League Cup) that operate like traditional bracket-based elimination tournaments. These are played concurrently with the Premier League and results in one don't affect the other (lower-league teams also play in the tournaments). This year, Liverpool will also be in the Champions League, whch is basically the same format as the World Cup with the best clubs from all over Europe. 

Also, the lowest three teams in the Premier League are relegated at the end of the year (kicked down to a lower league). The three top teams (sort of, it's actually a little more complicated but not important) from that lower league replace them.

&gt;who are the rivals

Manchester United: FUCK Manchester United.

Everton: The other team in Liverpool, local rivals. This isn't so much a hate thing as with Man U, but we always want to beat them and finish above them in the league. 

Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea, and maybe Spurs (Tottenham Hotspur): Rivals in the sense that they're the other top teams right now and we'll be competing hard with them for the top spots in the league. 

&gt;the best place to stream the matches

If you have access to cable TV, they're all on NBC Sports. Alternatively, NBC Sports also streams them online for free, so if you can borrow the account of a friend with comcast (or whatever other cable providers support it) you can also stream for free online at nbcsports.com (I think) or in their app (Live Extra). Alternatively the usual places like firstrowsports work if you want to watch shitty streams. And you can also watch full games online with an LFC TV subscription, but they're delayed like 24-48 hours I believe, so you can't usually watch them live.

You should also learn a bit about the club's history. Start here, watch this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6SAI6I5OGY&amp;list=PL64E8FB4005C66A3E

That was 4yrs ago. Now the situation is different. I have my degree, my wife has too, with plenty of experience. And I have a choice between separating from my wife and child, moving home to look for a job, then sitting around for six months before they can apply for a visa; or not living, and raising my family in the country I was born and raised in. 

Or We could move to the EU and live there til my wife gets naturalized there, but neither of us speaks a foreign language, and that's way too big of a gamble to take when we have our daughter to think about. 

I basically feel completely abandoned. The US is great, but for reasons too lengthy to go into, we feel like things aren't really working out for us here. The thing is, we are both educated, driven people; we both want to work. In fact, the fact that my wife would have to be unemployed for six months at least after moving home is a major drawback for her; it's not like either of us is going to be a drain on the economy. there is literally no reason for preventing us from moving home, and yet we can't because of some ridiculous law that views every case in black and white. The only saving grace is that because my daughter has a UK passport, I don't need to be earning £24000 to cover her as well as my wife.

I think it's fairer to say that we can only guess what else they've been up to.

The word ""conspiracy"" suggests a bunch of people having meetings, plotting - that might well be what happened in the News of the World phone hacking case, but I think there's a lot of malfeasance that's just the odd person here or there.

If you look at some of the Savile reports, there were a lot of people at the top saying ""this 4th hand rumour about Jimmy is just silly talk"", because he was a mate and because he brought in all this charity money. There's no evidence they knew any more, only that they didn't *want* to know more. Meanwhile it was impressed upon those at the bottom what an important guy Sir Jimmy OBE was.

For a while when I was at a previous job there was a period when about once a month a dead hard-drive would turn up in my department - it belonged to my employer, but no-one had responsibility for it and it was not accounted for. Often these were under warranty, so they became a source of new hardware for my home computer projects - I'd slip the dead drive in my pocket when I left after an evening shift, and file an RMA when I got home.

I don't really feel guilty about pinching these hard-drives, because the whole workplace environment was shitty - incompetence was rewarded. The drives went unaccounted for, and the warranty unclaimed, due to the oversight of a lazy manager in the adjacent department, and I justified taking them as ""it would've been thrown out, otherwise"". I suspect there are plenty of £100,000 and million-pound crimes which are committed by politicians just as easily and casually as I committed my workplace pilfering.

We know the unemployment rate is 6.8% (or about 2.2 million people)... if there are 1400 deaths each week in adults aged 16-64 then we would expect 93.2% of those deaths to occur in employed adults and 6.8% of them to occur in unemployed adults... assuming we are ignoring the fact unemployed people are inherently more likely to be ill (as a cause of unemployment) and therefore more likely to die.

Now the numbers are slightly distorted by the fact that not all working age adults are employed or unemployed... some fall into a third broad group where they are excluded from the actual number of ""employable"" adults from which the unemployment percentage is calculated.

true,ashinator,lfc68,,"I think Rodgers and the transfer committee had it in their plan that Suarez would not stay for a long plan and had something in mind if that happens. 

What the transfer committee want to do is to buy young talented players that are undervalued like Coutinho, Sturridge and Emre Can. Then develop them into stars, most of the times they are not going to go straight into the team. So what Rodgers have done is to buy Lallana a player who will go straight into the team, even though he had to spend way more than he wanted, 5 mill more at least. He gets a player who goes straight in. 

It seems like Rodgers did not really want Sanchez at the start and rather keep Suarez, but if Suarez leaves Liverpool needs someone who can go straight into the first team and create some chaos in the defence. 

Liverpool as a team last season had so manny missing parts to be a great team like a decent LB + RB and a stable CB pair. Defensive midfield was lacking therefore they bought in Emre Can who will give Gerrard a time for his money. Offensively Lallana was brought in as Moses replacement. Lambert for Aspas. Those transfer where coming if we where keeping Suarez or not. Now with Suarez leaving it seems like Rodgers want 1 striker + Markovic and Shaqiri to replace him. 

Then buy Lovren for someone to play together with Sakho. Moreno for LB and keep Johnson for the last year of his contract before he gets replaced. 

After this transfer window our team does not really have any weakness if Moreno, Lovren, Markovic, Shaqiri + lets say Huntelaar is arriving.

Personally I have heard mixed reviews about Ikea installers, so I would hire privately using sites like [check a trade](http://www.checkatrade.com/) or [rated people](http://www.ratedpeople.com/) (We have used the latter almost exclusively since moving into our place and have only had great experiences from it!). Ikea don't have actual trained fitters, they just use local approved companies to do it so you can have a great experience or a bad experience, depending on who you get. I also think Ikea are more expensive than a private company. 

For reference, we are in the midst of doing the kitchen now and we have done it for £3100 (but we are installing it ourselves) which breaks down to:
£1,450 (roughly) for the kitchen itself
£300 for the electrics + installation of a hood, oven and hob.
£500 for plastering the entire room.

HOWEVER, having said that as I have said elsewhere, being found fit to work and dieing do not intrinsically imply wrongdoing. Lots of people (especially working age adults) die (1400 per week of which about 95 would be expected to be unemployed). Without knowing the cause of death it is impossible to tell whether the ATOS assessment process if faulty. It's also worth noting, it isn't ATOS' job to tell if someone will be alive in 6 weeks... their job is to tell whether that person can work, and there will be many examples where someone might die in 6 weeks, but can actually work. 

For example someone with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) could be fit for work during their ATOS assessment, but 5 weeks later develop an acute exacerbation of COPD which kills them... that isn't ATOS fault and it was correct for ATOS to say they should be working. Their death was an unfortunate complication of their condition, but not one that should prevent them from working for life, as infact many people have COPD and many will continue to live (and hopefully work) for many years, exacerbation free.

And infact, if you look at the most common causes of death in working age adults you will see they are largely from difficult to predict ""chance events"" like cardiovascular disease, accidents, stroke, suicide etc. Obviously those cases where someone has an established palliative diagnosis and is found fit for work are slightly alarming... although having said that, a person with an indolent but palliative condition like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis might actually be legitimately fit for work for a significant period of months or even years before they should be signed off... as it usually takes about 3-4 years to die from the point of diagnosis.

Similarly, it is not ATOS fault for failing to know that someone they assess will accidentally step infront of a car and die in 3 weeks time. Their remit is to tell if someone could work during the assessment period, not to use the power of clairvoyance to predict the future.",0,1404756676,null,0,1404757303,0,ciqtor2,t3_2a2270,t1_ciqtor2,t1_ciqtcrv,null,1434595481,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

It's no doubt that Pellers had influence in the tracking of both Ferna and Navas, as we had been rumored in on them and it's known that MP was clearly in contact for a long period of time. There will definitely be moving and shaking, but how can we know that any other GK will be this value with this kind of working level with the current team?

&gt; it's not fair not accurate to simply ""assume"" that people who kill themselves do so because of ATOS.

My son was severely disabled in the 91 Iraq war. He was found fit for work by ATOS. The pressure he was subjected to from places like the Job Centre and then the convoluted appeals process (where he was treated as if he was faking his disability) was so severe it brought back anxiety problems and he briefly went through another bought of PTSD where he is now having to be treated for anxiety/depression via medication.

I shudder to think what would have happened to him had we not been here for him, or for any other person with a mental illness that doesn't have emotional support.

Simply looking at stats doesn't give any idea of the realities of vulnerable people dealing not just being declared fit for work, but manor in which they are treated. 

Having somebody call my son job shy, or having his money stopped because he can't travel to a distant place (no job centre in the village he lives and he can't use public transport) at an exact time (and no excuse for being late) for an appointment that you are not allowed to reschedule, puts a tremendous amount of pressure on somebody who previously was dealt with supportively through the benefits system.

As a disabled person, he was treated with respect. People understanding what disability means, know that appointments can't always be kept. Know how vulnerable a disabled person can be emotionally (not mental health issues, just the effects of living with chronic pain can cause). 

As an unemployed person, he is workshy, avoiding job interviews. Given no flexibility with appointments to account for his disability (Remember, ATOS aren't arguing he isn't disabled, just that his disability doesn't prevent him working), all the while trying to get ATOS to reassess him again (which is a waste of time and serves no purpose other than keeping him in the statistics for number of people back in the market for jobs), so that finally he can get an independent tribunal where a Judge will make a ruling which is an enormous amount of stress, even for a well person.

Which brings me to

&gt; it's not fair not accurate to simply ""assume"" that people who kill themselves do so because of ATOS.

It's not an assumption for those of us involved in the process. People have taken their lives because their protections were removed. Others have died because the stress has been too much for their bodies to endure. I have a number of stories I could tell of individuals who's lives have been cut short as a direct result of the process that follows an ATOS assessment. Would they be dead anyway? Impossible to tell, but I'd bet their survival chances would be much higher without the added burden of being treated like a criminal and their financial stability being removed. Particularly is the disability is a mental one.

(Sorry to unload on you. But something about the line I quoted really got to me. Strangers to the situation don't realise what's involved and statistics are a cold dismissal of a real and current serious problem in the care of our most vulnerable.)",0,1404758475,null,0,1404758704,0,ciqunuz,t3_2a2270,t1_ciqunuz,t1_ciqsokv,null,1434595940,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,MrJDMTyte,num23,,"The big difference between us last year and Liverpool this year is that Liverpool aren't really buying too replace. Only a couple of their transfers are players that will be making regular appearances in the first team. They are building a full squad rather than making an attempt at strengthening their entire first team, because they will have many more games next year with champions league. 

We bought a 7 excellent players, plus 2 returning from loan, all of which could be starters. On top of that, we sold a lot of our players and sent a few familiar faces on loan. What we were left with was basically an entire new team, plus a couple of veterans. 

I don't think Liverpool will have the same problem unless they try and force everyone into their first team. We had no real identity last year and a big part of that was that we had no solid starters that new how to play with each other.

I do however think Liverpool have made some bizzare transfers, and have been pretty wasteful with their money. History will tell you Liverpool have never been great at making top class transfers, and typically over spend on shite. Lallana for 25 million is ridiculous as I don't see him as a starter (and it seems like he'll be played out of position and shoe-horned in), Origi for 10 million could be a good pickup but he's very raw and unproven. Then there's the issue of their defence, they've spent a lot of money on attacking players so far but have spent nothing on their back line, which was fucking abysmal last year. 

They also insist on playing Gerrard and building their team around him, which again personally I think is a big mistake. He's still got it, but I don't think he will for much longer. 

TLDR: Liverpool are strengthening for more games, have made some strange but decent signings. If they don't try and make everyone a starter and continue with their core, they will be as good next year.",0,1404760372,null,0,false,0,ciqvoy3,t3_2a27e6,t1_ciqvoy3,t3_2a27e6,null,1434596557,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;I have been wondering how the club will announce his departure. Will we take the high road and just say something to the effect of, ""Today Liverpool has completed the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona FC"" and leave it at that? Or will the club perhaps go into a bit more detail about the transfer and add a bit of swing to it to try and appease the fan base somewhat? Is it possible that the club sends him off with a bit more of a scathing statement?

I think it will very much be the high road and a very simple statement that announces the transfer and wishes Suarez nothing but the best.

To say anything to appease the fans, to me, would be a sign of regret or weakness and even if we did regret it, as a club, that wouldn't be said. A scathing *official* statement? I'd be shocked and disappointed if that happened.

The majority of 'Old Golds' home games last season were called off due to a waterlogged pitch. Which meant our home games were shifted to Llanelli &amp; Port Talbot which meant an even lower gates!

There's talk of Carmarthen getting a 3G pitch, which should help get more games get played, but it's going to cost the club £100k (the other £400k will be paid by the league). I've no idea how they'll fund this. In 2012 the club had a cash balance of £835, and a net-worth of £74k.

The only major thing a summer switch might screw up is 'European matches'. The early qualification rounds would come at the end of a season and later rounds over the winter rest period (if any club actually gets that far).

The only people who would probably reject the idea would be the players themselves.

For me Wisdom should be used this season as a backup for both RB and CB. He should get sub apps and make starts in the Cups. It's time to see if he can perform at Prem level. He looks a better player than both Kelly and Flanagan.

So I feel we do need better quality at both fullback spots.

In spite of our goal-scoring success this season, a vast majority of our goals were scored by two players. Sturridge struggled with fitness at times, while Suarez may not repeat that performance next season (and looks like he won't even be around next season). There is also the issue of our difficulties in controlling the midfield especially when Jordan Henderson wasn't around for a few games towards the end of the season. Then you add our difficulty in creating chances when we needed to create chances the most.

I think that is why we see LFC adding guys like Lallana and Can. Because, in my opinion, once you sort out the defensive side of the midfield and add some creativity in the attacking side of the midfield that will help the defense and the forwards.

true,ErroneousBee,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; Research is expensive, and much of it is funded with an ulterior motive of some sort, 

You are confused about the meaning of scientific research.

Journalistic research is about constructing a narrative and then supporting it with any facts you can find whilst ignoring anything contradictory.

Scientific research is about reproducibility and statistical significance. 

Researchers producing  computational models don't produce models that reflect some political ideal. They produce models that reproduce effects seen in the real world, and use those models to gain insight into what factors are responsible for effects in the real world. To act otherwise is to believe that computational models can somehow influence the system they are modelling.

And being expensive (which is also not necessarily true) means you want the most accurate answers, if you are making data up, you may as well skip the expensive bits and go straight to the fabrication (which is what notorious frauds have done in the past, skip the actual work).

&gt; I'm sure many academics wish to study things only for their own sake, but to claim it is mostly motivated by those without an agenda is simply not true, or even realistic.

Other than that the [National Trails](http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/) are really good. There are 15 long hiking trails, mostly 100km - 300km long. The website I linked above has all the information on each trail like its distance, how long it takes to walk it and where it goes etc. You can walk or cycle 1 section in 1 day or do the whole thing in a week or two. There is a new path opening up this year which runs along the South West Coast which is over 1000km long which would take you about 1 and a half months to walk (at 24km a day)!

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"&gt;I think you've missed my point really... which was that regardless of whether ATOS drives people to take their own lives, jobs also drive people take their own lives

Your point wasn't lost, I just don't agree with it. Yes, people in work take their own lives. You are comparing people who are (normally) able to live an independent life with those that are not. 

If you aren't able to cope with even leaving the house on a normal day and then suddenly are thrust upon the world with no support or safety net, that's going to affect you a lot more than it would a depressed office worker, who while at that moment may not be able to cope, he's otherwise able to have a standard of living well above the former.

Then of course he used to have a healthcare system that he could go to to get help, even if it meant giving up working for a while. Now the reality is him having to face an Atos assessment before he can and the very real possibility he'll be assessed as fit for work.

Perhaps some of those statistical suicidal workers might have been still living with a more helpful and supportive benefit system? And maybe some of those were previously given full support, but had an Atos assessment and were forced into the workplace?

&gt;which is to rationalize how unemployment and disability benefits are managed.

That's the governments job. Atos are contracted purely to carry out assessments. They deserve no sympathy as they are doing exactly what they were contracted to do. And they are doing a bad job. More later about this.

The particulars of ATOS's contract and behaviour would need a post of it's own to even scratch the surface of the problems caused. And why so many whistle blowers have left the company with shocking tales of the lack of ethics being show by management in order to satisfy targets.

For the sake of simplicity, I'll quote a bit of the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Capability_Assessment) regarding this contract and the subject of deaths.

******

&gt;Dangerous conclusions and deaths[edit]
&gt;
&gt;Government statistics reveal that between January 2010 and January 2011, 10,600 sick and disabled people died within six weeks of being assessed. Government statistics also revealed that in terms of those who had been found 'fit for work' in particular, 1300 of those people died shortly after being declared fit for work by the Work Capability Assessment. Atos and the UK Government have usually responded to the 10,600 figure by questioning its authenticity, but its advocates vehemently defend the number's accuracy and allege that if anything, the number is not less but more, as the figure keeps increasing through to the present day. In mid-January 2012, there was a significant scandal as media were alerted to the fact that the WCA had found a man in a coma to be 'fit for work'.

&gt;Work Capability Assessments have found patients with brain damage, terminal cancer, severe multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's Disease to be fit for work. On 24 April 2013, a woman who was a double heart and lung transplant patient died in her hospital bed only days after she was told, after a Work Capability Assessment, that her allowance was being stopped and that she was fit for work.

&gt;In August 2011, twelve doctors working for Atos as disability assessors were placed under investigation by the General Medical Council because of allegations of misconduct in relation to their duty of care to patients.

******

Man in a coma. I'll let that sink in for a moment. This goes far beyond simple mistakes or errors. It's part of the process.

I know none of these deaths can be proven to be linked to the assessment, but when you look into this as I have, there's a lot of circumstantial evidence which shows the types of disabilities people are dying from mirrors the types of disabilities that are being passed off as fit for work.

It's not just x number of people dying and x number of people who failed the assessment, it's the type of people who are failing the assessment happen to be particularly vulnerable and that doesn't appear to be an accident.

From our own experience of talking with others going through the same thing, people are being picked out if they are either unlikely to appeal, or unable (I've just deleted a few paragraphs relating to this as I realise it's getting off topic and since I can't provide sources to back it up, isn't proof of anything, but at each assessment, the initial questions are in a hostile tone and if you become submissive, you fail. Mass oversimplification, but the best I can do without a lot of additional paragraphs.).

This has nothing to do with the needs of the assessed, but rather how easy it is to classify them as fit for work. What happens afterwards doesn't affect Atos. They are paid to assess. If the assessment was bad, the tax payer pays for the appeals process. Atos get paid regardless.

And in case you thought that there might be some redeeming qualities to be found in saving tax payers money from all those pesky spongers falsely claiming benefits

&gt;WCA appeals tribunals tell a different story. The WCA – dubbed by one MP as a ""crude computer test"" – is notorious for delivering seemingly incomprehensible decisions. Tales of claimants with terminal cancer who are found fit for work, for example, have become a stock local newspaper story. There have been over 600,000 appeals against fit-for-work decisions in recent years, clogging up tribunal courts and costing the taxpayer over £60m a year. Nationally, four out of 10 appealed decisions succeed. Where claimants have expert representation this figure rockets. Oxfordshire Mind reported recently that a startling **98% of WCA appeals taken up by its advisors on behalf of mentally-ill clients were successful**.

[Source](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/27/atos-contract-end-relief-campaigners)

You know statistics. Of the claimed thousands who have either stopped claiming before their assessments or didn't appeal. How many of them simply got better and the Atos contract had no bearing on them? 

Anyway, as I said, sorry to chew on your ear.

It's obviously a thing if you're cycling to go from coast to coast just for bragging rights but if you're more into taking in some different towns and countryside I'd consider including Chester and York as start/finish points, and focusing on The Lakes area of the trail, with lots of lazy pub lunches between.

On a different note away from solid trekking, if you want to see another side of the UK a week pootling around in a hired boat on the Norfolk Broads is an awesome, chilled holiday for family or friends.  Live on the boat, cruise for a couple of hours, berth up in a new countryside village each day.  Do a little exploring.  Find a new countryside walk.  Find *that* particular pub for lunch.  Everybody chipping in for the accommodation makes it quite easy to do on the cheap too.  Pack up a car with as much as you can; bikes, fishing rods, DVDs,...whatever.  Pile it all into your boat when you arrive and it's home from home.  Pick where you go and when, plot your own journey, and slowly make your way to the arranged drop off at the end of the week.

No hills in Norfolk though, if you're a bit of a hill walker.
