Don't filter through a right turn UNLESS YOU ARE 100% SURE nothing is turning right or a car is coming out of the turn into your filtering path.

As you approach a car, look in the drivers mirrors at their eyes to see what they are doing. Also look at their wheels, are they turning? that can give you an extra half a seconds warning before the car moves. Also handy for cars waiting at junctions.

Is there a gap up ahead? Slow down in case a car is about to cut through the queue to join the other side of the road.

Watch out for fuckhead pedestrians using a phone while walking through queued traffic.

Take it slow. I filter only 5-10mph faster than the traffic is going. There is a shit tonne of information going through your brain filtering in London. I don't give a damn when guys come up much faster than me. I pull in, let them go past and carry on at my own pace. I haven't had near miss while filtering in a very long time.

Given that the issue here is mainly about avoding kids getting the message that objectification of women is OK at a very young age - I think we can agree that the cover of Men's Health isn't causing an issue here - and the interviewed mother initially mentions her son looking at a paper with an ""upskirt shot of a woman"" - are you sure you're not using a ""thin end of the wedge"" type argument?

Having said that, I note that the group is also campaigning against certain language in headlines which seems going a little far, not least because children don't know the words automatically and parents don't have to tell them in great detail about what those words mean (akin to: ""What am I going to tell my child when they ask me what gay marriage  is?!"". That might be hypocrisy on my part, of course.

As an amusing aside, I notice that at the end of the report mother asks son which magazine he likes: ""Do you like the Spiderman one?"" Given that one of Spiderman's chief activities is kicking the shit out of crims, I'm reminded of the South Park movie: ""Excessive mindless violence is OK, so long as nobody says any naughty words.""",0,1416749581,null,0,false,0,cmalt30,t3_2n3wm7,t1_cmalt30,t1_cmakpcd,null,1425883460,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You're underselling it. Just go on /r/spacedicks and you've got more fucked up content on 1 page than we got in months. Even films released now shit all over Texas Chainsaw. Those ""extreme examples"" are just the tip of a huge iceberg which we have little power over without helicopter parenting/

&gt;I know I never want to and was brought up with a mind of my own to decide such things for myself) as a reason to cut their kids off from everything

Bully for you! You're clearly a much better person than me because I'm a sheep and I watched that video. I imagine most kids are as inquisitive as you and wouldn't care to see what the fuss was about, right?

&gt;If Tesco's newspaper display is such a small thing...if it's so irrelevant to today's connected world...then why did they campaign so vigorously for the change?

You should ask them, because they haven't changed anything else. Kids are still exposed to the same horrible things, day after day. They won't even be reading newspapers when they grow up as the internet provides all the media they could ever need. If that's how they choose to spend their time, that's up to them.

Is this campaign going too far? Probably. I don't think it will really protect anyone for the reasons I've already mentioned. But we as kids weren't exposed to anywhere near this level of questionable content. They will need to get on with that internet ban, and proxy ban, and VPN ban, and ban whatever other workarounds are found if they are going to get close to the good-old-days where casual racism and the occasional gorefest film is the worst we have to worry about.",0,1416750094,null,0,false,0,cmalxgv,t3_2n3wm7,t1_cmalxgv,t1_cmalfmd,null,1425883402,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- Register in the UK, for god's sake - accountancy is complex at the best of times, and avoiding/evading corporation tax by suddenly trading out of Ireland is just being shitty. Corporation tax rates are similar to Income Tax anyway.

- I was paying less tax on my earnings than if I was PAYE employed, but you lose benefits that negate that extra money - sick pay, paternity/maternity etc, but also the lost time it takes to do admin.

- A week off with the flu/man flu suddenly costs day rate * days taken off, which can be upwards of £2000 lost in this sector. I'd not considered this before I started, but after being ill, I had to make up the days afterwards - it caused extra stress at a time when I didn't need it.

- IR35 is a real risk, especially if you're only working for one company over a long period of time. They usually want to see that you've advertised your services, and worked for multiple contracts (or received income from several sources, like affiliate income etc)

The idea is to employ a number of strategies because you can't rely on just one of them working when we owe that much money - remember, this is still ongoing and there's going to be *more* pain whoever gets elected next, but concentrating on one or two strategies and asserting it's all a secret plan because Tories-are-evil (etc.) doesn't do much other than get what could be valid concerns ignored.

I entirely disagree. By definition, it is exploitative as the employers are breaching the law to pay someone less than they are entitled to. This is more like catching fraudsters than witches.

&gt; If an employee feels he wants to work for less than the minimum wage, we should not actively try and disrupt his will.

We absolutely should, as he is devaluing basic human labour and keeping wages down at a time when they so desperately need to rise.

&gt; The current situation is the best of both worlds - it provides protection for employees while allowing for flexibility in arrangements. It is Win-Win. 

I would say that it's a win for unscrupulous, greedy employers and a loss for everyone else. I cannot believe that 287,000 people are voluntarily working for less than what they are legally entitled to. The current job market is heavily weighted against employees and I feel that there is likely pressure for people to 'stop whining' and 'get on with it'.

Bringing in Paul Mitchell to help instill a similar philosophy here at Spurs may well be a good move- but it's surely a bigger task than simply joining a successful setup that was already existing at Southampton?

But he looks fucking clueless.

The formation just doesn't work, the players playing dont work. 

Its the same fucking thing every single week. Like literally, the formation and players are exactly the same, even though theyve not worked. 

Yes, we've been plagued with injuries, but we spent fucking 150 million or whatever the figure was last summer to build the squad, and yet were playing as if we have a squad of 14. Its predictable, bland and just poor management.

Out best performance this season was against Madrid in my opinion. Yet Rodgers drops all the guys that played that game for the stale side that's been playing every single week. 

If you see that the defence isn't playing well, either put someone else in or give the! more cover. Its not like both options are impossible is it? Kolo could easily be playing their, and we could go with two DMs in Lucas and Can. 

Where has Gerrard played best this season? The ten minute attacking midfield bit he played the other week was for me his best performance. Yet every week he plays this 'Pirlo' role, and every week he gets overun and walked over. Does he get changed? No. Because Rodgers is too scared he'll get beaten if he drops him.

And god damn why is Lallana treated as a rotation player? Fucking hell week in week out hes one of the best players, yet he's benched after 60/70.

First...youngsters that don't quite make Real's 1st team are still expensive players (Morata to Juve for ~£15m for example), and for the most part that would go against what ideally we would be aiming to do (buy low, sell high).

Second....we seem to dislike bringing players in on loan if we can avoid it. Especially younger players. Why develop someone else's talent only to send it back to them?

Third....we really don't like ""buy-back"" clauses.....word was this summer one of the big reasons Morata went to Juve was because they allowed a buy-back to be put in to the agreement. Something i really can't see Levy agreeing to unless that buy-back was guaranteed to be MASSIVE and i can't see Real (or many other teams) agreeing to a massive fee before they know what they are getting.

Fourth.....as we have been hearing for the last 8 weeks, we just didn't have a huge scouting staff.  The likes of Jese and Morata or one thing....high end talent that are in many ways known commodities.

&gt;Where has Gerrard played best this season? The ten minute attacking midfield bit he played the other week was for me his best performance. Yet every week he plays this 'Pirlo' role, and every week he gets overun and walked over. Does he get changed? No. Because Rodgers is too scared he'll get beaten if he drops him.

We've put too much into it to not follow him now. He's shown he can make a team click and you have to give him time. This isn't just a case of Rodgers fucking everything up left right and centre. He's made mistakes obviously but remember all those moments last season where our defence looked absolutely fucking pathetic and the amount of ridiculous scrambles in our box we got away with? Well all of those moments seem to be goals for the opposition now. It's the shit luck we deserve for riding it last season. That, in combination with a general lower standard of performance throughout the team, injuries and Rodger's making mistakes has led to this situation. This is a disaster chain. There's not one particular thing causing it.

Still using Gerrard as a lone DM when it was clear Lucas/Can played WAY better. Still using a lone striker when it's clear two produce. Everything has mounted on to this humiliating defeat. The players are not the problem. They are more talented than Crystal Palace. All signs point to the manager who is causing the team to underperform.

He **KNOWS** like the rest of the footballing world that Gerrard is not, never has been and never will be a world class or even half decent defensive midfielder. He **KNOWS** just like we all do, that Glen Johnson is a useless, lazy, selfish pack of shit and hasn't been even close to a first team standard for a couple of years now. **HE MUST HAVE KNOWN** that in summer, if we lost Suarez we needed to make a like-for-like signing, a Vargas, a Firmino, a Sanchez, a fucking Berahino for christ's sake, not two strikers, both 6 feet with no mobility or industry. Although I understand that the summer is gone and hindsight is wonderful, we had time to prepare and we failed completely.


Now we're stuck with 3 (for the time being) average strikers, a midfield who aren't confident enough to just pass it enough to tire the opposition out (y'know, BR's original plan of playing good possession football?) rather than panic and try to find the quickest possible route to goal, a defensive midfield player who won't be dropped simply through reputation and not form who is costing us goal after goal, a center back pairing that patently **IS NOT WORKING** - and of course poor old Simon. 'But he's a good shotstopper' we all cry, **ANY GOALKEEPER SHOULD BE**, but they should also have the other tools that a top goalkeeper needs; presence, confidence, aggression, distribution - all attributes he's not just lacking in, but lacks almost completely.


I'm LFC through and through, and I do believe it'll get better, but not with the team that played today, not by blind faith in reputation and price tags but by what we all see every single week. Let Toure prove himself again like he did against Madrid, once he's fit let Mamadou Sakho become the heart of the backline, chase after Victor Valdez, swipe him from United so at least Mignolet can learn from him. Bring back Origi, stop rushing Sturridge, bench Gerrard or play him more advanced and let Lucas or Can play as the anchor of the midfield and then *maybe* we'll end up looking something like the side we did last year and concede less. Although I know that's a very ambitious dream to dream.

This year we sit back, let people run at us and when we have possession we just 'try' to play the most simple pass possible and there is no movement. 

Right now Gerrard is offering nothing at all to our play. He is supposed to be the deep laying playmaker who links up the defence and midfield/attack but whenever he gets the ball he just passes it backwards. Unless Rodgers moves Gerrard into a more forward position he shouldn't be playing, Can, Lucas or Allen will be better in the DM/DLP position than Gerrard. 

Johnson.... why is he even a football player any more, he can barely make a simple pass let alone anything else and if it wasn't for Allen protecting him he would have been shown up a lot more than he already has been. 

As for Rodgers, his tactics were completely wrong with the way we lined up today against Palace, it's fine starting like that if you think it was going to work, but he should have changed it a lot sooner when it was quite obvious their LM was getting the better of Manquillo almost every time because he had no protection.

But this is the worst start we've made in 22 years. There's something *seriously* fucking wrong.

&gt;What's the alternative, get a new manager and let that give the players the nudge in the ass they need? Win a few games, then come to another inevitable struggle?

I'm not saying we should sack him yet. I'm agreeing that he needs to be set a target, and if he does not meet it, he's done.

And you've got no idea the difference a change of manager might make.

A mid-table or lower finish will harm sustainability just as much as a change in manager is likely to.",0,1416757151,null,0,false,0,cmao3qn,t3_2n5uni,t1_cmao3qn,t1_cmanyoh,null,1425882388,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;This is more than just a poor start, there’s something wrong.

It’s been happening all season. Liverpool aren’t being beat by quality, they’re being bullied, they’re being beaten by enthusiasm. After the goal Liverpool offered no enthusiasm, no threat. They’re mentally and physically weak. There’s no leadership there. It was the same last year. I’m very worried as a Liverpool fan. Talk about players taking time to settle in, but you’re looking at them and thinking, they need four or five players.

&gt;If you look in the team, there’s no men in the team. There’s not enough people organising in there. Sometimes you’ve got to grind results out. There’s no confidence there so you’ve got to grind through. A game like that’s a perfect illustration. You dig in, you nick a 2-1, or take a 1-1. Liverpool rarely if ever play badly and win.

Second review your diet and lifestyle choices, do you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle? These are bare minimums/ maximums not even close to optimal nutrition. If you already do, work on nutrient dense, anti inflammatory.

Nutrition and physical activity are proven beneficial in stress/ anxiety - daily at least 10,000 steps as recommended by the powers-that-be, foods like oily fish (long chain omega-3s, bioavailable vitamin D, B vitamins), and magnesium rich foods (seeds, unsweeteened cocoa, bran).

Thirdly moisturisers - Eucerin, Flexitol, CeraVe are all great brands. Look for ceramides and urea (5% for face, 10%+ for body) since these are both known to be deficient in eczematous skin.

Begin post:

You all can down vote me into oblivion I don't even care anymore, I support Liverpool like it is my religion. I have the utmost passion and respect for the club and those at it.

We have lost 6 games, 6 games. Let that sink in for a club who finished 2nd last year. Clearly something is wrong, to pinpoint the problems seems hard to do but there is certain factors that havent helped us on our way. Signing Lovren who can't defend for his life for 20 million?! Laughing stock, Markovic who is potential but for 25 million? unheard of. We have slipped farther and farther down the league this season and Its painful to watch, as I watch every game go I'm starting to get used to losing, its feeling like all the work and ""Transition"" we watched Liverpool go through has gone out the window.

Forget pulling a spurs, we are on course to finish in the bottom half of the league and just saying that is unacceptable. I shouldnt have to sit here and type this, Liverpool are LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB, we have been beaten by the likes of Newcastle, West Ham, Aston villa?! What is going on to my beloved club? I dont even know if its tactics, managment or if the players just arent giving there 100% but something needs to change and we have been talking about it for months.

We have had 2 international breaks and during them all we have talked about is how the game back from it is the game where Liverpool push on, where we will start to pick up results. It hasnt happened and this form we are in does not look to be breaking any time soon.

This post might be a bit out of spite of our last game but its my feelings that I have been keeping to myself for too long, downvote me , say Im disillusioned but I love Liverpool as much as any of you, I just need to get all of this off my chest.",0,1416758867,null,0,false,0,cmaorlt,t3_2n6587,t1_cmaorlt,t3_2n6587,null,1425882079,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt; So there's my solutions, which I think the UK could secure from the EU. Get all EU migrants to apply for residence certificates to prove their right to access public services, and reinstate exit checks and an electronic visa regime. 

The residency permit idea seems brilliant: the EU could have a system where a country could negotiate caps on residency permits for a limited time, perhaps. Just the kind of legal fudge the EU seems to like. 
     Absolutely agree we should invest a lot in state of the art border controls.  Public trust in the system is vital for wide agreement for positive policies on integration. The more secure the border controls, the greater the acceptance of existing immigrant communities would be. 

A short-term aim might be to reduce immigration so much that the public might then vote to increase it :) 

&gt;Blair eliminated exit checks and border points back in 1998. I presume it was a cost-saving measure, although there may have been some nefarious intent as well.

I think it was deliberate to encourage both legal and 'illegal' immigration, and overstaying. I did not realise it at first (he was my favourite prime minister); it was only gradually that I realised what New Labour were up to. 
    The political calculations were ingenious.  First, most of the new immigrants would be future Labour voters.  Second, the conservatives would get involved in unwinnable battles to slow the flow or deport 'illegals', years down the road: the more people Labour could bring in, the more political difficulty for the Conservatives later.  Not least, all the new immigrants, many with poor command of English, needed a new public sector industry relating to Equality, Diversity, and Integration: these jobs were new, well-paid, and occupied mostly by fervent Labour supporters. This industry gathered its own momentum. 
     All forecasts of numbers were far lower than what happened. I don't believe a word that Labour says about immigration to this day, therefore.


Why am I negative on immigration?  

The big positive argument: London is buzzing with network effects from the huge number of talented people who have come here.  This is big, but hard to quantify. 

The weak positive argument:  more people = more GDP = more tax =&gt; pay off the debt. Hmmm.  Needs a life-cycle analysis. The lump of labour argument cuts both ways: more people = eventually more government spending also. 

Big negative argument 1:  a melting pot is all very well, but it needs delicate cookery.  All too often, melting pots curdle and separate into communities that define themselves in contrast and opposition to each other.  This is **very** hard to reverse, and can lead to many problems.  
    It looks as if much of the muslim community (or communities?) in Britain is increasingly defining itself as different and separate from 'white' British culture, but that most other immigrant communities (West Indians, Europeans, etc) are seeking to integrate.
    A curdled melting pot is the last thing we should want. Lots of bad effects...
    The current 'cooking policy' in London is to have immigration from many different countries and cultures: as a result there are many communities who vaguely dislike each other. There is no common positive myth to aspire to (as there is in, say, coming to New York).  Danny Boyle tried single-handedly to create one with the Olympic ceremony. It might work, but I suspect there will be distinct minority groups, who regard themselves as separate from 'British' culture, for centuries to come.  

Medium-sized negative argument: increases in GDP are all very well, but they don't measure quality of life.  Positional goods are bid up to higher prices and need to be shared between more people. We all live in boxes: it is hard to rapidly build millions of new boxes for the new immigrants to live in (for many reasons). As a result, we all pay more to live in smaller boxes. This increases GDP but reduces the quality of life, and is a serious social problem in London.
     The obvious solution is to build more boxes.  Existing owners will be happier to give planning consent if they believe that the rate of immigration is low and will stay low. 

...and finally... my intuition is that UKIP is nothing like a proto-Fascist party. It can often look more extreme than it is because it doesn't yet have the level of 'message-control' that Labour achieved, so that the press can grab incautious statements and blow them up.

How can we quantify the effect of immigrants on this country effectively? It's very difficult. We can look at the net contribution from immigrants towards the economy, but this is skewed tremendously by the demographics of this population. And to what extent does this effect people's wages? It doesn't, it just allows an influx of cheap labour in areas such as warehouse work. 

We certainly can look at polling attitudes of people who have lived through this recent push for multiculturalism and live in areas which have been affected by it. We can realise that there are now areas where white people cannot be found, where English is rarely heard on the streets. These areas are close to where I live. Alum Rock is one such example. When the promises of a wonderful multicultral society were being proposed, this was not the image we were promised. We are becoming more fragmented.

Defence is hilarious at times to watch...pretty painful. Too narrow, which I'd imagine has been said 100 times ITT and this season, but that is to be expected when you're playing with ''wide'' players who are on the opposite flanks. It would work but I don't think Soldado is the right type of CF to thrive in that system at all and we're sorely missing Walker/Full Backs who get forward and have pace - that's not Dier's fault and Davies isn't exactly a speed merchant tbf. 

I just feel like in general we're throwing shit against a wall and hoping it sticks recently. Not an insult to our players - I'm in the Pro-Lamela/Soldado/Whoever else is a ''flop'' camp, but we don't have a ''regular'' starting line up (at least it seems that way) and we have lots of ''good'' players but not a great team with the system ingrained into them all. Even looking at our Bench and beyond you'd expect us to field a side that can challenge Hull or a majority of teams in the PL tbf.

Yes, massively, but I'm genuinely interested in hearing your opinions and reasoning, and I don't want to put you off sharing them by being confrontational.

In summary:

* Areas without white people.
* Areas without English spoken.
* Strain on public services. (I would disagree that this actually exists, I think if we reduced immigration it would actually put *more* strain on public services.)
* Trojan horse plot. (This was legitimately a fucking catastrophe, I'm not sure what UKIP propose to prevent or fix this?)
* Polls showing that people generally ""don't like it"". (citation? I believe you, but I'd like the source, if you have it.)

&gt;All of the major parties admit that immigration has been too high in recent years. 

I don't think any of them believe this, but they pander to public opinion. I think the tories, in particular, are privately very happy with the amount of immigration and would like to see more.

Golf clubs for years have prided themselves on often being a select club of members and societies who could play on their course. Yes the price can be a bit extortionate in some but its really reflected in the quality of the course, the upkeep, the clubhouse and the facilities they offer. Its nice that they can refuse people playing on their course for attempting to walk on in trainers, and trackbottoms who can dick around and actually damage the course.

On the other hand, some of the clubs out there charge ridiculous prices for the shite course they offer, and their stubbornness to even lower prices is whats aiding their downfall. They have to draw a line between trying to be exclusive, or surviving. You have courses like ColinValley and Mallusk that are some of the cheapest courses in NI, and they are absolute dogshit, then you have other ones like Shandon, Dunmurry that are more moderately priced, but still affordable and attract a decent number of members and visitors.

Golf clubs rely on money from vistors via green fees. Unfortunately they cannot really rely on trade all year long because of shite weather, and in turn the upkeep that the weather brings. Golf season is at best, April to October unless you play on a links course, but it sounds shady that this course has been given this grant via membership being on the planning committee.

Albert Einstein, (attributed)

Rodgers need to optimise the players he currently has rather than playing the ""system"" and hoping the players would bed in and get used to it.
We are not improving at all... unless you call scoring within 90 seconds then conceding 3 goals an improvement...

Our defence are porous, we need Lucas covering them. We need two up top, defending from the front and not loosing possession at every attack opportunity that we get.  

As much as I love Gerrard, he's a utility player right now, shoring up the midfield with another partner; attacking from the middle; or providing crosses from the right; but in any of those instances to be substituted.
We are closer to the bottom rather than the top, FSG need to sit the gaffer down and talk some sense into him, faith in your manager can only go so far. 

Other teams are not consistently doing well, even if we do a half decent job in defending and attacking we would still be in the mix. However we have been consistently below par. Saw some hope in the second match against Real, where we lost but not outplayed. We now look like we will buckle under any sustained pressure by the opponent, without being able to score.

Thing is if we change managers now, the new manager is going to take the better part of winter to get to know the team... I don't see us being better off by new year with a new manager....

So hopefully... hopefully, Rodgers get over his stubbornness and realise the talent of his current fit players has and capitalise on it...

The other, I found out about his support through Facebook, where he was posting vitriolic things under another mutual friend's post.

Damon Hill, a very average driver in a good car, also got one championship - which on talent he probably didn't deserve.

F1 championships are not awarded on merit(of the driver's ability) a lot of the time.

I disagree with your using of the term 'catastrophe' with regards to the Trojan Horse Plot. Catastrophe implies a singluar event. 

Anyway, that's why I think mass immigration is bad and why UKIP are the only party which will do anything about this.

If you disagree with me that having non-white areas is bad, then you are free to do so. Bear in mind these areas are not the result of 100 years of multicultural policy and immigration, it is the result of 20 years. 

Near where I live, there are towns where immigrants in general do not assimilate and the youth have rivalries to do with their race. Somalians Vs Pakistanis. The racial tensions in these areas are out of control. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28139799

What a surprise, in Birmingham too! Where I live. I see this as a direct result of Labour's push for open doors immigration and a refusal to encourage immigrants to integrate with our society.

What we can blame Rodgers for is not getting the best out of his players that he has. He definitely is not doing that at the moment. He continues to pick players who are consistently not performing. Maybe the other players are as bad as the current ones, but I fail to see how could Lucas perform worse than Gerrard as a DMF, this just excapes me. At the moment having Gerrard on the pitch seems just because he's the captain and a Liverpool legend. The whole Madrid game selection seemed bizarre and it seemed even more bizarre to not have the good performers from that day start against Chelsea. That was worse than the Madrid game selection. He either didn't trust them or was afraid of the uproar from the fans if he drops Gerrard for example.

If he continues to be stubborn and the players will still not perform then I can see no reason why he is the man to lead us out of this mess.

Well, UKIP obviously would face a huge uphill battle to fix all this, because it is already happening. How do we solve radicalisation within the UK? If you know, feel free to tell me, because I'm stumped.

&gt;Do you think it's EU or non-EU immigration that's a problem, or both?

I dont see the problem as being singularly EU or non-EU immigration. I think we have first of all, a problem with the numbers. Secondly, we have a unqiue problem with Islam. Remember, a lot of muslims can come to the UK through Europe thanks to countries like Sweden, and soon Turkey if they join the EU. 

EU immigration matters because we actually can't say no to immigrants from within the EU. It is not that EU immigrants are 'worse', it is just that we can't control how many of them come in. The important effects of mass immigration are social and long-term, not economic and short-term. We are yet to see the true impact of Labour's stupid policy of open-doors immigration. 

UKIP differ from other parties on non-EU migration because, as you said

&gt;I don't think any of the other parties actually believe that immigration is a problem.

I looked it up and it turns our you are right. Labour and Lib Dems don't want to reduce immigration, EU or Non-EU. UKIP want to treat all immigrants equally, no matter where they come from. UKIP want the best candidates to come in to our country, on a points-based system. As far as I know, the other major parties don't want that either. 


EDIT: If you can get access to this source, it is a study which informs a lot of my anti-mass-immigration rhetoric.

Such a party would only need ~30% of the vote in the UK to gain a majority in the Commons. That would be the last vote you ever had. Is it ""tolerance"" to tolerate those views?

No. The intolerant cannot be tolerated, as they pose a threat to the system as a whole. We can afford to be indulgent to a certain degree... it's overly harsh to suppress groups that have no chance of power.

It was a good sub with Chiriches he still was doing crazy shit which makes me yell at the t.v. but overall I thought he was good, certainly got forward a lot. 

I thought Lamela was good but erg sometimes he really dribbles when he should just pass. Eriksen was outstanding, his movement was just really great, and he was always looking for the pass. Soldaldo...oh man what the goal would have done for him, but he was still very good I thought. And Kane was great. Dembele was meh, same with Davies, Davies in particular had some lazy passes I thought.

They get around it in the support work sector by paying you a nominal fee for sleeping at the client's house, this sleep should be 8 hours, with you paid at least the minimum wage for the rest of your shift but they keep extending the amount of time you are on the sleep for the nominal fee (£38 in my case).

At the end they wanted me to be there for 24 hours, get paid for 13, and £38 for the rest of the time I was there.

false,doltiaste,null,null,"A few thoughts on today's match:

* Soldado looked really good today, apart from his bad miss. He dropped off the centerbacks to get the ball, and had some nice 1-2s with Eriksen and Lamela. He was fairly involved and I was disappointed to see him taken off.

* Kane's good at leaving space for the others and making our attack flow better overall -- we often have the problem of having the forward/Eriksen/Lamela all in the same space, and Chadli sometimes adds to the problem as well, but Kane was semi-regularly drifting into wide areas which helped to leave room for the others.

* I wasn't impressed by Lamela again today. It just seems like the only way something constructive comes from his attacks is if he can beat 2-3 defenders to get some room, which he just can't do more than once or twice a match. The rest of the time, I feel like he either ends up dribbling into a defender's feet, or the best case scenario is a few dribbles and a pass right back -- not much comes from him getting the ball, apart from the fact that it can leave room for the RB to get forward.

* Davies looked alright in defense today, but nowhere near as good as Rose in attack, and in Poch's system that's pretty crucial. When we're depending so much on the fullbacks for attack, I think Rose is much better for the system.

* Dier didn't look great today, and Chiriches looked good going forward, but it was against 10 men. I'm curious to see how he'd do in a full match over Dier.

* Vertonghen and Fazio looked solid today -- we didn't have a true DM helping them out, which really bit us on Hull's goal when there was no one in front of the back four to help close down Livermore.

* Dembele looked healthy today, but he didn't really do all that much other than recycle possession. He doesn't have too many spaces to dribble into when we're playing so narrow -- a lot of times he didn't have any options other than to play a short pass forward or play the ball out to the fullbacks. Which is fine, but I feel like Dembele's not bringing much to the table otherwise, and that he's just not a great fit in this system.",0,1416766471,null,0,false,0,cmas8lt,t3_2n6j6x,t1_cmas8lt,t3_2n6j6x,null,1425880459,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Yes, he's frustrating and I'm sure he himself is frustrated but we talk about passion on this sub a lot and Soldado and Kane have it, Ade does not.

First half we kept trying to long ball to Soldado, I thought he was actually doing very poorly because he was positioning to try win the ball instead of trying to sit closer to his CB and then beating them behind - Daws is a good defender but he is very easy to turn. Overall if we bought Soldado to try to break down the bus with long ball, we bought poorly.

While the weather can be quite bad, it's definitely not as bad as most people imagine. I'm actually from an area close to the Netherlands and I find it quite comparable to home. Try and find information about the climate in Amsterdam and Edinburgh and compare, I would expect the amount of precipitation and sunshine hours to be similar. For temperatures I'm not sure but Edinburgh is not arctic :D

Personally, I think Edinburgh is just stunning: beautiful buildings, hills to climb, beaches to take a stroll, so much culture :) I like the nightlife here, I think it has something to offer for about every taste. I discover new cool places all the time. And I like how you can easily get from one place to another, most things in the city center are really close to each other- Edinburgh is not a huge city after all. Also, if you get out of the city (lots of opportunities for exchange students to go on trips etc), Scotland is so beautiful :)
Most people I met here are definitely really nice and open-minded and were really interested in my background. At uni and everywhere else you meet a lot of people from abroad, you would definitely not be an ""outsider"". 

My only ""con"" would be living costs, compared to where I'm from living in Edinburgh is quite expensive. I don't know how it would compare for you.  It can also be quite hard to find a place to live. But that's honestly the only thing I can think of.

Biggest challenges are the short winter days i think :S days are very short between November and February. It gets kind of chilly too but I actually don't think it's as extreme as Canada/north USA. 

Here (in my opinion) are key pros and cons about Edinburgh :):

Pros-
1) It's beautiful. I'm biased but I really think Edinburgh is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been too.

2) It's central (ish) to the rest of the UK/Europe. You can get to London in 4 1/2 hours, Glasgow in 40 minutes, the highlands are close by. You can get out to Iceland, Norway or Finland also fairly easily from the airport here (though Amsterdam has a big airport too)

3)It's very diverse. There is a big international community, there are lots of American students here so I wouldn't worry about feeling like an outsider.

4) Lots to do! As solidsnake says there's the festival in August, we have big New Year Celebrations, there is lots on culturally, we have lots of pubs, cafes, restaurants etc. The city centre is divided into the 'New Town' and the 'Old Town'. The new town is where the main high street shops are, and there are more upmarket pubs and bars, and fancier shops are there too. The old town is where the university is and has more independent shops and cafes and most of the tourist attractions. There is much more of a student/community feel in the old town, and something to suit lots of different places.

5) It's student friendly. There are 5 universities in edinburgh, lots of places do student discount and there are nice places to meet friends. Can't really comment on nightlife as I'm not a big club person, but the bars and pubs are open late at the weekends and tend to be busy-lots of chances to chat to the locals. 

Cons-
1) It's expensive. Most room rates are £300-£350 a month at the very cheapest, and the area you live in/state of the flat is usually reflected in the price. If you look hard enough on gumtree though there are good flats that aren't always extortionate though. A pint of beer tends to cost about £3 up now, and a latte would be about £2 up from local coffee shops. 

2) Some people can be unfriendly. There isn't really any two ways around it, some people are a bit stuck up. However overall Edinburgh is very welcoming to visitors and the majority of people are really nice. The student community is mixed-I think there are more people at Edinburgh Uni that are a bit better off, but there are loads that are so nice as well. The student association runs loads of clubs and societies so it's really easy to meet people that have similar interests as you.


Pro and Con: Edinburgh is quite small as a city. This gives it a cosy/community feel. You bump into people often which can be a curse or a blessing. Some find it claustrophobic, I really like it :)

So to summarise, yes it's expensive, and cold in the winter, but there is also so much that is good here. It's hard to compare it with Amsterdam as I haven't ever been there... I guess Amsterdam has the benefit of being in a non-english speaking country which might be more of an adventure. But the culture here is pretty good and if that's your bag I'd say go for it! :) feel free to swing a PM my way if you like.

Hatice: I’m not sure, I don’t have any proper British friends

Hatice: No, they’re all—English people have become so diverse you can’t find anyone. It’s like old people you can. But our age, I haven’t met a proper British person in ages.

Edit: Another study is similar, but in Denmark, looking at Turkish immigrants. There is a much greater push to become 'Danish' than there is to become British in the UK. Much of the conflict in this country comes from the parents of these children being unwilling to allow their children to integrate.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"**TL;DR:** I fundamentally disagree with many of the justifications for leaving the EU, many of the justifications for limiting immigration, climate denial, repealing human rights legislation and also I find the party itself disingenuous and manipulative. 

No one policy in particular would end a friendship I don't think but accepting the full range of UKIP policies would be a major problem for me. The details would always matter of course - there are a few decent reasons to dislike the EU and my friend may consider this enough of a reason to leave which is fair enough. There are also many bad reasons to leave the EU and if my friend embraced one of those it would be disappointing to say the least. If my friend argued, for example, that the EU was an economic drain I would have to conclude they didn't know what they were talking about. If they become a loyal UKIP supporter on the basis of that argument I would think worse of them, of course, because it takes 10 minutes to disprove so I must assume they didn't take even 10 minutes to look up whether their new political beliefs were actually valid. The EU has reduced [trade costs](http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/would-britain%E2%80%99s-trade-be-freer-outside-eu) dramatically for us and has made owning a small international business trivially easy and much cheaper. The vast majority of businesses [report](http://www.cbi.org.uk/campaigns/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/) that the EU has had a positive impact on their business. If anyone thinks (UKIP officially does) that the EU has a negative effect on trade and business then they don't understand either one - they're also disagreeing with over 3/4 businesses who I should think know better than ideological activists what's been good for them. 

Their official stance on immigration is, though I disagree, more or less also understandable if a bit confused and inconsiderate but given the behaviour of their representatives and their seeming inability to stop racist individuals from becoming representatives or senior activists with responsibility within the party (even when they know they might be attracted by UKIPs stance on immigration being different to the main parties) UKIP is worrying to me. One of the most worrying things is that I don't feel like I really know what a UKIP majority government would do on immigration. Supporters point to the official party line on these things and say ""Look that's not extreme"" but that doesn't mean the policy won't become extreme while UKIP is in power especially given the frequency with which extremist individuals keep popping up as UKIP's candidates - some examples: [1](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ukip-leader-nigel-farage-facing-1857695), [2](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/05/01/nigel-farage-ukip-alex-wood-pot-plant_n_3191427.html?1367406909&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk), [3](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-councillor-investigation-racist-homophobic-facebook-comments), [4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27151509). It's perfectly possible that if racists are inadvertently elected as UKIP candidates they will reject their previous views and follow the UKIP party line but it's also possible that once in a position of power they will revert to type and start actively discriminating against people they represent. If UKIP can't get it's shit together then continuing to vote for them regardless is equivalent to saying 'I'm not that bothered if the guy I'm voting for might be a racist because he hasn't been vetted' which of course is deplorable. I understand UKIP is trying to combat the far-right influence in the party but it's not doing nearly a good enough job and UKIP voters must know that but continue to vote for them anyway. 

Beyond that I think their denial of climate change is utterly irresponsible and unscientific. [Here's quite a well set out rebuttal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbW-aHvjOgM&amp;list=PL6B84B372A56FEC9A) of the claims of UKIPs former spokesman on climate change ""Lord"" Monckton - watch all 5 videos if you can. He was only sacked last year because under his stewardship UKIP was wiped out in Scotland [\(his words\)](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/ukip-wiped-out-north-of-the-border-after-its-scots-leader-is-sacked.22833054) and as far as I know his views on climate change are still the party's views - namely that it doesn't exist. 

They want to leave the European Convention of Human Rights which even my Eurosceptic, privatise-the-NHS, right wing father thinks is among the stupidest ideas he's ever heard. It's madness that the Conservatives want to do it to but they also wanted to pass the 'Snooper's Charter' so it's not a huge surprise they don't care about civil liberties. We win 99% of the cases referred to the court from the UK just for context. It is the ECHR that forms the basis of the ONLY guarantee British citizens have for free speech and privacy; even in historical common law only free speech (but not privacy) existed as a liberty (not a guarantee) but was always very limited. Getting rid of the strongest protections British people against a government we know has destroyed our historic civil liberties since 9/11 is truly insane on both UKIP's and the Tory's part. 

Also outside of specific policies I don't like their nationalist 'patriotic party' image. It sounds like the classic fascist right-wing method of attracting voters. It's no mistake that the BNP contains the name of the country. I'm not saying UKIP is fascist but merely that they use some of the same tactics - they whip up peoples fear of something other or unknown, normally foreigners, that is blamed for every problem under the sun and claim to be patriotic defenders of the country against this enemy, to restore order where they claimed there was chaos. UKIP persuades it's supporters that their current problems are the fault of the EU and therefore EU immigration and they set themselves up as patriots defending freedom rather like the Tea Party does in the US. It's an easy answer that gets people and angry and gives them an outlet/scapegoat for their anger. In reality we've just been through the biggest economic crash in 80 years and people's economic problems are largely caused by the irresponsibility of banks and the government's who failed to regulate them properly. Rather than encouraging people to ask for an economic system that doesn't rip them off (Nigel Farage was of course himself a stockbroker and was a wealthy part of that machine that ripped the public off in 2008) UKIP convinces poor people that immigrants are the problem when research shows this is not the case and with recent immigrants the opposite is true. 

I really hate the scapegoating and intentional encouraging of ordinary people to ignore the real cause of their problems and instead to turn against their fellow workers in order to achieve the aims that UKIP set out to accomplish which was to leave the EU for constitutional reasons. UKIP was not a working man's party when it was set up - it's forerunner was The Anti-Federalist League which didn't give a toss about immigration. Even UKIP in the [early 2000s](http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/e01/man/ukip/UKIP2001.htm) said ""The UKIP recognises the contribution made by all immigrant groups to our culture and economy"" and talked about ending EU immigration because of crime concerns not concerns over the jobs of British workers. The whole ""EU workers undermine your job"" aspect is a recent addition intended to stir up resentment towards the EU among working people so that the party elites can get what they want and have the UK constitutionally independent. Now that motive (the UK's total constitutional independence) is perfectly fine on it's own but they are quite happy to go about getting their way by feeding bullshit prejudice to working class people and piling on misleading statistics which [I made a post about here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2j19kc/nigel_farage_repeated_his_75_of_our_laws_are_made/). It strike me as emotional and political manipulation using people's ignorance against them and it's very disingenuous.

Its there for anyone to see - I gave you the very well known argument (at least among those who read) that race is simply a social construct and doesn't exist as a fact.

It may be a big universe but it's a small world and one we are an increasingly smaller player in (I think a British space colony is sometime off).  If we leave the EU or have parts of the union break away this will be even more pronounced.

&gt;Growing customer base. 20 years ago we would not be able to sell BMWs or jets to the chinese

This is a little confusing.  BMW is a German owned company so we do not make profit from it except when they manufacture or sell cars in the UK and China mainly build their own jets (the last real success we had was with the Harrier although some countries are buying the Eurofighter which we partly own).  Largely speaking we do not have many strong brands to export mainly aerospace parts and pharmaceuticals.  Either way manufacturing is a highly competitive environment and we are currently not a strong player in it (especially at the low-medium end).  What we do have is a bloated service industry that is not going to be a massive growth area and there is a real risk other countries can erode it's profitability long term.

&gt;The NHS and pension liabilities demand growth- if we do not grow we will become destitute and those absurd promises have already been made a long time ago

1. There are tons of americans studying in Edinburgh.  You will not actually be that unique - you may end up with a very diverse friend group (my group of friends hailed from 5 or 6 countries)

2. Edinburgh is fantastic for students.  You can get student discounts almost everywhere, and it has one of the best nightlife situations I've ever encountered.  Whether you like hanging out in a pub and doing pub quizzes, drinking in the university-run bars, going to clubs that are open til 4am, or drinking in the meadows during the fringe festival and watching the worlds best comedy shows, you will find a shit ton of things to do.

3.  ""Are people open-minded?"".  This is Scotland.  Way more open-minded than any US state by a long shot.  It is incredibly liberal/socialist - you have nothing to be worried about. 

4.  The weather is not that bad - most of the states I've lived in have had worse weather (Iowa, Mass).  It gets chilly and sometimes grey and rainy, but it really just makes the city that much more charming.  It's very easy to get around, and the flats are huge and charming.

As long as the polices of the party and the party itself aren't breaking any laws, I don't see why not. Of course the electoral commission would have to make sure this is the case.

There is a huge difference between a ""extremist Islamic party"" and UKIP. I believe it's fair to allow those with opposing and distasteful views to attempt to be democratically elected, as long as they're not breaking laws, or extreme to the point of the EDL (Yes, I know they're not a political party). Honestly, if you think UKIP are terrible, look at extreme parties throughout Europe.

For example, the Golden Dawn in Greece are gaining ground, with a perfect environment for a Nazi party - terrible economic conditions, bad social conditions ect. Then we have the Front National in France, again, gaining ground. 

I don't believe UKIP are intolerant as a party. Some of their members, voters and supporters are intolerant, but as a party I don't think they're intolerant. Unlike the main parties they want an exit from the EU so people from all around the world can have an equal chance, instead of favoring European migrants. 

You can call the party names all you want, it would be much more constructive for what you believe in to explain why UKIP (in your opinion) are intolerant, dangerous ect.

Alos wouldn't be the worst shout to have Carragher coming in as a defensive coach or just a dude that's around similar to what we see with Giggs. A little annoying but the fire seems to be missing, and whether that needs to be in the player's hearts or under their butt hardly matters atm. Need some people around that embody LFC and what it means to be a Red, otherwise some of the younger or newer players (and relatively new manager) wont be in  alignment. 


I think we lack a bit of toughness and there's a real lack of match winners in the team currently, or just belief. Manquillo shoulda smashed his shot on target after excellent work from Coutinho. We end up always operating with a lack of space between the opposition lines. Hopefully they figure it out a bit tho, because we have a solid squad just lacking some leadership (by example) across our lines and the strain is going to the younger guys. Once players like markovic, sterling etc start firing on all cylinders we can start to enjoy the games a lot more. 


There are always players that are the enablers on a team, that allow your younger and more skillfull players to really play thier game. Gerrard is fading a bit unfortunately and he cant shoulder the load for others anymore. Suarez was a great leader from the front last year and the reason i miss him most is the added pressure it puts on Raheem, whereas he must have really been enjoying the game a lot more last year, being able to just make runs, be creative and haha be a kid really. 

Turned into a rant. Just been a deflating day -_- P.S. I remember also being livid at Rafa A LOT, for his team selections week to week, and for tweaking things that were working, only so we could go out and lose the next week.

Now let that sink in. Rodgers cannot rely on Suarez and Sturridge anymore who were the striker partnership of the decade. He wanted to change the system what failed perfectly. It has been almost 3 months since I have known that that system is just not what fits the team. Now the club is in shamlbles and I cannot see us win a game anytime soon. 
Rodgers needs to be sacked, even though I am pretty convinced that he is a good manager, he clearly is too stubborn, and too weak in tactical things, to be able to help the club in the long term.

I could vomit when I see posts to give him more time. 4 months of not winning games destroys a season and it makes the last year's great success useless. ",0,1416772121,null,0,false,0,cmavayg,t3_2n6qim,t1_cmavayg,t3_2n6qim,null,1425879017,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;___An Unearthly Child___ (sometimes referred to as ___100,000 BC___) is the first [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. It was first broadcast on [BBC TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) in four weekly parts from 23 November to 14 December 1963. Scripted by the Australian writer [Anthony Coburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Coburn), it introduces [William Hartnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hartnell) as the [First Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Doctor) and original companions; [Carole Ann Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Ann_Ford) as the Doctor's granddaughter [Susan Foreman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Foreman), [Jacqueline Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Hill) as [Barbara Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(Doctor_Who\)) and [William Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Russell_(actor\)) as [Ian Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Chesterton) as school teachers. The first episode deals with Ian and Barbara's discovery of the Doctor and his time-space ship [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) in a junkyard in contemporary London. The remaining episodes are set amid a power struggle between warring [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age) factions who have lost the secret of making fire.

Edinburgh is a great place to live in my opinion, my favourite city in the world that I have visited thus far. As an Edinburgh student who enjoys going out regularly, I'll be the first to admit that the nightlife is fantastic! There's a very diverse range of pubs and clubs ranging from cheap nights with cheesy music in low-lit underground clubs to high-end pompous cocktail bars, and everything in between! There's something to cater to all tastes, interests and budgets here. Many of the pubs and clubs (particularly in the centre of town) tend to be very student-oriented, particularly during the week. 

Having spent a lot of time in University accommodation over the last four years I have to tell you that people being unpleasant or grumpy is a bit of an urban myth (though of course there are some locals who like to keep to themselves, you are unlikely to contact many of them as an exchange student). I wouldn't worry about being an outsider because as others have said there are LOADS of American exchange students here, and I've certainly not met or heard of anyone who's had problems with integration. In fact, you'll probably find that in most uni accomodation there is a nearly even split between local and international students. The majority of people I've met here are generally very welcoming and accomodating, and will certainly be up for a drink if that's your bag. If not there's plenty going on culturally too, it's a city with a lot of history. There are several interesting museums, lovely Georgian architecture and of course regular cultural festivals of various descriptions. 

The city is unique in that it has all of the things you want in a city, without it feeling big or overbearing. It is rather small in the scale of things, you can get around anywhere on foot generally and if not the bus service is critically acclaimed. Yes it's cold and does rain a bit but don't let that dampen your spirit! If you have any more questions please feel free to respond on here or send me a message!

I'm sick of people jumping on the bandwagon of Skrtel and Lovren hating. There is no way that Skrtel could stay with us for 7 years and be shit. And Lovren was really really good at Southampton.

Defence starts at the first line of penetration. And that's Lambert and Sterling. It's not Lambert's fault he's 32 and doesn't have amazing fitness. Sterling however, I've noticed has become a little lazy in pressing and tracking runners.

Then you have Lallana, Coutinho, Gerrard and Allen. All mobile players apart from Gerrard. When you look at Gerrard, 0 tackles, 0 interceptions... What do you expect? Matic? Makelele? The whole midfield is confused. Do you press? But what happens if you bypass the press? Then you have Gerrard isolated on his own. That is trouble. But you drop deep. But Rodgers doesn't want you to drop deep. So you more or less play musical statues here. Go up the pitch, pressurise the opponent but don't apply too much pressure because you need to help Gerrard. How can you expect anyone to do that?

Lovren and Skrtel are polar opposites in terms of Defending. One wants to get tight on his man. Don't let him turn. Force him to make a pass backwards. The other is quite content letting people get into the box. You can't have it both. You have one way or the other. Again, confusion.

Of course, there are some poor INDIVIDUAL players. Mignolet's kick before their goal was astonishing. Johnson, we know the deal with him. But this whole game is a team effort. And it's Rodgers job to sort this out. Right now, we've got no identity.

I wouldn't be dissapointed if we lost the game knowing what we tried to do. But I don't have a clue how we're playing. I can't figure out our style. You know Chelsea's style. And Barcelona's style.

As well as that, you're handily leaving out the part in which I stated that ***I believe race is a human construct***. But I also realise that it is used as a motive for racist attacks and as a tool to separate people - something you deny time and time again. There is a recognised Celtic race/ethnic group in history - dating back to the fucking neolithic ages - The English population is descended from several peoples — the earlier Britons (or Brythons), the Germanic tribes that settled in the region (including Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons).

The Irish in Northern Ireland identify their heritage as Celtic - the British, with the Anglo-Saxons. Therefore - different ethnic groups. *Therefore*, in human culture - whether it is a human construct or not - attacking, insulting, patronising, denying rights to education of or equal rights to another language (purely because it is not one you identify with) all constitute racism.

First half: Unstoppable, they barely touched the ball and Matic was amazing at breaking up their play on the counter. Fabregas's passing game was hugely influential in attack and you've got to give props to JT/Cahill for keeping Sessegnon and Berahino quiet, players much faster than them.

Second half: We were unlucky not to have a third goal in that first half and we really took our foot off the gas in the second. I thought it would've been smart to take off Costa and bring on Remy as our first substitution earlier as Costa really started sitting in midfield more which closed down our play, we really needed him to push forward onto their centrebacks, play off the shoulder and force them to sit deep and also give his hammies/calves a chance. We dominated possession and we often found ourselves passing around their 18yd box with no ideas. It was screaming for a fabregas-to-schurlle-throughball ala Burnley alas the decision was made for Oscar to come off to play a strange 4-2-2-2 and move fabregas forward until the second sub was made.
Bringing on drogba also I feel was a strange choice as we didn't need someone to hold up the ball (which an aging drogba is really good at)...Schurrle/Ramires, someone with an engine who can run out the final 25minutes, or at least run around their defense and put in a decent cross would've been more effective imo....or at least run the ball to the corners.

false,JB_UK,null,null,"It's because the British fishermen sold them, partly also because the UK government has a choice about where to allocate the licenses, and chose to give the vast majority of them to industrial, large-scale fishing concerns, who were more likely to sell them on. Go down to Hastings; the small-scale fishermen are lobbying the British government, not Brussels.

The other major issue with fisheries is overfishing. Similarly, the UK government has very significant powers to introduce Marine Conservation Zones to protect reserves. They introduced a law in 2009 to allow them to do that, commissioned a report, which recommended in 2011 127 zones would be created, with many sites dropped due to industry pressure [1]. In 2013 they decided to actually create 31, then reduced that to 27. The current plan is that these will be introduced by 2016, and it's recently emerged that these zones will be entirely voluntary [2]!

Both issues are substantially under the control of the British government, and they do very little.

[[1](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/08/england-marine-conservation-zones)] - 'In what has been described as ""robust"" arguments, industry objected to some areas and conservationists had to compromise to arrive at the final list. ""Sites we were sorry to see dropped due to industry concerns include Flamborough-Helgoland, the north Norfolk chalk reefs and the Farne Islands,"" said the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), one of the many organisations that helped to determine the sites.'

[[2](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/17/england-marine-conservation-zones)] - ""Even in the few small places where protection from certain fishing methods is being (reluctantly) entertained the measures will be entirely voluntary. Which begs the question: what was the point? Why spend upwards of £10m to create an elaborate network of paper parks? Why have a law that permits mandatory protection and leave protection to the goodwill of users?""",0,1416778508,null,0,1416782433,0,cmaysn2,t3_2n5twh,t1_cmaysn2,t1_cmaolmr,null,1425877387,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

PERG 2.6.2 – Deposits
01/07/2005
FCA
“A deposit is defined in article 5(2) of the Regulated Activities Order. This focuses on a sum
of money paid by one person to another on terms that it will be repaid when a specified event occurs
(for example, a demand is made).”


PERG 2.6.3
10/02/2011
FCA
“Certain transactions are excluded. The definition of deposit itself excludes money paid in connection
with certain transactions such as advance payments for the provision of goods or services and sums paid to secure the performance of a contract. The circumstances in which payments are excluded from the definition itself are exhaustively stated in article 5(3) of the Regulated Activities Order (Accepting deposits). In addition, there is a separate exclusion in article 9 of the Order (Sums received in consideration for the issue of debt securities) and another in article 9A (Sums received in exchange for electronic money).1 PERG 3A Q4 contains guidance1 on the exclusion relating to electronic money.”


PERG 2.6.4A – Electronic Money
10/02/2011
FCA
Electronic money is specified as an investment in article 74A of the Regulated Activities Order1
, but only when issued by:1
(1) a full credit institution, a credit union or a municipal bank; or
(2) a person deemed to have been granted authorisation under regulation 74 of the Electronic
Money Regulations; or a person who falls within regulation 76(1) of the Electronic Money
Regulations (see PERG 3A, Q30 and 31).
The authorisation and registration requirements for any other person intending to issue electronic
money are governed by the Electronic Money Regulations. Guidance on these regulations is available
in PERG 3A.

In any event, both the housing and employment issues you mention aren't functions of immigration from the EU but of immigration in general. The majority of immigrants to the UK are from non-EU countries. 

What pisses me off the most about UKIP's discourse on immigration is that it currently focuses largely on EU immigrants. EU immigrants are more likely to net contributors to the economy, share our broad cultural values, and perhaps most importantly leaving the EU (a *sine qua non* for any reform of EU immigration) would be a big step into the unknown that has every chance of fucking us over. Meanwhile, restricting non-EU immigration would take all of about five minutes and wouldn't piss off our neighbours and major trade partners.

&gt;

&gt;___Multi-Coloured Swap Shop___, more commonly known simply as *Swap Shop*, was a UK children's television programme. It was broadcast on Saturday mornings on [BBC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) for 146  episodes in six series between 1976 and 1982. It was ground-breaking in many ways: by being live, sometimes up to three hours in length, and using the phone-in format extensively for the first time on TV.

&gt;Its creation was thought by many to be the BBC's response to the growing success of [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\))'s *[Tiswas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiswas)* - although at the time the latter was only broadcast in the [ATV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_TeleVision) region in the [Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Midlands) and had yet to be taken up by other ITV franchises around the country.

I totally agree and understand all of this. But in perspective, Mourinho is a world class manager. If you are a wealthy person purchasing a football team and want trophies, you hire Mourinho. Hate him if you want, he's a winner. Mourinho is a winner.

Rodgers, by contrast is very very young. He's a baby in terms of managerial experience. Rodgers will get it right. I hope it's at Liverpool. It might not be though. But that's OK.


@Fripletister. From what I understand, Chelsea made a profit. And they have done before and look set afterwards. So whilst FFP does restrict us, we could've bought quality. When this squad peaks, we will win trophies. But we won't get instant success like what Chelsea can do. We're evolving now. 

Besides, any big player who we want to get won't go to us. Fabregas wouldn't chose us. Nor Costa. Nor Matic. Remember Rafa's quote about being faster and smarter in the transfer market? We need to be more astute in that department. But we've got a good core right now. We're riding the rough wave now. But in a few years, be it with Rodgers or who ever else, we will have a great team.

At present, being a rare disease, a national specialist group decides how much dialysis to provide, and where it should be provided.

Note that this only means where the money is coming from will change (at least initially). The local commissioners will have the option of purchasing dialysis services from the existing sites in the same quantity that is already provided. 

The difference is that in due course, the local providers will have more flexibility in choosing how much to provide, and where it should be provided (e.g. provision of mobile sites, or ""cottage"" sites in rural areas).

Of course, flexibility may not always be used for the better - while local rule could improve services, it could also be used to make the worse in preference for other conditions.

Edit:  That said, I'd offer the following advice now that I've walked back to an actual computer versus trying to type on a cell phone.

1)  Quit splitting the CBs so far apart.  It's stupid and causes problems.  Also, use Toure and Sakho more.  Specifically, play Toure + Sakho.

2)  Quit having the CDM sit so deep.  They need to be farther forward.  Also, Gerrard is not a CDM.  Play Lucas, an actual CDM.

3)  The fullbacks need to be a bit further back.  Right now they're too far forward to get involved in the build up play coming out of the back.  They also need to pick and choose when to make runs forward better rather than 'always'.

4)  Any time we pass it around in our half more than 4 times, the guy who hits the 5th owes me £1000.  Knock that crap off.  Move the ball forward and move it forward quickly.

5)  If you lose the ball or make a bad pass, you had best do your damnedest to win it back.  Pressing everywhere, hunt in packs.  Try to nick the ball back rather than letting the opposition stroll into our side.

6)  Fire Achterberg and get a new keeper coach.  Preferably someone that has worked with sweeper keeper types.

7)  Practice headers.  A lot.  We suck at winning them everywhere on the pitch and even when we do they're 90% of the time to no one in particular.  Other teams seem to have absolutely no problem heading the ball actually to their teammates rather than just randomly somewhere on the pitch.

8)  Our fitness sucks.  We get outrun constantly and we always as a unit looked gassed by the 60th minute.  It seems like near every team in the PL can run circles around us without looking tired while we're sat there bent over trying to suck in wind.  Not saying we have to go full Magath, but seriously our ability to run is shockingly bad almost everywhere.  I've come to the conclusion it isn't so much that Henderson is fantastic as that he's normal and everyone else sucks.  Bring your running shoes lads.

9)  In January, sell Balotelli to anyone willing to take him.  Get Pedro on a loan to buy deal from Barca, buy Huntelaar and Konoplyanka who should both be pretty cheap since they're out of contract, and send Markovic back to Benfica on a loan to the end of the season.  I'll assume this all works and now my team come January looks something like:

He is a better shot stopper than Reina who consistently got beat in the near post.

Reina, despite having greater distribution (He was an outfield player before a keeper), doesn't compare to Mignolet in terms of reactions/shot stopping.

Which is why I was confused because Rodgers' whole ethos is passing the ball under pressure. Yet although Reina can do that, he was sold and Mignolet was bought. Personally, I prefer Mignolet as he does the basics better. But I can't see how Rodgers would prefer Mignolet to Reina.

Products like CeraVe (and the UK equivalent Balneum cream) are more modern, and take account of the last decade's research on the skin barrier. Eucerin and Flexitol have been around donkey's years but the urea is still highly relevant. What is key to realise is that you often don't get anywhere if one product is fighting another or one lifestyle habit is fighting another. My breakthrough was quitting the harsh anionic surfactants, but this STILL seems to be one of the best kept secrets in dermatology!!

Supplements don't contain all the nutrients found in real food or not in the form that is easy for the body to process/ absorb, plus the are very low calorie so allow you to still eat processed stuff. If it has more than one ingredient and doesn't look like it came right off the plant or animal it is processed. Also different types of fibre in wholefoods feed the beneficial bacteria in your guy, pills and potions do not.

You don't have to like vegetables, I had to force myself initially trust me! There are lots of 'tricks' - baked beans with added tomato paste can be two servings, soups liquidised with a stick blender, blended vegetables in FRUIT smoothies (some recipes you cannot tell), blended or grated vegetables in tomato sauce/ bolognese sauce for pasta/ curry.

Dark greens are the hardest of the rainbow to get from fruit only, and they really truly can hide in smoothies - I've tried broccoli, spinach and green beans (not at the same time!). However you do need fruit for the blue/ purple family - berries - otherwise you will end up living on red cabbage and aubergine. Check out Marmalade &amp; Mileposts website, you won't like the idea of everything of course, but the blogger is pretty decent at making veggies taste good (or not taste at all). Also consider Jamie Oliver's School Dinners recipes, again he hid veggies so even kids ate them

Yes *obviously* it's a weird sci-fi show about aliens and time travellers, but that doesn't mean it can't retain a realistic tone. The tertiary characters and families of RTD era were pretty effective at this - something Moffat has almost entirely neglected (what happened to Amy's family? Never mind Clara's. That was Clara's Gran trying to conform her in Dark Water, but who would know?)

It makes it a bit harder to connect to the characters, makes them less relatable and can make the viewer a slightly disconnected. I think that's what might turn off a more mainstream, middle-of-the-road audience. Many of whom have stopped watching since Tennant left.

Since Israel considers itself to be a ""beacon of democracy©"",  then one should compare Israel to countries that are well established democracies not brutal dictatorships,  when one does form that comparison Israel is found wanting on a number of levels I'm afraid. Just today we have this bill being raised which only servs to further divide,  disenfranchise and alienate on ethnicity.

There is no reason beyond political suicide for ideological reasons why any Tory in their right mind would want Cameron to step down.

Nick Clegg'z sole chance of remaining relevant after the next general election is if they run a fiercely defensive campaign, keep hold of 30-40 seats, then go into another coalition with the Tories. Labour have rebuffed every effort to enter into pre-negotiations with him, and have insisted they would demand a change in leader to form a government while any new Tory leader is likely to be even more antagonistic to them. In short, the Lib Dem establishment see in Cameron the only person who they can deal with. It is not in their interests for Cameron to resign.

A right wing Tory pledging a 2015 EU referendum is highly likely to not only win the leadership contest but also to take a massive amount of the wind from UKIp's sails. Cameron is seen as a traitor who has destroyed the Tory Party and cannot be trusted, a new leader would likely change this. It is not in UKiP's interests for Cameron to resign.

The only people who want Cameron to resign are Labour, because he is superior to Miliband as a prospective Prime Minister, the Greens (because they can pretend it was them who got rid of him) and the SNP (because of the questions over Barnett and the Vow that would result).

I mean here's the thing: I think we should deal with immigration, but I don't think the UKIP approach is a good one. A lot of these immigrants, especially the ones from the EU, are actually in jobs paying their way in this country. A lot of them are self employed or doing jobs that nobody here wants anyway and are actually not doing too bad. Instead we lump the hardworking Polish hairdresser with the Romanian gangland leader. Oh, by the way, you know the funny thing about the Romanians. There were a lot of skilled Romanian workers, the type we'd want to come over here, willing to come over here, but they were put off by the massive hissy fit we threw when travel restrictions were lifted. Those Romanians now see us as racist dickheads and the people who don't care what we think (aka the dregs, the ones we don't want coming over) are the ones heading over here. Well done, Britain, we pretty much made a self fulfilling prophecy! [Slow clap].

There are more British people in Europe than there are Poles in Britain, many of them working, some of them living off the Spanish state in little enclaves eating exclusively British food, watching British TV, not integrating with the Locals other than learning to say ""one beer please"" in spanish reading British newspapers and complaining about how the immigrants back home aren't fucking integrating. Ironic, innit. The ones who aren't going to spain fuck off to Canada or Australia because it's cheaper than trying to get a Job in London. But we're not causing any trouble unlike those god damned romanians...except we are. In the Netherlands, the one foreign nationality that is causing the most grief there are Britons! And they're not just drunk stag nighters, they tend to be British drug gangs.

But people don't care too much that, they want a man of the people, an ex banker with $75 Million combined earnings who voted against cutting the wages of MEPs (which openly he complains about when the cameras are rolling), to tell them that our fears are true and we should start deporting the Euro-immigrants...except his German wife of course.

But you know what, I'd like to see what happens if we leave the EU. I wonder who we'll blame for the higher food prices ala Norway and Switzerland once all those bloody migrants are gone. I wonder who we're going to point the finger at when it's revealed we'll still have to keep to some EU regulations to trade with the EU as our biggest trading partner. I'd like to also see what happens when Nigel Farage cuts the bullshit and starts to enact his other policies. You know, the ones other than the ones about immigrants and the EU. The ones the average UKIP supporter can't name. Hopefully if I can I'll be in another country looking back at my home country from behind a screen, or at least I hope I will.",0,1416791021,null,0,1416791588,0,cmb551d,t3_2n6wb9,t1_cmb551d,t3_2n6wb9,null,1425874357,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

There are so many people talking about Rodgers not doing this, not doing that, not dropping Gerrard, sticking with Balotelli, sticking with one up front, not playing Lallana etc.  Do you really think that as a fan you know better than Brendan Rodgers?  Someone who has dedicated years of his life to playing and studying the game.  Someone who has worked under Jose Mourinho.  Someone who won promotion to the Premiership with Swansea.  And then lead them to a mid table finish when they were expected to get relegated.  Someone who almost led us to a league title in only his second season in charge.

You can talk about Suarez having a huge impact.  He certainly won plenty of games for us on his own.  But to try and say that he is the sole reason for our success last season is ignorant and downright disrespectful.  I don't care how good he is.  Football is played with 11 men.  And to take away credit from our manager for such a good season is simply disgraceful.  

I remember towards the end of last season, after the defeat to Chelsea, a lot of fans on here were talking about how we could ""go one better next season"".  A lot of fans on here actually expected us to not only repeat, but improve, last season's performance.  I'm sorry, but that was never going to happen.  Obviously this season has been much worse than we did expect, but we've only played 12 games.  A season lasts 38 games.  Although fourth looks like an insurmountable task at the moment - it is possible.  Just look at Newcastle, a few weeks ago they were bottom of the table, and after winning on Saturday they were in fourth place for a few hours.  There's no reason that we can't be back up there in a months time.

Even if we did sack Rodgers, then what?  Has anyone actually considered that?  We bring in a caretaker for the remainder of the season and probably finish around about 7th.  Then who do we bring in?  We certainly aren't going to attract any world class managers in our current state.  Then we start the whole rebuilding process again.  We start selling Rodger's players and bring in the new man's favourites.  How long do we give him?  What if we're still sitting mid table 12 games into next season?  Do we sack him as well?

The key is stability.  Unless you can throw money around like City or Chelsea, you cannot find success by changing manager every time you hit a bad patch.  Rodgers deserves to the end of the season, because lets be honest - we aren't going to get relegated under him.  He deserves a chance to turn things around.",0,1416793362,null,0,false,0,cmb69ic,t3_2n6pie,t1_cmb69ic,t3_2n6pie,null,1425873779,35,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,35

I realize some of that is supposed to be provided by the right and left back but with Rose out that's fallen out altogether on the left side and was never really existent at all on the right side.

Vlad actually did really well for us in that role today and he probably deserves to start the next match or two. But that's not a permanent solution to the problem.

Eriksen did ok on the left side for parts of last year and can be used there again if necessary. Lamela has no effectiveness as a winger, which is a little frightening considering he has little effectiveness in the middle of the pitch either.

Anyway, curious what others think the solution is to this. From what I remember of Southampton last season they didn't really have much wing play either.

false,aaronhere,null,null,"There are lots of interesting responses already here, but (in the interest of doing something different) my novel approach would be this: pretend we are going to be playing Liverpool in a week and draw up a gameplan.  What areas of the pitch do we want to exploit?  What players can we limit or put in uncomfortable positions?  How has the team been beaten recently.  Basically, do opposition research/gameplanning for your own team with as objective an eye as possible.  So, here would be some amateurish observations:

1. The team cannot handle high pressure.  (This was papered over last year when the team could just kick it to Sturridge or that other fellow and say ""make something happen"") Make sure there are no easy passing lanes and shut down space for Sterling.

2.  Alternatively, and terrifying, the team also cannot handle low pressure.  Slow buildups break down when teams pack their box and force low-percentage crosses from wide positions.  When in doubt, pack the middle and force them to be patient.  Go on the break when the turnover occurs

2. Man marking Stevie shuts down build up play

3. When fullbacks push up, team is vulnerable on the counter

4. Can't consistently build up play through the middle. Rely on FBs for width

5. Team can be gotten to on set pieces.  If you get touched within 35 yards of Mignolet, go down.

6.   Defense is easily overloaded.  Getting behind the midfield opens up their entire defense and puts lots of pressure on error-prone/young defenders.

I am sure I missed some nuanced points, but this is a broad brush approach.  So, what to do.

A. If we have to play a 4-3-3, the 3 man midfield damn well better be able to control the game.  Or else we end up with a shitty 4-5-1 as the wingers track back and the forward is left quite isolated. Lucas is more suited to the holding role than Gerrard, and while he is not the fastest, he reads the game and positions himself well enough to cover.  Alternatively, Allen holding with Hendo and Can in front would add a lot of mobility alongside some physicality in the midfield.   

B. Many people (myself included) want to see the 4-D-2 formation.  Assuming that Rodgers would rather drink his own piss than make that switch, why not employ a similar setup as we played in the 2nd leg of Real Madrid.  4-2-3-1 with Lucas and Hendo/Allen/Can holding and an attacking band of Lallana/Sterling/Coutinho/Gerrard (sub)/Markovic.  

C. Stop dropping DM between the CBs.  Keep fullbacks behind the play as pressure outlet, not as primary providers of width.  Overlaps are good - having your forward sending crosses into the box to an FB tells me something is fucked.

D. Be practical and hire a defensive coach.  Seriously, I don't care about philosophy or whatever, practicality demands some way of addressing consistently woeful defensive performances.

E. I don't have the stats for this, but I haven't seen another team in the BPL that passes it around at the back more.  It invites pressure.  Get the ball to your playmakers with the ball at their feet and organize the buildup around them.  No longballs, no meaningless passes between CBs   ",0,1416793978,null,0,1416800419,0,cmb6koe,t3_2n71q0,t1_cmb6koe,t3_2n71q0,null,1425873634,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

Commonwealth nations on the other hand, with whom we are linked in history, habit and language, would be a far more beneficial bloc to get involved in and focus on. The similarities in culture are there, making for more willing populations when it comes to promoting trade and travel between these nations. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand...All are growing in areas where Europe is shrinking. Additionally, it would surprise you how many costs can  be avoided, both directly and indirectly, by not having to worry about translation issues when it comes to international business arrangements and deals.

Overall I think there is a strong argument to be made for re-prioritising involvement with the Commonwealth, and in turn, moving away from ever closer political union with Europe. 

I would advocate to remain close with Europe rather than a *part* of Europe.

Things would get more complicated when you add in Big Finish. I haven't listened to a lot, but didn't they completely undo the Traken stuff? That would mean one of a few things:

1. Beavers II is also the one played by Tipple, therefore Roberts immediately succeeds him. Ainley never happened. MaqQueen happens after Roberts. 

2. Beavers II regenerated into MaqQueen, who is the same regeneration as Tipple, and Ainley still never happened. 

3. Beavers II happened in an alternate timeline. Ainley still happened, but so did Beavers II. MacQueen takes place in the Beavers II timeline. Ainley is the one who died in the '96 movie.  

4. Same as #3, but MacQueen happens in the Ainley timeline, between Roberts and Jacobi.

And then, of course, there is the possibility that all of McGann Big Finish happens in an alternate Timeline, but this is fairly unlikely.

Things were fucking horrific under Hodgson and even somewhat under Kenny, but what did both of them in was a sense of stagnation and no prospect of improvement. When Rodgers came to LFC in 2012 things were truly dire for the first half of the season and then the team started to play brilliant football the second half of the season. He was given time because there was a positive trend in terms of style and approach, but that's lacking now. I personally think Lovren, Gerrard and Johnson are more to blame for that than any other three players, but it's Rodgers' job to get the best from them. If he can't do that then he should move on. 

Basically, it's not a matter of whether some version of Rodgers is better than another. It's a matter of whether the version we have can do right by the club and get the best out of his players, whom he has spent a small fortune on. If not, then someone else needs to step in.

However, I'm simply saying that sacking Rodgers *now* - to me - would be short-sighted and detrimental to the future of our club.

Sure, SAS certainly masked a lot of issues but Rodgers is growing and adjusting as a manager the same way a lot of our young players are also growing and adjusting as players.

If we sack Rodgers now, then we have an interim coach who will most likely *not* be the manager once the season is over. Then there's another manager search, another new set of philosophies, transfers, etc and then it's almost like we're back at the start.

Of course, then there's the next logical question, ""Well, /u/joeinthebox, when is enough, enough?""

Well, I think Rodgers has built enough currency to be allowed to ride through this purple patch. I think Rodgers has built enough currency to be given the entire season to show what he can do with his signings and this team.

The clear goal - to me - is to gain *at least* a Champions League spot. Or even if we miss out on a CL spot, Rodgers and the squad need to show very clear and sustained improvements in the last few months of the season.

If we don't get a CL spot, if we haven't shown these clear improvements by season's end... then I will be more than happy to re-evaluate Rodgers' status with the club and be quite comfortable with thanking Rodgers for his services, for steadying the ship and moving to hire an experienced and progressive coach who can take us to the next level.",0,1416811691,null,0,false,0,cmbeh7u,t3_2n6pie,t1_cmbeh7u,t1_cmb22fo,null,1425869474,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

* On one hand, yes, the club was fully aware of Sturridge's injury history.
* So, the club should have planned for it, right?
* But we didn't necessarily plan for the worst - because why expect the worst from Sturridge who wasn't out for *that* long last season - and ended up with Balo, Lambert and the un-wanted Borini.
* So, we took the gamble on Sturridge and the worst possible outcome happened: Sturridge is out until at least the new year.
* It's frustrating but what can you do when a player allegedly does not want to come to Liverpool? Alexis Sanchez went to Arsenal for around £35m back in July. He has scored 8 goals thus far. Would we be happy with 8 goals if it took £40m to get him to Liverpool? £50m? £65m? And on what wages? Sure, hindsight is 20-20 but I think it was hard to make that decision back in July when we still had a fully fit Daniel Sturridge who scored *21* goals in only *29* Premier League matches (and still looked fairly dangerous when Suarez wasn't playing alongside him).

Long story short, we could not have predicted the extent of Sturridge's injury but now that it has happened, it's easy to look back and say, ""We should've gotten so-and-so.""

false,AdArbitrium,null,null,"I'm not surprised this got upvoted here, but frankly, it reads like the wishlist of a Guardian reader who's too lazy to bother learning the detail. I'll bite:

&gt; **Provide interest free loans for small business.**

Why should we be doing this? Credit is not that tight right now, and despite what you may hear, banks which choose not to loan to businesses generally do so because the business has been unable to provide a convincing business plan or adequate security. The latter is particularly important -- the purpose of interest isn't just to generate a profit, it's also to cover the proportion of loans which default. This is a basic point about loans which you've missed, meaning the government would essentially be losing money hand-over-fist.

&gt;**Re-industrialisation of the country's steel mills and coal mines.**

Why? This country has relatively few left, and you have presented no case for why Sheffield Forgemasters or UK Coal would be better under public ownership, and better able to compete with cheaper imports.

This isn't 1930s Stalinist Russia or Germany under Bismarck -- the prosperity of the country isn't being judged by how much steel or coal we output. Good luck with tariffs, if that's your plan -- expect a rise in the cost of living, and retaliatory measures against our exports.

&gt;**Public financing of political parties.**

Under what criteria will a party receive public funding? Do you or those politically aligned with you get to decide? Forgive me, but I'll assume that if UKIP or Britain First received 30% of the vote next time around, you won't be advocating they receive 30% of the pot for public funding. How will you avoid this system just further entrenching the existing parties by giving them the lion's share of funding?

&gt;**Regulation of the financial markets and more scrutiny of banks.**

Care to be more specific? It's awfully easy for people who know nothing about banking to scream ""more regulation!"", but I suspect few on this subreddit appreciate how onerous the regulatory and reporting environment already is. Capital requirements are getting higher, and will do much to prevent liquidity problems a la 2008. Beyond that, whether you hate banks or not, we'd do well to remember quite how reliant the UK is on its world-leading financial services. A significant portion of tax revenue is raised from it, for one, without which most of the services you support would be untenable. The UK isn't going to be exporting coal or textiles to the world, but then it shouldn't need to if it becomes the modern knowledge-economy we all want it to be.

&gt;**Abolition of student fees.**

Blair wanted 50% going to university, and Labour seem to be sticking to this. Unless you want to return to early 1990s levels of people taking degrees, how exactly do you propose to fund this? With the expansion of universities and the rise of low-quality degrees, how exactly can you make the economic case for this? I suspect the social case is equally pie-in-the-sky.

&gt;**Investment in infrastructure.**

Again, please be more specific. It's easy to shout ""more!"" but it means very little without specifics.

&gt;**Bigger push towards recycling.**

Many of us have 3 different bins outside our houses. Unless you are proposing punitive fines by having the council root-through our rubbish, how do you propose to 'push towards recycling' any more than we already are? Again, you're lacking specifics.

&gt;**Pay off NHS PFI contracts.**

How do you propose to do this without raising taxes substantially or increasing the deficit? Have you costed anything here, or are we just clicking our red heels together and hoping for the best? PFI has been a bad deal for the government, but it's one we're in little position to pay-off right now.

&gt; **Less interventionist policies.**

I assume you mean abroad, because your policies would lead to the government 'intervening' in our economic lives a whole lot more.

&gt; **More involvement in Europe**

In what sense? Is the metric here going to be how quickly we accede to European directives? We're already amongst the best at that. Again, specifics are always useful. Vague principles like this and 'transparency' mean nothing without qualification.

&gt; **More investment in the NHS.**

Who's paying for that, and how? As medical technology and life-expectancy increase, the cost of providing healthcare is going to keep increasing, and substantially. Whilst it is treated as a gift from the gods here, pragmatism says we have to keep spending on it in check unless we're prepared to spend any sum on health to the detriment of other government spending. Or perhaps you have a plan to raise new revenue?

&gt;**End tax loopholes**

I assume you think that'll do it. It won't. Tax is complicated, and gets more complicated each time more taxes are introduced. We might not like tax off-shoring and the like, but global corporates aren't as desperate to be shored on our green and pleasant land as you seem to think. For better or for worse, our tax policy has to factor the competition with other countries, and loopholes are a factor in that.

My preference would be for a lower corporation tax rate to draw more firms in (see Ireland), but perhaps that doesn't have quite the same tabloid cachet.

&gt;**Build more social housing**

House building costs more than it did in the 50s and 60s. Again, who's paying? Also, where are we supposed to be building these new houses? I assume you're also keen on keeping the greenbelt and the countryside as-is, and it does little benefit to build houses outside of where people want to live. The only tenable way government can increase demand for housing outside of London and the south-east is to provide tax incentives elsewhere, which again, we can ill-afford.

&gt;**Start to pay off the national debt**.

And this is where you really come unstuck. 2 reasons:

1. We would **never** pay-down the national debt. That is entirely counter-productive. If the deficit is less than growth, than the national debt as a % of GDP goes down. It would do us no favours to increase taxes to actually pay-down this debt ahead of schedule. This is a fundamental point you've missed.

2. You've just given a list of policies which all create huge pressure on the public purse, and yet the only tax-raising policies I see are the ever-popular 'tax weed' and 'close loopholes'. Even with the most optimistic projections, these two will come nowhere near to paying for this new expenditure. The national debt would without question increase dramatically under a a FMN2014 government, in which case, our ability to finance it would continue to worsen, as the rate of interest we pay would become more onerous. This continental cycle is one we'd do well to avoid, but which we would face head-on if we spent as much and apparently as unquestioningly as you propose.


Any tax rise capable of raising substantive revenue will fall on the already squeezed middle. This will depress demand, and almost certainly push the economy back into recession (see Japan right now).

I know we are a different team than, say, Man City for example but I have watched a lot of city over the last couple seasons.  You NEVER see the opposition getting a free run at City's back line.  Fernandinho or Zabaleta will crush anyone that tries to run at the back 4.  Gerrard simply doesn't have the experience or mindset to protect the back line.  He's spent an entire career in the number 10 role.  Although he has the tackling ability, he doesn't have the defensive awareness or pace to recover.  It doesn't help that LFC lack a dangerous long-range shooting midfielder, so Gerrard tries to fill that role as well, but this just leaves him out of position, repeatedly.  It's unfair to him to expect him to be a counter-crushing, ball winner when he has never been that type of player.  The lack of explosive pace up top means teams can mark Gerrard, mitigating his ball distribution, which completely neuters his deep-lying purpose and exposes him as a liability.  

I'd humbly suggest giving Gerrard some bench time and playing Can in that holding midfield role.

false,sneakyi,lfcflame,,"It's not having 20-20 vision mate, no manager in their right mind would want to go into a season with Sturridge as their main goalscorer.

His injury record has always been appalling, hardly something we didn't  know. It comes down to how we replaced our other striker. We didn't  replace him adequately.

It's just typical that we ended up taking a  punt on Balotelli, after losing one of the best strikers in the world. Trying to be clever and increase a misfit's value.

As for Sanchez, it took him a few games to get up and running but you can see his quality. 8 goals and the effect he has on the rest of the team, yes I would have been more than happy. Ask any Arsenal fan if they are happy with Sanchez.

We have filled the squad with so many gambles, whether it be on youngsters who may come good in the future, misfit's and players with injury issues, that it has come back to bite us. Then the odd player of experience is left floundering in a team unrecognisable from the club they left. Sahko, Lallana and dare I say it, Lovren aren't  bad players. They are just not at the level where they can cover the team's flaws.

What happened last season? A world class player having the season of his career and a sometimes fit strike partner who still managed 20 goals. They lifted the rest of the team and covered for their faults.

This sub was praising the work done in the summer and saying we should be worshipping Ian Ayre, when it was obvious we hadn't achieved the what the team needed.

Boyata then pushes the ball towards Lovern's outside, by the time he's re-orientated to that side he's already given Boyata enough space for the shot. 

My description may be poor but just watch the replay, it just seemed so inexplicable to me why he would turn inside in the first place.   ",0,1416816920,null,0,false,0,cmbfv31,t3_2n67ts,t1_cmbfv31,t3_2n67ts,null,1425868827,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
