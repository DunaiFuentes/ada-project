I wonder if he thinks he's **actually** tricking people with this bullshit.  Like nobody's gonna notice he tried to shoehorn Zarate into Carroll's position with his usual approach.

Nolan just needs to go.  Nothing I saw from him last season endeared me to him, and nothing from this pre-season has changed that.  Noble or Reid are at **least** as capable as captain, and as a bonus are virtually guaranteed to never get sent off -- at least not for kicking out at another player like Nolan did, and certainly not a second time in a season in his first match back on the pitch.

**Any decent player** can reap the results of crosses knocked down by a target man.  There's nothing fancy about Nolan here; if we'd had someone like Zarate in Nolan's spot last season, I can virtually guarantee you he would have ended the campaign with more than six goals.

The only real positive I can take away from the pre-season so far is that both Jarvis and Downing seem to have woken the fuck up.  I'd love it if that was all it took for us to finish at least top ten this season, but it won't be.

More broadly, a lot depends on opposition. Against weaker sides, or if we need a goal, Capoue-Holtby or Schneiderlin-Holtby seems ideal. Against stronger sides, slot Dembele or Paulinho alongside Morgan or Capoue, and against top sides, or to finish matches out, play them next to each other, or Bentaleb alongside either Capoue or Schneiderlin.

More likely to get stuff nicked in a shared house.

I would still give it a shot though, as it definitely is a part of tv history and there are some really great stories. Ones I would recommend, in no particular order:

The Naked Time

Miri

Balance of Terrror

Space Seed

The City on the Edge of Forever

Mirror, Mirror

The Trouble With Tribbles

The Enterprise Incident

The Cloud Minders

As far as liking the new movies vs. the old stuff is concerned, I think you'll find that the shows are a lot more thought provoking and philosophical as compared to the nu-Trek. Of course, they have the luxury of doing that, as a weekly television show can, whereas a tent-pole summer blockbuster doesn't really. However if you like action, definitely check out the last 4 seasons of Deep Space Nine. Gigantic interstellar war. It's fucking awesome. In fact in my opinion, if you only watch one episode of Trek, ever, that episode should be DS9: In the Pale Moonlight (Season 6, Episode 19). Obviously you'll enjoy it more if you watch the show up until that point and are invested in the characters, but I honestly think it's the most powerful Trek episode out there even if you don't. Grapples with a great philosophical question, check it out.

The referendum for an assembly was a narrow one, I think it was 50.3% to 49.7% on a turn out of about 25%. However support for the assembly has increased since, I don't think there are many people in Wales who support it simply because they think Wales as a nation has to have some form of government (those that do might as well support outright independence, which only 10% of the population do). Rather the assembly is generally seen has having made an improvement on wales because matters affecting Wales can be handled by its own government rather than by the british government which also has the rest of the country and international affairs to handle.

I don't know what the situation is like in Scotland but prior to devolution, Scotland already had its own legal system and other things such as school system that were handled by the british government's scotland office, so a devolved parliament to handle that would only have been logical. Northern Ireland also has had its own laws and, unlike Scotland, did have its own parliament to administer the territory within Britain until the parliament was disbanded when the troubles kicked off.

I couldn't afford to go out for a while once I needed a new boiler and electrics (remember a house will have these added extra costs), but I got through it.

As my salary increased it become more manageable... I then decided to bring in a lodger too... it was probably the most disposable income I've had in my life.

It now means that I was able to live in the family home I have today... buying my 1st house was one of the best things I've done.

In short, if you believe your salary will increase (highly likely) and are willing to sacrifice a social life or bring in a lodger if/when money gets tight, then go for it.

It's got good stuff like rosehip oil, hyaluronic acid and argan oil. It has aloe vera too which I think might be irritating for some people and iirc it has one alcohol ingredient but I think it's only a tiny amount. You can get it from TK Maxx.

Alpha Hydroxy Enhanced Lotion Anti Wrinkle 10% Glycolic Acid - it's a good exfoliator and I love the moisture and the glow it gives right after you apply it. I highly recommend it. You can get it from Amazon (imported from the US but mine arrived 6 days after I ordered it!).

Avon Sun+ SPF 30 Moisturising Face Cream - leaves my skin soft, smooth and less dry. If you're not sensitive to fragrance, it's a good, cheap sunscreen.

true,RanchWorkerSlim,num26,,"Hello and welcome, here is a copy&amp;pasted comment i posted to a similar post like this last month:

***General info about us***

* Based in North London.

* We are one of the oldest cubs in the prem and have never been out of the ~~top division~~ Prem.

* Our main rivals are Arsenal. Other rivals are West Ham and Chelsea (and a lot of us Spurs fans hate Real Madrid)

* Our league position aims are always a minimum of 4th, in which we realistically expect 4th, nothing more. But then we finish 5th a lot, which we are always *ok* with.


***Info on our current team***

* Lloris (our keeper - 2nd best in the world), Eriksen (our midfield maestro) and Vertonghen (our star CB - one of the best in the prem) are our key players. Learn about them and always keep an eye out for them.

* Dawson is our captain but he's widely expected to leave in the coming weeks and it will most likely be Lloris who will become our new captain

* Our new manager is a promising, tactical and relatively young Argentine called Mauricio Pochettino. He replaced Tim Sherwood (a failed project) who took over from AVB (a very young, very bright manager who was relatively controversially sacked)

* ~~We are in desperate need of a new left-back and you will hear us constantly whine about it (but we like whining about it, don't worry).~~ We also need a new striker, although not essential, we are lacking in goal scoring ability up front (which has been a major problem of ours for the last couple of seasons). Lastly, we are also ~~desperate for~~ would like a playmaker (someone who spots that pass) as we sold one of the best playmakers in the world a couple of years ago (modric) and haven't replaced him since.

* **Lamela!!!!!!!!!!** He is the player we will probably talk about most. He's our record signing for 30mil. He got a succession of bad injuries last season which extremely hindered him. He's young and got a ridiculous, mouth-watering amount of potential thats just dying to be harvested.


***Important people associated with the club***

* **Bill Nicholson**. Look him up, seriously. He is our god. Legend amongst legends. He guided us to unparalleled triumphs and got us to the height of world football in the 60s. He was our manager in the late 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

* Ledley King. Nicknamed 'The King of the Lane'. He was our captain from 2005 till his retirement 2 years ago. He was one of the best english 21st century CB's. He's my all-time favourite player and I'm sure he is too for the majority of Spurs fans. He is now an ambassador for the club.

* Harry Redknapp. Some may think this is a strange one. He managed us from 08 to 12 and got us to play some of the best football the club had ever done. He was one of our best managers ever (certainly in the 21st century) and guided us to an unbelievable quarter-final place in the Champions League. He is still hugely popular amongst Spurs fans, especially American fans, as he was one of the, if not THE, main reasons of the massive increase in American support for spurs from 08 onwards (due to his amazing attacking play).

* Daniel Levy. Our current chairman. Loves to drive a hard bargain. Extremely (if not the best in the world) good at getting an amazing return (money wise) on our players. Views on him are so incredibly 50/50, best to stay out of Levy debates until you've done your homework.

***Extra info***

* We tend to sell our superstars, so watch out.

* Spurs are known throughout English football that their fans suffer the most. This is due to the ~~literal~~ figurative roller-coaster of a season we have (you'll find out soon enough).

* In the last 6 years we have gone off the boil towards the last stretch of the PL, usually March time -- so watch out for that 

* Our nicknames are: Yid Army, Yids, Spurs and The Lillywhites

After I left uni it turned into a graduate account (basically the same if I remember rightly, including the overdraft) for a year or two then into a more standard account (overdraft limit stayed but was no longer interest free).

I've not had to deal with them much more than that really but what little I have had has been good service, and they have excellent online banking.

As I said, someone who has been a student more recently might have more up to date info, but for what it's worth they were good for me. ",0,1407182824,null,0,false,0,cjguhnb,t3_2cm9jx,t1_cjguhnb,t3_2cm9jx,null,1435066333,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You're the one writing stuff 'in a bid to stop being sued.'

Look up defamation yourself. You are not covered cos you say 'allegedly' or this may or may not have happened.

And look up Contempt of Court for your arrest thing.

You can report a crime, arrests, charges but not imply that the suspect is guilty. Those laws are to ensure fair trial by jury, nothing at all to do with defamation.

Most definitely, it was the same with Man City, and Mancini was gone.

If it was anyone but Mourinho last Season, they would have also got the chop, how long he has with the club I think depends massively on this Season.

If we don't win the League, I can't see him staying, his excuses are invalid with the signing on Costa. He was lucky Liverpool gifted us their win, I true believe if he lost the last 2, he wouldn't be here, which is why he was acting ""depressed"" near the end of the Season.

true,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"I don't think the reason they reoffend is because of any perceived lack of punishment though. It's a well-accepted fact that there's a causal link between poverty and crime. Our current system is that we take a person who's grown up in poverty who gets arrested for stealing (for example), put him in prison, give him no skills, end any job prospects he might have with a criminal record, and surround him with people who can help him get into more serious crime that pays even better than the minor stuff that got him in there. That's the real problem. We put convicts in a position where it's borderline impossible for many of them to ever adjust and fit in to civil society and then punish them for not doing so, worsening the situation, and then we sit around as though there's no obvious conclusions to be drawn here.

You're certainly right that there's definitely a problem of being, in a sense, middle of the road here. Both Labour and Conservatives (after being confronted by mounting evidence by home office investigations and pressure groups like the Howard League) have realised that punishment is not an effective deterrent and that there are not enough measures in place to reduce recidivism. But as you said, there's not really been any measures taken to redress the balance so, as you said, we end up with a situation where our prison system doesn't hand out super-severe punishments but also doesn't want to implement any policies to reform offenders. We need to look at what countries like Norway are doing right to get such low recidivism rates and totally disregard the opinions of those Daily Mail readers who want capital punishment, cut off hands for theft etc.",0,1407185382,null,0,1407185953,0,cjgvx2c,t3_2cl4wn,t1_cjgvx2c,t1_cjgq1gn,null,1435067087,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,fameistheproduct,null,null,"When you borrow money to buy a property then rent it out, the proportion of the money that is interest paid to the bank can be off set any against income you generate from rental. 

If you're buying a house to live in it, you don't get any tax relief. If fact you've already paid tax on your income. People who earn money from their work are at a disadvantage to those who are making money from their money.

So people buy property, rent it out covering costs, and mortgage payments. There's little motivation to pay off the debt as interests rates are so low. But what's screwed is that any BTL buyer is able to get the maximum leverage and generally buy because they expect their profit to be the house price increase (Substituting speculation greed with ""it's for pension"") over the medium to long term.

Stupid things are, as the price increases (as it's part of a bubble) of the property and borrowing cost have gone down. The landlord has been able to remortgage ""extracting""  asset value and then go looking for another property to BTL. 

This tax relief was introduced in 1997, by Tony Blair's government. Funny how it makes really good business for the banks. Ed Milliband's ""Hard working Britions"" is probably one of the most hypocritical things he has said in the last few years. His party caught the economic boom and then double down on making it worse for the next generation.

The reason lucas doesnt work there in that system and why he never will be a first choice is because his passing range doesnt excede 10 yards. He cant control the tempo of the game and break things up with a long diagonal ball like gerrard. He always slows down the play and allows other teams defenses to get into position. 

On your point about gerrard having more defensive errors than other cb is because when gerrard has the ball hes  pressured by midfielders and striker and generally the cb have split to each side with the fullbacks up high (very limited cover until Mignolet) Yes its crucial that he doesnt loose the ball and thats what he needs to improve. 

Overall he is so far superior to  lucas in that role.

Edit:   
That role needs more of a pirlo and less makelele.

- Domestic ducks can interbreed with wild Mallards and dilute the gene pool. Mallards are Amber-listed meaning that their populations in the UK are declining.
- Some domestic ducks cannot fly (usually their wings are clipped) or move around quickly. This means that they are more vulnerable to predators, loose dogs, and unscrupulous humans. Also, during bad weather, they may not readily seek shelter or unfrozen water as a wild duck would and may die of exposure.

Such a system would always need to have redundancy and access control built in.  It would also need to be able to send data to clients which could then leak data outside of the database.

The best way to share data is almost always to dump it to a file and let the other organisation process it as they please.  If you can't trust them with the entire dataset then you can't trust them with more limited access.  If they have a genuine requirement to use the data then annoying APIs just get in the way.

2) Are you wanting to do straight compsci or go through natural sciences? Even if you do compsci you'll be doing some natsci courses first year (most compscis do physics). The more sciences you do the better, and biology sure isn't going to hurt. However maths/further maths/physics sets you up quote nicely. If you prefer something like English lit/history and that's what you're interested in then by all means do it but I don't think it will give you a real advantage. Do whatever you're most passionate about, because that is what will come through at your interview. 

I went into physics natural sciences with maths/further maths/biology/chemistry/physics and me having no humanities was never a problem. In fact,  most people just had 3 science A levels.

While I don't mind if we sell Daws, saying things like this makes him out to be a much worse player than he is. You could also argue that he most likely saved us points last season as well seen as he lead the team in blocked shots per game, clearances per game, offsides won per game and was 4th in interceptions per game.

I'm not saying he should start, I'm not even saying we shouldn't sell him (although I wouldn't mind keeping him around) I'm just saying you're doing a disservice to arguably our most consistent and best overall defender last season.

Out of the choices you listed, Biology is definitely best if you can't do Chemistry. You normally need two sciences to get onto NatSci, with which CompSci is partially merged in your first year.

I'd rather associate ourselves with a team in the MLS and have friendly ties back and forth. I just want to win right now. So I'm not sure if getting another team in another league is exactly what we want. 

That being said, I think it'd also be good if we could do that, and we'd keep younger players active in those leagues where we could monitor more closely. And we could develop on our terms while still getting fire team looks for our ""side"". So it'd have been intriguing to keep Frank, and get him on to said Chelsea American FC.

Being from Denmark, any other fans than ManU (unintelligent pricks), Chelsea (arrogant pricks), Arsenal (entitled pricks) and Liverpool (self-pitying pricks) are extremely rare. All of their fans are terrible and think they're better than each other and everyone else. And don't you *dare* root for a worse team than these! Fuck that, and fuck them. They don't love their club, they love the success and the sense of superiority. 

I've always wanted to stand out and have something of my own when it comes to football, and I chose Spurs back when I was around 12-13 (six years ago) as I consider(ed) the club an underdog with lots of potential - much the same way as I see myself.

The players are great and I remember going to a game four years ago at WHL with my dad and #JD18 scored a bicycle kick after just 30 seconds of play against ManU. Crowd exploded, and so did my pants. That goal was fucking majestic, I remember the scenario ever so clearly to this day. Bought the full away kit after the game, wore it for football practice three times a week the next two years. Ever since then I've been completely hooked on everything Spurs, and I think of the club all the time. I love that I've become so passionate about Spurs. I really love this club and the people in it.

If schools teach about the Hundred Years War, or the American War of Independence, it's taught relatively neutrally. But because World War I cost so many lives, it's almost as if we feel the need to justify it as a war that needed to be fought. I believe that the UK was right to enter the war when it did, but Germany et al were not the big evil they were in World War II. Even then, the USSR committed massive war crimes and the Western Allies were not daisy fresh either.

The salary cap is currently at $3,100,000. Teams can spend up to this amount for their standard players' summed salaries. They get three Designated Players. These players are exceptions to the salary cap. Chelsea would be able to pay whatever they wanted to these players. The average Chelsea player, even deeper players on the bench, would count as a DP.

Unless the MLS rules change, it would be impractical. Our players bring to large of salaries to play in MLS after the used DP spots.

We are already having enough trouble with the homegrown rule as it is and lets be honest, most MLS players wouldn't even make it in the Championship. Sending a youth player to play in MLS would basically be putting two nails in their coffin. They are training at a lower level than they would with an English loan and they lose their home grown status. Basically, sending a player to MLS would be just like sending them to Vitesse now, except we'd have to deal with MLS having a different schedule than we do, odd wage rules, the constant thought that the league can reject our transfers at any time for any reason, and no chance the team ever giving our players European experience.

Honestly, over the next 10 years, I doubt city's plan will go as expected. As MLS grows, I am really doubting they are going to let their league become a training ground for the European super clubs. They are going to want the talent to stay in the league.

Now, IMO a smart move would be a partnership like we have with Vitesse, except with an English club, that way they can retain their homegrown status.",0,1407191703,null,0,false,0,cjgz94z,t3_2clw17,t1_cjgz94z,t3_2clw17,null,1435068814,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Also the colonies tend to get forgotten sometimes, or at least it seems that way.

I wonder if WWI will always hold this significance to us, and how long it will take before it drifts so far into history that it becomes 'just another war.' That may never happen though, and it would be sad if it did. 

Also, apologies if this is inappropriate / irrelevant, but I visited my Granddad a while back and we got looking at old photos.

Re-runs on comcast sportsnet, youtube highlights. other than espn it was pretty hard to watch them before nbc sports really made it a priority to show the EPL in america. 

But i will never forget the game that will make me a fan for life. It was tottenham vs west ham on a tuesday and i just got home from class, i sprawled out on my couch and put the game on. It was honestly the one game i watched where the action captivated me the whole way through. Bale was a man possessed and when he scored the game winner i felt emotion for the first time and connected with the team. Its kinda hard to become emotionally invested like that when you don't grow up around it but that game did it for me.

It wouldn't really be a developing ground, just to make that clear. City aren't really doing that, and it isn't a good idea. City will loan 4 young players, no more. They will have already been developed in the academy, and it will just be to get playing time and to experience New York City, which I haven't been to but I hear is the greatest city in the world. I've watched Seinfeld, though. It seems okay, I guess.

Here's some context: almost a decade ago, C.D. Guadalajara in Mexico (aka Chivas (Spanish for ""Goats"")) decided to make an expansion team in MLS called Chivas USA. Long story short: it was a disaster. They've been a good team on occasion, but for most of their existence they've been one of the bottom feeders. And they've always been at the bottom in attendance numbers. Last year they had a lawsuit involving racism (firing people just because they were not Hispanic) and this year MLS bought them out, and will sell them to new owners to be rebranded next season. Again, it was a disaster.

Moral of the story: the Chivas experiment failed miserably, and if Chelsea expands into MLS they need to do what it looks like City is doing: differentiate between both teams so that the club has it's own identity.

I think that playing friendlies in the US is smart to develop the brand, and I think that some kind of affiliation would be smart as well (maybe loan out a player or two, sell Chelsea stuff in the gift shop, etc.) but full-on buying an expansion team, or buying an existing team, would be risky and might cause more harm than it's worth.",0,1407194427,null,0,false,0,cjh0lc5,t3_2clw17,t1_cjh0lc5,t3_2clw17,null,1435069293,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

&gt;Domestic violence refuge provision at crisis point, warn charities
Women's groups say broadscale closure of safe houses putting support for some of most vulnerable people back 40 years




&gt;Domestic violence refuges are being closed across the country in a crisis that is putting support for the most vulnerable women and children back 40 years, leading charities have warned.

&gt;Specialist safe houses for women and children – which were forged out of the feminist movement in the 1970s – are being forced to shut by some local authorities because they do not take in male victims.


&gt;Key concerns raised by women's groups include:....Funding cuts because refuges do not take men. 

...

&gt;Coventry and Wolverhampton are examples of cities where a new focus on providing accommodation for male victims has led to funding being cut for traditional women's refuges.

...

&gt;The Wolverhampton Haven, which has run the refuges for 41 years, is having its funding from the city cut by £300,000 and – as it struggles to maintain services – has been forced to reserve some of its places for men, even though it has had no male referrals to the accommodation so far.

...

&gt;""Without adequate refuge provision, women experiencing domestic violence will be faced with a stark choice: flee to live rough on the streets or remain with their abuser and risk further violence or even worse. Refuges are so much more than a roof over a head.

...


&gt;Horley called for an urgent review of the commissioning process across the country and criticised the focus on male victims as deeply flawed.

&gt;""The vast majority of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women,"" she said. ""Of those who experience four or more incidents … 89% are women.""

&gt;Specialist refuges that take in victims of violence in forced marriages and of female genital mutilation have been particularly affected. This comes as the home affairs select committee report on FGM has called for better services, including refuges, for those at risk.

How many male victims of infant genital mutilation are in UK?  I know it's not as prevalent there, but it's still a nonzero number.

&gt;""These women have very specialist needs and need specialist refuges. They have been trafficked, or involved in forced marriages, are victims of FGM, or so-called 'honour' crime.

1. US visa/labor laws are pretty relaxed for athletes compared to Europe.  I can't recall too many players having visa issues in other US sports, aside from [weird human trafficking situations in baseball.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Ogando#Human_trafficking_ring)
2. If Chelsea/City is picking up the tab, then those players wages could be mostly covered by the home team and not part of the MLS team's cap.
3. EPL teams would be unlikely to send the cream of the crop youth talent to the US.  I'd imagine they'd want to loan them out to teams in big 5 leagues, the Eredivisie, and Primeira Liga leagues where the competition is a little stiffer.  We'd be getting lesser prospects and therefore lesser salaried players.

I'm interested to see what City does.  I imagine their goal is to increase their brand recognition (thus revenue), build player funnels, and have easy places to loan out players recovering from injury/disgruntled/not getting enough first team action.  I just don't see it being in the best interest of US Soccer and maybe not the MLS.

All the stuff with River Plate is apparently very confusing (Villareal paid money to River Plate some years ago to buy a portion of like 9 players, and thye could switch who the players were at some point) and could end up in court between River Plate and Villareal so there is no point to trying get River Plate to sell their portion.

22 years ago Erik ""The Viking"" Thorstvedt throwers his gloves to the fans at WHL. Being one of Norways best players all time and so god damn nice person, me as a 7 year old Norwegian guy were sold (bought by Lord Sugar several times in my dreams, even played for Gerry Francis one night). 

Soon there were two players standing out. Mysterious Darren Anderton who always were injured but played awesome at the same time. And being the little naive do gooder of a Norwegian, the struggle of first diabetic top tier player Garry Mabbutt. My older and cooler cousins favourite. (He actually wrote several letters to the guy without getting answers. At the age of ten, he wrote his last, a five pages lie about him (my cousin) also having diabetes and being bullied on his team for it. Result: his first reply from the Mabb himself, also five pages long! But that was a digression.)

My first trip to WHL came at 13. My parents took me. Subway full of spurs fans, first I've seen in my life except my cousin. A loot of cheering. Then, suddenly quiet, some single boos, but mostly quiet. Mom and dad didn't understand. But I saw the sign of the station: Highbury. Train leaving and cheering went on with more power. I was home. Tottenham lost 3-2 vs Leicester. But I'll never forget Steffen Iversen scoring his second, and the fifty year old Irish man sitting next to me screaming to my mom: you are Norwegians, can I kiss your son mam?

It seems that, as of now, only the portion payed by the league (MLS) to a player counts towards the salary cap. This seems to be a little contentious though, as it essentially bypasses the cap. It will be interesting to see what comes of this, as it is almost certain that the non-City affiliated teams will almost certainly pressure the league to close it (and as it is an American League they have legitimate power).

Another interesting point is that loans for young european players may not be a good idea for MLS teams. The current European players who play in the MLS are often brought in for their high quality of play and brand recognition. They can improve a team drastically and also increase a team's revenue.

If you bring in a loan player, their contribution on and off the field will not be as dramatic.

Edit: Reasons -- Please counter my points if you can see the flaws; but i see Migs as lackluster at times like he doesnt know what to do (whether go to one side or the other) last season in particular he made some pretty drastic mistakes in 1-2 games. Yes he was a savior at the beginning of the season but i feel that he has been sloping downwards. Mostly i think that he feels he doesnt have to try hard because he doesnt have any competition and his spot is cemented. I wish BR would give Pepe a chance just to rustle some jimmies and improve them both instead of picking favorites.

Honestly first goal he moved and yes it was difficult angle but the ball wasnt going too hard. 

2nd goal took a deflection but he didnt even make an attempt to punch the ball he just stared at it

third defense and it could have gone inside with any keeper.

He is a decent keeper but i just dont think he is a great keeper and plus i feel he has  become complacent ",0,1407203588,null,0,1407204387,0,cjh54g9,t3_2cn0am,t1_cjh54g9,t3_2cn0am,null,1435071518,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Villareal are trying to figure out a way to get as much money as they can because they know they have to pay out to the other parts AND fund a transfer of his replacement.  As it was quoted earlier today they would stand to get between ~£6m to ~£7m as their cut of the deal. 

River Plate just want money and want the deal to go through, but (depending on what you read) there seems to be some disagreement between River and Villareal about the money that would be needed.  This seems tied to how Villareal got the rights to Mussachio...they got the rights because they went to River several years ago and paid a lump sum for a cut of something like 9 players, of which Mussachio want's one...but there was a clause in the agreement that allowed Villareal to switch 2 of the 9 players rights, they did so and got Mussachio....but it sounds like River and Villareal don't necessarily agree on the % of money that would change hands, people think it may result in a court case at some point....Regardless a statement from River basically said ""we won't be going to court but we will be getting paid for the player"".

The agent part was explained as the easiest to solve since apparently the agent wants Mussachio to move to us (more money to him over the long haul)....so pay the agent ""X"" amount of money to buy out his share and then have him make up that amount in ""agents fees"" paid on the sale, Villareal then pocket the difference.

Regardless it sounds like all people want it to go through, Mussachio wants to move and his agent wants him to move to us, we want him (Apparently Poch loves him) and Villareal seem to have come to the conclusion that he won't ever suit up for them again regardless of what is going on.....now it's just a case of getting Villareal to sort out their shit.

Point about the length of this is well taken. I'll admit that in part it was a ramble, just venting my frustrations at the situation. Having moved to a new town, I don't really have the network of people yet in real life that I can do that to. Taking your points in turn:

I don't ramble on my CV, or on a covering letter. I'm as concise and precise about things as I can. Same in an interview. I give responses to what they've asked, and don't go on about how I want this job because my Great Aunt Flo was a Chemist years back and how I should follow on (etc etc).

The few minutes for a job application is in part said with hyperbole. However, more and more things these days go through people such as yourself. And when you do your search for, let's say, ""Chemistry in West Midlands"", you get x results. Go to the job page, and it's ""My client..."" or ""Company Confidential"" more often than not. It's few times where I can actually see whom I'm applying for.

In those cases, sure. You can tailor things much better. And obviously before the interview, I'm no fool. I do my due diligence. I research the company, what they're about, where they are going. I think about the things that *are* weak about my application for x position, and think about how I can address that in an interview.

 Don't commemorate important events because people are dying now and it happened in the past anyway?



The point is wwi changed Britain completely.


 It's not that some people died in a war, it's that pretty much everyone died in a war and no one came away without some loss. 


Aside from that there the were obviously political ramifications which broke Britain/ rest of Europe for a while and changed the entire dynamic of the ""world stage"". 


People have said that although wwii financially broke Britain and recovery from wwi was doable - it was wwi that mentally broke Britain and the ""scars"" remain till this day. I'd say I agree with that.

true,196884,null,null,"Quick thoughts :

We play 4-3-3, with Stevie sitting deep and Allen/Henderson in front of him. Our front 3 is (left to right) Sterling-Lambert-Coutinho. We kept shape more or less until the subs came in. Again, we play an intense pressing game, forcing transitions and causing all sorts of problems for the United at the back. The intensity was very surprising for a friendly, but I think BR might be using this as a practice match (""go play like real"").

In general, even though we lost, we played better -- more organized, much better penetration, and much more confident on the ball. We should  have been 3-0 up by half time. Sterling's 2nd pen shout was completely legit. 

Comments on players :

Lambert : Again, Rickie is lost here. Misplaced passes, not doing runs, and general (and obvious) lack of confidence here. The fact that we are playing a system that he is not suited to may explain a bit, but to me it seems like he is suffering from the fact that he is not quite sure of his role in the Liverpool high intensity style. Without Lallana, he seems lost.  His off-the-ball movement is static.

Coutinho : Great all round game. And he hit a shot on target. And that flick with the back of his leg while under pressure in front of our own box is genius. He is playing with very high confidence right now, and he looks determined to prove a lot of people wrong. I bet BR is over the moon with his attitude right now.

Sterling : He is just getting better and better each game, and I mean *literally*. He was great vs Milan, but in this game he is simply unplayable. He skinned everyone in the game, and his off the ball play is ....dare I say....Suarezlike -- constantly probing for holes and space and generally very hard to track. United players are petrified of him. 

Ibe : Lambert may not be our impact sub this season. But Ibe has a great chance to be. He came on, and immediately generates an impact with his physicality and skill. His decision making needs work, but he seems liek someone who has bedded in with the ""liverpool style"", and he knows what to do off the ball. I like the fact that he cries for the ball, and wants it play to him. Keep at it, and he will be a revelation this season.

Gerrard : Oh stevie, stevie. He is poor defensively, and didn't do so great offensively. He is directly at fault for the 2nd goal (Mata was his man).  After this game, if BR have thoughts about selling Lucas, he will have second thoughts now. Lucas came on and his positional awareness is immediate -- less holes for United to play in the middle.

Skrtel + Sakho + Toure : Both Sakho and Skrtel have good games in general, but our old bugbear of playing too deep again come and haunt us. (The first goal was a brilliant finish by rooney -- maybe skrtel shuld be tighter to his man but he was closing down the angles.). The 3rd goal was totally us dropping in too deep, and giving up the entire space in front of the box for united to play in. Yes, it was a counter attack, but when the ball got to Kagawa, the entier defense line needs to *push up*, not sit back. THis is why BR is buying Lovren -- there is nothing wrong with the skillset of our defenders. This is a clear failure in leadership at the back (somebody needs to get everyone pushing up).

Johnson : not a good game, though not really that bad defensively. His offensively play however, is costing us with him making bad decisions.

In general, good game. Yes we lost, but the signs are great for a good season. Many of our players seem to have stepped up a notch -- Coutinho, Sterling,  Ibe, Skrtel, Henderson (nice to see him trying tricks again). So I am not too worried. on the other hand, If I am LVG, I will be livid even if manu won the game.

3. Even *if* Chelsea were willing to take a complete loss on Torres *and* we found a willing buyer, Torres would still have to consent to leaving. Let's be honest, why would he? He's not going to find a club more likely to win trophies than Chelsea, and he's never going to a get a contract with wages anywhere near what he has now. He's got a lot of the leverage in this position, he can chose to stick around if he wants to.

The most realistic option would be to simply release him, which would be stupid; Chelsea would have to pay out the remainder of his contract anyways, but lose the service (limited though it may be) he can give to the team.",0,1407205422,null,0,false,0,cjh610r,t3_2cnbmb,t1_cjh610r,t3_2cnbmb,null,1435072048,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

What he offers is through balls and size and decent finishing in the box.  If he is going to play on his own in a 4-3-3, then he needs Sterling and Markovic or Ibe as wide forwards, not Coutinho, who is a midfielder. Then he can play almost as a false 9 and look to play in the faster guys with short passes in behind, and then getting into the box for pull backs.

More agile defenders are better suited to play against the other top teams, with a couple of exceptions. Big powerful defenders are best utilised at set-pieces and aerial play, which are much more commonly employed by the smaller teams. 

I feel that this season, Poch will be able to significantly decrease dropping silly points against the lower teams, simply by keeping the lads motivated (and obviously tactically too). If you are winning your games more than 1-0 against lower teams, you are less vulnerable to set-pieces.

I do think we may still struggle against the top sides though this season. We are stronger, but so are they. I believe that agile defenders are better suited to dealing with the likes of Mata, Silva, Fabregas, Cazorla... the Spanish style of attack which most of the top teams are now employing. 

The one thing that I think most people will agree on, is that forming a consistent partnership (injuries allowing) will be key, regardless of who you play. If you look at Mascherano or even Medel at the world cup, inferior size can largely be made up for by intelligent position and determination, so in my opinion we give more away by relying on less mobile but powerful defenders.

It was a match where the contestants were confirmed only a few days before the match, which means that most of the fans in attendance could not have been the passionate ones for either side. Another thing to note, Miami is notorious for bandwagon fans; just look at this years NBA finals. They began leaving the stadium halfway through the match, cause their team was down, so that shows you the passion and loyalty the have for their sports teams.

Now I can't speak for all the venues, but for New York which I attended there was a hellova support for Liverpool present. The bars were packed, many a song was sung with pride, and before the match a good march was made to the gates as one big giant Red family. However at the match itself, fans were disorganized and not seated as collectively as we would have liked. There was a good LFC section behind the goal, but the rest were dispersed, and so while the YNWA was better then in Boston, it was impossible to get songs going throughout the match.

Another thing to note is that unlike the Asia and Australia tours, we were up against some elite opposition, all Champions League calibre teams, which meant that unlike those tours, the support was not overwhelming Red. So you can't judge the fact that oh this was the worst crowd they played in front of just cause the final was bad and couldn't compare to the Melbourne or Bangkok games. Fun was had by us fans, and we did our jolly best to support our mighty Reds.",0,1407210135,null,0,1407210309,0,cjh89kr,t3_2cnjpa,t1_cjh89kr,t3_2cnjpa,null,1435073052,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I come from a family of soldiers - our history with the army goes back generations before we even *had* a British army, and while I can't say that every time a family member has fought has been for the right reason, it's been for an honourable cause. Soldiers don't choose where to go; they don't get the luxury of choosing their enemies, and they certainly don't get to survive war without wishing they were dead in most cases.

Out of six sons that went to the first world war, my family saw two return. Out of four sons that went to the second world war, one saw the British shores with his own eyes again. In both cases, they fought because they believed they were doing the right thing. They believed they were defending home, and once they were there, they never deserted their posts because you don't fight for your country or ideology; you fight for the people around you. They died defending the belief that if a person is unable to stand and fight for themselves and you're able to, you grit your teeth, you dig in and you fight hard enough for the *both* of you.

Yes. War is a waste of life - but war is only ever pointless if you *allow* it to be. If you want the second world war to have a point, stand the hell up and object to the surveillance state that's happening around us. Stand up for the thousands of Palestinians that are being murdered *right now*. Stand up and demand the changes you would see Britain make. Those brave young men fought to defend and safeguard those rights for the sons and daughters they would never see - don't diminish it with apathy. That's the greatest insult you could ever pay.

I think maybe this is why we're not focused on a Left Winger too hard, or I hope so. Maybe Poch wants Eriksen-Holtby-Lamela as the front 3 (I would rather have one more direct winger, like Depay one side, but anyway). Because Holtby reminds me of Kagawa at Dortmund. A VERY key aspect of their gegenpressing, the reason why he's not effective at Utd but also very creative too. Read any ''analysis'' of Kagawa at Dortmund, and it's his energy and creativity alongside the teams pressing that made him such a pivotal figure in that side. Holtby can do the same. **HE IS NOT A FUCKING MC.** OR DMC deep lying playmaker. **He's a AMC.** With creativity to rival anyone. It's no different from Kagawa going from ''un fucking believable'' in Germany to neglected and nothing in England. Lets not do the same to Holtby. 

Holtby is underrated by us in that regard as he's just usually a MC who runs his ass off for 60 minutes, get's tired, and can't make an impact on the game. But it's a lot less taxing if he's pressing from AMC and closing down CB's rather than a ''dog off the leash'' from MC tiring himself out. I've been downvoted a LOT recently because I know nothing about football evidently, so I'll provide some sources.

[Why Shinji Kagawa was successful at Borussia Dortmund but is not at Manchester United](http://www.thefalse9.com/2014/04/why-shinji-kagawa-was-succesful-at.html)

I'll link sources for these quotes, as I know nothing - but here goes.

*At Dortmund it would seem Kagawa was at home with Klopps pressing game and fast counter attacking style interchanging with Gotze, and eventually moving centrally due to a long term injury to Gotze. He clearly excelled at Dortmund working from the left and centrally and with a midfield that pressed the ball high up the pitch and hit teams with their pace once the ball was won back.*

**klopp on Kagawa**

*He hits his head with his palm. ""Shinji Kagawa is one of the best players in the world and he now plays 20 minutes at Manchester United – on the left wing! My heart breaks. Really, I have tears in my eyes*

I have tears in my eyes Holtby is not considered our AMC in Poch's system. Hopefully he will be after this pre-season. ",0,1407217751,null,0,1407219155,0,cjhb7wd,t3_2cl6nj,t1_cjhb7wd,t1_cjgwrfh,null,1435074418,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Basically comparing him to Kagawa and how vital Holtby is for us as a AMC, why he's failed with us and why Kagawa failed at Utd and thrived at Dortmund with similar pressing. And why as a result, Holtby should be our AMC. He's not a MC, he's not a DMC deep lying w/e bullshit term you wanna use. I'm newer here, but I frequent other forums (not giving my name though...) and I'm a keen tactics/scout nerd.

I don't really care about the downvotes, honestly. The only reason it's annoying is it means a perfectly valid PoV gets hidden - the points mean nothing to me, just because ''someone finds me annoying''. They could be -20 per downvote as long as your opinion didn't get hidden and it forced people to explain why they downvoted. Yet, I try and make threads from various sources, my own PoV and such on our Youth Players to contribute, then get downvoted to -20 for saying in every thread ''plz don't buy this guy''. It's annoying - I just picture some kid sat there like the dude from Dexters Lab thinking the downvotes actually mean/bother me. It's great.

If I *really* cared, I've got dat Reddit gold, and I bank much much more karma points than I lose. But I genuinely don't care about it and honestly - I don't downvote *anyone*, swear to the lord Lloris. Why are people so bothered by this? Why can't people understand that we ALL agreed Vlad &amp; Jan doesn't work, yet we're happy to spend 17 MILLION (now probably more with all the clauses and shit) on basically giving ourselves the same problem. I see no reason why Vlad couldn't have the same impact if he was in La Liga for the past 3 seasons. The football there is totally different, technical defenders *will* thrive. 

That's the thing. If I'm wrong - then I'll admit it. But so far from what I've seen, read and watched he's basically Chiriches with a few minor differences and has played consistently for his side. So then we have 17m spent, Vertonghen and Chiriches with Dier and possibly Dawson/Kaboul gone. I care about the club as much as anyone else - more so, in some respects as my Mothers family are born &amp; raised in Enfield and Tottenham and I've been going to games since I was 7, back in the ''dark ages'' of Colin Calderwood and Dean Austin.

I've seen you comment on this issue a number of times over recent days and I really think you overstate the problem. Vertonghen, Chiriches and Musacchio are all six foot tall and none of them are wimps who will be so easily muscled off the ball as you suggest. 

In most matches, if not all, Vertonghen and Musacchio would be a fine combination. For those that they aren't, we'll have the stronger Kaboul or Dier to come in. Personally I'd be starting Kaboul as much as possible anyway, but this either signals that Pochettino probably won't or that *whisper it so they don't throw a fit* Vertonghen will be leaving us.

The latter should be borne in mind even if it's not this summer. If we get Musacchio I would expect either Vertonghen to leave or Chiriches to get a year on loan, ready to come back next summer if Vertonghen leaves then.

My point being basically La Liga is a different ball game - technical defenders will thrive there. Hell, Mascherano plays CB now. They even tried Adriano there. The EPL is a different kettle of fish. Chiriches would most probably thrive at Villareal if he played full seasons like Mussachio. He was lightly linked to Barca himself before joining us. Yet we all agreed (well, most) that Vlad &amp; Jan wouldn't work. Why is this different now? And the price - it's the price that bothers me too. We're penny pinching (or good business, depends how you look at it) so far - yet dropping 17m on a guy that gives us 3 ball playing CB's, Dier and there's rumours Kaboul is off to Lazio and Dawson is Dawson. So we can't drop 17+m on this guy and never play him. Verts moving...I dunno. The whole ''happy at Spurs, 5 year deal'' appears to mean he isn't - at least for now. So either way we're in this situation. And are we spending similar amounts on MC, and left wing?

I'm not saying these guys are Mascherano at CB, or are weak, or whatever. But it's no coincidence in the EPL every side has a BIG defender. Your typical EPL defender. Cahil/Terry/Ivanovic (rb wtf?)/Zouma. Skrtel WAS 'Pools best CB. Sakho there too. Distin WAS Evertons best CB, and he's a man mountain. Kompany at City. Vidic was a beast. Arsenal even have 6'6 Mertesacker and Vermaelen, who is a beast in the air. Why not go for Curtis Davies? Ashley Williams? They both had AMAZING seasons. Matip? Shkodran Mustafi? Hell, even Nastasic if he gets disillusioned at City. Adil Rami, Naldo was arguably the best CB in Germany, and just at that age to give experience and is ready for Dier stepping up. 

See what I mean? We're gonna have the same Vlad &amp; Jan issue, just with a 17m + guy that *has* to play and fit in. So it's basically him and Jan.

We all agree Vlad &amp; Jan doesn't work. Most EPL sides have a BIG man featuring. Terry, Cahill, Zouma, Ivanovic (rb? wtf), Skrtel, Distin, Mertesacker, Vermaelen (great in the air) Kompany and on and on and on. 

Vlad would excel in La Liga, imo, exactly the same had he played full seasons. (was lightly linked to Barca to before us) Vlad maintains a 88-90% pass completion ratio ffs, is an amazing tackler and has the technique of a CM. Musacchio has excelled in La Liga, and there the ball is played on the ground more so it's playing to his strengths (anticipation, interceptions, technique) over anything else. Whoscored even says his ''style of play'' is ''likes to dribble''. We're basically paying 17+m to have another Chiriches, when we all agreed that wouldn't work. So why does it now? Verts IS our first choice, and we won't bench a 17m+ signing. So it will be Verts and Musacchio together. But we all agreed basically that just doesn't work in the EPL with Vlad? So what is happening here? It doesn't look like Vertonghen is leaving, and it's unfair to dismiss Vlad already as like I said - I think he'd excel equally as Musacchio has. 

It would work PERFECTLY with Jan/Chiriches as the ball players, Big Guy NEW SIGNING/Dier. 1 Hummels type, 1 Subotic. Nesta/Maldini. Terry/Carvalho. Vidic/Ferdinand. Blanc/Desailly. All won major trophies with those set ups. Same as Yepes at 38 in the WC mopping up, and Zapata as the energetic dude. But that's not happening. Now we're having Jan/Chiriches/17m signing we can't bench.

Well that's not true. 

Cole when he moved here in 2006 didn't have a great first season and in fact said words to the effect that he felt he owed Jose something for not delivering.  

Cech was injured by Hunt in the 06/07 season and had a significant dip in form for at least two years after it. 

Ferreira was a very solid, consistent right back - in Jose's words 'always 7/10' but he faded after a few years and right back was a constant problemfor the 'completeness' of our squad. He was not better than Azpilicueta or Ivanovich, though he did an excellent job on Ronaldinho.

Actually if you wanted to argue that the support was better you should probably have mentioned Gallas, who left in exchange for Cole and was absolutely fantastic for us until he had his hissy fit. 

Either way Carvalho actually only left in 2010 and was probably the best centreback the club has had - ahead of Desailly etc. That said JT is of course also excellent and a far better leader.

That certainly isn't the case with Vertonghen, nor do I believe it is with Musacchio. Even with Chiriches it's more a case of lack of experience than lack of physical presence - i don't put the apparent consensus on him and Vertonghen not being a perfect pairing down to his physciality, more the former's inexperienced, devil-may-care play style.

Maybe some of those players you mention would be viable, but most if not all are too slow for my money, a trait that i consider more important in the PL these days. And maybe they're not available.

Even if they weren't slow and were available, i just don't see this as the disaster move you seem to want to paint it as. Why would he have to start just because of his price? As far as I'm concerned we'll have three CBs with equal claim to the start in Vertonghen, Kaboul and Musacchio, which is a great group that covers all the traits you could want a CB pairing to have at our level.

Personally i gove no weight to the whole ""happyhappyhappy, contract negotiations are underway"" from Vertonghen. Absolutely could stay, and that would be great, but there's still every chance he goes, and then this whole discussion is academic.

My point is is Chiriches I feel would excel exactly the same in La Liga as Musacchio has if he had all those consistent, first team football seasons. His average per game stats speak for themselves - he actually didn't have a *bad* season considering, just not consistent and barely played 20 games. His technique is flawless, his pass completion is solid 89% and his tackling is REALLY fucking good. 

So why not go with Jan/Chiriches (he seems happy enough so far in that 2nd fiddle role and can learn discipline), and then a 17m Big Guy(like the players I listed/Dier? That's the angle I'm looking at this from. That way we would have the perfect balance. If this was La Liga? Then Jan, Vlad and Musaccio is a great ball playing, technical 3 with great anticipation which fits the style of football there. But it's the EPL. Now if you introduce a 17m signing (i can't see Spurs having him play 2nd fiddle for that price), where does that leave Vlad, when he's a perfect backup to Jan? I only see it working if Chiriches is leaving, which I think would be a massive mistake after playing like 20 odd games for us.

If a player wants to leave but feels the club is making excessive demands and puts in a transfer request the club will be in a bad spot to negotiate from. In cases where a clause is available the club can argue that the player felt the agreed sum was fair and stand their ground. Obviously things would get very contentious before that happened but it is a deterrent to the sort of acting out we sometimes see. Notice how rarely players with release clauses drop transfer requests.

And in cases where a player is on high wages but not really pulling his weight and unable to secure a move away a club could trigger the clause themselves and pay the guy off. Obviously this only occurs in situations where the total wages remaining is in excess of the clause amount. Again a rather obscure example but no doubt a bit more frequent in lower leagues.

WWI is one of two major reasons we have the Long Peace, with fewer wars globally than ever before. In fact, there has not been a deadly war directly between the major powers (the kind which would be most destructive and deadly) since 1945. Even the Cold War, with its nuclear threat of bringing the world to the brink of collapse... ended without a bomb dropped or troops invading the key belligerents.

Irredentism, honour and nationalism are no longer valid reasons for a war. If Cameron seriously suggested going to war with Spain over its interfering at the border of Gibraltar he would be laughed out of office via a no confidence vote - whereas a hundred years ago he'd have been mocked for his cowardice and lack of resolve for not threatening a tough military response.

true,NapoleonHeckYes,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"On the macro scale, yes. You could have just got the leaders of the countries into a room and have them fight it out amongst themselves. 

However, if you know an army of millions is coming to kill you, do you just sit there and wait for them to take over, or raise your own army? As a leader at that time, I could just go ""But why? Why should we fight? Why do millions need to die aimlessly"".

Had I said that as a king or general, the reply would have been ""Fuck you then, we're taking over"". So the only response to a proposition of war was to fight back or be taken over. 

Of course looking at it today it is insane that millions of people died because leaders couldn't come together to condemn war like they do today, but that is the way it had been for centuries. Especially as there were smaller states, each with their own territorial claims. As these were subsumed into larger states and industry made war into a far deadlier kind of conflict, suddenly a previously unimaginable war was suddenly triggered.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I definitely do, but i certainly don't expect them to be out-and-out first choice. Kaboul will get more than a look in, and i wouldn't even be surprised to see Vertonghen getting eased out.

I think our defensive fragility last season is hugely overstated; outside of a handful of disaster games we had one of the best defensive records in the league. That's with our best CB playing well within himself and having to cover LB at times, our second best CB out injured all year, our third choice soooo slow, our fourth choice very new and very inexperienced, our actual LB pretty defensively absent, and on top of all that we played all season without a defensive midfielder. A defence with good Vertonghen, Musacchio and Davies added, playing behind Schneiderlin and Capoue/Sandro will be excellent in comparison; one featuring a fit Kaboul would be even better.

I'm not saying that what you suggest doesn't make sense, just that it doesn't make *more* sense; they're both valid ways we could build the squad.

Thing is, five senior CBs is too many, which means if we are bringing another CB in, either Chiriches or Dier goes on loan/is sold (obviously i'm assuming Dawson goes too here). And if it was going to be Dier, it would have been straight back to Sporting. This is exactly the sort of move everyone should have been expecting to see once the Dier deal was announced, and I think it makes complete sense.

I think the big reason the likes of Davies and Williams aren't an option is the lack of sell on. I think it would cost a significant portion of what we're apparently paying for Musacchio to get either, and there's no potential pay off after - they're both 29. I also think either would be pretty likely to flop, but that's more gut than judgement.

&gt;In January 2012, Cahill signed for Chelsea for approximately **£7 million.** Cahill won the UEFA Champions League and the FA Cup in his debut season at Chelsea.

Yes, I'm aware that's then and this is now. Williams, Curtis Davies might be more. Yup, they're not flashy, but they've had great EPL seasons. Matip and other foreigners might cost 20m. Whatever, just thought I'd throw that out there. Most teams, top teams in the EPL have one solid ''beast'' no nonsense CB (still with some smarts/footwork), and one more football minded. It's been that way throughout history of partnerships. I know we have Kaboul, but he's not had a massively great few years and he's a ''will he play 5, 10 or 20 games'' this season player. We can't rely on that. He's also been linked away, Lazio is the latest one. 

We'll see. I'm not convinced, and I think for the EPL the 2 big men, 2 technical men partnerships work best. Just because of the nature of the game - La Liga is more technique, movement and on the floor football hence why Musacchio looks a class act with his interceptions and so on. 

If I'm wrong and this goes through - I'm wrong. Nobody knows who will be here in a weeks time, one months time even to say ''xxx will start over xxx'', but this is just my gut feeling.

I'm highly aware of that none of us can predict the future, so I don't want it on my conscience if I tell you what to do and you lose a packet.

However, I would urge caution when a mate's advocating investment strategies. Maybe I'm just projecting my own less-than-stellar experience, but it sets off all my alarm bells. 

Someone who's advocating an investment has all the answers because they've spent time reading and thinking about it - if they're sure of success then they're never telling you about all the risks and downsides.

IMO your investment strategy should be one that you've arrived at for yourself - doing your own research, slowly and calmly weighing all the options and the risks.

I personally think your mate is dead wrong. Yes, many people have done very well out of leveraging property over the last 3 decades, but this seems to have resulted in [house prices which are IMO unsustainable.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456991/html/nn2page1.stm)

Having said that, I don't think that a house to live in is a bad investment, nor a single BTL property, as long as you're careful not to overextend yourself. As long as you're in it for the longterm, I don't think property will ever do you too badly on this crowded lil island.

So if one operator made £50M, they only need be making about 200k journeys a weekday, for it to be £1 towards profit.  That is about as many people as use just London Bridge alone.  When you consider that for a friend of mine its now £5k for his Season Ticket (Tunbridge Wells to London Canon Street) having only a 10% profit I don't think is the issue.  I think it's the fact he pays £5k and doesn't have even a seat so can't get any work done.  Interestingly he's been able to shift it, to travel off peak, now he can get work done on the train, and saves £2k.

The supply and demand aspect appear to be failing, because even when there demand pulls the limited supply higher, people often aren't able to move to the off peak times for work.

The mods of the sub were apparently trying to verify this with the club for over a year before it all fell to shit and he got banned.

[Here is the post explaining why he was banned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tmdyp/elevenreds_has_been_banned/)

There were a few hilarious moments in the whole saga, including an AMA he did on this sub. [Here that is](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/10oj01/elevenreds_amaa/).

Some notable laughs from his time here included the infamous ""~~Phil Coutinho still has my Toy Story~~ Pepe Reina has my Lion King DVD"" incident (pretty sure it was a different player and movie, but you get the picture), a post where he ""really wanted to show Jose Enrique a funny video"" and a post where he tried predicting some transfers in/out of LFC, got it well wrong and tried to explain it all away. [And here that is](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16iee1/elevenreds_here_lets_clear_some_things_up/).

All in all, it was a pretty bizarre series of incidents. I'll admit, he had me fooled for a while. Some of the stuff he says wasn't absolute bullshit, but looking back, it's clear he wasn't as clever as I thought he was at the time.

If a player wants to leave it puts a line in the sand, and it's a line that you're setting when the player is signing a new contract and presumably doesn't want to leave, so will agree to a high fee. If we were to stick a £65m release clause for Coutinho and he wanted out, then it's easy for the club to use that £65m as a starting point for negotiations with other clubs. He might still go for less than £65m, but that pull of the release clause will help because it's a pre-existing agreed valuation for the player. With no release clause you've basically got a blank slate and are far more at the mercy of what other clubs are offering. 

If the player doesn't want to leave then the release clause doesn't mean anything. Even if we accept the bid there's no reason for the player to agree terms, and in reality we'd probably just reject the bid knowing that the only person who could sue over breach of contract would be the player, and they wouldn't bother they unless they wanted to leave.

Plus adding a release clause might make a player agree to longer contract terms on lower wages, because they know if they ever become a super-star or big clubs come calling then the club has less ability to hold them to ransom.",0,1407230823,null,0,false,0,cjhef6f,t3_2cmlqr,t1_cjhef6f,t1_cjgypvg,null,1435076183,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; The Tory peer told HuffPost UK that one of the reasons she resigned on Tuesday morning, despite the signing of yet another temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, was because she wanted to see those who are alleged to have committed war crimes over the past four weeks, both in Gaza and in Israel, held to account - but did not believe that the British government would support that process. **""As the minister for the International Criminal Court, I’ve spent the last two and a half years helping to promote, support and fund the ICC. I felt I could not reconcile this with our continued pressure on the Palestinian leadership not to turn to the ICC to seek justice.""** 

Continued:

&gt;**""It appalls me that the British government continues to allow the sale of weapons to a country, Israel, that has killed almost 2,000 people, including hundreds of kids, in the past four weeks alone. The arms exports to Israel must stop.""**

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Hmm, I guess it still makes me wonder what happens to Chiriches? I mean, if technical based defenders work wonders in Poch's system then he's perfect foil for both Verts and Musacchio and can fill in at will. If not, he's out in the cold and 3rd choice for that ''Ball Playing'' CB slot if a strong partner is required. I think most big teams, and good defensive teams, have that partnership for a reason (a Kompany, a Vidic) alongside a Vertonghen - but what do I know? 

I'm in the ''Chiriches will become brilliant'' camp, ya see. And the ''Chiriches would have been as good as Musacchio if he played the same games, same league and got consistent football'' camp. Hence why I want us to spend on a BIG imposing CB, and not 17m on someone Chiriches can become (or is). I wouldn't like to think he never gets his shot. I've never seen someone tackle as well as he does at Spurs for a long time, not since King. I mean that - the way he extends his leg, and the last microsecond adjusts to just take the ball away. It's beautiful. And his technique is flawless, and his passing completion of 89% is admirable. 

I just feel we need some steel in defence. For me Vert/Chiriches was fine for one slot, Dier made sense. If Dawson had pace, it would be perfect. If Kaboul was fit and could play every game, and didn't have lapses in concentration, it would be perfect. I mean BIG imposing CB's don't often have pace in abundance - but Daws is like Oil Tanker slow. So neither are really good enough for us (in some respects), but we're spending 17m on someone who we basically already have (if my theory of one powerhouse, one technical CB is right). I'm just surprised people can't see where I'm coming from in regards to this, but it's okay - I know I know nothing about football, so theres that. In our Youth team we have the new King coming, Carter-Vickers, bossing things at 15/16 against players 3 years older than him. I'm thinking of doing one of my ''Youth Watch'' threads (done 5) so far, but i'll probably be downvoted to oblivion so I might not bother anymore.

Also the fee is just because it *seems* we're more penny pinching lately than just good Business from Levy. All our transfers so far have been awesome, and made sense, but I don't feel Poch has much to work with when he should. We've ''made'' 20m in transfers the past few seasons, and haven't spent this ridiculous TV money and we're 2 weeks away from the start of the season. That might just be me, but nothing has indicated we're willing to drop 15m+ on anyone till this move. I still feel we need Schneiderlin alongside Capoue and Depay for LW. And that's a good 30m+.

Having taught a German how to drive over here (and vice-versa), I noticed a few common difficulties.

* Positioning your car correctly on the road - quite often one finds oneself driving far too close to the kerb (if you're bring a LHD car here you might find that you drift the opposite way and end up too close to the centre line).

* Turning into roads.  If you don't keep your wits about you, you can end up turning onto the wrong side of the road, as it's what comes naturally to you.  Just make sure every time you turn, you think ""must stay on the left!"".

* Roundabouts.  I only know this from the German perspective, but we have slightly different rules for roundabouts to them, so I assume they're probably slightly different to the Dutch rules too.  Of course you're going to be going the opposite way to normal - we drive on the left so you're always going to turn left in to the roundabout, and go clockwise.  Priority is given to cars already on the roundabout and the cars entering from the road immediately to your right - always let those cars go first.   If you're taking an exit immediately on your left, indicate left.  If you're taking an exit between the first one and the one straight ahead of you, don't indicate until you've passed the exit before yours.  If you're going more than halfway round the roundabout, indicate right until you pass the exit before the one you want, then indicate left. [Highway code](https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/roundabouts-184-to-190) explains it well!

I'm not overly concerned about pre-season, but judging it so far, the only new addition who has looked in any way promising has been Emre Can.

Mignolet has shown all of the disastrous flaws in his game that were there last season, and will always be there. The main one being that he can't actually kick a football any distance, with any accuracy.

Sakho and Skrtel looked fine, but at fullback we have horrible problems: Johnson is all over the place like a mad woman's piss, and Kelly was even worse.

Gerrard looks like this may well be his last season as a regular starter, which is a shame, but it also sheds unflattering light on Lucas, who was horrific again. Allen was his usual invisible self, so I would quite like to see another CM signed, because Allen and Lucas simplay aren't good enough. I hope Can plays in our first game; he looks very much the part.

In attacking midfield, we haven't seen Lallana, or much of Markovic, but Coutinho looks in good shape and Ibe, while very raw, is a talent. Sterling will be our best player this season.

Attack is a concern, but it's not as if everyone with eyes and a brain doesn't think we should buy a new striker. Sturridge is all we have, and poor Rickie Lambert has looked atrocious.

All in all, while it is really very early day, and we surely haven't completed our signings, we will struggle to replicate last season's challenge.

United will be very strong contenders for the Top 4, along with the perennial Arsenal threat, but I'd say the title will be between Chelsea, City and - depending on what else Wenger does - maybe Arsenal.

Before we left, we read a few sites that summarised the basics of driving in France, common roadsigns, how seriously they take speeding, etc. There must be some decent equivalent for the UK somewhere. Then we streetviewed the first few roads and junctions from the ferry in Ouestreham to the main road south, to work out the lanes, where we needed to enter and exit each junction, what to look for on the signs, etc. That way when we did it in real life we weren't coming at it completely blind. By the time we'd driven the first few junctions we'd got in the right-hand-side mindset and it was fine. 

Just make sure for the first part of the journey your satnav plots a route you're happy with, and doesn't plan anything stupid. Towards the end of the week our satnav took us right through the centre of a major city, something I'd have avoided given a choice, but by then it was completely natural.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"I couldn't watch this time because of the lateness of the hour. Looking at the lineups they played their strongest team bar Persie. We were missing Lovren, Lallana, Sturridge, Flanagan (Kelly is not good enough) and a LB (sorry Glen). I would also argue Can would be in our 1st XI over Allen.

I'm not surprised by the result at all. Why? Because Van Gaal has taken this friendly tournament super seriously and played his best team every game. We have used it as a fitness exercise and given more time to fringe players to either impress or prove they don't belong.

Lambert playing as the striker in a 4-3-3 simply doesn't work. He doesn't have the mobility and movement needed to play that role. Sturridge obviously does. But then Borini doesn't excel in that role either. Both he and Lambert are better as support strikers or, in Borini's case, drifting wide. I am glad BR was quoted yesterday saying we need another striker because it's glaringly obvious.

I couldn't care less about this result. It's just a glorified fitness exercise. The results will be completely different when we field our strongest side against them in the league.

For me Van Gaal has been clever in playing his strongest team to try and win this friendly tournament. He was aware confidence was low after Moyes' shocking season so he's placated their fans by making them feel like winners again albeit for a meaningless 'trophy'. 

I imagine their will be scores of baying Scum fans crowing on /r/soccer now. Their devoted fans around the world will be walking round with chests puffed out boasting about being trophy winners again. Van Gaal knows this will be a very tough season and difficult to even make Europe so having this trophy to cling onto was a masterstroke. I am willing to wager he'll play his strongest team in the Carling Cup too and not just for the trophy but for the easy path back into Europe. Win that and it'll take some of the pressure off their remaining league fixtures.

&gt; an outstanding teacher would find it within herself to teach kids about Keats

Teaching material is only one of the problems she mentions:

* I see children as individuals; today's ministers see them as a mass that must be trained
* I also cannot work in a system that prioritises political gain over the good of our young people
* I often found that by 9:30am (by which point I had been at school for two hours) I felt I had been reprimanded five or six times in emails to all staff, or in departmental meetings, or staff briefings

Effectively, you will be making no money on this house.

Secondly, you should think about the valuation of the house. Your friend has made so much money because the values have gone up so much. He has been lucky. There are a lot of signs that we are at the top of the market and values could go down. So you may end up losing money through the value.

Thirdly, there is the hassle of being a landlord. I hate amateur landlords. The ones I have had have been petty penny pinchers. They come over any time they want. You need to realise that you will be running a business, and the renter is your customer. They can move out and leave you with more expenses as you try to get more tenants in. If you do it through an estate agent, quite often the people they bring in to do the repairs are shoddy, and you can say goodbye to any profit.

For someone who had previously been considered a career meteorite, she essentially got demoted at a time when the PM was actively looking to promote conservative women - of which there are few with experience and background. It's a clear a signal that he isn't a very big fan of her that we'll ever get and I doubt he'll shed any tears over this. She'd obviously come to the realization that her career in politics had probably peaked as high as it was ever going to, and that she didn't really want to do the grind of working as a junior minister in the Foreign Office.
 
To then come out and criticize government policy on Gaza seems bizarre considering both David Cameron and Ed Miliband have [separately criticized](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/04/david-cameron-israel-gaza-hamas-ed-miliband-labour) Israel. What exactly does she want the government to do that they aren't already doing? There is no point trying to drag Israel through the UN or starting trade embargos because they've survived trade embargo in the past and can continue to function on their substantial US material and financial backing. And whilst the EU might be highly critical of Israel, the US with its powerful Jewish lobby isn't going to do anything but support Israel. It strikes me, as I suspect it strikes most politicians that rather like the Troubles in Northern Ireland, what the Israel-Palestine situation needs is simply time.

It's your money now. You have to make peace with that.

&gt; student loans ... currently at £23,300

I'd pay it off straight away. I know it's only a tiny debt and doesn't count against your credit rating and you don't feel the payments coming out, but it's still a debt that means someone has a hold over you in some small way. I'd recommend paying it off and then setting up a regular saver for the same amount. That way you'll soon build up the £23k again.

Contrary opinion: If you can get &gt; 1.5% (net) in a savings account then putting the money into savings is more efficient than paying off the debt. But I'd still say pay it off for the psychological freedom if nothing else.

&gt;  banks taking into consideration these savings when applying for a mortgage

They will take that into account.

Why? They give you a decent rate, and time to come to terms with the money. Don't put it all in there, as you say you don't know where you'll be, but you can set a big chunk aside.

Also don't rule out a pension fund.

Additionally, the problem with these stories I find is it always focuses on the teachers who can no longer stand the profession, whereas there's so many teachers I know personally who absolutely love their jobs and somehow evade the chronic 12 hour days every day.

Teaching is a labour of love, and if you no longer love it of course you're going to quit.

And it might just mean they don't rate Chiriches. I certainly think he needs more experience before we can rely on him, and it's just one of those difficult parts of modern football that it's really hard to compete with the biggest clubs while also blooding inexperienced players. I think Chiriches has a high ceiling, but i don't think we'd be letting go a truly world-class player of the future if he left. Musacchio is a year younger with a ton more top-level experience. He has just as much potential i think, and is further along the road than Chiriches, which is what we need.

I wouldn't be reading anything into it being this late in the window and us not having been willing to spend big. That's just Spurs/Levy unfortunately. I think we'll get Schneiderlin but probably not a winger. It'd be nice, but I'm happy with Eriksen out there to be honest. I don't agree with this ""he has to be in the middle"" shit.

If that link proves to be bogus I think that Glen Johnson will be retained for the final year of his contract and he will compete with Flanagan for the starting role, while Manquillo continues to develop. Once Johnson's contract runs out Flanagan and Manquillo will compete for the starting role.

The advantage of Flanagan starting is, apart from the academy graduate tag is the fact that he is more defensive minded than both Johnson and Manquillo, which if the rumours are true will complement the playing style of Alberto Moreno, as he is a very attacking fullback. This will allow BR to field a formation with a back 4 without being too exposed at the back.

It explains what happened in Canada, and explains austerity has never worked in a down turn.

Politics and economics are inextricably linked we need to acknowledge this. 

As I have said national policy can have an effect on global lending and investing confidence especially with regard to the USA and China and probably the Euro Zone too. [Just a simple example, if every country is doing national austerity it is clear that debt increases as percentage of GDP and global demand is likely to decrease and we stay in a down turn for longer] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v8m-J8sgik). Obviously the UK can't stimulate global confidence on its own (but it can destroy national confidence through austerity) but luckily China adopted Keynesian stimulus and USA had a massive monetary stimulus and did not cut as much at the beginning of the down turn.

There is some evidence that the UK changed course with austerity and this has helped the recovery; http://www.pieria.co.uk/articles/fiscal_policy_plan_a_and_the_recovery_explaining_the_economics

I think we have a reasonable balance in the UK. Both Israel and Hamas are blamed for the mess in roughly equal measure. We feel sympathy for the Palestinians as the real victims (as much as the terror of Israeli civilians is regrettable there aren't thousands of dead).

However there is a double standard and a necessary one. We expect Israel to be the party pushing for peace. They have to be. The alternative is expecting a bloody terrorist organisation to be the sensible party in the room. Israel as the more powerful and more legitimate actor is necessarily the party expected to also act in the more measured manner. If they want a definition of measured, I'd suggest the US not immediately declaring war on Israel after them attacked a US Navy ship is a good standard for measured.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;We've seen Pochetinno use a defensive mid to drop very deep so that the center-backs can spread out wider, almost making it a 3-man backline, giving the fullbacks and wingers more leeway to move forward. Maybe the ""big-man"" role you talked about in his system has moved to this defensive mid (ie. Capoue), who is, by what I've seen, pretty dominant and possesses good strength.

Well, Capoue is a competent CB after all. Plus Schnederlin often would drop back - I think the two of them would create a nice stable platform in the centre of midfield and that duo is my ultimate dream midfield pairing. They can take turns dropping back, with the full backs pushing on giving passing options. My only fear is that's fine against teams we can beat regularly - but can we impose OUR way on other teams? I still feel having some genuine steel in defence is necessary - like I said, all the top teams have that one (or two) destroyer type CB's. That is no coincidence. It might work in La Liga - hell, Mascherano works in La Liga, but the EPL? I guess we'll find out. 

&gt;bit condescending in your initial post. 

To be fair, I don't really see how it's any different from someone just saying ''good signing''. But I don't really care if I'm downvoted. I'm not being a little bitch about it like ''oh I'm so hard, I don't care about downvotes'' but...I really don't. I just don't wanna write a novel in every thread and sometimes ''hahaha dodged a bullet'' type comments suffice.

I will suggest you to check frequently the tickets info category of the website

http://mcfc.co.uk/News/Tickets-and-Travel 

Usually one month before, the content team publishes a news with all the information about tickets (for example: The Stoke game http://mcfc.co.uk/News/Tickets-and-Travel/2014/July/City-v-Stoke-City-30-August-ticket-information)

Regarding the Chelsea game, as you may imagine, this will be a big game, so read carefully the article.

The logic is that priority is given to loyal fans, with a system of ticket points.

However, it may be possible that City releases ticket available for people without ticket points. In this case, you will need to purchase a Cityzen membership first http://beacityzen.mcfc.co.uk/ in order to be qualified to buy tickets.

But you need to be quick :)

If you miss this, with your Cityzen membership you can purchase from City Season Ticket Holder on Viagogo (http://mcfc.force.com/help/articles/FAQ/What-is-the-MCFC-Ticket-Exchange/?q=ticket+exchange&amp;l=en_US&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=2). Price are reasonable as members can only resell their tickets for between 90% and 150% of its value (more info here http://mcfc.co.uk/Tickets-and-Seasoncards/Seasoncards/~/link.aspx?_id=405A84CD05D94EBDB6056A0B3394098C&amp;_z=z)

2 things to remember:
- If you buy using Viagogo, I believe tickets are transferred on your Cityzen card, so make sure to get your Cityzen membership  early in order to receive the card
- If you buy using Viagogo, not sure how many tickets you can buy with one Cityzen card. So check this also, as your friends may need to buy a Cityzen membership if you miss the General sale

Hope it all makes sense, don't hesitate to call the box office for further information +44161 444 1894 (option 1, option 1, option 2)

Eriksen - Holtby(Kagawa) - Lamela. I had a big post why but I'm not posting it now, just cuz I'm being a little bitch because of the downvote brigade putting me down to -20 everytime I make a ''off hand comment''. 

&gt;I think the Musacchio deal makes sense even if we aren't losing Vertonghen now though, as long as Chiriches gets a loan to pick up the experience he desperately needs but isn't going to get enough of with us. The rumoured loan to Southampton would be perfect, he walks into that team now Lovren's gone.

Pretty much so. Vlad hasn't played a part in pre-season, but 17m seems an awful lot on a player just to cover him for a period. That is assuming we go with a ''ball player and strong cb'' partnership. Maybe it'll be enough to light a fire under Jan's ass and he'll replicate his first season form which he made the PFA Team of the Year first 11.

very true. However, I would rather do what is good for the club and keep him than let him go (if he's happy) just so he can play a few extra games in the CL. Hopefully it's with us, but who knows. The pessimist in me says it's unlikely and even if we do make it I doubt we'll keep our best players. Just how football works right now. If I wasn't born and raised in Enfield and my entire mothers side of the family didn't live a stones throw from WHL in the 50/60's I probably wouldn't support a team and just enjoy football. I'm jaded with it right now and the whole ''FFP/money/CL means everything'' bullshit. If he's unhappy and wants to go for the CL football, then fine - Levy will get us a good price and we move on. But I don't want to shove him out the door just because we can't provide him CL guaranteed if he's happy. if anything, teams may not want to take the plunge after his soso last season with us. But we'll see.

I'd say it is the key factor after interview performance, and you will definitely discuss any projects at interview in any case.

Buy a Raspberry Pi and build something awesome (there are tons of tutorials and projects online). Create a website with a back-end. Play around with API's. Build a simple 2D game. Go to one of the many hackathons that run every couple of weekends, even if your involvement is minimal. Maybe learn how to create an iPhone/Android app. Solve a problem you are facing, or automate something in your life, by writing a program or script.

This does not undermine my comparison at all. Driving and parenting *are* similar in that both require skill and education and care of others.

&gt;This approach already happens with social services without the need for a licence.

There are so, so many children out there that are neglected, mistreated and malnourished that I shouldn't really need to try to convince you that a much greater level of inspection of parenting abilities is needed.

&gt;They just need more power to highlight problem families. Too many currently slip through the gaps as it is.

yup

&gt;A licence wouldn't change this. It'd only make things worse.

Why? It works just fine for teaching qualifications, nursing qualifications, all sorts of caring qualifications *and prospective adoptive parents*.

Our roads fall apart faster than most due to the weather mostly. Think -5 in winter and +35 in summer so it has to be done really. If you left it until a resurface was needed we'd have a really fucked road network in a few years.

That's quite true, but there are other rights at play beyond the reproductive rights of the parents. In driving, there are the rights of other drivers and pedestrians. They are entitled to be free from suffering caused by bad driving. In raising children, there are the rights of children. They are entitled to be free from suffering caused by bad parenting.

It would be a silly approach to assess or restrict drivers only when they cause damage and, in the same way, it would be silly to assess or restrict parents only when they cause damage. It makes much more sense to evaluate people before these situations arise at all. So, for driving, we have licences and for prospective adoptive parents, we assess their parenting abilities.

I can see what you're trying to say about rights to reproduce. Technically, I'm not talking about the right to reproduce, but the right to be a parent, but, moreover, I'm talking about prioritisation of rights. Some rights simply are more important than others.

Back before computers had Graphical User Interfaces (think WIMP - Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers), all of the logical navigation around a computer system was done in the terminal (think the command prompt from Windows, or Bash in Linux).

On January 1st of 1970 an operating system called Unix was launched at Bell labs. It was created by a team of people, one of whom was Denis Ritchie (the co-inventor of the C programming language). Since there was no GUI, the only way to move around on the screen and in files was to use printable characters (control + this, alt + that, etc.), most of which were used by holding the control key (to turn a character into a control character), or alt key (to gain the alternate use of the key).

This doesn't cover the use of the ¬ character though. I thought I'd lead in with a little computer science history. Also, remember that until the late 80s there was no standard keyboard layout (there, kinda of isn't one still these days). Here's a direct quote from Wikipedia about the ¬ character and it's use in programming:

&gt; Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages likePL/I and Ratfor use ¬ for negation. Some modern computers and operating systems will display ¬ as ! on files encoded in ASCII.

Since its still used in programming languages and operating systems, it's required on keyboards. Remember, that most bank back ends run on extremely old hardware and software (were talking early 90s stuff), because it's been proven to work 98% of the time. If a system is still in use which requires that key, then it will be provided by keyboard manufacturers. Also, it's all about tradition and providing functionality that your competitors (If you're in the keyboard business) provide, simply because they provide it.

The Guardian in general has some awful, awful writers. There are good left wing writers out there, but they tend not to write for the Guardian. This is because they have very few staff writers, and a lot of have-a-go-harrys. See [here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/22/thomas-the-tank-engine-children-parents). Now read that and tell me it isn't the most self-important pile of tripe you've ever set eyes on.

&gt;I would argue that the way WWI is currently commemorated has moved away from ""lest we forget"" to ""support our troops"".

This is something i resent. It is very easy to say, but impossible to quantify. It has also always been said and is seen as 'low-hanging fruit' to almost all journalists.

""Oh we're so imperialist and evil aren't we, oh whip me harder."" That is essentially the tone of these articles, they are masochistic, and they actually detract from the act of remembrance in my opinion.

The fact of the matter is that Journalism is a dying profession, and stories like these are a way to make the writer feel successful. They are just guaranteed clicks.

Calling the fire brigade is a perfectly reasonable step to take when someone is stuck in the lift. Hell, you even called the maintenance man first, which I don't think you were even obliged to do. More than reasonable.

Do not give the landlord any money for any of this. If they try to deduct from your deposit take it straight to the deposit protection scheme arbitration service.

Many tenancy agreements include a clause that requires the landlord to furnish the tenants with details of the property/buildings (and associated Property Owners Liability) cover, and which insurer/broker is providing this - if this is the case in your position you are fully within your rights to approach the insurer (or broker, if there is one) with your concerns.

However, regardless of the cover your landlord opted to take out if it can be proved he has acted negligently (in not maintaining the lift, or showing sufficient duty of care) the cover he has chosen is often fairly academic - the insurer is often held liable and will then often pursue the insured (i.e. your landlord) for failure to comply with the terms of his policy.

Was perhaps expecting more from Lambo and Lucas, was impressed by Coates and Can, everyone else kind of performed to expectation in my mind.

I'd say the whole thing was a success.

1. Roundabouts. It's been said, but really.

2. The angle you take junctions at. You may need to rotate the car slightly away from what is normal to get a better view (if you're in a LHD car)

3. Less cycle lanes to worry about.

4. The traffic lights don't go straight from red to green. They go red, amber+red, then green.

5. Most motorway junctions in the UK have a separate on and off ramp. Not the crazy everyone-goes-everywhere-then-crashes that's common in the west of NL.

6. There may be hills where you're going.

Another thing, thanks to observations here. Most of the UK are much more polite drivers. In NL, it's kinda normal to change lanes quickly without bothering if you slow anyone down behind you. It's a common complain of any expat living here.

true,UneasyElk,BristolRovers,Bristol Rovers,"I'm a Bristol Rovers fan. I think we have done well so far, it's been difficult to get some of the players Clarke wanted in because, contrary to popular belief, we don't loads of money. 

Goals were a major problem last season and with Harrold, Clarkson, Richards and Gillespie all leaving we needed to bring in some much needed fire power. Clarke got the transfer window of to a start by bringing in a player he is very familiar with in Jamie White (Salisbury). I'm pretty pleased with this signing, if he can stay fit he will score goals. We also signed Matty Taylor (Forest Green) and he has been impressive in pre-season. We managed to beat Oxford, Mansfield, Kidderminster and Chester to signing Taylor who also turned down bigger wages to play for us.

In midfield we have so far brought in Stuart Sinclair (Salisbury), Andy Monkhouse (Hartlepool), Lee Mansell (Torquay) and Jake Gosling (Exeter). Overall I'm very pleased with these additions. Sinclair has already become a fan favourite ([dat beard](http://imgur.com/8lcxJcl)), he's quality, a great engine on him which is important to Clarke's system, good tackler and handsome as fuck. Monkhouse brings in some much needed experience to the midfield, he's done well at higher levels and was still a decent player for Hartlepool last season. Hopefully he'll bring some much needed creativity and goals from the midfield.

Lee Mansell like Monkhouse brings in experience to the midfield. He's still a very good player and has Conference experience. Gosling is still young but is someone I hope to see a lot of this season, he's creative and exciting. 

In defence we brought in Dan Leadbitter (Hereford). He's only played once in pre-season since joining late on. He spent a while training with us at the start of pre-season before moving on to trial at Southend and Cambridge but he left in the middle of his trial period with Southend to come and join us. I don't think it will be easy to replace Michael Smith but Leadbitter is a welcome addition. Fast, attacking wing back which fits right in with our system.

As we speak Bristol Rovers staff are still trying to wrap up a deal for a winger on loan for 3 months who is rumoured to be Christian Jolley (Newport) which will take him up to the end of his current deal at Newport. Jamie Turley (Forest Green) has also been negotiating with us. Personal terms were all agreed but since he had a broken arm during the break we have been assessing it for ourselves. A decision was expected today and Turley sent out a cryptic tweet which points to us maybe passing him over.

Duncan Culley is also on trial with us. Scored 39 goals last season for Shortwood a few levels below. Already trialled with Wolves, Cheltenham and Oxford. Decision set to be made by Thursday. And we have Neil Trotman (Plymouth) back on trial again.

Overall I'm happy with the signings made and if we manage to sign Turley, a decent winger and a striker I will be delighted.",0,1407243444,null,0,1407243961,0,cjhhb4r,t3_2cobml,t1_cjhhb4r,t3_2cobml,null,1435077637,3,false,conferencefootball,t5_2xoai,3

We bring in season-long loans, two or three more, and maybe purchase someone from the bargain bin.

The talking point is that it's so hard to buy players when other squads know you've got the funds, which is partially true, but it's also that every time a deal for a player with some long-term value gets close to the finish line, ownership comes down saying it doesn't represent value for money.

The season carries on and we struggle because the morale is shit, it's clear Katherine wants out and Koeman was brought in to make the most out of scraps. Koeman leaves at some point, realizing that he can't actually take the team forward in a league with no parity. Eventually the club is sold and we're bought by an owner or consortium that obviously can't really afford to own us.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Well, for the AMC role I would look no further than [Firmino](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/96182/) or Maxim. Both in the Bundesliga. Firmino is 22 and at Hoffenheim, and picked up 16 goals and 11 assists in 33 games, which is admirable considering they finished mid table. Maxim is 24 and at Stuttgart, with 7 goals and 9 assists in 18 starts and 11 sub appearances. 

As you can see from the link, Firmino is very good defensively despite being a AMC and gets ''Very Strong'' for his defensive contribution. 2.5 successful tackles per game average VERY good - especially in this system. Capoue is at 2.1, Eriksen 1 (for perspective).  He isn't afraid of getting ''stuck in'' and putting in a shift. He's at Hoffenheim too, and they finished 9th in the league so I think he is ''get able''. I know stats don't paint the full picture, but I've seen him play a few times and the link is a pretty accurate summary of him. Great player and only 22 - and can also play all across AMR/AMC/AML. 

Or, you could have Eriksen there - and pick up Depay for the Left Wing. All depends on Poch wants to do - does he want someone direct like Depay who will cut inside? Who knows. I really think Depay is that guy, the pipe dream is Draxler. But there's an abundance of attacking talent in the world, so I could sit here all day. But Firmino is the best for that role with his defensive contribution and INSANE goal/assist return. I wish I had more insider knowledge at the club, cuz I'd be tossing his name in there. 

But, I will say I don't want Chadli, Townsend and Lennon being our wingers. Lennon has never lived up to his promise, and peaked at like 21 - he's looked sharp pre-season, but nah. Townsend will never learn, two footed, quick, good technique - but just doesn't have that *brain*. And he's not 18 anymore, he never will.

Yes and No, in London at least there were some places that were relying on the fire brigade to cover up their lack of maintenance.

So often the fire brigade were coming too frequently to one place.

As a result I fully support them being able to lay fines, like they do for false alarms (back when I was a student, I lost count how many times we had someone set off the alarm in halls).

But also, there are many different kinds of lift, and engineers are seldom raited to work on all of them, so they will likely damage the lift too.

Yup. Unfortunately, mistreatment, neglect and malnutrition are not so apparent in the case of bad parenting.

&gt;There's also the fact that if a car is seized, it won't be at a disadvantage in life because it went to a series of badly assigned foster homes.

It goes without saying that improving state care of children is extremely important too, though that is a separate argument. The detrimental effects of taking a child into care must, of course, be taken into account.

&gt;If we go with what you say, and when someone without a license gets pregnant, it doesn't really matter as long as they pass a test now and the test is fairly lenient (child only gets taken away in extreme circumstances)... what's the point?

As I'm sure you are aware, there are a frightening number of children who are not cared for properly. The sheer numbers of children who are mistreated and neglected is justification for additional checks in order to ensure that prospective parents have the basic skills necessary to caring for a child.

I would certainly be able to buy outright the house I have just brought for £236k.

What you should do is the unknowable question. However I can advise that short terms stocks/funds/etc are a bit pointless and at best you'll probably only get back what you put in, while wasting a lot of your time.

true,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,"""Dr Ben Pitcher"" from the ""University of Westminster""? Think about it. 

""Doctor"" is a title created by rich old white men to legitimise their patriarchal closed view of the World by rejecting the ancestral and popular wisdom of womyn and non-white people. 

""Ben"" in Arabic means ""son of"", an expression aimed at maintaining patriarchal dynasties, or ""leader"", giving it an authoritarian overtone. It can also mean ""mountain"" in Scotland, a clearly phallic reference, and it is the pronoun ""I"" in Turkish, a glorification of individualism.

""Pitcher"" is a word that has come to be synonymous with the encouragement of excessive drinking in bars and pubs, aimed mostly at the working class. Save money by getting a ""pitcher"" of alcohol to share, while at the same time putting a stronger peer pressure on those workers and young idealists who would prefer to keep a clear head for self-organising towards Revolution. ""Pitchers"" are aimed at numbing class consciousness.

The University of ""Westminster"". Westminster has become synonymous with the proto-fascist British Government, which is the direct successor of the British Empire, one of the bloodiest and most destructive regimes in history. This University, by the way, used to be the Royal Polytechnic Institution, ""Royal"" as in Monarchist of course.

So, does Dr Ben Pitcher from the University of Westminster promote patriarchal, authoritarian, anti-womyn, racist, individualistic, anti-working class, reactionary, monarchist and imperialistic beliefs in support of British Fascism?

* Recon - The cockpit has windows.  The escort is close enough that they can get some idea of the situation in the cockpit.  Are there too many people in there?  That's valuable info.  Pilot's missing a head?  That's valuable info.  ""looks normal / cooperative"" makes a huge difference in the decisions to come.  And there's not many other ways to take a look-see.

true,Tuniar,null,null,"The best tip is to fill out your profile as much as possible (including a profile picture and summary tagline). Use buzzwords in your tagline so you show up in searches. Don't be shy about adding your ""skills"" - this is how you get to the top of potential employers' searches. 

It's not FB (as mentioned below) - so don't get involved in crap like the annoying circular spam messages (like ""Only 5% of people are intelligent enough to read this! Are you one of them???"") because it makes you look like an idiot. 

Don't be shy, add people - especially recruiters. They're not going to reject you, they want as many people in their network as they can get, and it'll benefit both of you. 

When you search for jobs, some want you to apply on the company website, that's fine, but a lot simply say ""Apply Now"" - it gives you the option to add your CV, but other than that you're basically using your LinkedIn Profile as your application form. That means it takes mere seconds to apply, but employers take it seriously (because they still get access to all the information they need), so don't feel bad about doing this.

I'm a Canadian living in Ottawa, but I grew up in a small city of &lt; 35,000 people in the middle of Northern Ontario (8 hours drive NNW of Ottawa). In this small city, there is only one sport because the place is frozen 8-10 months of the year. Unsurprisingly, that sport is hockey. 

As a result, I had zero exposure to footy until Ottawa announced they were getting an NASL team (2nd Division Canada/US) last year. I began reading up on the sport, and got a job working for the Fury during their inaugural Spring Season, and either streamed the matches live (when they were away) or watched the replay. I loved every minute of it, even when we got whupped.

I then started trying to catch the Canadian MLS teams, and joined an MLS Fantasy League. There are 3 Canadian teams in the MLS: Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto. Since Vancouver is too far away to realistically catch a match in person, and since everyone who doesn't live in Toronto, hates Toronto, I ended up cheering for Montreal Impact. The play was a good step above the Fury, and despite the being broadcast in French most of the time, I was able to follow along and enjoy it.

The NASL got its break between seasons and the World Cup came on. Like most of us in Canada, I picked a team that I had read a few good things about and followed Germany all the way to their eventual win. Again, there was a big jump in the quality of play, so following the World Cup final with the NASL Fall-season opener (an hour break between), was a big fall in quality of play. I was a little disappointed in what our home-grown soccer had to offer in comparison.

No longer content to settle for only NASL &amp; MLS play, I decided to look at the famous leagues across Europe. I downloaded a handful of matches and watched random clips to get a feel for playing style. Since I don't really want to just watch matches all by my lonesome, I also searched online to see what teams had supporter groups here in Ottawa. Spurs had a local group, and I liked their attacking style in the clips I watched, so I watched some vids from a couple of their friendlies (vs Toronto &amp; Chicago). I liked what I saw, and now I'm hooked.

Now, I just need to find some coin so I can get the kit before the match on the 16th.",0,1407247122,null,0,false,0,cjhio6v,t3_2cmj4v,t1_cjhio6v,t3_2cmj4v,null,1435079533,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,Darneil,,Protein shake to go.,"Don't worry, I research Military History as a hobby, in particular the wars of the 20th Century. I know that Britain was far from a good guy in World War 1, but we weren't a bad guy either.

I very much see World War 1 as the Age of Empires coming to an end, and several large empires (Prussian, Commonwealth, French, Spanish, Ottomon, Austrian) trying to hold onto a dying idea. The Austrians and Serbian block had a massive distaste of one another, the Germans were egging them on. The British were trying to maintain a military dominance and were happy to constanrtly ramp up mobilization efforts to appear powerful. France and Russia were setting up a surround in Germany, to pen them in and cut off their power.

No one side can claim the high ground in World War 1. However, claiming that a war is only men being thrown against their will into the meat grinder is far from right. World War 2, the people of Britain believed in their war. Yes, conscription led to a lot of unwilling men being brought into the ranks, but the popular opinion was that National Socialism was an evil, and Hitlers hold on Europe had to end. France was our allies, as were Poland and Belgium, Holland and Norway. We were under the belief our friends had been attacked, and we were willing to do everything we had to stop that.

That being said, the best quote I've ever heard on the matter of war was from Game of Thrones. ""There is good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."" There were heroic Germans, who fought the system, likewise there were British soldiers who murdered prisoners out of some kind of entitled vengeance. But claiming that wars were done for posturing isn't always true. But yes, World War 1 was the dying throes of a lot of large Empires trying to hold onto the past.",0,1407247343,null,0,false,0,cjhirgn,t3_2cmktu,t1_cjhirgn,t1_cjhh6pn,null,1435079589,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

So it was my first year at University in the States and I was hanging out with a few friends. We decided to have a FIFA tournament. I had never played FIFA, barely watched a match (my area only showed Liverpool since they are owned by the Red Sox or a ManU match).

Anywho, when I first started. I clicked the 'random button'. First selection: Tottenham, second selection: Wolverhampton; third selection: Tottenham. To this day I still don't know how I got Tottenham twice, but I selected them. 

Guy I was playing against was a big Gooner fan, so he selected them. I beat him 4 - 1. 

Next day, there was a guy selling flags and posters on the lawn in front of my dorm, went over to check it out, and sure enough they had a Spurs flag. I was looking at it and the 'shop' owner (He was Irish) came over and said ""Good choice. Supported them since 1960."" So I bought the flag, and when he handed me my change he said ""Don't forget, Arsenal are cunts.""

Been a supporter for 5 years now.

With all due respect, bullshit. When the Troubles were occurring, was Britain using air strikes on Republican residential areas?

Part of that is that we recognise that just because some people in a civilian area are terrorists we don't have the right to indiscriminately target the mostly civilian community, and, moreover, we knew that killing civilians only increases support for our enemies.

Even in Afghanistan, we don't bomb villages when our troops can identify civilians as present/in the target area.

Israel could go in on the ground and totally saturate Gaza with troops, but they haven't.

I work on the website and not on the commercial/ticketing side of it, so I don't really know about the why.

Also please note that I do not represent the club when saying ""Guy working on the website"". I'm just doing this for the sake of transparency, just trying to help.

Regarding your questions, from what I understand:

can you explain why the club has a loyalty point system, which long serving fans have to use in order to qualify for tickets for big games, but would then totally undermine that system and release a number of tickets free from a loyalty/ticket point criteria to fans from abroad?
Is that fair?

-&gt;To be totally clear, the Cityzen membership is available to any supporter, UK or abroad.
Also when you're a season card holder, you're automatically a Cityzen member and you kept your ticket points.

Regarding the ticket points system, for some games, you may see the system is still there for example the Newcastle one (http://mcfc.co.uk/News/Tickets-and-Travel/2014/July/Newcastle-United-v-City-17-August-ticket-information).

Whereas it's true that for some games, it is more accessible (like the Home game at Liverpool http://mcfc.co.uk/News/Tickets-and-Travel/2014/July/City-v-Liverpool-25-August-ticket-information). However you can notice that if you have more ticket points, you do have access to the box office sooner.

The way I see it, is that for some games (I presume games with less demand), City makes it more easy to buy tickets by simplifying the process.

Also, any comment on the increasing price of a match ticket at City, for example most tickets for the opening fixture against Liverpool pushing almost £70?
-&gt;Sadly I don't work on the ticketing side of the business, so I can't really explain why.

Of course, we don't know the intricacies of his contract. Some say that we want the £19m up front, and that's why no club has matched. Bony's agent says he wants Champions League football, but if that's the case, why would he be linked to the Spurs?

I think if a big club comes along and offers us £25m to be paid out over two years (easier for clubs to do, rather than pay it all up front), I think we'd take it, I think Bony would want to go and I think all sides would come away winners.

&gt;One side slaughtered over a thousand civilians and hundreds of children in the last couple of weeks,

True. That is about as far from the full story you're going to get, but it's certainly true that Israel has directly killed a lot of civilians in the last few weeks.

&gt;the other side targeted soldiers with pinpoint accuracy (and considerable courage) despite their primitive weapons.

Bollocks. First, there's nothing primitive about [RPG-29 Vampirs](http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-cowardly-tunnel-attack-shows-why-gaza-op-must-go-on/), a system so sophisticated that the Americans won't let anyone they sell to buy it lest it come back against them. Nor is there anything primitive about spending $30m digging at least 31 tunnels up to ten storeys underground and three miles long through sandy soil. The primitive bit would be using children to dig them (losing 160 of those children digging the earlier Rafah tunnels alone), I suppose.

There is no courage in launching **3,000** unguided R-160 and J-80 missiles in the last few weeks, nor any pinpoint accuracy in aiming them at the only things large enough to have hope of hitting with such crude weapons - Israel's major population centres.

Both kinds of operations take serious balls when you're up against one of the world's most advanced (and most genocidal) militaries. They've even launched audacious raids into IDF terrorist camps.

As well as this, Hamas has been able to shut down their oppressors economically. For example, by suppressing the Israeli terror state economy and tourist/airline industry with missile fire.

Yeah, I think we're done here.

Are... [Are you serious?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter) Please read the [Hamas Charter](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp) and see if sheer hypocritical lunacy of what you just said strikes home in any way, shape or form. Selected quotes thereof:

&gt;""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.""

&gt;""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews) , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.""

&gt;""The Zionist invasion is a vicious invasion. It does not refrain from resorting to all methods, using all evil and contemptible ways to achieve its end. It relies greatly in its infiltration and espionage operations on the secret organizations it gave rise to, such as the Freemasons, The Rotary and Lions clubs, and other sabotage groups. All these organizations, whether secret or open, work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions. They aim at undermining societies, destroying values, corrupting consciences, deteriorating character and annihilating Islam. It is behind the drug trade and alcoholism in all its kinds so as to facilitate its control and expansion.""

&gt;""The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on.

Given the demographics of the US and UK (especially US) elites, you do have a certain amount of privilege and status from simply being a Jew. You're more likely to earn a high income.

Nice deal if you can get it.

However, the Jewish establishment is very hierarchical, so unless you're one of the very wealthiest, you aren't going to be calling the shots either.

Sterling looks like he just keeps on adding an extra level to himself, really excited to see him next season, hope he gets managed well so he doesn't burn out because when hes at his best he can take on anyone and you can see the fear he brings out of opponents.

Coutinho looks quality, so composed and technically brilliant on the ball, as many have said, if he adds more goals he could be incredible this season, I hope he stays fit and free of injury, so exciting.

Can was boss, looks so composed and strong but someone that people said is inexperienced and perhaps not ready for 1st team football yet, if he continues to play like he has done in the short halfs we've seen he'll be a boss player for us, him and Hendo will boss midfield's together.

Suso didn't get much gametime but when he did he really looked quality, I feel sorry for him as well behind players like Coutinho, Sterling &amp; Markovic in the pecking order because if he was at any other club outside the top 6 he'd be their main creative talent.

Ibe reminds me of Sterling last preseason, a really exciting prospect and its a shame for the lad that he won't get as much time as Sterling did last season to develop, hopefully BR works closely with him as he did with Sterling and helps him progress well, perhaps a loan spell with a relegation battling Premier League side would do him good if he gets regular starts, if not he could add great depth and rotation for Sterling when we can afford to rest our better players.",0,1407250793,null,0,false,0,cjhkbbn,t3_2coajk,t1_cjhkbbn,t3_2coajk,null,1435080442,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
