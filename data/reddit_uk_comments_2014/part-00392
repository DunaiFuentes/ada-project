false,Nihht,mcgann,McGann,"&gt;Yes, and by ignoring them she saved both the alien and the lives of everyone on earth.

Except she had no idea of that. Nobody but the Doctor had any clue anything else would happen than the world fucking ending when the egg hatched. She willingly, knowingly pressed the button, knowing that would kill 10 billion people and destroy all life on the planet.

&gt;It was an extremely tough, and cruel call to have to make, but she made the right one.

It shouldn't have been. 10 billion human lives and hundreds of billions more animal/plant life on Earth or one alien life; which would you save?

&gt;And what's wrong with being empathetic to aliens?

Nothing. But when you're willing to sacrifice your entire race and planet to save the life of a single being, that's a little too empathetic, don't you think?

&gt;That was the evolution of the Doctor and Clara's relationship ... that's why she was willing to lie to stay with him.

Fair points. I do like how she stood up to him and against his decisions and, unlike almost all companions, at least tried to leave, even if it didn't work. It does disturb me that she was willing to lie to Danny about her traveling, and that in the end she trusted the Doctor much more than Danny, but perhaps that's a side effect of going through so much with him (most of it life-threatening).

&gt;I can't really change your opinion if you liked the end of Death in Heaven, but personally I feel like that would have been a horrible way to end it. After finally seeing that the Doctor is still her friend to just then leave in a lie?

I think it would've been a great ending, and not just because she left. Traveling with the Doctor never ends well - every companion in New Who to date has demonstrated this. Rose was trapped in a pocket dimension, Martha and her entire family were left with the scars of the year that never happened, Donna's memory had to be wiped, Amy and Rory were touched by angels and sent into a pocket universe. Ending it there would've been tragic - the two of them lying to each other in the aftermath of losing Danny. It was a great ending because it seemed so cruel for it for it to end that way. It's one of the few times I actually felt for Clara.

&gt;I think series 8 was an adjustment series, but now the Doctor and Clara are ready to face everything head on in series 9.

""Adjustment"" shouldn't take a whole series in my opinion.

&gt;Ok, I'll admit Rory never got the attention Amy did, but I do think the Doctor cared. And honestly, do you really think if push came to shove the doctor wouldn't save Rory if he was in danger and he could do something about it, or sacrifice himself to save Rory if the need arose?

I don't doubt he would; that's part of the Doctor's personality, 11's especially - companions above all else. But he never really clicked with him like he did Amy or River; Rory was always exasperated and bewildered by the Doctor's personality and actions.

false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;What has happened to Gerrard this season? He looks a shadow of his former self.

Turns out footballers (even legends) get old and start to become ineffective. He is a shadow of his former self because we have continued to rely on him for 90 minutes at a time for a lot of matches.

To me, it shows the lack of quality (or desire) of our current squad to supplant the 34-year-old Gerrard from his place in the squad. And at the same time, it shows the quality of 34-year-old Gerrard as well.

In terms of leadership and confidence?

Well, I laugh at the notion that Gerrard is less of a leader in the dressing room. And I laugh at the notion that Gerrard has lost any of his 'confidence.' Sure, some footballers are sensitive but I find it hard to believe that footballers like Gerrard who have the accomplishments, drive, ambition, and mental-toughness to play until their mid-30s will have any crisis of confidence.

If anything, I believe the club has inadvertently put Gerrard into this situation by not providing him with a strong team that would allow him to gracefully reduce his minutes to allow him to have a larger impact on a match in a shorter period of time.

Gerrard is used to leading by example and while I believe his head and heart can still do that in many ways, I'm not sure if his body can do that week in and week out. He is simply not the player that can take over and change a match. Frankly, he has not been at that level for a while but, obviously, to his credit, intelligence, etc. he has been able to contribute strongly in other ways.

For those who follow basketball in America, one can see some parallels to 36-year-old Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. ",0,1419666849,null,0,false,0,cn6ftin,t3_2qh1zz,t1_cn6ftin,t3_2qh1zz,null,1425198762,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The dilemma was: do we want to take the chance that it will. Clara didn't choose the alien over the people, she pressed the button because she believed both would survive. Secondly, you're taking a very ""Needs of the many vs needs of the few"" approach to this argument. Yes, the alien was just one being, but does that make its life worthless? Imagine it in terms of people - it'd be like shooting one innocent person to save another group. Logistically, it makes sense, but that doesn't make it any less difficult, or morally wrong. In fact the whole situation is very similar to the episode ""The Fires of Pompeii."" Yes, obviously the Doctor had to sacrifice Pompeii to save the world, but did that make it right?

I do see the tragic irony in the ending. I guess personally it just didn't feel right to me, but I can understand liking it.

When most non-Muslims talk about shariah law, they're talking about the criminal shariah law, which in reality makes up a fairly small percentage of the actual shariah system. The overwhelming majority of shariah covers religious observances such as how to correctly pray or the hijab, and social matters such as children's Islamic education, marriages and divorces, family life, running a business and dealing with business transactions and the like. 

  Plus I would not be fooled into thinking that shariah is totally black-and-white in its workings or as simple as some people would care to believe. Shariah, and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) are VERY complex and students of these can spend years learning the principles and methods of these, much less their actual application to daily life. A qari or scholar whose judgement is requested on some topic will not just impose some blanket judgement but rather consider each case as a unique event, with a unique ruling (although precedent also is considered) for each one. 

  With regard to the amputations and stonings so beloved of the right-wing's rhetoric on shariah, this is something which I often think too many people fail to understand. These punishments are, to my understanding at least, only the *maximum* punishment that can be given out, but there is nothing in the shariah which mandates this is the **only** punishment for a crime which can be given, and the Quran itself advises mercy is better than revenge. Rather, these punishments are intended to be deterrents, with part of the deterrent effect coming from the uncertainty as to whether, should you commit some crime warranting them, whether the judge will give *you* that maximum sentence.

Nottingham has a fair number of old buildings in the centre. Museum wise there's the Galleries of Justice, Nottingham Castle, City of Caves, Woolaton Hall and lots more if you venture further out the city.

There are lots of good pubs, including a few that go into the city's caves, which is novel. There's plenty of your traditional boozers serving real ales as well. There's a pretty good live music scene too, in pubs and in independent venues. Notts is also big enough to attract the big music tours, but there's loads of small independent stuff going on too. It's a great place for eating out, name a cuisine and we've got it! There's some good independent cinemas, as well as massive chains and there's a few theatres too.

Living costs, it's fairly reasonable. You can rent a one bed flat for £400, a room for upwards of £200. Public transport is about average cost for around the country. 

Because it's got two universities, it's got a lot of young people and people from abroad, either students or academics. This means lots of house shares are available if that's what you wanted.

West Mids - **Birmingham**. I really like Birmingham, great nightlife, shopping and lots to do, it's undergoing a bit of a renaissance now. Good public transport and BHX is a great airport and it's well placed in the middle of the country to explore the UK.

East Mids - **Nottingham** and **Leicester**. Both medium sized cities with history (Nottingham has Robin Hood, Leicester is pre-Roman) with good culture, nightlife and shopping. Leicester is only just over an hour from London on the train and both are close to East Mids Airport so weekend breaks to Europe are easy.

But I can't disagree that how he wants to run the show as a fan (and holy shit is he ever a fan - ever read the bbs posts by him waaayyy back in the day like 20 years ago?) is not necessarily how the current incarnation of the show (including its fanbase) is most efficiently run.

However, I can't say that it ISN'T the best way, either. All I know is I've been happier with him as a showrunner than RTD.

Remember that we're dealing with Doctor 1.0 of Regeneration Cycle 2.0. When Eleven commented ""we're breaking some real science here"" to the Daleks during his cycle reset, he was speaking out-universe as well as in-universe.

This kind of thing has only ever been hinted at, not directly seen. Rassilon was alive for The End of Time/the time war - but it was never said that he was at the end of his cycle, and even in-universe it was unclear if he was dead or simply in some kind of Odinsleep. The Master rocked up after supposedly wasting all his lives - but Anthony Ainley was a possessed Tremas, Eric Roberts was a possessed Bruce, and after that I guess the Time Lords somehow retrieved him from the Eye of Harmony.

What I'm trying to say is, this kind of blatant regeneration reset is unprecedented in the show. So if Moffat is making it up as he goes along, so what? The Doctor probably would be too, let's face it. Dude just got granted an entirely new life cycle which he didn't even think he DESERVED, let alone thought was possible.

And you're dead right, from a simplistic thermodynamic viewpoint.  But there are always reasons why you eat too much and don't move enough.

&gt;I used to read comments like yours and conclude that it wasn't my fault, so I wouldn't feel bad about it, then I would continue my unhealthy lifestyle comfortable in the knowledge that it wasn't my fault I was obese.

Giving explanations about why it happens is not the same as condoning it, and I would never do that given the plethora of health risks associated with obesity; however, I'm not going to sugar coat the fact that obesity is highly heritable, or influenced strongly by maternal BMI at time of conception, just to make the obese feel they have to lose weight because it's entirely their fault.  It isn't.  I'm going to lay out the research as it stands.

&gt;It is entirely down to personal responsibility. Nobody else is picking up the chocolate bars and unhealthy dinners and making you eat them, nobody else is preventing you from getting up and doing some exercise.

Two-thirds of the population are now obese and overweight, double 30 years ago.  Are you going to claim people have half the personal responsibility now?  No.  So what has changed?  Working hours, sleep, stress, physical activity at work, physical activity at home, automation of nearly every daily physical process, cheap high calorie food, drinks, and sophisticated and overt advertising at every turn.  

&gt;Give a fat person an excuse and they will stay fat.

I'll repeat, these are not excuses, nor should they be used as them.

I think Moffat is trying to take steps towards a more gender-neutral companion/Doctor pairing, but he can't just hit us in the face with it. 

Look at it this way: 9 years ago, ""Rose"" premiered. The Doctor reappeared, acquired a sexy young female companion, the rest is history. This was as a direct result of RTD trying to make the series more appealing and accessible to a younger audience. Plus, it's pretty clear the guy is a raging romantic at heart. Was this a bad thing? Hell no. It caused a massive resurgence in Who fandom, it allowed the show to get an increased budget, and it massively reignited interested in the franchise as a whole.

However, it was also all RTD knew how to write. Even Doctor/Donna had romantic undertones (although admittedly they were seriously toned down - made more like positive sexual tension than anything else). Note that pretty much every male companion on RTD's run was a bit... well.. ok. Adam turned out to be a dumbass (which was baffling to me, but whatever). Jack wanted to fuck everything that moved. The only person that was ""normal"" was The Doctor's female companion.

Moffat has been slowly stepping away from that. He initially wrote Rory as being a henpecked skinny little nerd boy... who eventually became one of the most motherfucking **BADASS** characters to ever grace the series. He started writing in more and more male pseudo-companions. He wrote Rory as the Doctor's human equal in many ways.

12 offered companionship to at least one dude. Danny tagged along. There's been more and more male characters having important roles in the episodes. Like I said before, he can't just totally and completely upheave that dynamic of the series. But he's definitely been nudging it toward a more ""neutral"" footing.

Also note that 12 seems somewhat face-blind. He doesn't seem to know what people look like, and he doesn't seem to consider their physical gender important. I highly doubt that's accidental.

-edit-

Turns out it's not accidental. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Twelve was deliberately written as prosopagnosic (cognitive face-blind).",0,1419679021,null,0,1419680559,0,cn6i6p7,t3_2qgoid,t1_cn6i6p7,t1_cn615l1,null,1425197658,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

&gt;___The Portrait___ ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Портрет) is a [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story) by [Nikolai Gogol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol), originally published in the short story collection *[Arabesques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography_of_Nikolai_Gogol)* in 1835 and is one of Gogols’ most demonic of tales, hinting at some of his earlier works such as ""[St. John's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Eve_(short_story\))"".

&gt;It is the story of a young and penniless artist, Andrey Petrovich Chartkov, who stumbles upon a terrifyingly lifelike [portrait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait) in an art shop and is compelled to buy it. The painting is magical and offers him a dilemma — to struggle to make his own way in the world on the basis of his own talents or to accept the assistance of the magic painting to guaranteed riches and fame. He chooses to become rich and famous, but when he comes upon a portrait from another artist which is ""pure, faultless, beautiful as a bride"" he comes to realize that he has made the wrong choice. Eventually, he falls ill and dies from a fever:

&gt;*""The sick man understood nothing, felt nothing, save his own tortures, and gave utterance only to frightful yells and unintelligible gibberish. At last his life ended in a final attack of unutterable suffering. Nothing could be found of all his great wealth; but when they beheld the mutilated fragments of grand works of art, the value of which exceeded a million, they understood the terrible use which had been made of it.""*

Sure you've got Sterling, Lallana and Coutinho with their occasional flashes of brilliance but Gerrard consistently makes masterful passes out of nowhere that nobody's really even come close to replicating. Mind you, consistent in that he'll have a killer ball or two a game not throughout the entire 90. His free-kicks come at the times we most need 'em and with Balotelli and Lambert mostly benched, he's the only one I'd feel comfortable allowing to take penalties.

He's also our captain - the only legend in our squad that stands above the rest by a longshot. I don't think the team could bare to lose him at the moment by not giving him enough playing time to keep him happy. Hendo's a good lad but he's still got a while to go before he's ready to fill in Gerrard's shoes.

The problem though is that despite all of the above, he's invisible for almost 80 minutes each game. He doesn't go forward (rightly so I guess) and contributes very little defensively except for the occasional good block so I don't feel he deserves to start each game based on his performance on the pitch alone.

With him, we want the best of both worlds (have him available but not gone) which means that either the team or Gerrard will suffer as a result.",0,1419681427,null,0,false,0,cn6ikgc,t3_2qh1zz,t1_cn6ikgc,t3_2qh1zz,null,1425197479,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;

&gt;A __cairn__ is a man-made pile (or stack) of stones. The word *cairn* comes from the [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language): *càrn* (plural *càirn*). 

&gt;Cairns are used as [trail markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_blazing) in many parts of the world, in [uplands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_(geology\)), on [moorland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland), on [mountaintops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography\)), near [waterways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway) and on [sea cliffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cliff), as well as in barren [deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert) and [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra). They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [megalithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith) engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, whether for increased visibility or for religious reasons. An ancient example is the [inuksuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk) (plural inuksuit), used by the [Inuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit), [Inupiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inupiat), [Kalaallit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaallit), [Yupik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yupik_peoples), and other peoples of the [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic) region of North America. These structures are found from [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska) to [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland). This region, above the [Arctic Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle), is dominated by the tundra [biome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome) and has areas with few natural [landmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark).

&gt;In [modern times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_time), cairns are often erected as [landmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark), a use they have had since [ancient times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_times); but, since [prehistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory), they have also been built for a variety of other reasons, such as [burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepulchre) monuments and for defence and hunting, as well as ceremonial, [astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical), and other purposes.

The consequence of using a taser was unfortunate. The question is though, was using the taser justified?


From the article:

&gt; He was invited to Mr Carter’s birthday party at the flat but for some reason became very distressed.

&gt; Mr Carter called the police but it is believed there were other 999 calls made by neighbours.

&gt; “I tried to talk to him but he wasn’t really explaining what was wrong.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Carter collected his child, who was asleep upstairs, and they went outside to give Adrian some space. He then called police after Adrian continued to be upset.

The article doesn't specify exactly what was going on when the police arrived, but I think it's reasonable enough from that to infer that he was in something of a state. Neighbours don't call the police for nothing, friends definitely don't, and the fact that he had to remove his child from the flat for his safety doesn't go well in the man's favour. His friend had tried calming him with words, and that had failed. What do you think the police should have done?

Seriously though, the way my partner and I do our finances is as follows:

* Work out a solid budget for your joint expenses. This is things like rent, council tax, bills, insurance, even joint holidays and your meals out. Total it all up.

* Add your two take-home packets together; £3,450 by the sounds of it.

* Divide your total joint expenses by your total net household income. bills/take-home. You've kindly kept it easy at £1,000; £1,000 expenses / £3,450 income = 0.29

* Both of you then 'tax' your take-home pay each month by 29%, and deposit it your joint bank account. All your bills come out of that account will zero fuss each month. You get to keep your 71% take home pay each month. 

Enjoy being a DINK.

That being said, most married couples I know just have joint accounts and put all their pay in there together.

false,NikkiJayne28,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"PCOS messes up your hormones big style. It also causes insulin resistance, which I have. Insulin resistance makes it harder to lose weight, and puts you at an increased risk of type 2.
I was put on Metformin when diagnosed at age 14, which is meant to help reduce the insulin resistance and help you lose weight. All Metformin did for me was make me run to the toilet multiple times a day. I came off it and weirdly lost 6 pounds. Metformin does work for some women with PCOS, however.

As I was diagnosed at 14, I didn't take the science in and I haven't read up on it much since, because it doesn't particularly interest me, it's just one of those things I live with. When I was diagnosed, my endocrinologist informed me that it would be harder to lose weight, and it is. Cruelly, PCOS is a condition that improves with weight loss, which is why I try so hard to lose.

Britain has become a racist country because in any recession people typically turn to the political extremes and become more xenophobic and protectionist.

We've also suffered under particularly the labour party bullying and thuggery where they fund ""antifascist"" mobs to attack political opponents and they shut down debate.

We've also suffered under all politicians refusing to discuss immigration and make a positive case for it when one so clearly exists. It's remarkable that there's anyone wanting to remain in the EU at all because there's pretty much nobody saying anything positive. All you ever hear is scare stories about how much it would cost to exit.

We also suffer under a reactionary and populist press where it's far easier to write headline grabbing stories about immigration to sell your shitrag than it is to write accurate and informative pieces.

Something that also might be worth considering is that _if_ it is racism that motivates UKIP votes (and I suppose to at least some level it must be some of their vote) then why is it in areas where there is little immigration?

Firstly, rent costs so much more than a mortgage. Yeah you need the initial deposit, but after that it's plain sailing. Both our houses were cheap repossessions that we fixed up. After buying the first 6 years ago, we now rent that out which almost covers both mortgages.

Children also bring in regular income in the form of chid benefit and tax relief depending on circumstances.

Both our cars are battered and old. (However, we're changing over to a brand new electric one next month as with the fuel savings it works out cheaper than running and maintaining our current family car. If you do want a car, it might be worth checking out the Nissan Leaf @ £160 a month. No tax, tiny running costs and as the range is low (~90 miles), they'll give a normal car for 14 days a year to do longer journeys, but I digress...)

Our biggest financial breaks came through inheritance. We heavily invested it in our houses rather than squander it (although we did have a week in the Maldives too - gotta have some fun!)

£450 left over with no kids sounds kinda low, so do monthly budgets with your spouse and figure out where it's going. Then SAVE. Either as investments (I've just started with managed funds using HL.com) or just dump the cash into an ISA, it's amazing how quickly it builds. Also, is your student overdraft at 0%? If so, I would forget paying it, and let them fund your investments until the 0% is over. 

I found reading Rich Dad Poor Dad has helped me get my head around things recently; questionable advice, but will sufficiently start to answer your question. But by no means have I got this right!

I get the train from Lisburn station to TQ every week day; the trains are extremely regular during commuter hours; and around every 30 mins off peak during the day. 

The trains in the mornings for Belfast come every 10 or so mins. There are expresses that only stop at Portadown, stations between p'down and lisburn and then straight to great Victoria street, they run all stops from there.

There are also all stops trains; which are a 20 main longer journey.

Lisburn to great Victoria street takes about 30 mins on all stops; about 10 on express.

The expresses in the mornings are packed to bursting when they leave Lisburn: so if you want a wee bit of space go for an all stop service.

I can usually get a seat on the all stop that I get on in Lisburn in the morning; and have no one sitting beside me for most of the journey except finaghy-gvs.

If you are heading to Belfast central its about another 7 mins from GVS. I have had colleagues from Portadown fall asleep on the train on the way to TQ. The train empties massively at GVS; so it is quite quiet.

When I commute by car for a 9 start to TQ; it actually takes me longer door-to-door :/ The buses do use the bus lanes so they do save a lot of time.

For reference I live near laurelhill school

-Coleman Jagielka Stones Baines

-Barkley Bešić (McCarthy's presence allowing more freedom)
-Naismith
-Lukaku Eto'o (Mirallas can rotate off with Eto'o as a deeper lying forward to curb his offside habits)

Posted this comment awhile ago but didn't get much traction, thought it relevant:(discussing using a traditional 442)
&gt;2). A 4-4-2 like that would mean going without the central attacking midfield position which is one of our most important with Barkley and Naismith both operating best from it. It also means in order to keep Ross on the pitch we'd have to put him in the holding midfield role which he isn't nearly as effective in and he just can't provide enough cover for his partner in a two man midfield. The only formation I believe would get the best out of Eto'o, Barkley and Lukaku is a 4-1-2-1-2 or a 4-4-2 diamond with Barkley playing behind the two strikers being backed up by two defensive midfielders and an anchor man. We'd have a much weaker wide presence without proper wingers but that's where our magic fullbacks come in and our anchor man can drop in to cover. Not having wingers wouldn't be a huge issue for us at the moment as our main game changer out wide, Mirallas, is injured. If done properly the 4-4-2 diamond could also get naismith, with Barkley dropping deeper as the anchor man's presence would minimise his defensive responsibilities considerably.
I do very much agree that Lukaku and Eto'o being played together up front would be a fantastic sight to see.

Expanding upon that further down the page:

&gt;I very much agree with that. My thought with Naismith was sticking him in behind the two strikers and putting Ross in the deeper central midfield role with freedom to roam and make an impact further up the pitch (Think Man United with Di Maria playing as a CM and Mata at CAM). Ross would be pretty much free of defensive responsibility due to an Anchor Man's presence behind him and his CM partner beside him as opposed to only having one central player supporting him. Honestly think that unless our wingers start doing amazingly well we should adopt something like this as a plan B, use it for a few matches to keep things fresh. Thinking not only for playing both forwards but also for an overall tactic, if we wanted to slot Mirallas in there we could play him as one of the two front men, but with Kev dropping deeper and drifting a bit wider while his strike partner can stay situated centrally at the opponent's back line as a traditional striker would. Lukaku would fit great for this with his physical presence, he could spearhead the attack down the middle. Imagine Lukaku being fed by a roaming Barkley and Mirallas as well as Naismith in his natural position and Baines/Coleman free to cross the ball into the area!
I do still think our 4-2-3-1 is the best option with our players but it can't hurt to have a plan B, especially with injuries!",0,1419693651,null,0,1419694206,0,cn6l6lx,t3_2qhng0,t1_cn6l6lx,t1_cn6b3ak,null,1425196189,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

So they backpeddle, or do half a job before the other party comes into power again, so nothing really changes.

Of course a good start would be for the government, council and MPs to stop stealing money for their second cousins 3rd London house, sprucing up their duck houses, commissioning stupid fucking statues/sculptures, spunking budgets on pieces of artwork for the council offices.

I also find it shocking that so many people don't see the correlation between how awful Rodgers defenders always look. Lovren hasn't been good by any stretch, but I would say a great deal of that is down to our formation (and it's lack of protection for the CBs with wingbacks bombed forward and Gerrard getting walked by) and a smaller portion is confidence. What so few people ever talk about, when talking about how good certain CBs are, is how protected they are by their formation or the quality of their fellow players. The teams that frequently have CBs that are considered world class tend to play with two DMs. Go down the line of top CBs and you'll find on their club a DM who is miles away better. To be expected to be great when you have no strikers to chase down hoofed balls (Lovren played mostly with Balotelli), no DM who can move in front of you (Gerrard is old, slow, and quickly hounded out of being the Quarterback role this year because people could put someone a year younger with a bit more speed on him and it was over), and a group of attackers that came from different clubs with different roles the previous year. Not to mention, our attackers who played in a side last year where two of our strikers could drop to the half line to relieve pressure whenever.

Lovren's situation is incomparable to Balotellis. End of. Balotelli doesn't belong in England. He's perfect for slow Italy. Or maybe he can come to MLS, get another huge paycheck, and fail again.

Hell, it's amazing to me that Kane has worked out as well as he had... I shudder to think if he hadn't.

I think we're dangerously close to running both him and Eriksen into the ground, particularly with the cups picking up steam in the new year.  We're overly reliant on the two of them, not just in terms of playing minutes, but in saving the whole team time and time again.  Should either break down physically or go through a form/psychological slump, our team would suddenly look much weaker.

If Poch doesn't address those two needs in the next month, I struggle to see how we'll keep momentum. We have a real chance at silverware this season, and 4th place is not out of the question.

Demi came rushing back and caught Messi ~2 yards out of the box, but he fell forward and the penalty was awarded, along with the red.

Pellegrini was suspended 3 games for his post match comments about the quality, or lack thereof, of the refereeing.

I am pro-immigration, I am however only pro EU immigration (properly pro, I would like to see more of it) as it appears to be more beneficial from the economic standpoint of the state. 

In an ideal world I would like to see more EU immigration at the expense of immigration from outside of the EU, which I would like to see more stringent controls on.

In this case, there's two situations where this could be a foul: Can's challenge can be illegal in all cases, or the situation can make it illegal. As Can *doesn't* use an elbow or a hand and *doesn't* barge his opponent from the front or back, nor does he cut across him, so the challenge itself isn't illegal. When it comes to the situation, a player can fairly challenge for the ball by going *shoulder-to-shoulder* with his opponent, which is Can's challenge. If this was not directly relating to acquiring possession of the ball, the situation would make Can's challenge illegal, and thus it would be a foul.

For example: If a high ball was played to Balotelli, and Can nudged him in the back to get an unfair advantage, *foul*. If Liverpool are attacking, and neither Can nor Balotelli are anywhere near the ball and are not challenging for the ball, and Can shoulders him, *foul*. If both players are going for the ball, and Can outmuscles Balotelli to win the ball, *not a foul*. If Balotelli is in possession of the ball and Can is challenging for it, shoulder-to-shoulder and outmuscles him to win the ball, *not a foul*.

This being said though, there is also a rule against excessive force. That's entirely at the referees discretion. And if the referee deems a normally legal shoulder-to-shoulder challenge as being unnecessarily forceful, then he can consider it a foul. But that's subjective.

But yeah, the sky shot was taken elsewhere and then superimposed and retouched in this composite image. Still a neat photo, but not true to life whatsoever.*  

&gt; This is a remake of the image I took last year. It is so far my most ""costly"" image because I spent so much effort in addition to the gear used. Other than a ""cheapo"" composite, this time I attempted to make the stars astronomically correct. The stars' pals should know how difficult it is to capture the winter milky way when facing towards the north, given that light pollution is virtually everywhere around cities.

&gt; Foreground: Thanks to the permission granted by the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, I was able to access the tower several times through the narrow stairs. It was no fun blocking the tourists with my tripod and camera doing long exposures up there. A Phase One IQ260 medium format digital back and a Rodenstock 23mm f5.6 HR lens were used to capture the foreground with different exposures, and blending of a morning shot and a night shot was used to obtain more balanced lights and best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for resolution.

&gt; Sky: I traveled to Whitehill near Burford (N51.79) but the light pollution near the horizon was still severe enough to destroy any details of the nebula. It was no fun either to stand in the freezing wind for hours when the temperature was about 0C. To obtain sufficient number of pixels and sharpness to match the resolution and SNR of the foreground, I used a Nikon D800E camera and a Nikon 24mm f1.4 G lens. Each frame was shot at f1.4, ISO 6400 and 4 seconds. Facing each direction 64 frames were continuously shot. 6 directions were shot to match the wide angle of view of the foreground. A total of 64 * 6 = 384 images were corrected by Adobe Camera Raw, aligned and stacked by PixInsight v1.8, and stitched rectilinearly by PTGui.

&gt; The final effective resolution of the image is 8888 * 6797 = 60 MP, with very high SNR. On technical ground I expect to see the mobile phones capable of taking such a picture in just one handheld single exposure if the technology of dynamic range evolves in the next few decades :)

Yeah I had a feeling it would be like this, I wouldn't go throwing about huge amounts of money, only a sum that I am willing and can afford to lose. 

I mean I'm only 17, not really sure what the financial future will be like so I'm open to trying new things like investing stocks and shares, currencies just to see what it's like, but I would only get involved in it if I had a lot of money and was good at it, which I assume I would not be!

When you bought the property the solicitor acting on your parents behalf should have known about this.

The position has different terms in Scotland and England&amp;Wales but a similar result. 

It'll run with the title and you can't get it removed without paying BT for an alternative. At some point in the past BT have arranged for that pole to be there. 

Getting on your high horse and demand they get rid of it because you or the solicitor acting on your behalf didn't bother to check is wrong. 

Your parents should get the debris removed from the pole ASAP (and at their own cost). This is where the law is slightly different, in Scotland the council will have more success forcing your parents to do it, in England and Wales it's not so easy. The title will no doubt insist that you keep it in order, and it doesn't matter that it was the previous owner that allowed it to become overgrown, your parents should sort it ASAP.

Your parents should speak to the solicitor to ask why they weren't told - but they might have been and not read it.

Depending on the survey your parents took when they bought the property you may also have cause to speak to the surveyor. However the vast majority of purchases are done with the cheapest option which by previous cases in both Scotland and England&amp;Wales it's unlikely a standard valuation would be deemed in court to be negligent if it didn't cover this.

&gt; How much do the different tests cost, at 25 years of age? And how long do they take to pass?

That depends an awful lot on your area and your own skill level. At 25 you can jump right into a DAS course to ride whatever motorcycle you like, which I think would be best for you, as it'll save you the hassle of deciding you want a bigger bike then going back for more (expensive) tests. Going rate in my area for a full DAS course seems to be £625 - £850 (if you want unlimited training and tests). Someone who has done the DAS will be able to fill you in a bit better. Many of the courses are around a 7-10 days long, obviously you can spread it out as much as you like.

&gt; How much for all the gear from scratch?

Depends an awful lot on the quality you want. M&amp;P currently have an offer on for Helmet, Jacket and Trousers for £100. They're all pretty basic but they do the job and offer a decent amount of protection. You can add on another £50 for a basic pair of boots. If you do all your shopping in person and try and buy a full set you should be able to negotiate a decent discount anywhere really.

&gt; How much for a good first bike? What are common first bikes and what are their pros and cons?

Don't jump into a liter sports bike like so many idiots. Obviously after completing a DAS test you can ride whatever you want, but I would suggest something like a SV650, CB500, GS500, FZS600, Bandit 600. Basically a middleweight sports tourer or commuter with a fairly upright riding position. 

If you are only going to be doing city riding than a 125 or 250 might make even more sense, and these will obviously be a lot cheaper to insure and fuel too. In 125s YBR125 and CG125s are popular. For 250s I would go with a CB250.

Regardless of what you choose remember to get some quotes beforehand, to see what you can afford.

EDIT: Just realised I didn't actually tell you how much you should look to spend. For a first bike, don't go for a pristine showroom condition bike. Get something that's taken a beating so you won't be upset if you drop it. In this respect naked bikes (without fairings) are often a good choice, but not street fighters (i.e. bikes that used to have fairings but they've been removed. This is likely due to accident damage and there could be more serious problems). My personal preference is to buy a bike that is an MOT failure and needs work and then do it myself to save some cash. For example, with my first bike the idiot previous owner fitted LED indicators but no resistor/relay so it flashed way too quick (numpty even tried to MOT it in this state). Cost of relay? £5, but it sold for £100 less than it's value because it wasn't roadworthy. If you have access to a van this is a great way to save some money, most people need to ride it away. If you don't have access to a van you might have someone over 30 who could rent one pretty cheaply. I spent £470 on my first bike, £550 on my second and £925 on my third (which is turning out to be a bad buy as I stupidly missed a screwed up rear disc and broke the wheel taking it off). If it's a classified ad, remember to put in an offer lower than the asking price. I sold my first bike for a £5 profit when I would have taken £100 less, and I got £100 off my third bike just by offering £150 less.

&gt; How much to insure?

How long is a piece of string? Depends so much on your own driving history, location, profession and the bike you choose it's impossible to give a decent estimate. Find a few bikes you like and get some quotes on a comparison site. As a rough guide for you to work from at 19 when I passed my test my SR125 (pretty low insurance group) was £450 to insure third party only, including commuting. I imagine your increased age will slightly offset some of the costs of getting a bigger bike than a 125, so I reckon £450-£650 is a decent ball park figure to work from.

&gt; What are the running costs like?

Depends on the bike you choose again, and what sort of riding you are doing. If you're commuting every day then your wear, tear and fuel will be much more than a weekend hobbyist. 125s are cheap on petrol and parts for common Japanese motorcycles such as a Honda or a Yamaha are mostly cheap too. Pretty easy to work on as well. 250s are slightly more expensive fuel wise, but parts still tend to be cheap. Middleweight bikes drink slightly more petrol and demand better, more expensive tyres. I could kit out my 125 with cheapo front and rear tyres and get change out of £70. The 250 cost me about £100ish for a full set of decent tyres and my Fazer will cost around £180 for a set of decent tyres. Middleweights are also a bit more difficult to work on in my experience.

Obviously bigger bikes cost more to tax too, 250s are £37 for the year and a middleweight will be £58 for the year. You can spread the cost over the year with direct debit for a couple of extra quid.",0,1419698432,null,0,1419718168,0,cn6ms35,t3_2qjdaq,t1_cn6ms35,t3_2qjdaq,null,1425195444,13,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,13

With regard to the Danny Pink / Doctor Who situation, I think that's more to do with the fact that PE teachers have traditionally been considered as lower on the intellectual ladder than other teachers.  The thought process seems to be that if you're a Geography/Science/History teacher, a large amount of learning is required to fulfil that role, whereas PE teachers simply need to know how to run about a bit. The Doctor was aiming to deliberately belittle Danny Pink, hence referring to him as 'PE'.  I don't think race was a factor in that at all.

Also of interest in the 'black kid cast as monkey' story, is the fact that after the initial media storm was whipped up, it actually transpired that the teacher had asked ALL of the children which characters they'd like to play (a number of human characters were available along with animal characters too - I seem to recall it was a nativity play) and the two black children actually volunteered, unbidden, to play monkeys.  No racial insult, no hidden agenda, those two kids just bloody loved monkeys and wanted to dress up like them.

Immigration largely falls into 3 categories, and lumping them all together under one header is what results in things like people being unable to bring their wives here to live with them.

Largely immigration falls into one of these groups:

* EU immigration - anyone can come here, irrespective of skills or qualifications, and our citizens can go there. That's the end of it, and that agreement was made on the basis that all EU countries are about as developed and about equally generous with benefits.

* Immigration from outside EU, persons with skills and qualifications - This is what supplies us with doctors &amp; nurses, probably engineers &amp; computer programmers, too.

* Immigration from outside EU, illegal immigrants and asylum seekers - hugely complicated can of worms. We deport as many as we can, but we have to accept some refugees because we signed a bunch of international treaties saying we'd do so. Could write essays about this, needs some reform at the global level, IMO.

[Even Farage says we should accept genuine refugees](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25539843), ffs.

We didn't adjust the team for Balotelli. We actually tried to stuff him into a setup that blatantly does not work for him, and then persisted with it for a long time hoping he'd magically change into a completely different player from the one we'd bought.

If we were going to adjust the team to fit Balotelli we'd have been playing with 2 forwards and partnered him with Sterling, Lambert, or Borini far more often. You can say we made adjustments to cover for his lack of defensive work rate,  but that doesn't do anything to actually help Balotelli play better. 

We've mismanaged Balotelli from the start. BR has been absurd in the media regarding him, and our setup disregards his strengths as a player. It's a bit tough to totally blame Rodgers because it seems clear he never wanted Balotelli, but he's still a Liverpool player and one that could have made a much better contribution to the season thus far if he'd been given the tools to do so. At the same time, in spite of being stuck in a setup that marginalizes his game with a manager who who treats him with quiet contempt, maybe Balotelli's form could have been better and he could have done more for himself too.

Now for me the really expensive part was the gear.  I was advised not to just buy cheap gear.  Get good quality gear because it will last you beyond your first bike.  My brother bought cheap gear to get him started and it didn't last long.  He had to rebuy everything.

I budgeted about £100 for each piece of gear such as boots, gloves, trousers.  Go with gear like Held, Alpine Stars, Dianese, TCX etc.  Avoid Spada.  You should get great all season gor-tex gear for that price.  Water proof and warm but with vents for summer.

For the jacket around £200 should get you a good AS or Held touring all season jacket.  Warm and water proof with removable liners but cool in summer.

For the helmet you can get a perfectly safe helmet for £100 but if you want protection plus comfort then spend more.  Cheap helmets have vents but they don't really work.

Even though the landlord hasn't done repairs you are legally required to continue to pay the rent or you can be evicted and the outstanding rent recovered by the landlord through the courts. There are very very few circumstances in which you can legally withhold rent and damp, no matter how bad it is, is not one of the circumstances.

Not in law. They are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get quotes etc. A month would be a reasonable time for work to commence for that type of problem depending on availability of tradesmen in your area.

~~Dear Sir or Madam~~

~~Recently it has come to my attention that PC World and Curry's are using some very dodgy, possibly verging on illegal, tactics in order to milk more money out of their consumers, for a service that they do not need.~~

~~Three to four weeks ago, I visited the Hove branch of PC World/Curry's in order to collect a reservation that my housemate had made the same day. Upon arriving, we were told that whilst the laptop that we had reserved for £449 was in stock (the Lenovo Flex 14), the only ones they had available had had a ""set-up"" service that came with the laptop. This ""set-up"" service includes a USB stick with a backup of the PC's files and nothing more - yet, a new laptop comes with a backup partition pre-installed for free.~~
 
~~We refused this price as it was not the price that we had reserved the laptop for. We were then informed by the sales assistant immediately that he would be able to drop the price down to £25. We refused again, and he countered with the offer of dropping the price down again, to £10. At that point we had had enough and just wanted to purchase the laptop, so we bit the bullet and cut our losses of £10.~~

~~This had obviously raised red flags, but not as much as it has today.~~

~~Today me and my father visited the Derby branch of PC World/Curry's, after reserving an ASUS 2-in-1 laptop for £500. Sure enough, when we arrived, we were informed that they did not have the laptop in stock without the set up service. After we refused, and I had told the sales assistant what had happened in Hove a few weeks prior, the price was again brought back down to £25. This is when we decided to leave the store.~~

~~These events show that this is a tactic that is being used nationwide, and it is likely that hundreds, if not thousands, have been subjected to this absolutely useless £35 charge, without knowing the inherent value (or lack of) of this backup - which as I stated before, comes on the recovery partition on the laptop.~~

Revised letter:
  
Recently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a ‘bait-and-switch’ strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.  

Three to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry’s PC World website for collection in Hove. However, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the ‘regular’ laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been “set-up” – the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick. We were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.  

After refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25. We again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35. At this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.
Now, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry’s PC World in Derby. The price of this laptop was £499. Yet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no ‘regular’ versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop. We declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 – not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at. We then decided to leave the store.  

These tactics are being employed by Curry’s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this – especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP. This poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.

Similarly, Modric is listed as having a strong long shot. Love the player, but his long shot is not one of his strengths. He gets this counted as Real Madrid dominates possession, Modric lays deepest of the offensive players, so he gets a lot of long shots. Doesn't mean it is a strength though.

As far as why I discounted water retention, it was a first approximation to examine what the relative rates of calories in to out looked like. Obviously it's possible that compensatory mechanisms can result in your weight staying the same, despite losing fat, but those don't carry on week after week after week.

false,ppphhh,UnionFlag,CBF600N-Kent,"The test issue is so complicated I don't even want to go there. To get a full license you're probably looking at £1000 including training. To get a CBT (and ride a 125), £100. A CBT takes a day to do, a full test might be a solid week of training to pass, (or a few weeks spaced out) plus a day for the CBT and a day to practice &amp; pass the theory test. 

You want to spend about £100 on a decent helmet, maybe the same on a jacket, and about £20 for gloves. You can of course go cheaper, but I wouldn't. You can ride with nothing but a helmet, but I wouldn't. Cheap boots will be about £50 (but worth it compared to regular boots) and trousers with a bit of armour you might get for £50, so £220 total as a rough figure, depending on how well protected you want to be. Of course for higher quality you can quadruple those figures. I have a £130 helmet, a £250 jacket, £170 boots, £120 trousers, and £70 gloves. And I need to replace the helmet.

First bikes are normally the 125s which are basically all the same (Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki are the big three to look at generally speaking.) Pros are they're super cheap, legal on the 1 day £100 CBT, and easy to ride. Cons are they're slow as shit, but enough for in town, and expensive to buy because they're always in demand, around £1000 used. If you get the full license many people start on things like the Honda CB500, the Suzuki GS500, the Suzuki Bandit 600, the Yamaha Fazer, the Kawaski E6-RN (or something). Pros are they're quick, quicker than most cars, but still easy to ride and relatively cheap, around £1000-£3000 used. Of course each bike will have its own pros and cons but broadly speaking it's the same as with cars, some are more reliable, some are quicker, some look nicer etc. There's not an awful lot of difference really, it's more about personal preference. A *bad* first bike is a sports one, the GSXR, CBR, and RX in 600 and 1000 from Suzuki, Honda, and Yamaha, are all very fast, very unforgiving bikes that will smoke a ferrari but only cost you £3k used. Sounds great until you hit a pothole, blip the throttle, and the bike shoots out from under you.

Insurance varies massively. I paid £500 down to £300 aged 17-19 on a 125, and £400 down to £300 on a 600 from 19 to 22. Bigger engine = more money, generally, and as with cars, it's more expensive if you're young and in London etc. Bikes are a lot cheaper to insure (and tax.)

Running costs are less than a roughly equivalent car. I've not had to have any serious work done on my 10 year old bike, so I've only paid for oil and services, which are cheaper than for a car. MOT is cheaper too. Tyres are about the same but you only have to buy two. Bikes in general use less petrol, I get about 60mpg out of mine riding carefully and that's not remarkable. I pushed 100mpg on my 125. Naturally a big or a fast bike will be closer to 30mpg, and will be more expensive generally to run. Stuff breaks on a motorbike as frequently as on a car, but they're easier to work on and there's a lot less stuff *to* break, so it works out cheaper, generally speaking.",0,1419703018,null,0,false,0,cn6ole8,t3_2qjdaq,t1_cn6ole8,t3_2qjdaq,null,1425194600,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2
false,James955i,null,null,"I think the core question here was how do people with kids afford to run cars, not asking for budgeting advice, so I'll attempt to relate my situation. I have an income of £21,000, I live oop north, I am 27 and have four children. My monthly income after tax, pension etc come off is about £1380, but then tax credits add about £885 every four weeks, and child benenfit pays roughly £200 every four weeks. My monthly income is around £2700 per month.

That's how it's affordable, cheap northern expenses, heavily subsidised by our almost overly generous tax credit system. 

Child tax credits pay roughly £2700 per child per year (I could check the exact figures, but I can't be bothered..!) plus £550 on top. Working Tax Credits when you have a partner and work over 30 hours pays around £5000, and then they take 41% (?) off of you for everything you earn over £7,000ish. 

Effectively between tax, national insurance, student loan repayments and the lost tax credits if I have a £10,000 pay increase, I will see £1,700 of it in real terms until approximately £45,000 p/a earned income. If I changed jobs and lost £10,000p/a my cash income would drop £1,700.

If you held £100k you would get the maximum amount of £85k from the FSCS. You would potentially get some of the remaining £15k from HSBC's remaining assets, but this is likely to be pennies in the pound and could take a long time to come through.  

One thing to watch out for is that the compensation limit is per authorised institution. One authorised institution may operate under more than one name or brand.  Perhaps the best example is Bank of Scotland plc which is the authorised institution for Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires, Capital Bank, Halifax and St James's Place Bank, plus savings accounts sold in the name of the AA and Saga.  So if, e.g. you had £50k with Halifax and £50k with Bank of Scotland you might naively think you were under the limit when in fact as far as the FSCS is concerned you'd have £100k with one institution.

Shares ISAs are rather different.  The FSCS has a lower limit of £50k for ""investments"". That sounds bad but AIUI (and I admit I'm a bit sketchy on this - hopefully someone else will weigh in if I'm wildly wrong) it's not as bad as it sounds. The reason it's OK is that shares held by a broker (whether inside an ISA or not) are still legally seen as belonging to you.  If the broker goes bust those are still your shares; they're not at risk in the way funds in a bank account are.",0,1419703136,null,0,1419710804,0,cn6on6y,t3_2qj1e5,t1_cn6on6y,t1_cn6mje9,null,1425194575,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

false,BraveSirZaphod,null,null,"It actually hasn't been though. The classic series had a wide variety of companions, from a prodigy kid to a robot dog. The show started off with two schoolteachers, one male, one female. While you're right that the new series has always been the Doctor and a girl, Donna proved that she doesn't have to be some young bit of eye candy.  But Doctor Who has definitely not been the Doctor running around with a pretty girl for fifty years. 

As for the escapism factor, that's absolutely valid for you. Different people watch the show for different reasons, and that's true of any show. I personally love seeing all these wonderful adventures occur throughout all of time and space and following one of the most fantastic characters ever created. I would postulate however that the same relatability problem should also pop up with Peter Capaldi. Now the Doctor is less a dashing young man and more a tender, if not somewhat grumpy, grandfather figure. That's further from me than a young Doctor who just happens to be a girl would be. Then again, that's not why the show appeals to me. The 50th anniversary episode spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be the Doctor. The Doctor is defined more by his attitude, morals, kindness, and constant curiosity than anything else. I really don't feel like taking any Doctor, say Eleven, and then making him female while leaving his personality alone would really change who the Doctor his. 

Finally, why does having a few gay characters equate to making a political point? If you went back not that far ago, having a black character was making a political point. Heck, judging by the reaction to that new Star Wars trailer, some people still can't fathom the idea of a black character without imagining some hidden agenda behind it. And that's absolutely ridiculous. Characters should be able to exist without being judged for their skin color, or their sexuality.

To really advise you properly, you should probably state what kind of income you expect to be making on graduation. Yes, £250k is a lot of money.

If you want your money to go further but you don't want to leave the southeast you need to be earning a lot more than the average. Housing prices here are insane and will continue to be insane for a while yet. It's just the way it is.

Prices are unlikely to inflate outside the South East at anything like the same rate - they currently don't and historically have not done so.

I don't  think either of the choices made in those instances were were the right choices. The aliens in Christmas Invasion were leaving, and Torchwood had no right to kill them on the basis of something they might do in the future. And there wasn't even a need to hurt the Star-Whale in the Beast Below. It was offering itself to help, there was no need whatsoever to begin controlling its brain. Humanity was wrong to jump to violence there.

&gt;disregarded that and refused to detonate it and save the world

Again, Clara did save the world. And the Egg-Creature. It was not destroyed when she pressed the button, so clearly she made the right choice. Yes everyone wanted her to kill it, but sometimes the majority is wrong. I think that was a bit of a message in the episode - making the right choice even when it doesn't seem like the right one. 

I'm sort of confused as to why you think killing the thing would have been the thing to do. I mean clearly in retrospect its obvious that the thing didn't need to die. It wasn't deus ex machina, it was the creature wasn't malevolent, and Clara put some trust in it to believe that. Yes, the decision was a very risky one to make, but that didn't make it the wrong one. And yes she had no way of knowing and thats why she got mad at the Doctor later on for not helping her.

&gt;Regardless of the choice and outcome, lives will be lost and it will be your fault

Except it wasn't that kind of situation. There was a possibility that no one had to die. There was a chance the egg wasn't going to wake up and decide to destroy everything, and Clara decided to put trust in it and let it live. She believed this was the version where no one would die, and she was right.

Reed looks ready and capable and with Davis, Wanyama, Cork and Toby as options in the centre we won't suffer a big loss of depth with Schneiderlin going (obviously we'll miss his quality).

So if he goes that opens up the opportunity to improve our depth in other positions in Jan, in particular another striker would be nice I think. Accounting for match fitness and then form we are probably going to miss J-Rod for a while yet, look at how long it's taking Walcott to come back.

CBT around £100 depnding on where you like
Basic kit, ball park £400 is you shop smart.
learner legal bike, you can get really nice ones for a few grand, i just got my partner an AJS 125 for £1400 new, you can spend as little as £300
insurance, hard to say, alot of factors are taken in to a quote but we paid £600

the great thing about this route is there very little pressure on you, when your doing the test through a bike school, your paying for the test, the bike and the instructor, plus youll usually have an hour or 2 before the test so it all get very expensive. 
If you have your own bike on a CBT certificate you can find empty car parks ect to practice. when your ready you should only need a day to get used to a 650cc machine and then do the test.
Another point here is you pass and you have a bike, youve earned maybe a years NCD with your insurance, possibly upgraded your basic kit and provided you didnt overpay on the bike originally you should get back close to what you paid for it

2nd route is DAS, this will let you ride any bike, but it is expensive, i dropped just short of £800 on mine, that was including CBT and test fee's.

Why *are* black people such good marathon runners compared to people with other skin tones at high level international sporting events?

I'm curious whether you believe it is because they have superior economies and are beneficiaries of institutional racism that gives them advantages other races just don't get.

*Surely* a non-racist like yourself would never *dare* to suggest genetic differences/supremacy? Surely not!

One of the worst places to go for football journalism with the exception of Wright Thompson, who's written a few really nice pieces (like [this one on Suarez last season](http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10984370/portrait-serial-winner-luis-suarez-soccer-most-beautiful-player) ).

That said, I think Rodgers has actually pushed Balotelli into a formation that doesn't suit him (or the rest of the players for that matter) for the vast majority of his starts with us.  The 4-2-3-1 is so bad when we use it, it's hardly worked for anyone on the pitch, not just Mario.  For Balotelli specifically though, he's not that good as a lone striker, and he's not that good playing on his front foot so to speak, he likes to play with his back to goal more than anything.  We've not given him a partner with the exception of 2 games (Spurs and West Ham), and we've tried to force him to play with his front to goal.  I'm not sure what anyone was expecting, but in these circumstances, he was always going to have little to no impact on anything.  You can tell that just by having watched him a bit throughout his career.

He could have been in better form and taken some of his chances better (he's really missed a few blinders).  He's missed a few opportunities that are pretty damn hard to fuck up and that's absolutely on him.  He's also been a little unlucky on a few of them (like De Gea's save), and that'll happen sometimes.

I don't think BR and his staff have done anywhere near everything they can to get him playing well though, in fact I think it's the opposite.  I think they'd just jammed him into what they already had and ignored his strengths/weaknesses as a player.  I can see why that may have happened if Balotelli wasn't a player Rodgers wanted (which it seems more and more apparent is the case).  I don't agree with it even if I see how/why though.  This doesn't even touch on how BR deals with Balotelli in the public eye/media either, which I think has been handled horribly as well.",0,1419707764,null,0,false,0,cn6qkxy,t3_2qjqdy,t1_cn6qkxy,t1_cn6pspy,null,1425193671,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

The basics of it is they are performing a marginally beneficial task, and charging you a significant premium... but crucially they are denying they have the unaltered item in stock.

What will probably happen is PC World will officially claim they have both options available and that many laptop failures are down to dying hard drives and it's much better to have the USB stick. They're actually correct about that, the mechanical hard drive is the weakest link. They'll then claim it is absolutely not policy to cheat consumers into paying for the service if they don't want it and it should be available except where a customer has returned or cancelled an order... Which of course is bollocks.

If they were actually interested in great service rather than headline grabbing prices and trying to screw an extra few quid once you're in the shop they'd offer that service for £0, since they'd be able to give you a PC World branded USB stick that cost them less than £1.

It's not done entirely in bad faith, it's done in the interests of time saving and unrealistic expectations of all staff over Peak Season.

They get hundreds of laptops in at Christmas. Sales people (including new Christmas staff) are unreasonably expected to sell *almost every single one* of these with some kind of extra shit (whether that be ""product support"", a set up or just some Knowhow Cloud bollocks).

So to save time, many (it was a third last year, I imagine it's higher this year) of these are pre set up to save the ""less competent"" customer time and ensure the laptop is ""user ready"" when opened on Christmas Day.

This, of course, means that the rare people who are technologically competent and are simply after buying a laptop and getting the fuck away with the least amount of hassle will take the small amount of unopened laptops that the store has. So, once those are gone all that's left are the pre-setup ones...whose condition is not changed on the stock file, causing so many fucking headaches with reserve and collect ...

~~~~

Also, as an aside, not all of the laptops they sell have the recovery partition - I know Lenovo and HP laptops usually do, but the cheaper ones often don't. Hell, sometimes I'd see differences across different models.

~~~~

I always thought it was a bad idea (especially if the laptop already has a recovery partition), but I also understood why they feel they need to do it. They make next to nothing on laptops at Christmas (hell, they make next to nothing on them all year) because of the massive discounts so they *need* extras on the sale.

Of course the problem is, once you've done a set up, a laptop is no longer ""unopened"" and work has been done on it...meaning to sell it without charging for setup (and the USB stick) means time has been wasted.

It's a terrible system and I don't know who actually thinks it's a good idea in store, but it's direct from head office and the managers generally tell new staff that ""the laptop needs this set up doing, so if we do it beforehand then we save the customer time"" which is obviously bollocks. I often wondered how many staff knew they were lying to customers and how many were too ignorant to know any better or question it (and I'm also not sure which is worse).

I was absolutely terrible when I tried my hand at sales because I have too much integrity and actually knew my stuff (techwise) unlike many other staff. I couldn't, in good conscience, sell stuff to a customer that they didn't need because I knew better than what the ""higher ups"" were telling us to say.

So, they've been doing it long enough that if there have been complaints to trading standards about it, they're probably not *technically* doing anything wrong...no matter how dodgy it seems to customers like yourself or how shit I know it is to the staff.

I suffer from a different chronic illness, and I am trying to convince you of the same thing I've been trying to convince myself and others of for the past 10 years of suffering. 

I've told doctors how I'm feeling, and they have told me that it is impossible for me to feel that way. And yet the feeling remains. The obvious conclusion is that I'm mad, and if I'm mad and can't determine reality from fiction, then I might as well kill myself. 

I'm not angry at you for having the reaction you have, I'm angry at people like you who think that the issue is a lack of rationalisation. The issue is not a lack of rationalisation. I, and many people with chronic illnesses can spend every waking minute attempting rationalise my situation with the ""truth"" that it is impossible for me to feel the way I do. Edit: and go on living. 

Someone told you they have problems and you said that you can't understand how they could. That doesn't mean they don't have a problem ggow, that means you can't understand their problem. That is the fact that you need to accept. You do not understand. You do not know that pain. To empathise with someone you literally need to feel what they are feeling. When you read about people's pain, are tears streaming down your face? Are you curled up into a ball crying because it's unthinkable that this might be happening to you but all the evidence you have tells you that you're wrong? Because that's what you would be doing if you actually empathised with the pain.  

What I'm telling you ggow, is that it is okay for you not to understand. No one has yet been able to understand this problem, and if you genuinely think you have then I think it would be incredibly selfish of you to not publish your results.

I was a bit harsh on Sterling, he has done really well upfront for us but in the Arsenal and Burnley game it was made very apparent that he's pretty useless when the opposition defends deep.. what's he meant to do? he's 5 foot 7 so can't really win a header unless he's not being challenged and he can't really hold the ball up as good as someone like Balotelli. He's great when we can play a counter attacking style but the teams in the mid/bottom half of the table wont let us do that (like Burnley yesterday).. he'd be amazing playing upfront alongside Sturridge/Balotelli though I reckon.

I got done by a camera the other day, not had a letter yet but I'm sure it'll come. 

Plenty of people moan about the camera in question online, some even talk about contesting it because they believe the road/camera is dodgy.

The road in question was a 40 zone until recently, the roads running parallel on both sides which are very similar are both 40mph and there is no updates of speed for side roads (the one I came from being 20mph) and no speed limit signs along the road at all. Like I said, that's all well within the law. And while I do see where people are coming from in saying it's a bit of an odd one, at the end of the day everyone who drives knows a road with lights and no speed limit signs = 30mph (or at least should do.)

I'm pissed off that I was doing 40mph in a 30mph zone. Not so much because I was caught (though 3 points and £100 does hurt.) but mostly because I should have known I was speeding. I only passed a few months ago and I hold my hands up and admit, I am completely in the wrong. Whether that's through not paying enough attention, not knowing the area or a lack of experience - it doesn't rally matter, what does matter is the fact it's certainly going to further my ability/knowledge/skill when it comes to driving. 

I can't understand why so many people want to get off on a technicality or are so unwilling to admit their fault.

- consider an older and more classic sports car. You'll get more pleasure from a characterful car than a modern sports clone. (You'll also get more envious looks). Also, it's unlikely to lose value. Amazing what you can pick up for £5k.

""There are at present 62 grant-aided integrated schools in Northern Ireland""

See this is exactly what I mean, you're quoting a government site about schools they gave grants to which involves active expression of traditions of both sides of the country and equalish numbers. Not schools that simply don't give a fuck. Mine wasn't on the list for example and i'm damn sure it wasn't a religious school

&gt;Whether you want to paint it an an ethnic, socioeconomic or religious conflict, it's equally absurd. 

...well initially it had to do with the English killing and abusing millions of us, then there was gerrymandering and the abuse of Catholics in the 70's. I don't agree with the conflict but there was legitimate reasons behind it and it's ridiculous of you to dismiss it so easily.

&gt;There is no fundamental difference between a Catholic and a Protestant. 

See this is where socioeconomics and tradition come into it, for example Catholics traditionally being seen as poorer and more working class. Things like that leave a lasting impact, one we should and are moving past but to say there is no fundamental difference is ignorant. You also have to see that a Catholic is far more likely to have an innocent family member that was killed by the government and a Protestant equally more likely to have one that was killed by dissidents. These things leave marks, one's that have faded immensely but they still exist.

&gt;It's all indoctrination, nurtured hate passed on from generation to generation.

To an extent but again you seem to have this awful tinted view that is simply wrong in current times.

&gt;I lived in Northern Ireland for 26 years. 

When? Because it seems like it was a *long* time ago. 

&gt;I think it's disturbing that people aren't worried by religious bodies having influence over the education system.

There's a lot of Catholic schools but other than that I don't know what you mean there, perhaps you can elaborate?

&gt;Tell me where I'm going wrong

The headline inflation figure is an attempt to take all those individual price changes and distill them down into a single number which gives an indication of how prices in the UK economy are moving.

Ultimately the only use for money is to buy stuff, so it follows that the ""real"" value of money is the amount of stuff it can buy, not an arbitrary figure in pounds and pence.

So, if you have £1000 in a bank account today earning 2% interest then in a year's time you'll have £1020, which is obviously more in absolute terms, but whether it's worth more or less in real terms will depend on what inflation has done over the same time period.  

If inflation was 3% then the stuff you could have bought for £1000 today will cost £1030 in a year - you won't be able to afford it with the money in your account. On the other hand if inflation was only 1% then the same stuff will cost £1010 - you can buy it with money left over, which means you've made a *real* return on your savings.

They have targets of ""knowhow services"" to sell, as they generate more profit for the stores. As it is essentially, money for nothing. Technicians pre-setup laptops for customers so they are 'ready to use' as soon as they get home. These usually come with sales pitches such as ""Dont you want your children to be able to use the laptop on xmas day without any stress?"" etc around christmas.

Stores are targeted for the amount of laptops they have in stock that are pre-setup but laptops that are pre-setup arn't changed anywhere on the stockfile, so customers reserve them online assuming it is normal stock but actually the technition (Or anyone else deemed competent enough, AKA can run a usb backup of the recovery). Has opened it, done that crap then cellotaped it back up.

When I left prices were £55 for setup and tutorial (30 mins with the technician or again, anyone deemed competent enough by management).
£45 for just the backup etc no software installs, and £35 for just the backup, these are generated by ""customer offers"" through the till systems. Customer offers are discounted but dont affect the stores discount target, so they will try for the full whack if your willing to pay for it, and then as they say ""skii down hill"" to see how much your willing to pay. In head offices defence, the procedure if someone has reserved a laptop and doesn't want to pay for the additional setup that has been done on their product without wanting it, is to use a customer offer that brings it down to £10, so that the memory stick they used is taken off the stock file. And then discount the £10 off the sale manually.  But this discounting does affect the stores 'Controllable Discount"" which is at 0.6% of stores profit if i remember rightly. Usually for customer issues etc. But that's exactly why management would hate to use it, as that affects their bonuses. 

I used to dread if a customer had reserved the last laptop in store and it was pre set-up, as did most of the other colleagues. But managers try and create this culture of mugging people off as ok &amp; funny (The older you are or as technologically impaired the bigger chance you have of getting targeted for this as usually people dont even know what it is and panic thinking nothing will work without it). Headoffice usually get it right with what they say and instructions, and they are very careful how they are worded. But they know full well how much pressure managers are under by area managers to hit targets and do well, as that is how you get recognised for promotion etc. (Usually scammy tactics are passed from store to store from area managers).

There are scams all over the store though, worst are ""package deals"" but i'll get to that another day haha. It should also be pointed out that most stores will be different varying on the manager and how much people are willing to do for him/her (massive pat on the back for selling these services). Most guys on the sales floor are ok, just victim to the ""us &amp; them"" culture that managers create to get people to lose their sense of morality. Glad I left PCworld =]

Yes most of us alive didn't do it, we weren't in a position of power to change it... but the government we elected did... I see it more as taking responsibility as a country and just being a decent human being by taking ayslum seekers in, sure a few will be bullshitting but if we use that logic a few bullshitting ruining a good thing we may as well close down foodbanks, stop benefits for those out of work... just makes no sense to do.

A company will issue bonds with a certain face value and a certain interest rate (also called a coupon) and lifetime attached.  Say, a 10 year £100 bond at 5%.

I can buy that bond by handing over £100 to the company, and every year the company pays me £5. After 10 years the bond reaches the end of its term - called maturing - and the company pays me £100 to redeem it.  So far so simple.

But I don't have to hang on to that bond for the full 10 years.  There is a secondary market in bonds - I can sell my bond to someone else who then acquires the right to get those £5 coupon payments for the rest of the bond's life, and to receive £100 when the bond matures.  What are those rights worth? Well that very much depends on what else someone else could do with their money, and one of the big influences is what current interest rates are.  That's what the link talks about, and I recommend you read it if you want to know more.

Premium Bonds aren't bonds in that sense at all - you can't sell them to anyone else; all you can do is hold them for a chance to win prizes in the [monthly draws](http://www.nsandi.com/savings-current-interest-rates-premium-bonds-prize-draw-details) or cash them in at face value.

If you have a grandparent that is UK born and was born after a certain date (check the link) and you're a citizen of the Commonwealth you can get an Ancestral Visa, you can check eligibility here - https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa/overview - I found they're quite lax with it, a lot of people send off all sorts of evidence they can survive but if you're single and under 30 just send off the application and evidence you have about £3000 saved up and they'll accept it.

To become a UK citizen you would need stay in the UK for 5 years on the Ancestral Visa, then apply for residency, then after 1 year residency you can apply to become a citizen, so a 6 year process in all.

You can become a British Citizen (via dual citizenships) immediately if your parent is born in the UK, so one of your parents should be eligible to hold a dual citizenship, but unfortunately you can't then claim that your parent holds a UK citizenship so you should too - so you can't 'pass it along'. 

For example my Mother has a dual citizenship UK/AU because her Grandfather is British, but I can't then claim the citizenship - it's where you were born rather than the passports you hold. However my father is German born so I was handed a German passport just for being his child - the process would be the same for a UK passport for whichever of your parents has the Scottish grandmother.

[Government stats don't seem to agree.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/324580/rrcgb-main-results-2013.pdf) Having had a very quick look;

Pedestrian deaths are down 35% since 2000, serious injury down 19%. Despite stable traffic numbers (in fact, a very small increase.)

Cyclist deaths are a little more tricky seeing as they have fluctuated within a fairly large percentage range over the same time period, though participation of cycling has increased considerably since 2000 and deaths haven't increased with the same speed. Serious injury to cyclists do seem to be increasing though. Like you say, cyclist deaths are not falling yet they aren't clearly increasing either, despite very obvious increase in participation. 

&gt;And with vulnerable road users speed is almost always a factor.

From what I understand, most deaths of cyclists occur at relatively low speed unfortunately. 

75% of cyclist deaths or serious injuries are in urban areas, with a further 75% of them deaths or serious injuries being at or near junctions. It's fair to say most urban junctions have comparatively low speed.

The two most common factors involved in cyclist being seriously injured or killed on our roads are 'failure to look properly' (57%) and  'cyclist entering the road from the pavement' (20%). The third most common factor is poorly thought out turning or manoeuvring (e.g. overtaking a cyclist only to turn left right away, which is worryingly common!)

As for the plugs, smaller would be better. Something at or below the centimetre mark would be best; I don't know much about it, do you have time to get the holes any smaller? Also, wear plain plugs for interviews, no distracting patterns or images, and definitely no tunnels because they freak some people out, better safe than sorry.

When my laptop crashed, I did a quick Google search on how to fix it and it looked fairly simple;. I didn't want to tamper with any dump files, and figured that I should leave it to the experts.

So I did. I took it into PC World, went to the service desk and presented the problem. The guy was completely incompetent. He just clicked here and there, then took it in. Fair enough, maybe that isn't part of his job.

Anyway, I gave my insurance details and was surprised that he didn't offer a temporary replacement. That's where around £15/month was going; had I not asked, I would not received the service that I was paying for.

Okay, maybe that's a bit pushy to expect that offered to me, but it gets worse.

1) I got a shitty replacement; memory wiped whenever it turns off, slow as fuck, and I received it the following day since they 'don't have storage space' for replacements. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as mine, but what they provided was so painfully awful, especially for the monthly payment rate.

2) After a week, they called to say that they couldn't repair it, and that they'll give it back for me to contact the manufacturer. However, it clearly states in the contract that 'if we cannot repair your device, we'll get you a new one'. So a little angered by their request, I demanded that they contact the manufacturer and get it sorted. Why should I lose a week's worth of work time, only to get it back unchanged? I'd have to send it off again, and I couldn't risk it being returned unchanged again. So, they agreed to try and get it sorted.

3) They ring a few days later to say that the laptop has been given to their 'specialists' and will be returned soon.

4) Unannounced, they arrive at my door at around 08:30 with my laptop a few days later. I open the door and ask 'is it fixed?'. Woman replies 'yes' clear as fucking day, she says 'yes, it's repaired, can we have the loan laptop back?'

5) I return the shitty temporary one and take my repaired one upstairs. Read through the paperwork, and written was something along the lines of a faulty hard-drive - not repaired. I thought ""she wouldn't have lied to me, I better check...""

STILL BROKEN; nothing changed. The bitch lied and couldn't have fled fast enough.

Two days later, I fixed it myself. Fucking amateurs...

Wish I didn't though, so I could have milked a new laptop out of them, but I really needed to get my work done.

Harry KaneEdit

Hurricane (Harry Kane), created by Stan Lee and Dick Ayers, was an enemy of the Two-Gun Kid. Originally the leader of a bandit gang defeated by Kod, he gained super speed from drinking an Indian shaman's potion, which enabled him to outdraw many of his opponents in a gun fight (first seen in Two-Gun Kid #70, 1964). He fought the Two-Gun Kid several times, but was ultimately defeated each time. Later, the time travelling West Coast Avengers battled Hurricane and the group of outlaws he belonged to; he battled Tigra, but was defeated along with his partner Rattler and taken into custody.[1]

In 1876, Kane was asked by an Indian medicineman, to whom he owned a favor, to escort an Indian woman named Little Cloud to the Apache.[2]

I grew up in a house with one in the front garden, I accidentally broke the plastic around the wire running up it with a football and BT somehow realise right away and wanted a fee for fixing it (not that I'm complaining about that, perfectly reasonable), luckily the bloke who came to fix it said don't worry about it, boys will be boys and all that, and we never heard of the charge again. 

My point is this: BT aren't being unhelpful. They legally own the pole and have every right to expect you to cover the cost of moving it (or in my case, fixing it.).

Why would they move it for free simply because someone is unhappy it's there? If they did that, they'd be moving things like no one's businesses with nimbyism.

false,ashmoran,null,null,"Restaurants give out a free option to dine called a ""reservation"". You pay nothing for this option, but it has value, because restaurants fill up at weekends and without one you might not be able to get a seat.

This site lets you take that free gift and resell it, so the value of the option became not just utility but monetary. Now people have an incentive to book tables they have no intention of using, in the hope they can resell it. So on any given weekend the stock of available tables will go down, restaurants will be booked by people merely profiteering. Some of these will be rebooked by people who a) find the site and b) are willing to pay extra. The others will go empty unless the restaurant fills them with people walking in off the street. (So now, reservations are serving the exact *opposite* purpose they're intended to!)

For the above reasons I think this is a bad idea as it (IMO) associates Bitcoin with a dubious, profiteering, use of money. (Bad for Bitcoin, not bad for the operators of sites like this.)

There's a solution, which hotels have already discovered. Hotels used to offer free reservations with the same downsides to their business, but now most offer 10% or so off if you pay upfront with no option for a refund. As Bitcoin makes it much easier to send money casually, when its use is widespread, restaurants could ask for a deposit and text an address to pay it to. Then the reservation would not be free, people would be less likely to make a reservation speculatively in the hope of selling it, and probably more people would attend reservations (even a nominal fee improves attendance at most events due to the sunk cost fallacy).

So while I say it's a bad idea, the lower transaction cost of Bitcoin means it may actually drive out a better solution in the end. That's the sort of thing I like Bitcoin for :)",0,1419717933,null,0,false,0,cn6uv5f,t3_2qjb58,t1_cn6uv5f,t3_2qjb58,null,1425191603,8,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,8

At this some kind of panic ensues and quiet discussion were to be had with managers.

When they came back they pointed to a box number (not serial - just a non descript number on the box) and said because box number was not the same as serial number on the we the card in my hand was full price.
I tried to explain this was a totally different reference and from that point on just got a broken record of 'sorry we can't help you'.

Alternatively, another post I read elsewhere speculated that the tangerine suddenly being there was similar to the spinning top in Inception. It wouldn't happen unless they were still in the dream at some level.

the irony is immeasurable..  the reason i buy online now is not price, but to *avoid* the bullshit from buying in a shop.  

  
i used to advise non technical people, not to seek the cheapest price online, but buy face to face - so that if something went wrong, you could sling it back over the counter rather than deal with dodgy email only support.  
  
Now the opposite is true.  Get it from Apple, or Dell or Amazon or whatever - because their on line in no hassle, and no quibble.  Avoid shops, because of the bullshit.

The same people on that thread still voice their concerns about how bad some of our players are and think they have some valid reasons why we should or shouldn't sign a player they think is good or bad. They always think they are right. Oh, Willian is just average player, Fabregas should be our number 10 and Oscar shouldn't be playing in that position, Mikel is rubbish and Ake is way better than him, Ramires is rubbish, Cahill is average defender, Koke and Reus would change our team etc. Jose knows what our team exactly needs. If we were to sign a player it will only because we need that player or because he will offer us something different. At the moment, we are playing well and our team look solid in every position. I don't understand why they think a player that is not among the very best in the world would come in and just change our team for the better. Don't get me wrong, I like Reus. But, he is an injury prone player and he surely won't offer us what players like Willian does for us. Tracking back and boasting the midfield. If Jose and those behind the transfer go for him or other players, then there is something they see in these players that we can't see. A good example is why Mikel has been here for all these years playing under different managers. He is surely better than what some fans on this sub think. He could even be starting for big teams in the league. Having a player like him on the bench give us protection.

However you need to know your rights and always buy items above £100 on a credit card though as if something fucks up, that's between them and the card company, not you. 

Amazon have the best return policy though. My two year old Bravia EX TV packed in and they refunded it instantly and collected it. Then I bought a different model from them. Zero problems.

Just to add, I only buy higher quality PCs (Lenovo ThinkPad) second hand from eBay and look after them myself.

Your laptop does include a recovery partition on the hard drive, this has been the case for many years. The backup USB is for when your hard drive fails and you can no longer access the recovery partition. 

Many laptops are ""pre set up"". This means that software has been installed ready for activation and the recovery USB is created. The standard charge is £35 but there is also a £45 and £55 option.

The employee is saying none of the ""new"" laptops are avaliable, only the pre set up, you are then given the option of purchasing it with the additional set up. If you decline you still need to cover the cost of the 32gb recovery USB (£10) as this has already been created and cannot be used with any other laptop. Alternatively the employee may be able to order you a ""new"" laptop.

I think non-EU immigration is already ridiculously over-controlled. Tier 1 general visas are now closed so you can only move here if you already have a job waiting for you (or you're an investor with millions). International students have been screwed over with the anti-immigration rhetoric as they now have little opportunity to work here after graduating, so the best students are choosing universities in other countries.

And that's before we get to the clusterfuck of spouse visas. A British citizen bringing their spouse to the UK has to go through a ton of conditions to get a visa for their spouse (must earn about £18k, must have held job for at least 6 months) while an EU citizen can bring their spouse straight with them under EU freedom of movement rules.

Store managers tend to be law-abiding in my experience, so I'd expect the manager to do a ""manager's special"" when you explained with a printout of the Act (linked in a previous post) to demonstrate that what he is doing is clearly illegal (and you could ask if head office knows about it if he still needs ""encouragement""). 

Be nice but firm, the law is on your side as they *are* breaking the law, and no reputable retail manager wants to seen breaking the law.  

If you act like an idiot they will treat you as one, so it's obviously best to behave in a reasonable manner, being polite and not shouting and swearing at staff/manager should be more than enough to arrange a mutually satisfactory conclusion, it's only 35 quid for the manager to write off, and you *can* show they are wrong, so he is likely to do so if you make it easy for him to.

As a Christmas gift tangerines have morphed from balls of gold (no pun intended) and these morphed from the original gift of three sacks of gold that St Nicolas (a real person who Santa Claus is based on) gave to the dowries of a poor man’s daughters to allow them a chance at a new life (or a second chance for the Doctor) through marriage (or Clara’s continued companionship with the Doctor).

Theory #2 - Alternatively, another post I read elsewhere speculated that the tangerine suddenly being there was similar to the spinning top in Inception. That meant that you were still in the dream at some level.

Theory #3 – Or the tangerine could represent the gift of a five day Doctor Who marathon. Also a good way for current and new fans to get caught up.

Edit: Sorry. Last theory. Too much time off and have now OD' on the DW marathon.

Theory #4 – Or the tangerine represents a comparison between the 12th Doctor giving a second chance to Clara and the 10th Doctor using the satsuma (AKA Satsuma mandarin/orange/tangerine or Christmas orange - Wiki) to deny a second chance to the alien he fought for the planet in his first full episode “Christmas Invasion”. That persona of the Doctor didn't give second chances.

If a GP genuinely cannot prescribe something (eg. isotretinoin/ Roaccutane) then they can't, again there is NHS policy. However some GPs hide behind formulary when they don't feel comfortable prescribing on their knowledge base. Might be wrong - not worked in pharmacy in many years - but I don't think spironolactone is blanket hospital only.

Some policies/ formularies are local to the Trust and some are national, IMO do some serious detective work. Can your GP definitely ONLY refer you to the one hospital or is that a practice decision (its cheaper)? Would another doctor in the same practice or a different practice in your catchment area give you a different answer? Individual GPs have different interests and knowledge bases. You have the right to see another GP or move practices.

NHS policy on referring to hospital dermatologists was pretty clear last time I looked, if you are scarring, not responding to treatment or your mental health is being affected you should be referred.

Sometimes they're fantastic and great fun, and some other times you get some odd people turning up. I've never had an awful experience though, which is good. It's just that some groups/events are more enjoyable than others. But yeah, there's definitely a lot going on on there if you keep an eye out.

 - You can also head over to **/r/R4R or /r/GBR4R** if you're looking for a specific someone for one-on-one attention as opposed to meeting a group/collective of people. Yes, a lot of the threads on there are people looking for hookups, but once every now and then you get some normal hang-out requests on there. I ^shamelessly keep an eye on those subs.

 - You might also fancy coming along to our next **Reddit meetup**. We've not had one in a while (Probably due to Christmas being a busy time for everyone) so I'm relatively sure one will crop up soon. Last one was quite a small one - around 12 people just chatting so it should be a decent experience even if you consider yourself quiet/shy. (We're all fucking awesome, honestly) ;D

 - Also, if you fancy it, **tell us a bit more about yourself**, what you would like to do, the kind of stuff you do in your spare time, places that you enjoy... etc. There's always someone else who shares your interest and would be able to point you in the right direction, but it's hard for people to gauge it when we don't know your preferences.

 - I get the bit about being introverted: Clubs can be quite an overwhelming experience, but how about pubs? Even if you're not a drinker - Just sitting down with a lemonade is always enjoyable. :) We have some **fantastic pubs in BS1**, especially around Corn Street and the harbour-side.

 - Feel free, if you want to, to mention where you work or live, in which case we can give you more localised recommendations.

I'm not exactly a social connoisseur but you're very welcome to PM me if you have any follow-on questions. :)",0,1419727378,null,0,false,0,cn6yuue,t3_2qkpbr,t1_cn6yuue,t3_2qkpbr,null,1425189740,13,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,13

The blue cup. The out of place blue cup waved around by Santa has meaning in dream lore. A cup denotes exposing hidden secrets, which both the Doctor and Clara did. Blue represents distress or a calamity, which there was, and maybe waiting for them in the future.

And if you really want to stretch it, a filled cup in a dream represents a pregnant woman, and if emptied in a dream means she will give birth. Santa had a filled cup and drank from it / emptied it. Dream lore doesn't specify who has to hold the cup. But I’m way over-thinking this being used as a hint. If it was deliberate it might be there as a misdirection.

Bring Mikel in and give Fabregas a bit of a break, adds a little bit more grit to midfield and will help break up play, plus Cesc has played a tonne of games of late.

I definitely wouldn't buy a computer online and then have to go and collect it after ordering online -[that's not how it works](http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/2791433.jpg)...

If you buy online, you're never quite sure what you'll get, have little or no chance of tech support if there *are* problems; but you get it cheap enough to overlook those shortcomings.

If you go to a store, you pay more but get what *you* want, *not* what they need to get off the shelf, if they can't supply what you want, you go to a different store and don't re-visit stores that don't care about their customers needs.

As I've said I've never had problems like OP's above, but I'd not buy anything from a website only to have to go and pick it up later (and discover *then* it's not what I ordered and I'm expected to have to pay more for something I don't want/won't use) either.

Most stores will setup part of their stock allocation (especially promo machines) with Walk Out Working systems.

The recovery partition should not be deleted in these WoW systems.

The USB recovery drive is in addition to the HDD recovery partition.  And yes if there are no pristine machines left, then the £35 charge for a Walk Out Working is reduced to £10 (via a customer offer) and then discounted down to £0, effectively meaning that there is no charge for the customer, and it keeps the store stock systems correct (as the 32GB USB drive is a stock item).

So just to clarify in case not clear.


USB Recovery Drives are in addition to the HDD/SSD Recovery Partition, the pre-installed Recovery Partition is not removed.

If there are no more pristine machines left, and the customer does not want to purchase the Setup service, then they should be given the option of purchasing the setup machine with the 32GB recovery USB at no charge.

false,Monztaa,lfcwfmm,,"People, in real life coaching, defensive coaches don't exist. And I'll give you an anology of why they don't.

Everyone here would like a mould of Hyypia or a Carragher. But what they don't realise is that 1) Being a great player doesn't make you a good coach, as in the case of Hyypia who was sacked recently and 2) Carragher talks a good game, but in reality, a person who holds a UEFA B license could do just as good an analysis if not better.

What people fail to realise it transitition. And transition from defence to attack. A simple way is this. Say we brought in Hyypia to coach defense. He would 'hypothetically' say to Markovic and Henderson 'Guys, don't go to far forward, we need you to track back and form the 5 man defense'. Rodgers would say 'No, I want to attack and my system and set plays are based on the wings, so you need to go forward'. You see, this is a very very basic idea of what would happen. There would be disagreements on how to play. 

There are no 'defensive coaches'. Like I've mentioned before, if they did exist then I'm pretty sure every club in the world, including Madrid and Barca, Bayern and Dortmund, Man Utd and Man City, would have one. 

This is coming from personal experience. I once coached at a team where I was responsible for the defending and another coach for the attacking. From a naturally defensive coach, I wanted my team that I was coaching to drop off and defend from the 18 yard box and out, whilst the attacking coach wanted to hold the line and press. I wanted to play on the counter. The attacking coach wanted to keep the ball.

Do you see the problem now guys? It's about being in sync with one another. You'll have to be incredibly lucky to find a coach which not only understands how you want the team to play, but also PREFERS the team to play like that. And what I mean by that is that the defensive coach has to understand the attacking play and vice versa. It's incredibly lucky if you find coaches like that. Simply put, they don't exist. And one way of seeing this is seeing Liverpool under Dalglish. Steve Clarke did the coaching for that team. And that team went through the patch of hitting the post 32 odd times. That wasn't purely down to being unlucky, it was down to Steve Clarke coaching the attacking aspect of our game.

The OP mentioned that we don't coach defending a lot. I can see that. I don't think we practice set piece defending a lot if not at all. I think Rodgers just tells Skrtel to mark this guy and Sakho to mark him etc... Tommy Smith once said that Liverpool never practiced a set-piece under Shanks or Paisley. I don't think Barcelona did much practice on it under Guardiola and Vilanova.

Popular opinions will get upvoted initially, driving more people to post things along a similar lines in future threads because they saw the upvotes and came to the conclusion it was the ""right answer"". Similarly those comments get upvoted more as it becomes the consensus. And people don't want to comment otherwise because they know or at least expect it'll just get downvoted to oblivion. 

Occasionally you get the anti-circlejerk ""I know I'm going to get downvoted but &lt;insert apparently-but-not-actually-unpopular opinion here&gt;"" posts that potentially swing things the other way. But in general people don't want to say things if they feel that the general population is just going to use the downvote button to collectively brandish them an idiot. 

Also discussion threads tend to rarely make it into the top 5-10 on the front page as they're pushed out by fluff content like image macros or vines or instagram photos that only takes 3 seconds to look at. And articles get judged and upvoted more by the title than by the actual content within the article itself.

He missed the perception filter hiding prisoner zero. He was ravenously hungry (although very picky). He was often seen keeling over and complaining about not being done yet. 

However, none of these compare to the emotional fever he was exhibiting. The Doctor goes through the eleventh hour like someone is holding a fire to his butt, always running around and throwing him self into every and all problems that present themselves. As soon as the day is saved and he runs away to the moon and back he is instantly mellowed out. 

While ten's regeneration may have hit him hardest physically, eleven's was roughest on him mentally.

To go behind the curtain though we have to look at the state of the show in all your examples.

When Tennent took over as The Doctor this was the first time most viewers had ever seen a regeneration. This is a huge change that many viewers (myself included) had a difficult time accepting. The Doctor had changed BUT Rose was still there. Billie Piper was the thread between the two series, so what does RTD do in order to help the viewers adjust? He puts the Doctor out of commission and we have almost a whole episode of Rose easing us into the idea of a new Doctor, showing us that he is still the same man deep down. 

Eleventh Hour was unique in that it had both a new Doctor and a new companion. We need the Doctor to help ease us into a new companion just like we need a companion to ease us into a new Doctor, so whats a show to do if both are being introduced to us for the first time? We're shown both these characters within the first 30 seconds, first individually then together. They are both shown getting to know each other and this is also US getting to know them. If you have the Doctor be bed ridden for any of this episode then there is no one to answer ""Who are you Doctor?"" and no one to ask ""Who are you companion?""

Deep Breath you see these formulas again. The Doctor returns to Vastra, Jenny, and Strax - familiar faces for the audience since even Clara has only half a series of familiarity. He is then put to sleep so that Clara, the companion, and our connection into this world - has time to voice our concerns over a new Doctor (and one that is OLD!). The Doctor is incapacitated *just enough* to help us get eased into the idea of a new face.

So you see, the ""useless"" Doctor is just a very clever way for the writers to help the audience adjust to a major show change. I don't think your even going to get, say, an episode where the Doctor sits down and says ""Yes, well I was mostly fine one regeneration because I wore my special regeneration pants that day.""

I, in between my last post and this one took a test that showed that I have less ability to perceive contrast than a healthy person. My outlook, my vision, my truth is literally distorted. I was unaware I was unable to see contrast, and had for a while assumed that all of my screen's contrast settings weren't working.

Right well I went to a non-religious school that let anyone in and didn't have a particular push towards any religion. It's not on your little list. Maybe consider things have changed.

&gt;At the end of the day here, you weren't there when the English were killing millions of people and neither was anyone else alive today. 

You don't get the idea of history affecting the future and the shaping of a country do you? You also outright ignored the rest of what I said, you can sit and pretend that the Troubles were caused by ignorant evil people but it just shows you to be a fool.

&gt;What I meant by this is that when a child is born in either family, when it's sitting there in a cradle, what's the difference? It's not until it grows up and has all this hate poured into it's head by people who refuse to let it go around them, people who likely have never been personally wronged by anyone from 'the other side', that they turn into the exact same thing. 

You're from a decent, well off family aren't you? Cause from that it seems pretty clear you've never dealt with being poorer than the rest of your class and wearing shittier boots to football cause your Dads a taig so he could only get the shitty dock job cause when he was a kid Catholic education was bollocks for a lot of the country. Also for the record i'm Protestant and this is nothing like my life, but you have to be able to see how the past shapes the present right?

&gt;Few people in this country have the courage to turn around and say ""this is nothing to do with me and I will not take part in this anymore"". Instead we have this perpetuation of tribalism even when the justification for it slips away from living memory.

Yeah no most of us do actually. That's why the Troubles ended and we're so close to full peace. Again you seem so out of touch with the country...

&gt;I have more family members who have been killed by cancer than died in the Troubles. I'd wager the same is true for virtually everyone reading this. When are we going to put this aside? It is now 2014.

Yeah but Cancer isn't living across the street and Cancer didn't get off on killing your Mum with a car bomb to try and make a point and Cancer isn't your local MP and Cancer doesn't get to live the rest of his life out of jail because some politicians decided so whilst you're cousin is blind from the shooting. I mean it's 2014 right, when are we getting justice? Ignorant moron.

&gt;Maybe you just didn't grow up in the thick of it.

I'm in the thick of it right now, you on the other hand don't even live here anymore and have shown time and time again to be incredible out of touch with the country.

&gt;I don't feel religion has any place in education. There's nothing more to it than that.

You don't get a say in privately run schools that parents pay and choose to send their kids to and in turn they don't get a say in public ones that parents don't choose to send their kids to.

&gt;Come on. Anyone is free to start a political party, but they wouldn't get any votes because everyone is too busy voting for what might as well be their football team.

Again NI21. Again people vote to keep the people that will represent their main interest.

&gt;So, tribalism. Which was my entire point. I don't want to live in a country where this is what people think like, so I don't.

Recently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a ‘bait-and-switch’ strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.  

Three to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry’s PC World website for collection in Hove. However, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the ‘regular’ laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been “set-up” – the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick. We were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.  

After refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25. We again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35. At this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.  

Now, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry’s PC World in Derby. The price of this laptop was £499. Yet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no ‘regular’ versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop. We declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 – not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at. We then decided to leave the store.  

These tactics are being employed by Curry’s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this – especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP. This poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.

He's been one of the few bright spots for West Brom this year. He's of a different mold than Soldado which adds more dimensions to the striker corps. He can be a nice energy plug as backup for Kane. I think Berahino fits perfectly the young, high-potential players Spurs like to target over the past few years.

I give a thumbs down on Moisander. Is it because Chiriches is on the transfer table and we just LOVE Ajax players? Vertonghen and Fazio is our starting CBs for the indefinite future, so it's not like Moisander will come into add something new to the starting XI. As for backups, we have Kaboul the captain and the young and talented Eric Dier. Bringing a 29-year old center back who's been largely above-average in a defensively abysmal league is only going to take playing time away from Dier, who I really think can be fantastic for Spurs in a few years. 

I'm very mehhhh on Bernard. I never saw his small frame which relies so much on quickness to translate well in the Premier League. But then again, Aaron Lennon is about his size and he's the longest-tenured Spur. And let's not forget Santi Cazorla, Leon Britton, and Philippe Coutinho are established Premier Leaguers too, so what the hell do I know?

Be extremely careful buying electronics from Dixons Carphone companies. 

All add-ons are ripoffs, all staff are trained from the start to take advantage of buyers to flog add-ons.

Stock is treated badly. Stock is opened, used for demo and even personal use by employees, then repackaged and sold as new. Dropped and damaged stock is sold normally, it's very hard to get a discount due to it. It was commonplace for us to sell display items as new. IIRC this is illegal.

Bait-and-switch is used regularly, and recommended by management. 

We were forced to use opt-out for 'free' extras, like a 'free' trial of Daily Mail Online which actually added to the price, without any consent or knowledge by the customer. This is probably illegal.

If you spoke out against management, you were fired.

We were judged solely on sales of add-ons only. I was fired for refusing to push add-ons such as insurance, 'careplans', cloud storage (which is less storage than Google Drive and is not free), and suggesting customers do not use Curry's suggested software, instead installing similar free software (I refused to sell a care plan, storage, setup, software and so on to a vulnerable old man, which would have almost doubled the cost of his purchase).

Prices are cheap, but please do a full inspection of the goods before purchase. Do not buy the other shit they offer. You guys all know that instead of AVG/Avast/Norton/McAfee, you could use MS Essentials, instead of Office 365, use OpenOffice and so on.

I ran a department with no training or prior management experience whatsoever (other than online shit) after only 5 months of employment.

'Reserved' items are not reserved. They come through on a list every few hours, and might be put aside if you're lucky. It's fairly likely that you'll reserve an item, come to get it, and find it's been sold.

They also don't know how to run a company, often completely paying the wrong amount, fuck up the rota, poor training.

Due to these reasons, around 80% of the permenant staff employed during my time there resigned very early.

Maybe my store was shit, but Dixons is shit in general so I'd take no chances.

why? because we are a team that focuses on playing a complete team game, with everyone doing equal contribution. Its hard for a single player to shine in Chelsea and the fact that Hazard is shining is very fucking impressive, but hes not gonna be able to shine to the point of winning a Ballon D'or unless he plays in a team like Madrid or Barca where much of the team is built around a single player.

Someone else on this sub broke down eden's situation in Chelsea brilliantly and im probably doing a shit job at it, but just pay attention to how much defensive work Eden is doing. Chelsea is a hard working and disciplined team, everyone has a significant role, but none bigger than the other. 

There are obviously exceptions to all this, but this is how I see it. If Mourinho stays and Chelsea continue to play the same way with the same philosophy, we probably wont have a player to win the ballon d'or in a long time, because even if our players are really fucking good, much of their work is unnapreciated compared to the flashy and superb skill and goalscoring ability of someone like Neymar and Bale. Thats just how it is. 

If Matic becomes the best player in the world *at what he does* (he arguably is), he will never win the ballon d'or because its just not as ""impressive looking"" as what Bale or Neymar do.. even if Matic is doing his job perfectly. 

Its why im so impressed with Hazard, because he still manages to shine and play amazing despite the smaller focus he gets on the team.

This hardly ever gets talked about but it isn't like Willian and Hazard play alongside Costa, they all three play fluidly behind him, it is what makes them so dangerous in combination with Fabregas and Matic and the ability of Ivan to come forward. But tactics and use of play is less exciting and more difficult to discuss than ""should we spend to buy (big name)."" This is why I believe Schurrle is so good off the bench for this team, and Willian fits so well in the starting 11. Schurrle is much more a forward than Willian and while he is great at it, sometimes it can seem to, for lack of a better word, scramble the build up chemistry of the attacking midfielders. This is in no way an indictment of Schurrle, just more of my observation as to how he fits into this squad at this specific time.

edit: It is all about how he is used, and the way each player individually plays. Willian, while not having the finishing touch of Schurrle, is right now a much more versatile player, a lot of that comes down to his experience.

So, to me, he sometimes makes decisions that would be considered morally wrong, but he knows that he has to do it or else worse things will happen, makes those choices for the ""greater good"".
