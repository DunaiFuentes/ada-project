The 22-year-old joined Rovers on a one-month loan deal last month with fellow strikers Theo Robinson out through injury and Billy Sharp serving a three match suspension.

Bowery has made three appearances for Rovers since his arrival and he is due to return to Villa Park after the midweek game with Watford next week but Dickov wants to keep hold of the striker. ""We are going to speak with Aston Villa next week,"" Dickov told BBC Radio Sheffield.

""Jordan has come in and he has done well and I believe he will get better the longer he is with us.""

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert concedes that winger Charles N'Zogbia is unlikely to feature this season due to an Achilles injury.

The Frenchman picked up the problem while on a run in pre-season and his boss had hoped that he might return by the end of the campaign.

However, the Scot revealed that the chances of seeing the 27-year-old in action before May are looking increasingly unlikely, although, in more encouraging news, defender Jores Okore is back in light training after his ruptured knee ligament and could return this season.

""He's still doing rehab,"" Lambert told The Birmingham Mail of N'Zogbia. ""Charles's injury is probably worse than Jores Okore's was and that's disappointing.

""It will be a big ask for Charles to come back this season because he's not had many games at all and that Achilles heel, as everybody knows, is a major issue.""",0,1394148688,null,0,false,0,cfw98ex,t3_1zrhfr,t1_cfw98ex,t3_1zrhfr,null,1432690213,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

No. It's the low-skilled, low payed jobs and deep down they know that. Because they know that immigrating people from the poorer nations of the world; where they are uneducated, not able to speak fluent english, not understanding of UK law, they're easy to manipulate into a workforce you can pay half the cost for. They don't want to change that, cheap products stay on our shelves, cheap services left.

Have you seen how immigrants live though? They have no idea of the cultures of Britain, they have to have their children speak broken english just to speak to landlords and other Brits, they barely maintain a living wage to survive on without extra government welfare incentives. But the elites and politicians know this, they can hide behind the concepts of racism and discrimination to hand wave any of those problems away.

It's the greatest scam on working class natives AND immigrants ever. It's a vicious cycle constantly perpetuated by higher class politicians and elites. And it isn't going to stop anytime soon.

[Also OED definition. ](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chav?q=chav)

Chav as an insult is predominantly aimed at working class people, that is undeniable. Academic books have been written on the topic of the word chav and its use to dismiss working class social problems. It's not politics, its just what the word has always meant. 

Honestly I don't care that much it just annoys me that people are denying that the insult has power because its rooted in class. Its like throwing the word 'nigger' or 'faggot' around (although not as insulting) and denying that the words have primarily racist or homophobic roots and uses.

I know some people in their early 20s who work in Central London, but commute in from their parents' homes out in places like Marlow, High Wycombe, Rickmansworth, far flung north London etc.

It's not a lot of fun for them.  In your early 20s you should be able to just go out for drinks after work and let the night develop without giving it a second thought, but these people can't, not to mention the money they save on living expenses gets reamed by the rail companies.  Even the people living in Zone 2 and 3 have to stop and think about when their Tube is.

Poor infrastructure often means that, depending on location, a journey over a shorter distance can take more time than one over a longer distance.  I've got a friend in Colchester who can get into central London only 10 minutes slower than his friend in Southgate, north London.  That's just ridiculous.

My opinion is that they wasted a fantastic idea that a kid thought up, just for that one episode and to barely be mentioned ever again. There's also the unexciting feel of the episode, and how it tried to have the whatever-the-hell-it-was-called as a comical alien, which backfired horribly.
It was unfunny, unpleasant to look at, and used entirely practical effects, which in comparison to how much is done with computers, felt very cheap and low-budget. HOWEVER... the concept of that monster is a great idea, but it's just a shame that the terms for the competition it spawned from meant it would only appear once, and since then it's like it never even existed as a species.

Another thing I could point out is that the Doctor was hardly in the episode, but you could argue the same flaw with Blink. What made Blink good was how the doctor tied in with it, as opposed to being totally separate. On top of this, there's the main monster being such a terrifying creature, combined with two ordinary people that had no clue what it was, or how to deal with it.

true,dude2dudette,null,null,"I love Community, it may be one of my favourite comedy shows currently running. Despite that, I can't say I agree with you that it is littered with failures. Much like Scrubs, whilst it may appear that there are small failings in each character, they still fill the roles that Fry points out here - that they all have these witty one-liners (especially Jeff). These characters just often deliver these one-liners in a way that you aren't used to hearing, which is what makes it so great. For example, Troy says so little throughout his time on the show, yet he still remains consistently my favourite character, because each line he says is a joke in some way, or a lead up to a joke for Abed/Britta/Pierce/Annie or Jeff (though for less often Shirly, whose one-liners come in the form of muttering something passive-aggressive under her breath or talking about Jesus. The show is fabulous because it is a constant parody of everything that is American sitcoms whilst also going above and beyond to be (in the words of the show itself) ""meta"".

I don't think he was insinuating that any one type of comedy was intrinsically better than the other, considering both appeal to their audience and are able to make them laugh. I think he was just pointing out that there IS a difference, and that it may be to do with a difference in cultures. For example, a show like Peep Show or The Inbetweeners (yes, I mean the UK version) just couldn't have been made in the US, because it plays on the exact type of comedy that Fry highlights as unmistakably English. The only American show I can think of where the humour is more of this nature is Malcolm in the Middle. That was my favourite show for a good long time, because it was so brilliant at mixing English humour and American humour. It's no surprise that it managed to survive so long and make people on both sides of the Pond love it.

Majority of his goals in his pool days were that.  He doesn't have technical skills, his shot accuracy was below that almost all world class strikers, couldn't hold up the ball, and couldn't dribble to save his life.

He had one world class skill with his acceleration and lost it with his injury.  I never rated him from the start because I just don't rate players with a lack of technique.  Why when he lost his one skill, he couldn't contribute anything else and was a total waste of space.  But even I didn't expect him to do so badly as he has done.

Last few years he try to change his game.

I don't think he's pairing extrovert with confidence, as we all know that isn't the case. 

I'm extrovert around people and my girlfriend is introvert. Introverts aren't unconfident  - they're great listeners. They process what's going on around them more than they interact. It can be very taxing for them to be in a room full of louder people vying for attention and they can feel a little left out as they're often ignored in an extrovert melee. 

OP, as much as I hate the word, being ""proactive"" is the key to building friendships. You may have to step outside your comfort zone a bit to reap rewards. You don't have to act extrovert in anyway but do try interacting and being the first to introduce yourself. You'll get there eventually. 


Also, try hitting the gym. Solitary to begin with and you can network slowly over time while you're there. Ask for a spot from people and go from there. Far more introverts go to the gym than you'd think.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"There are over 6000 cooperatives with more than 16 million members in the UK, many of which are genuine worker-run cooperatives, and the numbers are growing.  Yes, the Cooperative Bank ran into serious trouble (although it's not a cooperative, rather owned by one - the Cooperative Group), made some seriously bad decisions, and displayed some highly questionable ethics; however, we don't condemn capitalism on the basis of one firm's failure, and we should apply the same standards here.  Broadly, and again with exceptions, cooperatives globally have done better than average, often considerably better than average since the financial crisis - both in terms of surviving (and their survival rates generally are better than capitalist firms), and in terms of how gracefully they've handled failure and the need to reorganise, reduce staffing etc.

However, you're undoubtedly correct that capitalist markets provide a hostile climate for worker self-directed enterprises, particularly in regards to access to capital, the requirements for growth and expansion to fend off competition, and the highly partisan legal system which disadvantages coops in many ways compared to capitalist corporations.  Imagine if there was a traffic light system of labelling for products and services as to whether the companies which offered them were democratically controlled or not! ;-)

It can be done, it has been done, the largest example in Europe is the Mondragon Corporation which has over 80,000 workers and is one of Spain's bigger employers, but even this company has been driven to employ traditionally capitalist mechanisms outside of Spain to compete in international markets (though they do appear to be addressing some of the criticisms).

A lot of people seem to think the Cable means ""Teachers don't work hard"" or  ""teachers don't know how easy their job is "" and there's a lot of replies in here about how they actually work very hard. Now I'm not disputing that, my wife is a teacher and she works very hard, often very late to prepare good lessons to engage the pupils - but I also think that's not the point. 

What I think Cable means is ""teachers know nothing about industry "" which is not related to their work ethic but to their experience and there could be spme truth in there. A lot of teachers don't have industry experience and so if a child is interested in a particular profession the teacher won't be able to advise them as well as someone who has actually worked in that profession. 

On top of that, people tend to think everyone else is like ourselves and so they should do what we want to do. So someone who has been to university is more likely to encourage a pupil to go to university. 

Some generalisations in there, I agree.

This is almost certainly the fault of the current and previous governments because they've pushed more and more people to uni every year and only know are they realising we need people to make things in order to have a strong export industry , which in general means apprenticeships not graduates.

No matter who's fault it is to my mind there is a grain of truth and a problem to be solved.

This is not correct either. Banks are not idiots. The top level executives are the ones who devise the bank strategy and direction. Trades are done based on these strategies on a daily basis.

&gt;Here, for what it is worth, is mine. The original schools of Islamic jurisprudence, which arose in the wake of the Prophet's reign in Medina, permitted jurists to adapt the law to the changing needs of society, by a process of reflection known as ijtihad, or effort. But this seems to have been brought to an end during the 8th Century, when it was maintained by the then dominant theological school that all important matters had been settled and that the ""gate of ijtihad is closed"".

&gt;**Trying to introduce Sharia today therefore runs the risk of imposing on people a system of law designed for the government of a long since vanished community and unable to adapt to the changing circumstances of human life**. To put the point in a nutshell - secular law adapts, religious law merely endures.

&gt;**Moreover, precisely because Sharia has not adapted, nobody really knows what it says**. Does it tell us to stone adulterers to death? Some say yes, some say no. Does it tell us that investing money at interest is in every case forbidden? Some say yes, some say no.

&gt;**When God makes the laws, the laws become as mysterious as God is. When we make the laws, and make them for our purposes, we can be certain what they mean**. The only question then is ""who are we?"" What way of defining ourselves reconciles democratic elections with real opposition and individual rights?

Awarding people with shares whose value is currently depressed means that the recipient gets more in terms of long-term value than is actually accounted for.  (This isn't a problem in general.  The issue in this sense is that because of state support the bank's long-term health is pretty much a one way bet.)

true,simAlity,amy,Amy,"I do have a couple of questions but first some feedback:


I downloaded the game earlier this week and have played almost compulsively as well.  And while I disagree with Skullpuck on a couple of points (namely micro-transactions and character drops) I do agree that the game has started to feel like a grind.  

Here's why:

* There is no roadmap; no indication of how far I am into the season and no indication of how much farther until season six.  Several times I have thought, ""Okay, now this has got to be the last level of the season."" only to be presented with yet another level.  At this time I'm at ""Time Attack: Robots"".
* Nor is there much of a story line.  A little snippet of plot/dialogue after each level would go a long way towards keeping me engaged.  
* The levels aren't getting much harder but they are getting longer, and to me at least it feels like more of the same every time.  I've seen all the tricks the enemies can pull and none of them have really impressed me or made me thing, ""shit, how am I going to get around THAT?"".

I do appreciate the lack of ""energy"" requirements which allow me to play as many times as I like, and I've also enjoyed building a good team of characters.  However it took me a long time to find an ordinary character empowered by blue gems.  This prevented me from being able to really experiment with either the tenth or sixth doctor.  Then when I finally got Angie it took me a while to get her ""juiced"" up so that she could hold her own against the higher level enemies.  Not that it wasn't worth the effort.  I still haven't gotten a stand-in for Porridge though which kinda sucks since I have maxed Porridge out.  I've played Riddle's level a few times but still haven't gotten the character to drop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, for some questions:  Where do I get heart tokens?  Like I said I have maxed Porridge out but I still haven't seen any levels that even offer heart tokens which prevents me from increasing his rank.  

Why is Brian empowered by yellow gems when his son is a red character?  It would make more sense (to me, at least) for Brian to have the ability to bolster his son's gem power.

Thirdly, if that is a by-product or consequence of more ethical animal treatment then again it's an overall positive result.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think the difference here is that, for example, in Always Sunny (and to a greater extent, Seinfeld) the characters do bad things, are in bad situations and don't care about the people around them. But their situation doesn't get worse. 

With the exception of Frank Reynolds in Always Sunny, characters who should have been in jail or a mental health institution by the end of season 1 are *still* running the bar and still earning money and it's sorta OK for them.

It is the characters they interact with whose lives are ruined. There's Frank, whose introduction in a smart suit with lots of money quickly turns him into a naked hobo birthing himself from the folds of a slimy couch. And Rickety Cricket, who begins his lot as a well respected priest, and ends up a homeless bum with a skin infection and a missing leg. And so on.

Compare that to Fawlty Towers. The characters are just as myopic, just as bad to those around them. And their situation is broadly the same. But things get *worse* for them. They go from bad to worse noticeably, and this is a trend in British sitcoms. Not just in the broader continuity, but within the episodes themselves.

This might have something to do with the length of American shows (you can only fall so far if you need to stretch out a season to 20+ episodes). But I think it has to do with the underlying comedy as well.

The best American comedy deconstructs this effect by looking at just how weird it is for so many of their characters to end up exactly where they started. Nothing really happens to them, despite the fact that it should. The overarching premise of Seinfeld was 'no hugging, no learning'. Until the very last episode, which itself steps outside and comments on this issue, these horrible, borderline sociopathic people had ruined the lives of *others*, instead of their own. Whereas in Blackadder and The Office, it is the characters themselves who are undone by their own hand.

The reason these bonuses get so much flak is because we all know that the business the bankers did this year could very easily be the crisis next year.

As for share bonuses, that rewards the people who contribute less to the company value than others, it only slightly extends the accountability of the bonus and often is massive - so will make them money no matter what. They can also keep these shares untill the price rebounds anyway.

Not a whole lot of point in this. If someone has gone to the trouble to use their own router, chances are its pretty decent and configured properly and thus doesn't expose any control panels on its WAN interface.

Also, it hasn't been confirmed whether the wireless interface of the superhub actually still comes up in modem mode.

&gt;It may be possible to repeatedly reboot the superhub and use multiple 7 second windows to crack your wi-fi router.

Don't believe so. If the wifi interface is down the reboot attack has no target. Unless you mean keep rebooting iteratively after you have hit the first window.

&gt;Unix enthusiasts have a history of holding ""time_t parties"" to celebrate significant values of the Unix time number.   These are directly analogous to the [new year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_year) celebrations that occur at the change of year in many calendars. As the use of Unix time has spread, so has the practice of celebrating its milestones. Usually it is time values that are round numbers in [decimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) that are celebrated, following the Unix convention of viewing time_t values in decimal. Among some groups round [binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system) numbers are also celebrated, such as +2^30 which occurred at 13:37:04 UTC on 10 January 2004.

1) Second or third generation of migrants who mass migrated in the 70s and 80s.

2) Illegal immigrants. Illegal immigration from the South Asia was rampant during the 90s. They gain legal status after living here for 10 years or more (the rules keep changing; I think its 13 years right now). 

3) Legal migrants who were married to first or second generation of migrants that I mentioned earlier. This is very common with South Asian migrants because most just refuse to marry here. They will still get married from their home country. IMHO, this trend has gone on for far too long and is actually a big cultural problem for Britain. This needs to go away. The rules for their legalization have been made a lot more strict in recent years.

The 15% figure that I mentioned in my original comment was part of the official figure back from 2010/11 (I can find citation if you need but a quick googling goes a long way). In my personal observation most unskilled labour in Britian, these days is EU migrants, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania and Poland. 

The main point that I was trying to make is that it is absolutely impossible for an unskilled non-EU migrant to enter Britain for work legally. There are no legal channels other than getting married to a British national. Even the routes for highly skilled labour have been mostly closed for the good part of the recession and will probably remain that way until we see some significant growth in the economy.

There are children leaving primary school who struggle to read or write, yet this curriculum expects them to be able to write software and make requests to internet services for data. 

I'm not against this kind of curriculum, but doing so in primary school where the pupils really only have a basic understanding of maths is pretty much a waste of time, which only a very few children will really be able to grasp.

true,IlliniQuant,null,null,"No offense to my fellow redditors, but what a bunch of unhelpful ""tips"".  Here are a few things you might actually find helpful.

* Have a pint and pie.  It's the proper English thing to do at football.  For all the crap that English food gets, a proper meat pie is a thing of beauty and shits all over the american pot pie. But don't do it at the Bridge, because the food there is uniformly terrible.  More on that in a bit.

* Fulham Broadway is a complete zoo on gamedays.  Now, you might want to experience a proper football crowd, but you've seen one crowd you've seen them all.  A much better way of getting to the Bridge, AND ESPECIALLY LEAVING AFTER THE GAME IMO is to take the tube to Earl's Court instead and walk through Brompton Cemetary (DO NOT PISS ON THE GRAVES!) - https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Earl's+Court+Station,+224-236+Earls+Court+Road+W.8,+London+SW5+9QA,+United+Kingdom/Chelsea+FC,+Stamford+Bridge,+Fulham+Rd,+London+SW6+1HS,+United+Kingdom/@51.4867692,-0.1917652,16z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x48760f8b6f5e8a11:0xbd3f258f6a313811!2m2!1d-0.193094!2d51.492148!3m4!1m2!1d-0.19109!2d51.4852276!3s0x48760f88fb14be1b:0x31efcd6db685e283!1m5!1m1!1s0x48760f864b8f35b1:0xde11790c6befd21e!2m2!1d-0.190973!2d51.481623!3e2  plenty of people will be doing that one, or if you fancy a bit of a walk, take the tube to South Kensington and walk down Fulham Road to the Stadium. 
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/South+Kensington,+United+Kingdom/Chelsea+FC,+Stamford+Bridge,+Fulham+Rd,+London+SW6+1HS,+United+Kingdom/@51.4871023,-0.191448,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x487605429cf5afd1:0xfef74f40edb435de!2m2!1d-0.17411!2d51.49409!1m5!1m1!1s0x48760f864b8f35b1:0xde11790c6befd21e!2m2!1d-0.190973!2d51.481623!3e2

* But you shouldn't do any of that anyway, because what you really should do is get there way early and spend a few hours at a pub watching the earlier games.  Don't go to any pubs at the Bridge, they're overly posh and have no atmosphere, and the pubs right around aren't great either.  My favorite is The Sporting Page which has a great pie (PIE ALERT) and a great variety of hand-pulled ales.
https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Sporting+Page/@51.4845963,-0.1793638,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48760564e7549303:0x12d85e449ceadf7e
It's a great place to watch the earlier matches, and it's a real neighborhood place with nice people.  But you probably won't be able to get a table.  They all get reserved ahead of time on match days.

* While Tottenham supporters are separated from Chelsea supporters in the stadium, you'll see plenty walking outside the stadium. Don't tell every one of them to fuck themselves, no one does that really.

* Don't be the guy who is taking pictures (especially with your iPad) during live action.  Seriously, just don't.  Watch the game and enjoy it.  You don't want to miss something exciting because you're putzing around with your camera.  Also, in the unlikely event Spurs score, don't be the guy taking a picture of them celebrating unless you want to be branded as that tourist.

* Buy a matchday programme.  It's a great keepsake.  I was too cheap to buy one from the first game I went to and I still regret it.  And keep your ticket stub for the same reason.

* Depending on where you sit, the tolerance to standing might differ.  I found that it's easier to stand in the Shed than it is the West or East stands.

The programs were written on coding sheets which were sent off where they were copied onto punched cards and then run through the borough computer. A week later, we would receive the coding sheet, the punched cards and the printout on piano paper. That was 1974. Since then, I've written many computer programs and been one of the writers for many years of the helpdesk section of a computer magazine sold internationally (and much more computer-related stuff as well including writing about computer security).

In the 2000s, I was horrified when my daughter did what had become the replacement for computer studies which was ICT - basically just learning how to use Microsoft products. This had taken an opportunity for people to learn how to read and write (which is what my computer studies effectively was) and replaced it with a scheme whereby people were only taught how to read - writing was nowhere to be seen. Imagine if English was taught in such a way that nobody was taught how to write.

Unfortunately, thanks to the foetid embrace between the designers of the ICT course and the likes of Microsoft, when it comes to program writing, we have skipped a generation in the UK, leaving a generation of teachers who themselves, don't yet have the ability to write computer programs.

Now, they have woken up and realised that unless we start teaching people how to write as well as read, we are going to be up to our arses in alligators - the swamp has pretty much drained.

What will happen is you will open the account and everything will be groovy until you start receiving funds from compromised bank accounts.

Then they'll launch an investigation into what you are actually doing, baulk at the money laundering opportunities your business gives criminals and then close your account since the profit they make from you will be negligible to the potential fines you could cost them.

In 10-20 years time, when we actually have decent internet, everyone will wonder how absurd it was that people allowed their viewing habits to be dictated by someone else's broadcasting schedule. People will watch what they want, when they want.

The BBC needs to stop thinking itself as a broadcaster, but as a media creator. 

It's role needs to be redefined. Or at least clarified. It should exist to do the stuff that independent television, driven by advertisers and tight margins, is unable to do. It should stop doing stuff that independent broadcasters can do just as well - e.g. there's no real rational for it to exist as a sports broadcaster. 

It should champion, create and redefine British culture - not just the white upper class culture that is still over-represented, but all British culture. 

It should stop trying to do stuff that can be done just as well by commercial rivals. 

It should create high quality programs. There's practically nothing made in Britain that matches the sort of quality seen on HBO. Quality is more important than quantity.

It should stop trying to play by the capitalist rules of it's rivals, and fully embrace the possibilities of digital technology - in particular the economies of scale that it offers. The aim should be to out-compete our American rivals, not to copy them. For example stop selling new DvDs at £15-20 - sell DVDs for BBC shows for half that amount - after all, the most expensive part, content creation, is already covered by the licence fee, so the BBC will still make plenty of a profit and enjoy much higher sales.

Whenever someone asked if they could play with it, the response was always along the lines of ""only if you're good.""

When I remembered it the other day though, and started thinking about that, the thought occurred to me that perhaps the real reason it was never used was because none of the staff had any idea what to do with it.

I suppose in their defence, why *would* they have known what to do with it at the time?  They were busy enough teaching the syllabus, when would they find the time to work out how to use it themselves, never mind teach the kids?  I can easily imagine it just arriving one day in the post with a generic ""Here you go"" letter.

It would be cool if they can make this idea work though, I'm just gutted it didn't happen twenty years earlier.

Establish your basic skills, and feel for the bike first, so that inevitably when it does go tits up slightly at high speed, you have good enough habits in place to save your ass!!

The teacher night not have wanted the hassle of getting the turtle out but also they might just not have appreciated the educational value themselves.  Saying something like *""if you are good""* indicates they saw it as a treat rather than an important teaching aid.  

That's why I is was suggesting having the kids 'control' the teacher or another kid.  No hardware to worry about, but the learning result is the same - an ordered list of clear specific instructions can be used to control the behaviour of something.    Indeed if the teacher is being controlled they can deliberately mis-interpret ambiguous the commands to show the kids how important it is to be precise.  Maybe they create a small maze using the class tables and chairs that they have to navigate the teacher around to reach some goal.  Then they move on to writing it down so they don't have to tell each 'teacher' what to do.  Then you start to simplify the language used until you approach something like Logo.  Only then do you introduce a computer and show the kids the turtle moving across the screen just like the teacher.

I was luck enough to be at school in the 1980's when the home computer bubble hit.  Whilst the school had a couple of ZX81's and BBC model B's there was no formal teaching of computers.  However, the playground was awash with kids swapping tapes with games but also stuff we had written ourselves.  Admittedly these were often flashy ways of writing swear words on the screen but it was difficult to do much in less than 1K!

Pick some interests or something new you think you might like and try it out. Get out there. You do NOT have to be an extrovert to go places and do stuff. What you DO need to have though is some sort of interest which can be shared with other people. 

........

I just made the mistake of reading through your other posts. It is not going to be easy to make friends when you:

- You are super lazy
- You stay in and eat junk food a lot
- Have a very messy flat/room
- Don't put in effort with your appearance
- Haven't been going to uni
- Don't eat
- Smoke pot (Doesn't sound like a good idea with your laziness problems, financial issues or depression)

I am guessing you apply this to other areas of your life too... perhaps not attending many events? Not making a lot of effort with new people? You do NOT need to be an extrovert to invite someone to hang out. Being an introvert is not an excuse.

Please don't blame Edinburgh or your depression for what is clearly a largely self inflicted problem. I have several friends with quite bad depression issues. You need to go outside more, eat better, make some effort with yourself, procrastinate less, attend your university courses.

Treat yourself with some respect and care, make effort with the (healthy) things you enjoy and friends will come naturally in time.

What I like about traditional broadcasting is that I can leave the TV/computer on, allowing me to watch programs I never thought I would be interesting in if I had to pick what to watch from a list, the programmes that are shown are curated by actual people (eg. BBC 4 sometimes does a ""music day"" on Friday where all the programmes are about music in some form.)

If the BBC was to stop broadcasting channels and instead everything was done through iplayer, even if there was a kind of automatic queue system like pandora &amp; spotify, the problem is that the things shown on those systems can become very ""same-y"". It knows the sort of music genres you'll be interesting in, your listening habits etc, but it means that it can make it difficult to discover music that is completely different to what you would normally listen to, music that, as far as the software knows, you would hate. And this is why I think traditional broadcasting is so important, because the BBC is, and has to become, a curator; much like the job of one at an art gallery or museum, it has to show people programs that are very different, programs that people wouldn't think they would be interested in, programs that people might think were boring, or weird.

* [Spurs are a good team with Tim Sherwood.](https://twitter.com/chelseafc/status/441954559351857152) [Not a more English side for playing 4-4-2. Says they they are jumping between formations.](https://twitter.com/chelseafc/status/441954841196519424)

* Doesn't accept Chelsea are favourites. 

* Spoke with Pardew a few hours after the incedent. He realized he made a mistake. He is a good man and a good friend.

* Spurs are one of the best teams in England with ambitions in the Europa. Napoli, Juventus, spurs, porto and benfica are the five favourites in the Europa league.

* All managers make mistakes in the technical area. He has made mistakes and was punished for it. The worst punishment is to know you have made a mistake.

Just to give you a very quick introduction to recruitment agencies, we sit between the worker and the client. Restaurants are experts in food service, but might not have the time to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of the right staff member for them. 

A client will tell us the exact type of person they want, and we find them on their behalf. 

In terms of good recruitment firms for chefs, I have no idea. The best thing to do would be to have a Google for say 'Chef recruitment London'. 

These guys popped up: http://www.gladstoneparkchefs.co.uk/ - I would highly advise to pick out 4 or 5 agencies, and simply call them explaining your situation, what your skills are, and what type of job you want. A good agency will work hard to match make and put you in a role that you love, which ticks all the boxes (type of job, salary, company, location etc etc). 

I hope that helps (and I hope I haven't patronized you!)

Yeah, that's basically what homophobia is.

When I was growing up, I was repulsed by seeing two men kissing, and I didn't really get over that until a long time after puberty.

It entirely depends on how fast the interest rates are increased. Seemingly no one expects them to be increased in the next 2 years or so. A slow and cautious increase of 0.5% per year would be about £900 per year more by the current average house price. £75 per month. 

No one will lose their house over £75 more per month on their mortgage. Cut back on heating, buy asda brand food, go out one less night a month..

That said we should still support the anti-war movement in all countries, too often the anti-war movement has the ideology of 'an enemy of my enemy is my friend'.

I agree that you have more influence over your own Government. However I think it's very much a case of hypocrisy from the Stop the War coalition to find reasons to dismiss the Russian invasion. It seems to me that this shows more of a general anti-Western ethos as opposed to an anti-War ethos.

&gt; The economist is essentially the voice of big business; I would never take it serious as a source. In fact it's quite easy and interesting to go through deconstructing their bourgeoisie arguments, it's illuminating to realise the business class’s opinions on certain political/economic/social developments.

I think the Economist is a excellent magazine. You say it's a voice of big business but they often lambast big businesses. They are honest and upfront that they support classic liberalism and free trade and dislike excessive, as defined by them, Government interference in markets and the private lives of their citizens. However in their main articles they are upfront with the facts and what is their opinion of that facts (""this magazine believes.."" etc).

The War Council then mentions in DotD that the High Council has failed in their plans (End of Time), which is when War, 10, and 11 come in and say ""WE CAN DO IT"". So, End of Time happened immediately before DotD. In terms of Gallifrey's timeline anyway.

You sell me a PC, priced at £400 / 1XBT. I pay in XBT.

How do you account for this? It is barter is it not as XBT is not GBP, not even money. Like, I gave you 2,000 crunchy orange carrots. Fair exchange? How does that even get into your books! Ok, you keep an account of how many carrots, er XBT you have, but this is just like stock (warehouse piling up with carrots now) and not taxable, not really even quantifiable - there's no official value for XBT, so no way to register it in your accounts etc.

I think one of the things that surprised me the most about the documentary was that the jury actually returned an ""unlawful killing"" verdict and they specifically exonerated the paparazzi.

Yet, when the filmmakers asked random people in the UK, they almost all unequivocally still believed that the paparazzi were at fault, which is also what the media incorrectly reported. 

It's almost as if that's what the media *wanted* the verdict to be.

Also, in what crazy universe can someone write several letters and contact their attorney about how their ex-husband was planning to murder them in a ""car accident""...and then when said car accident occurs, the ex-husband isn't even called to the witness stand!

The chief of police actually broke the law by sitting on Diana's letters for *three years!*

If the world had known about her predictions shortly after her death, *no one* would've been talking about the paparazzi...just the fact that Diana *said* she would be killed in a car accident, and she said it to numerous people.

Again, I don't want to be insensitive about this...I'm genuinely curious to hear what people think of the situation, especially those who've taken the time to watch this fascinating film.

true,callumgg,cnty-expat,Londoner in Russia,"Brown kept us out of the Euro despite Blair saying it was the UK's ""destiny"", and the previous government pegging Britain to the ERM. 

&gt; When the crash came, the U.K. had its own currency, central bank, and interest rate policy because of Brown. The Bank of England held rates down and later embarked on a Federal Reserve-style quantitative easing, even as inflation overshot its 2 percent target. The pound depreciated from 2007 to 2009, shielding U.K. exporters from what would have been a tighter squeeze.

&gt; It wasn’t Brown’s fault the recession dragged on. The Conservative-led coalition that replaced his Labour government in 2010 promoted “expansionary austerity”—fiscal tightening to restore public finances and boost confidence. It failed. Had Brown stayed in office, fiscal policy would have been more supportive of the recovery.

&gt; Brown didn’t see the crash coming, but who did? He made the case for “light-touch” regulation as banks grew reckless and the housing bubble inflated. He wasn’t alone in that. Maybe he increased public spending too much before 2008 instead of cutting debt while he could, but on the eve of the crash, U.K. government debt was 28 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 48 percent in the U.S. and an average of 43 percent in the euro area. He should have leaned against the economic dominance of the City of London instead of tapping it to pay for expanded public services. Until the crash, few complained.

A charmless man and a man who was just not meant to be PM, but not a ""shit treasurer"" by any means.

What's odd is I've done some improv out here, and even did a stand up set in LA a year or so ago, and it's all gone pretty well.  The stand up didn't go quite as well as the improv, but even then it went better than I expected.  I think, like you say, when you're a comedian people know to expect that you're not being serious regardless of your tone.  It's offstage where the problems come up.  People here get British comedy perfectly well, but they need to be prepared for it.

I feel like there's a social expectation back home (or at least among the people that I surrounded myself with) that nobody means anything they say, so I could state an absurdly objectionable opinion and nobody assumed I meant it, but here people often say what they mean.  

So, for instance yesterday I was speaking to a coworker who was talking about all the birthdays coming up in April and how expensive it was going to be.  My first thought was to suggest in a deadpan tone that they murder their cousin to save money on birthday cards (it's not the funniest thing in the world, but it's the most recent example), but I know from experience that it'll just make things awkward so I either have to make that suggestion in a very obviously theatrical ""I'm doing a joke"" tone to assure people that I'm not psychotic (and I'm not very good at that tone), or I have to come up with something else.  In the end I said something like ""you need to convince one of them to change their birthday"" which is just shit - there's nothing funny about that, but that's who I am now.  I'm the guy that responds to workplace chit chat by taking a few seconds to evaluate the appropriateness of my response and then says something painfully unfunny.

i disagree that its not the same thing, gettin' sexy is getting sexy no matter the chromosone make up of the pair/group/individual involved.

I too like porn, I prefer straight porn, i'm probably going to go as far as to say i'm not even keen on those ladyboys with big tits but a bigger penis than i've got... but if i'm a taxi driver and two people are getting on it i'm not watching it to get off, i'm probably actually going to mind my own business and only care if fluids are spilt.

So i'm saying that getting sexy is getting sexy regardless.  Picking fault with a gender thing is homophobia (maybe jealousy) but then like you say you wouldnt watch it.

However, I would assert that given he's got a licence to taxi (which is a job/business) and is engaged in that activity (taxiing), then the vehicle is the drivers' workplace and should be subject to the same rules and regulations as would fit an office or other place of work.  

I'm not too familiar with the law for a self-employed person, but as i understand it, if he's a limited company then he's probably going to be claiming all the tax back he can on that car as an expense which is wholly and necessary for his job.  To me, this means its not his 'personal' car but a company car he is allowed to use when he's not working.  I would imagine that also implies that is 'isnt' his car and isnt his right to tell people to GTFO, but rather the car belonging to 'his business' which employs him and is therefore subject to all the fun laws, including discrimination laws.

If he was off duty and gave a bunch of guys a lift home and they started to sexy up the back of the seat and he kicked them out then it'd be a different story.

You know, the 1 where Zeta-Jones slinks between laser light beams in a skin tight outfit, mostly just poking her booty into the air, while Sean Connery, ""her mentor in theft"" watches &amp; salivates? Moffett in The Doctors Daughter for some reason makes that scene pop into my head. It just felt like Moffett was used gratuitously in the episode, with not much purpose, and to no real effect on the plot...which was so silly it's as if the writers were all struck dumb that week.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Rooting for Spurs to win, hands down.

We control our own destiny over finishing in the top four now. If we win most of our remaining matches, especially the one against Spurs at Anfield, they won't overtake us. Whether they overtake us is more about our games and how many points we drop, rather than how many points they get - even if we have three or four dodgy games we'll still probably finish above them.

On the other hand for Chelsea and City, it's not in our control. We can win every remaining game this season and they can still potentially finish above us, which is why every weekend I'll be hoping they drop points, regardless of who they're playing.

If we're being realistic, we probably won't win the title and it's a long shot, but then if we're being realistic Spurs aren't going to overtake us either. More likely for us to catch 4 points on Chelsea/City than for Spurs to catch 6 (7 with goal difference) points on us.

true,GGBarabajagal,null,null,"I see many of the differences you describe, but I don't see anything distinctively British about ""things going from bad to worse."" That happens in most stories, I think, or at least most comedies. It happens in most farces, certainly -- *Fawlty Towers* as well as (the American version of) *Three's Company*, for example. I think this is more about plot than character.

*Fawlty Towers*, *Black Adder*, and *The Office* feature main characters who are the ""failures,"" as Stephen Frye describes, and who fail because of their own selfish delusions of grandeur. These main characters are each surrounded by less selfish characters who fail less often (and sometimes even succeed). In *It's Always Sunny* and *Seinfeld*, on the other hand, *all* of the characters are selfish failures, almost all the time. 

So I think you and /u/glomph make a really good point, about ""sociopaths,"" which I sort of skipped over in my first reply. Just like the characters in *Seinfeld* or *It's Always Sunny*, those British lead characters often demonstrate a lack a lack of concern for others, and a lack of regrets for their failures, but they are not all sociopaths -- or at least not in the same way. I think this is a fair and interesting distinction.

Basil Fawlty, Black Adder, and David Brent all strive for greater status in society. Even though they engage in anti-social behavior, it is almost always for the sake of appearing to be more socially acceptable, or of a higher social rank. They don't care about how they look to the people around them, but they do care -- a lot -- about how they look to people outside of their circle.

Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie; Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer -- they go the opposite direction. They are constantly abandoning appearances of propriety and shunning social responsibilities in exchange for more carnal and ephemeral pleasures. They don't really care about how they look to the people around them, either, but they care even less about how they look to people outside of their circle.

However none of these characters is anything at all like the ""wise-cracking, above-it-all, big-knobbed"" typical American lead that Stephen Frye is describing here. Not even close. For that matter, neither is Belushi as Bluto in *Animal House*.  Although I liked the point about the British comic wanting to play the pompous guitarist, there are much better examples of the American stereotype he was trying to evoke.",0,1394213977,null,0,false,0,cfwu6wr,t3_1zpft6,t1_cfwu6wr,t1_cfwmgey,null,1432700290,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

true,duffking,eng-devon,Proper Job,"&gt; I think one of the things that surprised me the most about the documentary was that the jury actually returned an ""unlawful killing"" verdict and they specifically exonerated the paparazzi.

The 2008 court verdict of unlawful killing didn't specifically exonerate the paparazzi AFAIK, it stated that [they were unlawfully killed due to the gross negligence of the driver and the paparazzi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7328754.stm). An emphasis was put on Henri Paul drink driving and not wearing a seatbelt, but in no way were the Paparazzi exonerated.

&gt;Also, in what crazy universe can someone write several letters and contact their attorney about how their ex-husband was planning to murder them in a ""car accident""...and then when said car accident occurs, the ex-husband isn't even called to the witness stand!

This letter isn't really solid evidence. It was not ignored, though. It was read at the inquest, and more importantly, was read *in full* as opposed to the cut down version the papers enjoyed reprinting. You can read most of the whole thing [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573170/Princess-Diana-letter-Charles-plans-to-kill-me.html). Probably the most important thing to note is that in 1996 prior to that letter being written, the Earl of Spencer had written to Diana expressing hope that she was getting help with her 'mental problems'. Additionally, you can see Diana wasn't really in a good mental place from the letter itself - she thought that Charles wanted to off her *not* for Camilla but for their Children's nanny. Additionally she also made unsubstantiated claims that someone had shot at her in London, and on other occasions had expressed fears that she would be killed in a helicopter crash - ""I am a threat in their eyes. They only use me when they need me for official functions and then they drop me again in the darkness… they are not going to kill me by poisoning me or in a big plane where others will get hurt. They will either do it when I am on a small plane, in a car when I am driving or in a helicopter."" So yeah, she'd covered a few bases there. 

Basically I think it's a load of old crap. There's no substantial evidence, and also this documentary is funded by Mohammed Al-Fayed whose son was romantically linked to Diana at the time of her death and also died in the crash, so it's rather obvious you're going to get a one sided view of events. What's more Fayed reckoned it was something to do with the relationship with his son iirc, but at the time of the car crash letter she'd never even met him.

For the record, I got some of the info here from [here](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rEJp00sYu7AC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;ots=eH9YiSSSxk&amp;dq=diana%20ex%20husband%20letters%20debunk&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) and [here](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WVRAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;ots=KCbzYH6T1s&amp;dq=diana%20i%20am%20a%20threat%20in%20their%20eyes&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). The conspiracy theories have been widely reported in the media here, and repeatedly dismissed.

Everyone will give you opinions on what cars are great, but you cannot argue with factual statistics - if you look at consumer surveys, don't buy a French or Italian car, ESPECIALLY on your budget (and therefore age of car). My personal recommendation is that you at least look at Skoda Fabias or Octavias, which are basically re-skinned VWs you can pick up very reasonably thanks to badge snobbery. You could get a good one within your £2500k-ish price bracket, and they are very low insurance group for the engine size.

If you get from a dealer, and (please don't take offence) I suggest you do because its quite obvious you're not particularly interested in cars and you won't know what you're looking for, then you should pay at least £1 of the cost on a credit card for the benefits of shared liability. If you don't buy from a dealer, take someone who knows what to look for to look at the car with you. When you go to test drive the car, ask them to leave the engine cold. An old trick is to warm the engine ahead of time, which can disguise noises and smoke from a soon-to-be poorly engine.

You should ensure that the car has an adequate service history, and no advisories on the current MOT. ASK the seller if the car is a CAT D insurance writeoff - they have no legal obligation to tell you unless you ask. A CAT D car can be a bargain if you know what to look for, but generally they should be avoided.

As already said don't be afraid to walk away. There are thousands of cars. And don't you dare not haggle!

I'm really stuck between a CBR500R or MT-07. Would love a KTM RC390 but the insurance is at least £1000+, while the CBR500R is £520.

I don't think you'd have too many issues moving from a 125 to a bigger bike, just take it slow and get used to it at your own pace. Biggest thing to practice is your slow speed control really, since it's a little different on a bigger bike so I'm told.

In general there is a huge drining culture in the UK and doubly so if you are a student so be prepared to get blind drunk a few times a week! Food wise its pretty standard apart from we eat quite a lot of curry and there is a very prominent Asian (Asian over here means southern Asian so Indian, Pakitani etc.) community in Brum so there's plenty of that about.  

You might want to acquaint yourself with football and please for all that is holy don't call it soccer. 

Manners wise, 'ta' and 'cheers' mean the same as 'thank you' and beyond that I wouldn't worry yourself too much.

You will probably struggle with accents at first but you will get the general gist after a couple of weeks. We use a lot of slang so it can take some getting used to.  

Cost of living - rent in Birmingham is not terrible, you are probably looking at about £70 per week for a shared house and a bit more for student accommodation in halls of residence. I used to allow £10 a week for bills and £40 per week for food when I was a student.  Then about £70 for drugs/booze. 

To be honest half the fun is finding these things out for yourself, I did a study abroad in Australia and I thought it was great learning all the weird little quirks from the locals.

Anything else just ask - I live about 15 miles from Brum and worked there on and off for a few years just for reference.

Alcohol is available in all supermarkets and most corner shops- unlike the system of government shops you have in SK. Having run around Moose Jaw trying to buy beer I found that to be an absolute pain in the ass.

UK bars don't generally do table service, so don't take a seat and expect a server to come and take your order. It's more likely you'll have to order your drinks at the bar and pay for them as you go rather than running up a tab. Incidentally cash transactions when buying drinks are the norm, although you can use credit/debit cards but that would be more usual if you were ordering a meal.

Bar staff aren't usually tipped in the UK, although you may if you wish- it's totally voluntary and not expected. It would be more usual to tip a waiter/waitress in a restaurant than if you were only having a drink. Again how much is up to you, but £5 or thereabouts is fairly standard for two diners.

You'll find most things are fairly similar but not identical- not many places in the UK do unlimited refills, for example, and soft drinks generally tend to cost a bit more. Alcohol from supermarkets/off licences, on the other hand, is substantially less expensive in the UK.

---

&gt;a person who considers themselves to be a celebrity when they really aren't. they are the stereotypical ""one hit wonder"" or ""nobody"" and when referenced people say ""who is that?"". they usually have lost all of their money and are terribly desperate for attention. a typical z-lister will be on or will host a game show or reality show (such as dancing with the stars, flavor/rock of love type show, celebrity fit club, or a regular show uses ""celebrity"" twist to get ratings). they like to announce their presence in public places, and will usually call paparazzi with their location in hopes of getting mentioned on TV, internet, or a magazine. the overly obnoxious z-lister will do annoying things and will be really loud in public. Even resorting to talking in the 3rd person to try and jog people's memory with the name. if a z-lister has a fan base, it consists of the most deperate middle-aged/menopausal women who had hopes of being the celebrity girlfriend/wife, but only have a chance with a Z-lister.

_VH1 hires all of the z-list celebrities._



_Robert Loggia? Who is that? Is he some sort of z-list celebrity._



_annoying things done in public would include_

_-when asked to spell name, they say each letter individually with an example (D as in don O as in OMG it's don N as in no way that's don)_

_-speaking loudly in 3rd person_

_-talking to people that they don't know and mentioning their second shot of fame, also very loudly_

_-posting news about themselves on a website_

_-calling paparazzi and paying them to sell his/her story_

_-making a scene in public to get attention (even if it's negative. attention is attention)_

They do have an official valuation, that is the fair market value.

&gt;The point here is how to HMRC view this. I could keep 100% in carrots. Would they tax this?

You would be taxed when you sold them or exchanged them so you are still liable to pay tax if you make payments in XBT and that would be based upon the fair market value of the bitcoin at the time.

As always, you should take advice from a professional. This is only what I know based upon conversations with my accountant and how he has suggested we deal with them. We keep all records of transactions, GBP, XBT or otherwise and report where required so at least if HMRC do take an interest in what we are doing we have the data so there can be no ambiguity.

If it said ""Ethnic/religious discrimination in Birmingham schools investigated"" then I think people would find it more believable.

I know someone who works in one of the mentioned schools. I was told about this kind of stuff before but I didn't really think that much of it until it was in the Sunday Times and now the BBC.

What I've been told:

In certain schools, Muslim governers have favoured Muslim applicants for headteacher/leadership - even if they're far less experienced than the non-Muslim applicants. In other schools, non-Muslim head teachers have been basically bullied out to be replaced by Muslims.

Governers have also pushed heads to put Islam into the curriculum and extra-curricular activities. 

Is it that hard to imagine? Governers of schools meet up with each other; they're often not involved with one school alone.  Say there was group of religious governers (of any religion) with strongly held beliefs. Couldn't they meet together and agree to pushing that agenda in schools? To pick staff based upon their beliefs and to push head teachers to include more and more religion-based activities in school.

true,bcash,null,null,"It's a bit of a myth that rich (foreign) landlords are buying up all the property and making a fortune.  It's not a myth that many people are buying property ""as an investment"", and it's not a myth that many of them are quite well off.

What's a myth is that it's a good investment.  It's speculation - not that this is a good thing, especially for the tenants - the potential yield on most properties on the market today is tiny (yes, better than a cash deposit, but that's not the only other potential investment); ""investors"" are ""investing"" for the anticipated capital gains.

The only way such gains can be achieved is if the current growth can be sustained, but since the current growth is already mainly fueled by speculators who have to have significant amounts of ready capital, where exactly is this going to come from?

This is the main reason that many tenants have problems with their landlord: the landlord isn't just a lazy greedy git (many are, of course), but also they're losing money on a month-by-month basis (unless they bought years ago, obviously) and don't want to invest in the properties.

The solution to the housing crisis is, therefore: better consumer rights for tenants - e.g. fast-track binding arbitration on issues of maintenance.  This will raise costs to the landlords, probably to the extent of significantly discouraging demand.",0,1394221212,null,0,false,0,cfwxlyu,t3_1zt4y1,t1_cfwxlyu,t1_cfwpvm2,null,1432702004,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Apart from everything else, when it moves, sometimes up to fifteen or sixteen times a second it beats the wood to make a hole, which is incredibly fast and generates immense forces—two hundred and fifty times more forces than an astronaut is subjected to. It's a thousand Gs. And it has these extraordinary kind of little muscles and cartilages around its brain to stop it from shattering. [suddenly laughs] If the pecker's got wood, why go for tongue, you may argue! Um … [giggles as everyone stares at him] … but it is pretty astonishing …

Basically, my coach ruined any chance of a football career for me, and I fucking despise him for it.

Even then, however, there are other avenues for us to bolster our attacking strength. *Young*, talented strikers should be the target, long-term investments in players with potential for improvement. We have a great youth program (see Marcos Lopes) and this club has made tremendous signings that have turned relatively unknown players into absolute superstars. 

Messi is not an answer to the strength of this club. He's a man of godly talent, no one can deny that. But he is not the answer. He's going to get older, and, with age, worse. If City sign him (and I do not believe they ever will), it will not be for his skill on the pitch. Where Messi goes, publicity follows. His presence would attract massive international support, even if he isn't going to add much to the team itself.

Oh here's one. Jaywalking isn't an offence in the UK. As long as you are careful crossing the road you can cross wherever you like- except on motorways.

Talking of crossing roads, that's something you might need to brush up on. British drivers aren't quite as courteous to pedestrians as Canadian ones- although conversely I'd say British motorists are more polite to other motorists; so rather than braking if you cross at a junction- where there would usually be a cross-walk in Canada- they might sound their horn at you and expect you to get out of the way. They're supposed to give way to pedestrians but it's not worth chancing it.

true,bcash,null,null,"Whenever a discussion about house prices breaks out, and the conversation moves to interest rates, there's a lot of equivocation about how much of an impact interest raises will have.  The fact remains that interest rates is probably the single-biggest factor in house prices (seeing as it has such a big impact on the much-cited ""affordability"" metrics).

So yes, a small rise, many years in the future would have a small impact.  But let's put this in a historical context shall we...  Similar debates were had here in 2006-2007, when there was a fear of rising interest rates (inflation was high and growing at the time), the base rate at the time was around 4%.  The fear was it'd go back to 6 or 7% where it had been a few years prior, everyone then was equivocating claiming that the 1980's house price crash ""proved"" that rates of 15% were required to trigger a crash.

But could you imaging 4% rates today?  Assuming banks kept a similar mark-up on their retail mortgage rates you'd be seeing 6 or 7% as the best rate, up from 2 to 3% today.  This would add getting on for £500/month to the typical mortgage (depending on who's definition of a typical house price you use).  There's not many who could absorb £500 per month without consequences, and essentially no first-time-buyer could consider such things.

4% rates would kill the housing market dead.  And even 4% is low by historical non-financial-crisis standards.  7% rates would cause so a new financial crisis.

To cut a long story short: the longer that rates stay low, the more the economy becomes dependent on low rates, and therefore the bigger shock there is to higher rates, even if small by historic standards.",0,1394224357,null,0,false,0,cfwz3d3,t3_1zt4y1,t1_cfwz3d3,t1_cfwqsbp,null,1432702703,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I only take specific issue with the idea that 10% of the population should somehow be able to determine or even significantly influence the outcome of a vote involving the other 90%. We aren't a federated superstate. The entirety of the UK **is sovereign**, not the Scots or Holyrood.

So no, the Scots vote doesn't matter any more than the Cornish, the Welsh, the people of the South East, Asians, Blacks, White etc. The bottom line is the vote is made up of everyone, and that means that any significant minority group when accumulated together is going to not necessarily get the outcome it desired (lets not forget we'd have an overwhelming Tory majority if the SE had got its way) - even though they may make up a seemingly large group, they are never the less a minority. That isn't a failing of Westminster, it's a good thing; because the two alternatives are a federated state where 90% of the population have to bend over backwards to accommodate a minority OR two seperate nations, where the smaller is effectively bullied by the larger. Either ways the Scots are always going to be in a minority, and probably need to come to terms with that. The problem isn't with our system, it's with unrealistic expectations of a minority group.

true,axolotl_peyotl,null,null,"Thank you for this response, that's why I posted here!

I think you need to do yourself a favor and watch the film in its entirety.

From my understanding, they *absolutely did* exonerate the paparazzi. 

Also, they *unequivocally* determined that Henri Paul's blood samples were tampered with!

That was perhaps one of the most damning bits of information in the whole documentary.

Also, France refused to allow the doctor who performed Paul's autopsy to testify for ""state secret"" reasons!

The discrepancy with Paul's blood samples is perhaps one of the most important (and under-appreciated) issues in the whole story.

As far as Diana's predictions, again you miss the main issue brought up by the documentary. Namely, she *specifically* wrote her lawyer with this predication for safe keeping, and after her murder, her lawyer turned over the letter to the chief of police.

He proceeded to sit on it for *years* despite its extreme relevance to the case. His actions were inexcusable. 

Even the 2008 trial determined that this was a *gross* error, and it was *illegal*. Despite this episode of gross misconduct, that chief of police was rewarded by being made a Lord.

Paul's autopsy was botched and the bloods samples were switched...*and* the global media immediately declared him ""drunk as a skunk"" which has since been proven wasn't the case *at all*.

The problem is that a narrative was developed and broadcasted *immediately* (Paul drunk, being chased by paparazzi, etc)...and although these details since have been shown to be untrue, the vast majority of people still believe them to be the case.

And here's the kicker: *this all came out during the trial*.

The jury was forbidden from returning a ""murder"" verdict, so they did the next best thing...they called it ""unlawful killing"" and again, did *not* blame the paparazzi. 

Also, I see no issue with the film being funded by Mohammed Al-Fayed as long as they disclose that information. Obviously he's going to have a vested interest in getting to the bottom of his son's death, so it seems perfectly reasonable that he would fund a documentary that was investigating a possible conspiracy.

That you again for actually having this discussion with me...I was getting concerned that people were just going to dismiss the subject with one liners.

I would like to reiterate...I think you should do yourself a watch the whole film! I think you might be surprised.

My brief synopsis of its *many* points absolutely doesn't do it justice, as there are *several* more issues that are extremely suspicious and worthy of serious debate.

Edit: I have to say I'm disappointed that this comment wasn't responded to, but then again, after reading the rest of the comments ITT, I have to say it's *very* clear how the Royal Family could get away with murder.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"No, that's my point. The Scots aren't going to be in a majority even if they are independent. Nothing is going to change the bottom line which is that they have a nation 10 times their size just to their south, and because of history, quirky circumstance and geography it just so happens that trade generally travels south. For example, did you know 75% of all retail items entering the UK (including to Scotland) and something like 85% of vehicles, do so via the dockyard at Southampton. That isn't going to change this September. It's just one tiny example of an area where the Scots need, and are subject to, circumstances in the UK. 

They are going to have to adapt to living in a world where they share a land border with a country 10 times their size, that happens to be the 7th largest economy in the world with the second or third (by various measures) largest financial center -- only now that larger nation has only the most peripheral interest in the success of the Scottish state, and if its failure would benefit the UK, then so be it. Ultimately, for better or worse (to us all) the UK and London in particular is an absolute behemoth... and being told what to do by Westminster isn't going to end if the Scots become independent. It will just take on different shapes, and the new name for being told what to do by Westminster will be ""Diplomacy"" instead of ""Democracy"".

* Want to use the pound? Gotta scratch my back.
* Want access to the EU physically via infrastructure like the Docks at Southampton or the two air travel hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick - gotta scratch my back.
* Want access to the single European market? - gotta scratch my back
* Want to physically pump your oil anywhere except Norway? Like via the E98 Belgium Interconnector pipeline - gotta scratch my back. 

That, I'm afraid, is how the world works. It's not that different to the way we all bow down to what the US wants - because ultimately, the harsh truth is that their friendship is more valuable to us than ours is to them. OR, the way the Greeks have to 'accommodate' German wishes. And the same will be true of Scotland and the rUK. Their bargaining position post-separation  is actually deceptively weak. I just can't understand why Scots would want to do that to themselves. There are a lot of good things to be said about the English, but we can be self serving when it boils down to it, especially London. I just can't grasp why anyone in Scotland really wants to put that to the test.

Because, that's how the world works. It isn't bulling as such, its called diplomacy, and the rUK has more to bargain with.

&gt; why couldn't England in a federal system be split into a couple of states

It wouldn't work because any division of England (except perhaps into a simple North:South) would be artificial. They'd probably vote in largely the same way, with perhaps the slightest shift in the North of England... but the majority of the English population live south of a horizontal line drawn through Nottingham, so the Labour voting tendency of a few area in the North probably wouldn't have any more of an impact than it does now. 

And ultimately, why should the English, particularly in the SE be forced into a federated state where their views can be diminished by a minority group. It also sets a very dangerous precedent.

&gt;**Dishonored** is a 2012 [stealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game) [action-adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game) video game developed by [Arkane Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkane_Studios) and published by [Bethesda Softworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks). It was released worldwide in October 2012 for [Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), [PlayStation 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3), and [Xbox 360](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360). Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists, a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider—a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including [Susan Sarandon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sarandon), [Brad Dourif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Dourif), [Carrie Fisher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher), [Michael Madsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Madsen), [Lena Headey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Headey), and [Chloë Grace Moretz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlo%C3%AB_Grace_Moretz) provided voice work for the game.
