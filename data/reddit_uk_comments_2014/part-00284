How's that different from what I said?

The thing is, bullying obese people won't make them eat more chicken or tuna, but it will make them more stressed, and apart from the physiological effects that's unlikely to make their decisions more rational.

I don't claim bullying or stress is the one ultimate reason for obesity, or that stuffing the face with protein would be a magic cure for anything. I claim that stress can cause obesity - it can be another factor in a complex mix leading to a greater risk of developing obesity, a greater risk of becoming even more obesity etc.

I don't claim that the obese aren't responsible for their bodies. Of course they are, up to reasonable limits of course. But that means other people aren't responsible for those weight problems - it's not their responsibility or their right to try to bully people into losing weight. The potential for that to be counterproductive adds weight to that, but isn't the core reason.

And as I tried to hint somewhere earlier, it's amazing how the opposite problem - anorexia - is one where no-one claims it's just a matter of calories. Where it's recognised that bullying is likely to be counterproductive.

It's a shame folk don't seem to appreciate that. 

Folk also miss how this was the first opportunity for long term television acting work for non-white actors, at a time when a darker face on television had immigrants phoning each other to share the joy. 

The couple in LTN are still acting, those in TDUDP had resultant careers as did a lot of the Anglo asian actors in ""It ain't half hot mum"". Like Renu Setna, probably one of the most recognisable Pakistani actors we've ever had, and before he got his scholarship to RADA he was a labourer on a building site - hard to imagine he'd see his part in IAHHM as degrading in comparison. 

Anyone complaining about these being racist is missing the point and is expressing criticism similar in it's lack of understanding to complaining about how ""Schindler's List"" is nazi propaganda.

In some ways, though, this is a bit better. They compared prices to Asda and Tesco and then compared your shop to the cheapest of those two.

One personal example I have of this in action is that not that many years ago my brother used to be a member of the management team for a well known cinema chain and they had at the very minimum 2 box office staff, 2 floor/screen staff, 2 retail staff, 1 projectionist and 1 team leader plus the manager running the back office on a typical weekday night. In the space of 2 years they made all the projection team redundant and replaced them with an automated system operated by the manager (if anything went wrong with the projectors you had to ring a help center in Sweden) and then they moved the box office into an integrated system with the retail stand and added automated ticket machines where the box office used to be.  They then basically merged the managers job with the team leaders job by automating responsibilities like staff training and stock orders and as a result got rid of the team leader position.  The net result was the reduction of staff down from 9 people to 4-5 people on a weeknight in less than 2 years.  This also allowed them to remove every full time basic staff member position (from about 4-5 FT positions) and instead use zero hour contracts.  The overall staff hours reduced by about 50%.

While I'm not going to argue any of that is necessarily a bad thing or that every business model would be affected that severely it does show how greatly technology can impact the amount of jobs available.  Personally I suspect this process is going to accelerate in the next decade as technology seems to be more able to fulfill or combine complex tasks than ever before and it's not outside the realm of possibility that advances in sustainable energy technology will make electrical power much cheaper in the future which will make things that may be uneconomical now a possibility.  Another factor in this is that the companies that are most likely to be able take advantage of this are the big corporations that are massive employers.  A simple obvious example of something that's already in place is self-checkout stations at super markets.  I'd be quite happy to be wrong but I think that potentially we could be entering a time when technology could really start quickly filling the jobs we never thought it could.  This is potentially a real problem as our current economic system really offers no clear solution on how the people who do the jobs that can be automated would find employment.",0,1411697875,null,0,false,0,cksr540,t3_2hftdy,t1_cksr540,t3_2hftdy,null,1426819490,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Contrary to popular belief the Tories plans for the NHS are not to create paid for system like the US where people must purchase private insurance or pay out of pocket.

The NHS as it was was founded and operated under the ""The Beveridge Model"" named after the founder of the NHS. Basically nearly all hospitals and clinics are owned and operated by the state, most doctors (except GPs, dentists etc) are government employees.

What has been happening for about a decade ( it started under New Labour ) is a transition to a ""National Health Insurance"" type system where most if not all treatment is carried out by private sector doctors working private hospitals that are either charities or profit making enterprises. This is the system that is similar to other European countries. The important thing to note is very few countries that have Universal Healthcare are run entirely by the public sector 

As for pros and cons:

Pros:

- More consumer choice over treatment.
- Investment from the private sector, especially in expensive specialised services
- Less reliance on politics to get things built

Cons:

- Probably cost more
- Possibility of co-pays (really depends on what the government of the day decides to do)
- Tacky corporate sponsorship.

More info: http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php

I think the root of the outrage is that there could be companies making money from treating peoples illness but personally I don't see how this is worse than any other service industry.

&gt;In [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), the [County Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim) area stretching from roughly [Portrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush) to [Larne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne) and centered in the area of [Ballymena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballymena) is often referred to as a Bible Belt. This is because the area is heavily Protestant with a large [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism) community. From 1970 to 2010, the [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) for [North Antrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Antrim_(UK_Parliament_constituency\)) was [Ian Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley), a [Free Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Presbyterian_Church_of_Ulster) [minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(Christianity\)) well known for his theological [fundamentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalism). The town of [Ballymena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballymena), the largest town in the constituency, is often referred to as the ""buckle"" of the Bible Belt.

I was one of the people wanting De Boer over Poch in the summer for the very reasons the article states - he's a winner, is used to winning, and has played at massive clubs, so he knows what the infrastructure is like behind the scenes at Barcelona.  Poch doesn't have anything like that experience.

I'm not trying to undermine our current manager... I want to get behind him and I hope he does very, very well for us.  I believe his general philosophy is right for us, and he's certainly worked wonders with lesser names than we have in our squad at present.

I've gotta say, I was in the FdB camp too, but then it dawned on me that Poch had an advantage over him-expectation. FdB's every move would've been criticized, while we'd just be happy to be the PL's entertainers under Poch. Spurs is his biggest job yet and it's only fair that he's given time to adjust (although judging from the WBA post-match thread, you'd have thought that we were bottom of the table with a game to go.), and that's not a luxury I think FdB would be spared.

I think the winning mentality, as you said, comes from Poch's background as a player, and what a total contrast it is to de Boer's. FdB won a lot with Ajax and later Barca. Poch, on the other hand, played at PSG before the oil money (interesting to note: he played with my all-time favorite, Ronaldinho, in Paris, and later played him in the Barcelona Derby), and mid-table Espanyol. Even their path to becoming managers were different-Frank had everything laid out to him, and had some of his best friends as coaching staff, etc. There was infrastructure. Poch went from captain to coach because the club that he loved were in chaos. It's easy to see why Poch doesn't have a winning mentality, because his first position as a manager was just to survive. 

Poch can pull it off. If Martinez did brilliantly at both Swansea and Wigan before coming to Everton (where he still does well-I think with a bigger budget, he'd likely be in a position to win the league.), it's not totally unreasonable to think that Poch, with that ""My teams will play with hunger"" mindset, can do the same here.

Rafa had pretty high sights for what players he wanted to buy, but the owners had appointed official shithead Christian Purslow to moderate transfers, who got in the way of most good things Rafa was trying to do at the time. I can't recall most of them, as it was a good long time ago now...

but as i remember it, Rafa really wanted to buy Gareth Barry from Aston Villa in that window. For good reason, he's a great player, with a good left, which we lacked at the time. He didn't wind up at City on accident. Anyway, the ownership wouldnt fund Barry, and Alonso had just had a really poor year by his standards, so Rafa figured he could sell Alonso to Juventus and get Barry, and Gerrard could fill Alonso's role.

well, Alonso probably never wanted to leave. 3 months went by and Juventus never put in a sufficient bid, and the deal fell through, which meant the Barry deal fell through. Alonso went on to have a career-defining season, and in 12 months left for Real Madrid.

Perhaps slightly under de Boer, but the club's ambitions are huge regardless of who is at the helm.  Poch has done extremely well overachieving with small teams, but he's never been at a European club that expects anything much other than survival.  FdB took the reigns at Ajax - one of the most storied clubs in European football - at a very low ebb, and transformed them into ruthless winners.  Sure, they're still the big boys in their league, but it's quite a job he's done there.

Like you say with Martinez, it's not essential to be a ""winner"" to succeed in the EPL as a coach (otherwise Laudrup would've lasted longer), and Poch's progress approach is definitely a positive for us.

In any case, I'm a huge advocate of keeping him on for next season, in all circumstances other than a complete collapse into relegation candidate range.  Give him a chance to school our side, inject some players genuinely of his choosing, trim the fat of players who won't cut it, and have another go next year.

He's a more traditional center-forward preferring to use his physicality to win the space to shoot ; two attributes he's very good at but have been yet to be used to full effect by the team.

The whole ethos of this team last season was the fast, inter-connecting play that we were so deadly with after winning possession and it raises the question of whether Balotelli and the other new arrivals should adapt to fit this style, or if the team's style of play has to change to bring out their strengths.

English is spoken exclusively by English speaking settlers to Gwynedd which I guess make up about 20-25% of the overall population.  Everybody else spoke Welsh at work, in the pub and at council meetings. 

This seems completely at odds with the rest of Wales where only a few elderly or younger Welsh nationalists seem to speak it.  Speak Welsh in Cardiff and you generally get a ""U wot mate?""  although anything official (council letters, sign-posts, websites ect)  has to be bilingual.

I suppose there was also an implied (political) threat that people would take their business elsewhere, or publicise their employees views further if action was not taken. From TFL's point of view the 'problem' was potential bad publicity and disciplinary hearings. From EDL News' point if view, the problem was somebody walking around with unchallenged and abhorrent political views, which they wished to use their own right to speech to attack.

I admit there's a bit of a problem that TFL is sort of an arm of the government and I'm not really happy with the government regulating speech like that, but overall I think you're wrong to think of speech as 'solving' a particular problem - speech (and the consequences of speech) are important for their own sake.",0,1411714557,null,0,false,0,cksx5dk,t3_2hfgl8,t1_cksx5dk,t1_ckspe9y,null,1426816676,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

John: income = £4k benefits +£4k HB, replaced by UBI would see him go from £8k to £10k. Crucially he would now be able to do odd jobs and casual work without impacting his main source of income.

Mary: income = salary £10k. For her she would now get salary £10k + UBI £10k less tax £2k (20% of income over £10k)

Bill: income = salary £100k less tax/NI £35k, under UBI salary £100k + basic income £10k - tax £50k. He gets a little less.

It's just redistribution from the more wealthy to the poorest. There's likely to be some break even point around £40k where you would be no better off under UBI, you'd get the same income you get now.

So it's not ""utterly bizarre"" just a redistribution.

It also clears up some benefits which are utterly bizarre. Working tax credits is basically a benefit which allows companies to pay workers less than they need to live on.

Your father could have given away up to £3,000 each year without the receivers paying inheritance tax. Unused part of that £3,000 can carry over to the next year. Any gifts given this way is ""potentially exempt"" from inheritance tax. If, however, you die within 7 years of this gift, the gift is counted as part of the estate.

The inheritance tax threshold is £325,000. So as long as your dad hasn't given away any money in the last 7 years, and his entire estate is now less than £325,000, YOU do not have to pay any tax on this inheritance.

So, it's not about what you have received as an inheritance, but about what your deceased farther has given away in the last 7 years and the value of his entire estate now.

1. If you have to stop walking on the underground for any reason (to look at a map or wait for someone to catch up or something) please move over to one of the walls so you are as out of the flow of traffic as possible.
1. Please move down the platforms away from any entrances/exits - you will likely find that most trains are more quiet away from wherever the entrance(s)/exit(s) are on your platform.
1. Please have whatever travel document (ticket, oyster card, contactless payment card) ready before you get to the barriers.

If you get an orange light in a different place from where the ""ready to read"" light was (the ""ready to read"" light is constantly lit and is on the right, the other one is below the green one on the left) and the gates open, then carry on through - it just means that you tapped too close to the person behind. The simple rule is: if the gates open or stay open after you've tapped, go through. 
1. If you can't get through the barrier after three quick attempts, move aside and seek a member of staff to assist you. Please do not stand at the gates trying your ticket time after time as you are only getting in the way of the people behind you.
1. Don't talk to anyone you don't know, and don't say anything you don't want the entire carriage to hear, because unless the train is going around a worn out curve and is squealing like mad most people in the carriage can hear you, and they are probably judging you, sorry.
1. Don't watch anything on your phones or walk along texting or anything like that. Not only are you making yourself a target for pickpockets (and there are still plenty down on the tube, even with the efforts the police are going to), you need to be ready to react in a split second to someone hoving into view on a collision course with you.
1. If you hold the hand rails on anything (stairs, in trains, escalators), make sure you wash your hands or sanitise them at the earliest opportunity - the handrails are cleaned every night, but as the tube moves 4 million people a day, think about who could have been holding it before you.
1. Let people off the trains first. A lot of stations (especially interchange ones like Bank or King's Cross St Pancras etc) get really really *really* packed at rush hour, and because lots of people need to get off the train, and then lots of people need to get on, for the love of *everything* please let people off the train first. And if the train tries to leave whilst people are still getting off, you can hold the doors open, *but only to let people off*. Don't delay the train unless you absolutely have to, because there will be another one along in about a minute at rush hour, and 30 seconds of delay cause 2 minutes to the train behind, because it has to stop and then restart, which wastes 2 minutes (These are official figures), but then the train behind that gets 4 minutes of delay, and the one behind that gets 8 etc etc.
1. If you are on a packed train, move down inside as far as you can go, or at least allow others to move down. 
1. If you or any member of your party is pregnant, you can get a ""baby on board"" badge from any TfL office, and on seeing this badge people are supposed to give up a seat for the lady. Otherwise, if you or any member of your party is elderly or less able to stand, you can ask a person for a seat, and they will normally give one to you if they don't spot that you need one straight away. It is also not advisable for people who are pregnant, less able to stand, or prone to claustrophobia etc to travel at peak times.
1. if any member of your party is blind, let one of the station staff know if they need an official escort - a member of staff can escort them to the train, then radio ahead to their destination to get another member of staff from the destination station to meet the train and take the person to wherever they need to be.
1. If you have smart phones, get the ""citymapper"" app - this is a great little app to tell you the best route to take to get to somewhere (either an address or a station) and can advise on alternative routes including buses, taxis, and walking. It also hooks into the live update information provided by TfL, so it can tell you when the next train, bus etc will arrive.
1. If you are lost or confused, most people won't mind helping you find where you need to be. Just ask someone politely if they can help.
1. Watch out for pickpockets. There are plenty of chances on the tube for people to steal from your pockets or bag if you leave a zip open. So do up all zips, make sure nothing is visible from your pockets, and only use pockets on the sides of your trousers/skirt etc, not the ones on your rear. Also, and I hate to have to say this, there are an ***extremely*** small number of perverts on the tube who behave very poorly towards women. If someone tries to kiss you or molest you, or you suspect they are masturbating, then speak up - people will come to your aid if they know what is going on. Keeping quiet is the worst thing you can do if someone is doing something sexual that you haven't consented to.
1. If you or a member of your party feels unwell at any time, take them off the train at the next station. There is no point in pulling the emergency alarm unless someone has collapsed or is seriously ill as the train can't stop until the next station anyway. If you do get off the train with an unwell person, seek help from a member of staff.

It simply falls in that an argument to 'efficency' which doesn't *really* seem to have a lot of purchase is being involved to justify 'fuck it give everyone money'.

&gt;Two leaflets distributed by the party in the campaign have highlighted the grooming scandal as evidence of Labour’s “betrayal of the working classes because of political correctness”.

&gt;“It is an issue, but immigration and the fact that we are not part of the Westminster establishment are also big here,” he said, whilst pushing leaflets through the doors of houses.

These are the the only 3 quotes used from Farage or UKIP. Not exactly BNP style fearmongering?
99% of the article is the opinion of Tom (father of abused girl) and labour MP.

The Guardian in the aftermath of Rotherham, posted articles downplaying the ethnicity/political correctness angle of the paedophiles and instead focusing on the working class status of the victims. (It was probably a mixture of all these factors). 

The point being by the Guardians logic we can also reach the conclusion that the Guardian was exploiting the child abuse issue to further their liberal agenda...

..the irony here is Farage actually mentioned the 'betrayal of the working class', a line the guardian was pushing.

Whichever side of the fence you sit and whatever your opinion is, talking and debating about anything should be a good thing. If your opponent is wrong you should be able to defeat them my directly addressing their points...not by simply accusing them of politicising something.

I do think it's a good thing to encourage children to think about their place in their community and their community's place in the world at large, and I don't think being proud of being British necessarily has to turn into nationalism. It's a fine line for teachers to tread, but that's part of their job as teachers.

I think I'd be concerned about it much more were it not for the specific inclusion of ""tolerance of other people and cultures"" in these values.

 So (again, by your logic) it was entirely negative for Britain being invaded too.

&gt;Multiple historians have addressed why

Really? That's odd - you were dismissing them as 'all wrong' earlier.

&gt;Whatever ""benefits"" you are listing came at the overall cost of India's economy and freedom.

Heh, yeah put those benefits in quotes, then they're less significant. And again, use the former to dismiss the latter  which *again* only works with polarisation. At the risk of invoking Godwin, we only got to the moon because of Nazi rocket technology....so really, India shouldn't be celebrating the mars-orbiter because it was based on technology invented using slaves/ genocide. See how easy it is to do what you're doing?

&gt;the population of Dhaka, which was once the great centre of muslin production, fell by 90%

The Iceni burnt Roman London to the ground. Imagine how fun the Roman reaction to *that* was.

&gt;No, colonization has been negative for India. It is a logical fallacy to assume that Rome/Britain is good, therefore Britain/India is good.

Nobody has said that, anyway. And again, I'll highlight your insistence on polarising so that you can provide the response you want.

&gt;India would have made technological advancements at a much higher rate than what is happening right now.

You have no real evidence for that, no way of proving it and in any case I could say the same about UK/ Romans. But your responses are so agenda-based that I can't be bothered to keep correcting you, so I think we'll leave it there.

That is the sort of thing that slips off one's tongue in an unguarded moment, but I agree with the Chancellor that it is a monstrous assertion that any important body of taxpayers should claim proprietary rights over the particular quota of taxation which they contribute, and that all should not be brought into an area freely justiciable by the House of Commons.

Seriously though, yes you are completely correct. UBI is a seriously hamfisted approach to social welfare, that appears to be in vogue at the moment largely because of some silly futurism.

Yes, automation is a thing. It's been a thing for generations now. People are making the mistake of assuming however, that replacing people in every possible task with A.I that reaches to the point of being an artificial mind, will ever be possible (unlikely given the frame problem! TL;DR turning complete machines no good at quickly setting context, biological intelligence v . good) or if it is economical. 

So a lot of the drive for this is based on a very extreme, very unrealistic futurist scenario. Protip, the singularity is a lie. 

There is also about 50 different ways in this thread to cash this proposal out, I'm not seeing many of them that bite the bullet on reducing / removing all other forms of welfare spending and moving to full blown market socialism to avoid lulzyinflation. Yeap, everyone gets a big bag-o-cash, but you pay for everything. That's one of the more pratical outs, you can't just increase the money supply to 11 without serious drawbacks. 

Then of course there is the *moral* element, and yes there is one. As you identifiy, NIT deals with this far better. Simply becuase provision tracks need. The counter arguments to this and just 'giving it to everyone'. This simplicity argument falls flat on its face quickly, once its is realised that beurcratic implemenation of UBI would **not be nill** and even superfiscal calculations of giving 'everyone' money, quickly spiral into numbers far in excess of our allready healthy welfare budget. The get out from this seems to then be implementing a convoluted taxation system that makes it such that '

TL;DR its a silly idea that's in vogue at the moment amongst academics, because its something interesting to publish on and is now leaking into frige politics. It is not however, for a range of reasons an actually not so good idea.

&gt;It's also idiotic to take these figures, which refer only to an obscure subcategory of exploitation (previously known as ""teenage prostitution""), outside the larger context.
In any of these cities, ten times the number of women will experience rape or serious sexual assault, but they'll be adults, and their rapists more than likely white, so you don't care about them.

The point I am making in this case is that the fact they were children was relevant. These men preyed on children because it was more acceptable in their community to do so. 

If all these girls had been adults, I would have been just as upset by the news.

I do care about preventing rape, far more than you do. I'm not the one desperately trying to prevent action being taken to prevent the rape of children.

&gt;If anything, Rotherham's figures for this crime are high because perpetrators have been allowed to get away with it for so long, but the victims there were vulnerable, and many of them were let down by the system before their groomers even met them

While it is right to blame the police, council and social services for their failings, ultimate responsibility for rape is with the person who commits the rape. 

&gt;You absolutely do have a nasty prejudice, that you're obsessing about that one case, when you care nothing about these kinds of issues at any other time.

I've said several times that what I am saying does not relate to all Pakistanis, or all Muslims, but a small number of those that live in small isolated Pakistani communities in the UK. I am not saying anything prejudiced or bigoted. You are just so bound up with you own views on the world, than anything said against the beliefs of a group of people is racist, that you are not able to accept a logical argument.

Edit: **Anyone else remember what happened in Libya? We destroyed that country which is still mired in civil war by toppling Gaddafi? Here's what a portugeese MEP had to say about what we did in libya**

&gt; ""Thank you. Mr. President. Franklin Roosevelt said, referring to the dictator Somoza: Somoza is a son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch. Does the chamber remember when Gaddafi was our son of a bitch? He began to be so in the year 2000, when he privatized his oil companies so that Western multinationals could come in. It was the time when Gaddafi was the friend of Europe, when he collaborated with the migratory policy, in a militay way (manu militar -literally with a military hand-)i, as dictators do. It was the time when Gaddafi financed Mr. Sarkozy's electoral campaign and gifted horses to José María Aznar. Even in 2011, one month before NATO's intervention, the IMF praised Gaddafi's economic reforms. **What happened in March? What happened is that the United Nations Security Council in their 1973 resolution appealed to the responsibility of protecting the civil population, and thus the military intervention, whose consequences we are discussing now, began. However, chamber, that had nothing to do with defending the civil population, it had to do with defending the interests of Western oil companies given the possibility of Russian, Chinese, and Indian companies exploiting Libya's resources. That is why those three nations abstained in the Security Council.** I do not ask you to stop being what you are, but at least do not lie to the people.""
&gt; 
&gt; the response by Ana María Gomes, a representative from the social-democratic Socialist Party in Portugal:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Mr. Igelasias, do you ignore the fight of the Libyan people to free themselves from Gaddafi's murderous dictatorship? Because this was the determining factor of the revolution that was carried out , of course, with foreign help. This happened and I was there and I saw it with my own eyes; at the front, the young ones fought against Gaddafi's dictatorship. Where were you when this was happening? Is it that you forget everything? Everything works to attack the forces that admittedly did take advantage of Gaddafi's dictatorship?"" (These forces being the West, I think.)
&gt; 
&gt; Iglesias' response:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Thank you very much for the question señora Gomes. You are right, there were many democrats that opposed Gaddafi in Libya, but those democrats that opposed Gaddafi never once received aid from NATO or from Eu nations when Sarkozy's campaign was being financed or when Gaddafi became the EU's migratory policy's major ally. **Let us not lie, the intervention in Libya was not carried out to ensure the rights of the civil population, the intervention was exclusively carried out on behalf of multinational interests.** Enough, stop pulling the people's legs (Ya basta de tomarle el pelo a la gente) señora Gomes.""

Al-Qaeda had just won a victory over the USSR by goading them into an un-winnable war of attrition. They then re-focussed their attention on the west. If this tactic had worked against the USSR in Afghanistan, then maybe it could work against America in the Middle East?

Al-Qaeda's pre-2001 strategy documents can be found online. In summary, the plan was:

- Massive terrorist attack on US soil

- Establish network of loosely connected cells to maintain terrorist threat

- Drag the US into 2-3 perpetual wars in the Middle East

- Unite the Muslim world behind the idea the the US is their enemy

- Watch as the US economy collapses due to unaffordable wars and rising oil prices

- Install a global caliphate and Sharia law

If I were in charge of foreign policy my priorities would be:

- Establishing a sustained campaign to align the muslim world with the west. We need to show the citizens of the middle east that we our not their enemy, and that we want the same things as they do - peace and prosperity. Our war budget could be spent on economic development. We need to change things so that the romantic thing for young muslims to do is aid work (for example), not joining ISIS.

- Reducing western dependancy on middle eastern oil. The high economic value of oil distorts middle eastern politics, and exacerbates human suffering at the hands of brutal dictators and paramilitary groups.

- Create a stable peace between Israel and its neighbours. Whilst Israel's borders remain in a state of conflict it is difficult to see how we can normalise relations with middle eastern countries.

All of these goals are really hard to achieve, and I don't have a master plan for how we should go about it. But I really strongly believe that we are doing the wrong thing here, and that we are indirectly causing massive amounts of suffering.

Yes, if I was in a refugee camp my opinion would probably be difficult. My plan means that, in the short-term, we are essentially sacrificing the Syrian people for the greater good. But the alternative is worse.

What I mean is that the internal contradictions of stated ideology versus actual practice in the party is pretty extreme. Elections in England is done in 40 marginals out of 510 constituencies. Those forty marginals decide the whole election. The rhetoric of Labour is still something you’d hear down at the local union office, but the policies pursued are those of the marginals where their base doesn’t vote and where they have to capture middle class people.

Those internal contradictions were exposed during the indyref where it wasn’t about marginals, but about percentages of whole populations, and now their policies were starkly light up. That’s why you had apparent mismatches between political messaging in England and Scotland about the NHS.

Now that these internal contradictions in Scotland has split the party almost down the middle, they lack the tools to fix things because they can’t step away from the rhetoric aimed at the Middle Class in England. Or they forfeit the election. They can choose to win Westminster in 2015 or keep the party in Scotland.

I am thinking that they’ll try to win Westminster, but in doing so they will further undermine themselves in the North of England and elsewhere. People in Scotland will see through the contradictions now. It’s damned if they do, and damned if they don’t.

At the end of the day the show runner puts out more scripts and finds a cohesive narrative for the season, and the only worthwhile larger narrative Davies did right was Season 4 but he just fucked up with the ending. Bringing back the Master was also an interesting concept but failed in execution. 

I liked the Pandorica story in Season 5. River's story and Season 6 was kind of weak because he just kept dragging it on, but Season 7 was a better return to form. His writing is still far from perfect but he still has given us more even seasons than Davies. But when people start nostalgia'ing hard at the Davies era and think the show went downhill afterwards I always want to ask you mean the show was at a great point when it had farting aliens, a piece of skin that wanted to be moisturized, a girl that becomes a cement block and is forced to just give her bf bjs? Davies to Moffat isn't the same as say, Community from Season 3 to Season 4 then back to Season 5.

Honestly, to those that don't want Moffat I also have to say there's really no strong successors to him. Toby Whithouse is probably the only one that could do it but he's got another program he's working on iirc. The only other option would be Gatiss and god help us if he took over. As it all stands I'd rather Moffat just keep being showrunner and just having a constant rotation of writers for single episodes. I'll take a couple iffy Moffat arcs as long as there are a good solid couple of episodes by other writers over no Moffat and an unclear future for the show any day of the week. Because that's how I see it, if Moffat is gone then the series loses its momentum. He's like the Tom Baker of the writers.

false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; In what way has austerity worked? Longest period of wage repression, still massive consumer debt, we have never taken this long to get out of a recession, and I think I am right in saying if we take into account population growth our GDP is still lower than before the crisis.

First of all, austerity wasn't really adopted, Osborne instead opted for an austerity-light using Keynesian principles (including QE) to manage the economic crisis so that restoring growth would not have as significant an impact on peoples quality of life as actual austerity. 

Secondly, wage repression, debt and duration of the recession are the result of earlier economic mismanagement and putting the economy back on track. The longer the economy was left to borrow beyond it's means the worse these factors are when it comes time to repair the economy. 

&gt; There is also no sensible economic model that suggests austerity in a downturn works.

The clip is an hour long so I'm not going to watch through it just to state the obvious at the end. You don't need an economic model to tell you that when you cannot afford your current spending that you need to reduce your current spending. This is what austerity means.

&gt; We can also argue that we did not have austerity for the financial sector because of QE, and the £billions of PPI payouts have helped boost the economy.

Austerity-lite: focusing on making the productive parts of the economy create growth.

&gt; the austerity cuts on the poorest in our society is a scandal.

That's your opinion and you're entitled to it, but the cuts haven't been that significant in relative terms and certainly nothing like as much as they could have been to fix the economy more quickly.

false,bakhesh,null,null,"Nope, for a number of reasons

1) I do not believe what I read in the media. Before the last Iraq war, there was a huge propaganda campaign run by the US government to make the case for war. It might sound paranoid, but it is well documented. One example is the ""Pentagon military analyst program"", which was basically an operation to recruit and brief so called independent experts. They were then sent out onto American news programmes to explain how important the war was, from an ""independent"" point of view. This program was discontinued in 2008, but I would be shocked to learn that it wasn't replaced by something more insidious. The CIA spends about a third of their budget on propaganda campaigns

Last year they tried to sell us a war in Syria, but the public just wasn't biting. They've gone away and had a rethink, so this time the stories are all about rape and mass graves. This is pushing all the right buttons for the public


2) Western Governments seem to really want to bomb in the middle east for the flimsiest of reasons. Cameron couldn't wait to have his own war last year in Syria, and was only prevented by public opinion. Now we are apparently bombing the people he wanted to help last year. The whole situation is a complete mess, and the one thing that the last 20 years have shown us is bombing does not stabilise the region

Remember, the US arms industry spends over $100m a year on lobbying the US government. They don't do that because they have too much money, they do it because they want wars

3) ISIS are probably a dodgy bunch, but they are not a significant threat to the UK. Terrorism is a minute risk to people in the UK, when compared to something like heart disease or cancer, and yet we spend billions on it each year

People claim we should do it for humanitarian reasons, so why aren't we bombing Saudi? They behead people for things like Sorcery, or beat women for being raped, and are are probably funding ISIS. What about Mexico? Drug Cartels down there behead entire families, thanks to the West's attitude to drugs, but that isn't reported and is completely ignored

Scarcity in most things including everything we need to live a happy healthy life will be a thing of the past and so there will be little if anything that we'd need to compete for and so a commons makes the most sense. 

This isn't ideological one way or the other it is the logical outcome of our technological progression and it was that progression Marx was talking about. The communist revolutions jumped the gun and tried to implement a form of society that they could not support and so it fell far short of the ideal they aimed for.

As for the rest of your post I can best sum up by feeling about it by calling you a selfish cunt but that's not very productive is it? So lets go over it point by point shall we? 

&gt;Why should the stupid and the lazy get the same reward as a genius?

I've known some very lazy geniuses and it telling that you don't say ""hard working"" here when describing them in relation to the ""lazy"" which makes me suspect that you are of a mind to conflating excellence with hard work which is one of the biggest loads of bullshit in the world. It's the ""work hard and you'll achieve so all that have achieved must have worked hard"" that underlines the sicking ""morality of being rich"" that drives so much of American politics and is seeping into ours.  

Stepping past that let me reframe the question why should someone who was born lucky in both nature and nurture get more out of life that someone who was born unlucky in one or the other? Some people are just lazy true but life is not fair and how well you do it in has, in large parts, fuck all to do with hard work or getting what you actually deserve, it's largely about luck. I don't know about you but I'm not going to base my system of deciding what is fair for people on outcomes that have more to do with chance that any other factor. 

&gt;There isn't enough resources to give everyone a good standard of living, so we would all be worse off.

As pointed out we are reaching a point that this statement is going to be false and leading up to that point we are going to face a crash in the labour market which is going to make billions of people, your self most likely included, worse off. Is it fair that only those at the very top who control the means of production benefit while the rest of us are forced to live of scraps from a table that could feed us all handsomely? 

&gt;It is only people starving to death who would be better off.

I'd happily take a hit in my living standards if it meant we didn't have starving people on the planet but the dirty secret is that I'm *going* to take a hit in my living standards as labour is replaced by automation and instead of less people starving *more* people will be. 

&gt;Why should I give up my house?

You wouldn't have to even while land is one of the few things that would remain scarce there's a shit load of it that we would be more free to use if we didn't have to worry about where we lived in terms of access to job and resource. We will also likely be looking to expand out into space where the reward for the hardworking and best people on the planet will be being in getting to do things no other human has done to colonise space to be pioneers. Instead of competing for food shelter and clothing we'll be competing to *do* things, fantastical wonderful things and isn't that better? 

&gt;Why should I work?

The question isn't why it's will you be able to and the answer is ""no, no you're not"" the labour market is going to crash any work there is is not work you'd have to do with in the system and the only reason for you to be doing is if the people who control that system force you to do so as means of control. 

In future the answer we should be able to give the question ""Why should I work?"" is just ""Why? Do you want to?""

&gt;What is the point of life if everyone is the same?

I'm not sure I understand are you saying that what we have is what we are and all that defines us is the stuff we have that other people don't? What an awful way to look at life... we are not all the same but in future we can allow everyone the same opportunities and they can take them or leave them as they like and we will free to find out what it means to be human when we do not have to worry about survival.

It doesn't matter where or who the report comes from, each authority will have their own guidelines as to what constitutes a pothole they need to make safe asap.  Usually this is either the depth of the hole or whether or not it caused accident or injury.

I urge you to report this immediately to your local council's highways department.  Give them as precise a location as possible (what town, what road, where along the road and where in the road) as well as details about the size and depth of the hole.  Make it clear that this has caused damage/injury and ask them to respond asap.

They probably won't do a permanent repair but they will at least fill it with loose material to 'make it safe' until a permanent repair can be made.  

Oh and regarding - 
&gt;It has been suggested to me that the reason councils don't sort them out is because it's cheaper to pay the compensation fees from people suing than it is to fix the problem. 

In the nicest way, that's utter bollocks. I've known of fatal accidents involving potholes and if it was up to the staff at the council I worked at, they'd have the budget, materials and workforce to get all potholes fixed immediately.  
Bear in mind that some councils have literally thousands of miles of road to deal with and only a limited number of staff to patrol, so some roads only get inspected once per year.  If they don't know about it, they can't fix it so tell them before a more serious accident occurs.

false,ninereeds314,null,null,"Remember how I said ""generally"" - as in I was speaking about the vast majority of people who can smoke an occasional joint or drink an occasional few glasses of wine without becoming addicts.

Remember how the point here started as ""comfort food"".

Remember my point that 20 stone excess bodyfat equates to roughly 10% excess calories sustained over 10 years. 10% excess doesn't sound so much like a metaphor for a heroine-addicted death-spiral does it?

""Smoke weed when stressed"" and ""crack open the wine after a bad day"" - that's something millions of people do without it spiraling out of control. 10% more, sustained over 10 years, means that occasional joint or occasional few glasses of wine is spiraling into a massively self-destructive addiction? No, I very much doubt it.

10% more calories in a day is well within normal variation. Sportspeople eat far more ""extra"" calories than that per day because they're burning it, yet don't get addicted to carbohydrates.

Even two or three times more calories on stressful days - a comfort food binge - should mean appetite regulation cuts in and people get less hungry over the next few days, skip a few meals and snacks, and end up having the number of calories they need in the long run. Sustained overeating is unpleasant, not comforting.

TV will have you believe that fat people are cramming their faces with whole packets of biscuits and cakes and extra meals day in day out. It's easy to see out-of-control addiction in that, but the reality is more like three chocolate digestive biscuits per day - again, that's for 20 stone extra bodyfat in 10 years.

Of course if someone's hungry, they're going to be stressed. And if their body needs some nutrient, they're going to be hungry. And if a hungry person eats, that provides at least temporary relief - until the body realizes it still hasn't got the nutrients it needs.

People use will power to diet, and after a while that will-power breaks, and that's when the big binge happens. These binges are spaced out - the math proves that massive overeating as an everyday thing simply doesn't happen. The diet is what causes the big binge, not an addiction.

A closer analogy would be smoking as stress relief. The fact is that nicotine triggers the stress response - smoking causes stress. But withdrawal causes far more stress, so it seems like not smoking causes stress when you're really just paying for the smoking you've already done.

The difference is that the obese never got addicted in the first place (in general - there are no doubt exceptions) - they just ate slightly more calories per day than others, which given that calories aren't all the same despite how nutritionists like to act, is entirely consistent with an unbalanced diet providing less protein than they need and maintaining a small but significant protein deficit.

Replace the three chocolate digestives with perhaps three or four boiled eggs and the deficit goes away, but that's not what the bullies are encouraging people to do, is it?

Relatively recently (over the last 10 years or so) it's getting more and more officially recognised that an increased proportion of protein in the diet tends to mean people eat fewer calories overall, leading to slow but sustained loss of excess body fat. What's apparently intolerable about my claim is that stress can lead to a need for a bit more protein - that bullying the obese can help cause the obesity.

OF course it's OK to claim that bullying the obese can cause obesity because the obese are week and pathetic and will run off and comfort themselves with masses of food like they supposedly always do, despite the fact that the math disproves that - three chocolate digestives per day, remember - but something physiological and unrelated to personality? Can't have that can we.

Does this mean as long as you give 6 months notice, you can break the contract? Personally mine have always been 1 month. 

Did you give 6 months? If so, don't settle for anything less than 100% of deposit. 

&gt;And does anyone know of the next steps I could take from NZ? I sent an email to him last week giving him until the end of the month to deposit the ~£900 into our account. But other than that I'm not too sure how best to proceed.

Email him again and demand the details for the deposit protection scheme he put your money into. Do not accept the £900. Deposit protection schemes don't hold all your money if you dispute. They only hold the disputed amount. So they'd give you £900 and hold back £900 until the dispute is settled. 

And you have to authorise any funds the landlord wishes to take. They can't do it unilaterally. If £900 turns up in your account, it means he didn't put it in a scheme and you're entitled to £5,400. 

I hate landlords. If I came up to you and said 'Give me £900 or else' you'd punch me in the face. But for some reason Landlords manage to get away with it every day.

His comments do nothing to help the healing process. Instead of using his influence to direct his followers towards something productive, like coming together to see through further devolution, he's using his time on TV to demonise 55% of the electorate. For example, when US Presidential candidates lose their campaigns, they tend to put a positive spin on it and direct their otherwise disappointed followers towards unity and cooperation: Salmond directs his followers to regard everyone who didn't vote his way as less intelligent than those who voted his way.

I'm amazed you keep making excuses for this, as if it's totally acceptable and fair. What Salmond is doing is the definition of sore loser: 'I only lost because Westminster lied and cheated and the electorate are old and gullible!'

Are you seriously going to tell me that's statesmanlike? Are you seriously going to tell me there's nothing wrong with the First Minister of Scotland going on TV and telling the world he lost because people are old and gullible?

Yes supporters are going to start saying that themselves now, and No supporters are pretty fucking insulted by it. Put those two together and you have social issues.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Their primary objective is to unify the Middle East under a particularly grim and violent form of Sunni Islam. And the best recruiting tool for ISIS, as for Al Qaeda, has been an America bent on intervention. The limited interventions that we typically undertake today, relying on drone strikes and/or house raids by special forces, all too often set communities against America; such actions may kill one or five or thirty “bad guys”—and create ten or fifty or five hundred more.

This is why ISIS has dedicated so much propaganda toward the West, and why it makes such a gruesome show of beheading Western journalists: ISIS is terrified that America will not get involved. American interventions can make a potential ISIS recruit out of someone whose uncle's house was destroyed by a drone, or help ISIS demagogues blame the United States for the plight of refugees stuck in camps. To someone who has suffered loss or displacement, religious extremism may seem attractive in comparison. When an extremist mullah cuts off the hand of a thief, the act may be barbaric, but it has a measure of logic behind it—unlike, say, a drone strike that wipes out a family celebrating a wedding. Having America as a military enemy helps miscreants like Al Qaeda and ISIS galvanize constituent populations in ways that they cannot if they are seen as merely waging a battle for supremacy with rival believers or ethnic groups. What ISIS relies on is a kind of bait-and-switch. They need us as their enemy.

Proponents of a limited intervention against ISIS advocate a combination of counterterrorism plus the military help of a regional proxy. But who should that be? Since neither Iran nor Assad’s Syrian government are acceptable, we are actively considering both the Kurds and the moderate Syrian rebel alliance known as the Free Syrian Army (or FSA). Both options come with severe drawbacks. Arming the Kurds means abandoning the geographical structure of Iraq—a structure that has remained intact since the era of British rule—while enraging and destabilizing our NATO partner Turkey, which has its own Kurdish separatist problem. As for the FSA, they are notoriously unreliable; any weapons or aid we give them tend to end up in the hands of ISIS or the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.

We cannot simply will a politically convenient partner into existence. In the absence of such a partner we are likely to fall back on the “whack-a-mole” approach of targeting and killing high-ranking terrorists via air strikes or drone strikes, or with Special Operations soldiers such as SEALs, Rangers, Delta, and other deployable (and often deniable) assets. The primary argument against this approach is that we’ve been doing it since September 11, 2001, and the bad guys keep coming. Meanwhile, there's no sign that the ever-popular resort to ""surgical"" airstrikes will deliver what we want. In his masterful book, The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam, Mark Clodfelter argues that bombing does very little to stop people from picking up arms in a conflict. What I observed in two and a half years of combat in Afghanistan convinced me he is right.

And what is it that we want, in fact? What rationale lies behind the move to expand our military actions in the region? Some who support greater military intervention in Iraq and Syria cite concern that the United States is about to be attacked by ISIS. But these concerns are wildly inflated; when weighed against, say, the violent deaths caused by the drug war in Mexico, or the potential for thermonuclear war with Russia, the actual threat posed to America by ISIS is trivial. ISIS and Al Qaeda are primarily interested in attacking other groups in their area, with a notable but secondary or tertiary desire to export their violence to America. And intelligence agencies agree; as the New York Times reported recently, no intelligence exists to suggest that ISIS is planning an attack on the United States.

As for using the military for humanitarian missions, yes, there are times when intervention makes sense as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted and we must act to avert catastrophe. Bill Clinton has said that doing nothing during the Rwandan genocide was his greatest regret as president. But such actions require “boots on the ground”—and nobody on the left or right is advocating a full-scale, boots-on-the ground invasion of Iraq or Syria. Air power alone, meanwhile, has rarely stopped a genocide, and the groups we’ve paid over the years to act as our proxies have usually ended up conducting ethnic cleansings of their own. Furthermore, we have not used sanctions to discourage the states, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, that are supporting ISIS; indeed we haven't even explored that possibility, at least not publicly. Either stopping genocide isn’t our real objective—whether it should be is a different discussion—or we’re applying the wrong set of tools to the problem.

With all the money we have spent—on military invasions, bombs, carrier-group deployments, handouts to corrupt Afghans and Iraqis masquerading as well-intentioned reconstruction efforts—and all the blood we’ve shed, it’s worth reviewing the fruits of our labor. Afghanistan: the Taliban in control of large swaths of countryside, warlords in control of most of the rest. Iraq: an unmitigated disaster, recoverable only by allying with a country led by Holocaust-deniers. Libya: equally grim, thanks to well-armed and dedicated Islamist fighters. Egypt: back under the control of a hated dictator. Yemen: beset by Al Qaeda, Sunni separatists in the east, and Shia separatists in the north and west. Syria: twice as bad as Iraq, if that’s possible.

This is what intervention has produced—or at least failed to prevent.

 

THERE ARE WAYS TO fight ISIS and Al Qaeda without using bullets or bombs. We can hit them where it really hurts: by reaching the people they cultivate as future fighters. The best way to curb these groups is to address the situation that gave rise to them in the first place—namely, the refugee camps, like those in Pakistan that provided so many Pashtun Sunnis willing to fight against the Soviets, and the secular Afghans that succeeded them. Our best long-term chance for success is to take responsibility for refugee camps, making sure that the 2 million displaced Syrians have a chance at a normal life. Make sure they’re educated, to Western standards. Fed, to Western standards. Brought into the global community. That’s the real fight. There isn’t much we can do about the eighteen-year-old jihadist who's carrying an M4 he picked up off the body of an American-trained FSA militiaman or Iraqi soldier. Our real target is the ten-year-old kid who’s listening to a radical Islamic preacher tell him that the only true way is jihad.

Violence begets violence, revenge begets revenge. America has sufficient resources to keep fighting for years, but not indefinitely, and that’s exactly what Osama bin Laden hoped—that we’d exhaust and bankrupt ourselves, fighting in a thousand little conflicts, while providing a recruiting tool for his side's propagandists. Dropping bombs won’t restabilize the region in the short run, while empowering groups like ISIS (or worse) in the long run.  With aid, however, we can prevent ISIS from coming back ten times stronger a decade from now. Iran seems fully committed to propping up Iraq and Assad’s regimes. Let’s let them. It’s time we started spending our money on the future, instead of continuing to condemn our present to an irretrievable past.

That the defeat of the Yes camp can be boiled down to nothing more than 'old people' and 'gullible people'.

That Westminster ""orchestrated"" (Salmond's words) the very long list of businesses and business leaders that opposed Independence.

That ""scaremongering"" was the sole objective of the large and diverse array of people, businesses and think tanks that questioned almost every aspect of the White Paper.

Pretty much everything that went against Salmond is being written off by that man as Westminster propaganda and scaremongering.

The definition of 'conspiracy' is 'the act of plotting or conspiring' and the definition of 'conspire' is 'making of secret plans jointly to cause harm'.

Alex Salmond is alleging conspiracy theories by reeling off excuses about Westminster propaganda, old/gullible people, and any questioning of his grand, perfect plan for a land of milk and honey.

I'm not sure how much more plainly I can put this: he's alleging conspiracies to excuse his electoral defeat. He's alleging improper cooperation among the Westminster establishment to dupe people into voting No and to bring about criticisms of his otherwise perfect plans during the referendum campaign itself.

But in truth a lot of you hold tacit support to what the UK government does to peoples lives in the ME. You simplify and breakdown the constructs of exceptionally complex issues until they are baseless. So under that context - if a terrorist see's his people threatened again and the british hold tacit support for what is tantamount to terrorism - is him blowing himself up on a bus justified? I'd probably argue it is after talking to some of you today.

To elaborate, yes they are bad people but the Iraqi government is not much better. The primary justification for supporting the Iraqi government given in public is because they are a democratically elected government and to prevent the slaughter of civilians but the current Iraqi government was not democratically elected and has tacitly supported the slaughter of minority groups for the last 9 years and we didn't give a shit about it. 

&gt; the Iraqi government has become increasingly authoritarian and is characterized by serious human rights violations and repression of journalists. Poverty, insecurity, a deteriorated social welfare system, and corruption effectively block citizens from meaningful democratic participation. 

http://costsofwar.org/article/did-wars-bring-democracy-afghanistan-and-iraq

http://www.hrw.org/publications/reports?topic=All&amp;region=227

And they are resorting to the exact same tactics as the IS in the current conflict: 

http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/killings-derail-talks-new-iraq-government-201482371354688320.html

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28274742

I feel the difference between IS and the Iraqi government is that we have a vested interest in supporting the Iraqi Government because they are pro-western, not because they are a democratically elected or to save civilians. It's about oil and influence again.

So, while I have no doubt whatsoever that IS are currently probably killing more civilians than the Iraqi government, I do not believe that the difference is significant enough to warrant an invasion which will kill even more civilians and potentially cement long term resentment in the area. Let's not forget that the strength of the IS movement was a near direct response to our invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place.

On to the more conspiritard stuff that I don't believe exactly but I'd like more information on: First I don't think IS actually represent a credible threat to the Iraqi government, the numbers don't add up. IS has about 50,000 fighters while the Iraqi Army has access to 800,000 and 14,000 in their air force with around 500 fighter jets. Someone needs to explain to me why the Iraqi government can't deal with this threat themselves before I will support the idea we need to bomb IS troops,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Air_Force

In addition, I feel that there is a propaganda campaign being run to support the idea of going to war. I can't really support that with links because the main ""Evidence"" I have is the absence of significant coverage of the bad behaviour of the Iraqi government. Although most news outlets have carried at least one front page talking about ISIS massacres, I never saw a single front page devoted to the shitty behaviour of the Iraqi government.

Finally, and I admit this is tenuous, there is a lot of talk about IS killing civilians but the Iraqi government has been supporting ""militia"" fighters attacking IS for quite a while now:

&gt; Diyala police officials told the Reuters news agency they had provided Shia militias with names for hit lists so that suspected members of the Islamic State group could be tracked and executed.

http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/killings-derail-talks-new-iraq-government-201482371354688320.html

I find myself wondering how many of the ""civilians"" being killed by the IS at the moment would find themselves classified as ""enemy combatants"" if we happened to drop bombs on them while they were in Afghanistan?

To put another slant on this, what the UN actually said about IS human rights violations is:

&gt; But the United Nations Human Rights chief, Navi Pillay, said the summary executions “may run into the hundreds” and that she was “extremely alarmed.”

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/13/isis-beheadings-and-the-success-of-horrifying-violence/

Whereas we know for a fact that the Iraqi government *has* summarily executed hundreds of people (see above links). Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt that IS are a bad bunch and I wont feel bad if we do launch air strike against them. The concern I have is that what we see as an especially barbaric group is actually business as usual in that particular part of the world and our outrage is simply the result of looking closely at it for the first time.",0,1411735185,null,0,false,0,ckt18t7,t3_2higur,t1_ckt18t7,t3_2higur,null,1426814765,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Then the science block will be over-run with bears, the desks will be full of Ebola, and the playing field will be infected with evil spirits as a result of challenging a moral imperative, so the students will all be twisted inside out by demons as there’ll be no money in the budget for an exorcist.”""

Not really. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are massively Pro-EU because it's the only reasonable way for them to become independent. That's pretty clear.

As for being a world power, we can't make our trade agreements and don't even get a spot at the World Trade Organisation, we could instead have closely links with the other Anglo- Saxon countries in the Commonwealth.

For the simple fact that governments are wasteful organisations. It costs them a huge amount of money just to decide what to do with the money. That waste would be better taken up by individuals spending their own time and giving it directly to the charities they want to support.

All reputable charities publish their figures so you can see who's spending more of the donations they receive.

I have no idea whether people would actually increase their giving but ultimately it's up to them to decide. Right now we have a situation where nobody asked us about charitable giving, and tax money raised by us is simply being taken away and spent abroad. Many people do not agree with that.

And you think they're not going to capitalise on it to attempt another referendum or galvanise support? Even I, as a staunch unionist agree with the SNP that its unfair for Scotland to be pulled out of the EU against their wishes and I would probably support another referendum in any case. 

If you thought the warnings of economic downturn from the Scottish referendum was bad wait till you tell the international stage that you're planning on leaving one of the biggest trade blocks on Earth and at the same time pulling tons of internationals companies European headquarters currently based in the UK out of the EU.

It would be easy pickings for the SNP to paint the UK as a failing state on the road to ruin and Farrage and UKIP aren't going to be the people who make Scotland want to stay.

&gt; As for being a world power, we can't make our trade agreements and don't even get a spot at the World Trade Organisation, we could instead have closely links with the other Anglo- Saxon countries in the Commonwealth.

If you think we'll have more power negotiating with the US as just the UK vs the whole EU then you have another thing coming, they'd rape us for all we've got and if it was a UKIP/Tory coalition then god help the UK as they'd privatise the lot for quick bucks.

As house prices rise they increase the wealth of those who already own one, while keeping out those that don't.

As far as I can tell, UKIP's only housing policy is ""British homes for British people"" with regards to social housing. Only about 6.5% of social tenants are not British/Irish, or 250,000 households. Business groups say that the UK needs to build 240,000 houses a year to tackle rising costs, but Nigel Farage says they are the only party being honest about housing.

Increasing the amount of houses built would be the best way to add another step to the ladder for many people currently left out of the property market. Those aged 45 and over currently owns 72% of all owner-occupied households in England, as well as many of the privately rented houses, and they are who would lose the most if housebuilding increased.

Coincidentally, 71% of UKIPs voters are aged 40 or older.

Nigel Farage may say he's helping the squeezed middle with his tax cuts, but he's still avoiding the biggest issue many in the squeezed middle face because it would hurt his voter base. In other words, populism.

It could also tax unproductive parts of the economy. It is very poor economics to think an individual and an economy are similar economic entities. It is also dangerous to think what is right for an individual is right for the economy, for example it is good for an individual to pay off their debts, but if everyone in the economy did it, it would destroy the economy (Cameron did not know this when he called for everyone to pay off their debts but he was rightly criticized for his comments).

&gt;The __Tompkins Table__ is an annual ranking that lists the [Colleges of the University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_of_the_University_of_Cambridge) in order of their undergraduate students' performances in that year's examinations. It was created in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, then a third-year undergraduate [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) student at [Trinity College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge), who compiles it every year exclusively for the newspaper *[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent)*,  and is not an official [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) table.

Money != support

My school was getting good grades but it was a grammar school so it was always going to get good grades, the grades were far short of where they could have been though (comparing it to other grammar schools).

If the under performing schools were improving or had a plan to improve that required some financial contribution then I would be absolutely fine with that. That is not what happened, the LEA would just give them money inversely proportional to how well they performed. They were getting ludicrous amounts of money that they didn't even know what to do with (at one point every single class room had an interactive whiteboard and they still bought more for spares because they didn't know what to do with the money).

Since becoming an academy my old school's grades have improved far more than any of the ""under performing"" schools have so you could argue that my school was under performing the most.

It may seem like they are, but broadly they're not.

There are professional bodies with voluntary codes of conduct, but it's not compulsory to be a member.

They're less regulated than plumbers in reality. You do not require any qualifications or vetting to call yourself an estate agent. (You do need a qualification to be a plumber however!)

Obviously explicitly causing someone to lose money can open yourself up to being sued, but that's the same with anything - there's no regulation saying you can't behave unprofessionally or give a better service if you give them kickbacks. (This is explicitly illegal in most professions)

It's a shame because obviously some estate agents do go out of their way to behave like a traditional professional, like an accountant or lawyer. 

They're sullied by the fact that anyone at any time can start their own estate agency and really there is little incentive to operate with professionalism beyond getting more business.

In my limited experience, estate agents can and do break both the law and normal professional guidelines, but there is no enforcement (my MP has been seeking clarification on whether there is any penalty for breaking the law, no clarification so far) and the adage ""hate the game, not the player"" is very relevant - this is the way it works in the UK where lettings and estate agents are the gatekeepers so you need to play by their rules.",0,1411737860,null,0,false,0,ckt25fs,t3_2hiu6m,t1_ckt25fs,t1_ckt1goc,null,1426814342,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

If you were being at bit broader and considering his play when the ball is in the air at any time. I also recall his goal against Ludogorets coming from him bringing down a cross from Moreno, and Sterlings vs West Ham coming from him bringing down a cross from Enrique.

Yes, yes it can and it's already happening there's examples of it in the video I like which I'll presume you've not bothered to watch?  We are at heart complex biological machines and unless you subscribe to the idea that we have a spiritual soul that sits apart from reality there is nothing we can do that we could not, in time, build machines to do as well.  

&gt;To be equal we would all have to live in identical houses with identical possessions, identical food, identical everything. Otherwise it isn't fair to the people who don't have the same things as you.

What is equal about me having to have to stuff I don't want because you like it? You are slipping back into this idea of people being nothing more than the things they have while ignoring that this is about access and availability... what you do or do not currently have means little when you could largely have anything you wanted produced on demand. In other words we can have a society where everyone's basic needs are met and most of our non basic ones as well and what matters is that we have equal access to the things and opportunities that *we* want.

&gt;So what is the point? You can only do what everyone else does, everyone has the same opportunity to do the same job. If you become an astronaut then someone else cannot and that isn't fair on them so we can not have astronauts.

This is so garbled a comment I'm not sure where to start with it but lets go with the kind option... Apparently I wasn't clear that I was talking about fairness in the equal access to opportunities which fundamentally does not exist now but could in the future in which those few things that remain rivalrous are open to everyone who wishes to compete for them because no one is forced to have to do things they don't want to simply to eke out a living. 

We can have what we need and could mostly have what we want and do what we like and the competition is moved from survival and resources to more abstract things like actual experiences... I say actual because at this level of advanced technology that we can have at least very near life like VR and that's a whole other rabbit hole.

so how is us attacking them going to lead to anything but them attacking us? surely standing back and trying diplomacy would be a better solution if radicalized groups always use force against force?

as for IS and insanity, is IS any more insane than Saudi Arabia? they both behead people. Both have strict religious laws. are they any more insane than Iran? Israel? Egypt?  lets face it, they all have their atrocities.

the case for attacking is not entirely plausible or intelligent to me.

The reason was that we let houses to students, and the university had the power to blacklist any agency that screwed over their tenants. As a result, none of the agencies in the town (as far as I'm aware) charged extra fees to students. The collective power of the student's union was enough to stop agencies from misbehaving. 

That said, I know that other agencies in the town who also let to non-students would charge fees, because they could. They do it because the tenants are willing to pay for it, and if everyone does it, you can't object by going to another agency. Anywhere where the demand for housing exceeds supply, the amount a tenant will have to pay goes up. This may be through higher rent, or higher admin fees. It's a free market, so unless demand drops, or the government steps in and regulates things, it is not going to change.

There would also be a cap on how much rent can be increased by each year, probably by using a % of the regional average model. 

Personally I'd like to see them both go further and commit to establishing a compulsory national register of landlords, paid for by a small annual subscription from landlords of around £50, and perhaps £5 for each additional property. The body would have the power to ""strike-off"" landlords in a similar way to how the General Medical Council or Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council can strike off healthcare professionals. Landlords would have a legal duty to inform the register if they receive a criminal conviction. Certain offenses (like those that result in being placed on the sex offenders register, or having a child placed on the child protection register) would result in an automatic ban from renting. Other offenses that might result in a ban from renting would be things like being declared bankrupt. 

The idea of the changes would be to make landlords personally responsible for the quality of their own operation. Instead of just being some *""guy with a house""* they'd need to professionalize themselves into a proper transparent industry. In the long term the hope would be that it encourages ""one man band"" BTL landlords to either group up into more serious companies or to move out of the industry entirely.

&gt;

&gt;""__Love &amp; Monsters__"" is the tenth [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [second series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_2\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, first broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 17 June 2006. It was written by executive producer and lead writer [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) and directed by [Dan Zeff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Zeff).

&gt;The series typically follows alien time traveller [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) (in his [tenth incarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor), played by [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant)) and his [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\))(s) (at this time [Rose Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler), played by [Billie Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Piper)), who travel around time and space in a machine called the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS). However, ""Love &amp; Monsters"" follows a contemporary ordinary man named Elton Pope ([Marc Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Warren)) who becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box, and joins a group of like-minded people in hopes of finding him. But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy ([Peter Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kay)) joins the group, the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his interests. Kennedy ultimately turns out to be a creature called the Abzorbaloff.

&gt;Due to the addition of a [Christmas special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christmas_Invasion) in the production schedule, an episode had to be ""double banked"" with another story (in this case ""[The Impossible Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Planet)"" and ""[The Satan Pit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satan_Pit)"") for production to finish on time. With ""Love &amp; Monsters"", Davies was able to tell a story from a different character's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper. The ""Doctor-lite"" and ""companion-lite"" structure has since continued in the programme. The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity, as it was the winner of a *[Blue Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter)* children's competition to design a *Doctor Who* monster. ""Love &amp; Monsters"" was watched by 6.66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans. Some praised the complexities of the script, while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour. Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions.

false,lettingagentuk,null,null,"Letting Agent here. The trouble is lettings (like sales, though more in the spotlight currently due to how massive it is) is very much a genuine industry, populated by a *lot* of unscrupulous agents. This happens very often and very easily due to a lack of regulation. As of 1st of October all letting agents need to belong to a redress scheme, of which the Property Ombudsman is the ideal, but that's another story.


As someone has already said, anyone can become a letting agent overnight and start operating. Landlords/tenants who have only scoured the market in the short term won't necessarily know the good from the bad. Or on the other hand, some landlords *do*, but opt for those with the cheaper fees - a big problem within the industry.


Lettings is a free market, meaning anyone can charge what they like. If a landlord or tenant agrees to it (typically by signing a contract) then this is essentially their decision. These charges can apply to how much a landlord pays to let and/or manage the property, how much the tenant pays to undergo references, administer the paperwork etcetera etcetera. A lot of tenants (and people in general) seem to think the landlord is our client, so why are we being charged? Well essentially it's not exactly true, we are providing a service to both parties. The landlord gets a paying tenant, the tenant gets a place to live. Sure, the tenant pays the landlord rent, but they are still using the agency for a service, however small it is. Therefore whatever a tenant pays should always be less than a landlord pays. The trouble arises when agencies recognise the opportunity to implement a higher charge than normal to exploit a tenant's position.


Specifically regarding renewals, the amount of work an agent does is relatively little, depending on whether or not you need to be re-referenced etc. Generally they will charge between £25-£50 including VAT, maybe going higher in more affluent areas. This is generally fair. You do hear of cases where agencies charge upwards of £100 per person to renew, which is of course ridiculous and can't be justified. However, if this is detailed in your tenancy agreement and you have signed it, guess what? It's owed.


The lettings market is so busy that tenants often don't have the *choice* of which agent they use - if they see a property they like they take it before someone else does.


Believe me not all agents are rip off merchants as the media and tenants with bad experiences will have you believe. There are certainly more good than bad out there. Unfortunately for us (and for the public's faith) it is the minority which let us down. Not always overnight pop-ups; some long-standing, established companies can act rogue too. But it is always those stories that you hear, not the 90% of times when everything goes smoothly and everybody ends up happy.


* *edit - just to add a couple of pro-tips.*

Try and choose a good agent through research, word of mouth etc. Not always easy as, as I said, generally only the bad things get publicised, and it's not always an option anyway if they have the property you want/need.

**ALWAYS** read the contract before you sign it. Specifically look for charges you are likely to incur during your tenancy, such as renewal fees. If there's anything you don't like the look of, or disagree with, query it. Agencies would rather remove or reduce a future charge, than risk you walking away altogether.

If a charge isn't detailed in your contract, the agent can't charge it. Simple as that. Likewise if it is detailed, they can't charge a penny above what's been agreed.",0,1411740562,null,0,1411741041,0,ckt38hy,t3_2hiu6m,t1_ckt38hy,t3_2hiu6m,null,1426813837,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

English players have been massively overhyped for ages. It really is only the last 8 years that English fans have come back down to Earth and realized that there are maybe only one or two world class English players in this generation.

These are the things that happen when a club gets a global brand. Attitudes towards the clubs and players regionally diffuse. Indonesia Spurs supports the club differently that Argentina Spurs, and America Spurs supports it differently than North London. When you become global, you are accepting that you are gifting the club to people who may not even care about the same things regarding Spurs to you, and you have to accept that.

Yedlin is an exciting player. He has the WC buzz around him, he has exciting attributes (attacking flair, loads of pace) that people often overvalue, And yes, he is the entry point for an entire country of soccer fans frothing at the mouth to support a club with the history and philosophy that Tottenham has.

           Lloris      
Dier Kaboul Vertonghen Rose  
     Capoue Dembele      
  Lennon Eriksen Lamela       
          Adebayor  


Issues: 
- Dier lacks pace and natural positioning at RB. Naughton is in our first team to play RB/CB as cover. Let's use him for that exact purpose. 
- Kaboul has been shocking, but while he is a mental leader for our team, he plays much better with a defender who holds the back-line accountable. See:
- Vertonghen: If he is fit, should probably get the start. Chiriches is a nightmare for tricks and Sanchez/Welbeck will strip him. Fazio doesn't look PL ready to deal with a NLD. You might find different. 
- Rose: Warrants his place without argument. Moving on.
- Capoue and Dembele: Capoue and Dembele compliment each other. ESPECIALLY when Dembele shows up. Capoue *is* the pivot that allows us to play out of defence. We're going to have a difficult time as we know Arsenal is not a team to drop and condede space in the middle 3rd of the pitch. Dembele's role here in Poch's system reveals that he is going to be that guy who can box to box and provide much crisper passes when Eriksen/Lamela are being boxed out of the play. SPeaking of that:
- Eriksen and Lamela: Should start, obviously, but they are a tricky pair. Eriksen loves the hole, and Lamela always wants to drift inside. If Lamela goes LW, Rose has to play smarter about when to overlap to widen our penetration, or suffer from Erik's lack of defensive duties. Eriksen and Lamela need serious chemistry strengthening and I don't see it coming easy. 
- Lennon: This is controversial because we all know how Lennon's form is pretty much as good as my Sunday League Teams. It's non-existent. If our peppy Lennon shows up to run the RB down for 60 minutes, then beautiful. If he actually figures out a cross, even more so. What we don't want is our RW to be. The alternative here is Lamela in his place with Chadli taking up the LW duty. To be honest, I'd prefer this against Arsenal who are going to be having Sanchez run that line as well. Lamela isn't physical or defensively aware enough. 
- Ade: Only because he shows up for these. He has that chip that has to prove to Arsenal he is better than them. If THAT Ade shows up, god have mercy on their souls. Also, he can hold a ball up in the middle of the pitch and is quite the smart player who sees the tiniest of openings in channels. We need that hold up play to allow overlap from Lamela/Eriksen.

Adebayor has the lead the line with Eriksen behind him for almost the entirety of the Premier League season so far. With the exception of the games against QPR and Sunderland (in patches), it has been with very limited effectiveness. Put those two against Arsenal and I don't see that we'll give a weak Arsenal back 4 all that many problems. Yes, our midfield might be more orthodox, with Erisken spearheading a 3, but we'll be playing right into Arsenal's hands. A midfield they can outclass and a strike force that hasn't been firing all season. 

With Adebayor sitting behind Soldado, we would carry that much more threat and it would give us a proper focal point of attack. Lamela and Lennon can sit a little deeper than otherwise and squeeze the centre of the pitch if necessary, but even just with Adebayor doing more defensive work than he's usually asked to do, I don't think Arsenal would walk through us as easily as you think.

false,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"So I'm one of those toffee-nosed elitist Oxford grads. Beware! 


&gt;How did you pick you your uni and course?


I never wanted to go to Oxford. In fact even after I had my offer I didn't want to. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in, that people would look down on me because I was a working/lower-middle class kid from Liverpool. Of course in the end that turned out to be nonsense, and I loved it.

I was always one of the brightest kids in my class at school. When I was in Year 5 I had a teacher tell me that I would end up at Oxford or Cambridge one day (non-Britbongs, that's like 9 years old). However I've never really wanted to go - my parents pushed me and I had some encouraging teachers.

I guess I just figured I should go there because that's what you do when you're a smart kid - you apply for one of the top universities. As for the course, I wavered a lot between History and English Lit but a couple of things swayed me:

*  I went to an Oxbridge ""open day"" event up in Manchester. Pretty much an outreach where prospective candidates could learn about the universities. The guy doing the English Lit one was this awful, posh, embarrassingly nerdy guy called Ollie. I did not want to be an Ollie.

* I got really into historical fiction (thanks, based Bernard Cornwall!)

* We studied pre-revolutionary France at A-level, which was amazing stuff.

I love reading and I always have, but whereas I was worried I'd get bored doing literature for three years I knew that history would be endlessly fascinating. So that settled it!


&gt;What was the process like applying to a university?


Nerve-wracking but fun. They really put me through my paces. The Oxford process is a pain in the arse, and requires you to get your UCAS forms in months early. It goes like this:

* Pick a college to apply for, or select an open application. Here's where you can game the system, by picking an unpopular college or subject combo so that you'll be competing against fewer people. History at Christ Church? Yeah, good luck. Geography at LMH? Probably got a a better chance. Also we were told not to apply to the same colleges because the chance of them taking *two* kids from the same state school was small. At least, that's what we thought - later on I learned that everything I was told was basically false, and on top of that if you're a good enough candidate they'll usually squeeze you in at another college. I ended up choosing Magdalen College, because someone else in our year was going for Merton.

* UCAS form goes in, complete with endlessly tweaked personal statement and a sample, *marked* essay. Mine was on the Duke of Orleans, regent of France. He was a dissolute, inebriated bastard - but an effective regent.

* You sit the HAT, or History Aptitude Test. This is a test based on periods and historical situations you won't have studied. It's about explaining what you could assume from the text. I think mine was about Polish Kings but from it you could surmise that there'd just been a rebellion, that kings were often elected and so on. It was difficult but a really great exercise. Study of History at school is almost entirely about learning rote facts and writing essays from textbooks, but at university you start to grapple with the big questions: ""what is history?"", ""why do we learn it?"", provenance, cultural and political context. All that stuff. The test is about two hours long and pretty difficult.

* If you passed your HAT and your form impresses you go to interview. This is about half a week to a week spent living in an Oxford college, and during that time you have three or four interviews with your prospective tutors. Tabloids love saying how tricky they are, and they love to imply that there are unanswerable questions. Really though, they fail to understand that interviews are about *how you think*, not what you know. Nobody expects you to be able to calculate the amount of methane in a cow - but they *do* expect you to explain that it could be worked out by choosing a hypothetical figure for the total amount expelled, divide by number of cows etc etc.

I had three interviews while I was there. The first was based on the essay I'd submitted and was really in-depth, picking apart everything I'd written. The second was on a paragraph I'd never seen before from an historical document - had to read it and then answer questions. The third was similar to the second, but based on a picture/woodcut from the Middle Ages (a knight riding towards a castle - but the subtext was about the Black Death).

These interviews are *hard*, but very fair. They are looking for passion in the subject, evidence of engagement and that you've done independent reading, all that stuff. Their general criteria are:

* Intellectual curiosity
* Conceptual clarity
* Flexibility - the capacity to engage with alternative perspectives and/or new information
* Accuracy and attention to detail
* Critical engagement
* Capacity for hard work
* Enthusiasm for History
* Evidence of historical imagination and understanding, in particular, the ability to speculate and compare, alongside the possession of appropriate historical knowledge and the capacity to deploy it.

Following that I got an offer - AAA. Then all I had to do (hah!) was meet that at A-Level.


&gt;What exactly do you do at university?


Study, a *lot*. Although Oxford students aren't as worked to the bone as you might imagine (in History at least), you're talking about three 2000 word essays every fortnight. Teaching time is about an hour a week, in small groups (tutorials) and there are only a handful of lectures. The lectures are really useful background material but rarely focused enough on your specific question to be of use when writing essays - I rarely went to them and still did OK. The vast majority of my work time was done in getting books out of the library and then ploughing through them. Maybe four or five per essay (though not reading cover to cover, of course) and then whatever articles I could get on JSTOR. Then each week I'd have my essay surgically dissected by some incredibly intelligent don, and feel rubbish.

That's where the social side comes in! Every college has a bar, and every bar caters for the student crowd. I got very drunk, very cheaply, a lot of nights. I also ran one of the student societies and spent a fair amount of time hanging around with people from other colleges and dating around. Oxford is a great place to date - everyone is similarly intelligent and committed to their work and nobody cares if you're a nerd. It's awesome.

The start of every term is the time for Collections - basically mini examinations to see how well you learned last term's material. End of first year is Prelims - fail these and you get kicked out. Then for Finals I had seven three-hour exams (write three essays in each) and two pieces of work submitted beforehand: a 12,000 word thesis and a 6,000 word extended essay.


&gt;What is after university - can you look for work placement in your 2nd year? etc...


Not in History, although plenty of people did banking internships over the summer of 2nd year. Work generally is discouraged at Oxford - we only have eight week terms and a ton of stuff to cram in - and you're not allowed to get a full-time job at any point. Part-time is acceptable but you have to flag it up to your tutors.


&gt;Anything you wish you knew before hand?


More about History? Otherwise not really - I would hate to go back and re-do it with what I know now, because part of the joy of the university experience was discovering new ideas, theories, meeting new types of people etc. Before I went to Oxford I'd never encountered fundamentalist Christians, never met an American, never had any gay friends, knew nothing about a whole host of cultures etc etc. Learning that stuff for the first time in an intellectual, welcoming environment was amazing.


&gt;I'm thinking about studying something with design (graphics).


Good for you! Chase that dream!


&gt;Who has studied design and what are your experiences?


Can't help you there, but my tip as a job is to look at the food industry - artwork people are always in demand and people forget that the food industry exists


&gt;Does a degree really increase your earning potential, especially in something like design?


Most jobs I've been in won't take people without a degree, even if the job itself doesn't really require one. People use it as an indication of quality, of being able to achieve something. I have had a couple of co-workers who have been able to demonstrate skill, experience and so on and therefore circumvented that requirement but often you won't get that chance. If the job requires a degree and you don't have one, most companies will just ignore your application.

That being said, it's not the be-all-and-end-all. I'm not sure how it works in design but I'm in the food industry and plenty of people don't have degrees - they've worked from the bottom up.


&gt;Any other tips?


If you go, have fun. You will never have such a small amount of personal responsibility again. You'll never be in an environment with thousands of similarly-aged, similarly-intelligent people again. Join every society you can, take up every weird sport you can. You're going to have the rest of your life to spend your downtime chilling on the sofa or whatever - use these three/four years when you're time-rich and responsibility-poor to really find out what you love in life. *Use it*


&gt;Is there something everyone MUST know before hand?


How to down a pint is pretty useful. Otherwise, not really. Just go in with an open mind and a positive attitude. Work hard, but also have fun. 

If you've made it this far then this is probably the most important piece of advice relating to my *specific* uni experience: if you think you might get good grades at A-Level then apply for Oxbridge. Don't be put off by what you imagine it'll be like, or by worries you won't fit in. I *loved* it, and am so, so glad that I had pushy people in my life who made me apply.

Sadly there is no easy answer to this.  They stand they are killed.  They take part, they are doing the killing.  Someone needs to be willing to stand with them.

See here for a 6' 25 year old male:

 1. If you are 175 lbs your body needs: 2500kcals a day. Say you over eat by 250 calories daily for a total of 2750 then you'll start to gain weight however.
 2. At some point you will weight 210lbs: you now need 2750 to maintain THE SAME activity level. You've balanced out your excess. So to keep gaining weight (because 210 really isn't that heavy) you must still have an excess but even more additional eating. Now you are eating 3000kcal.

 3. 3000kcal would get you to 250lbs.

3000kcal is quite a lot additional of food, and that to hold 250lbs, not continue to increase. Equally for someone 250lbs to loose weight they'd only need to 2750, at least to the weight starts to move then they'll need to reduce further.

A simple example of this that we saw a lot last season Skrtel for has pretty poor awareness and when other teams break quickly against him he doesn't have a clue what's over his shoulder. This results in a ball over the top beating him because he doesn't drop onto the man behind him until it's too late.  Because of how aggressive we are with our full backs getting forward, we ask our CBs to cover the large space between the fullback and CB on either side. It's a positional deficiency, but not necessarily a systemic problem. I don't think the space is too much to cover, rather the defender is being negligent in his duty to cover it.

I don't necessarily mean to single Skrtel out here  as they all have their problems, he's just a simple example to explain.

- just walk away and see the party executive fight amongst themselves and have a proper election.

&gt;The __War in the North__, in the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) was the campaign in which the Nationalist forces defeated and occupied the parts of northern [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) that remained loyal to the [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic) government. The campaign included several separate battles. The [Biscay Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscay_Campaign) resulted in the loss of the part of the [Basque Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community\)) still held by the Republic and [Bilbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bilbao), the greatest Spanish industrial center. This part of the campaign saw the [Bombing of Guernica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Guernica) and [Durango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango,_Spain). The [Battle of Santander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Santander) caused the loss of the province of Santander in [Cantabrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabria) [Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Castile) for the Republic. The [Battle of El Mazuco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Mazuco) lead to the capture of the Republican-controlled part of [Asturias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias) and the fall of [Gijón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n), the Republic's last stronghold in the North, to the Nationalists. The campaign ended on October 21, 1937 with a decisive and total Nationalist victory.

Good post but I have to take issue with this. The landlord is your client, thats where you get most of your money from (taking a percentage of the rent for managing the property), and in my experience letting agents are no more than the landlords mouthpiece. Tenants aren't the client, letting agents don't care if a tenant won't pay their fees because they know that there are plenty of potential tenants out there who will. Tenants are exploited by letting agents because of this and the lack of good regulation.

Don't listen to a lot of the nonsense in this thread. MK really isn't a bad place to live. 

Our road system is brilliant for a start. Even in rush hour traffic you can get from one side of town to the other and not hit a queue longer than 5 cars. 

There's loads of parks and lakes around which are really nice. 

No matter where in MK you are, you're only ever 5 miles from the countryside. 

There's some beautiful little villages dotted around on the outskirts.

Work here is good. Both salaries and prospects.

Transport links are good. Driving you can be in London in 55 minutes. By train you can be at Euston in 30.

Come check out /r/miltonkeynes if you're after any specific advice about the area. Take it from someone that lives in MK and spends a fair bit of time in Northampton though... Steer clear on Northampton.

Also, Bentaleb hasn't had much impact going forward this season and connecting the defence to attack is a bit of an issue at the moment (and has been since Modric).

A severe underestimation. The fact that just a couple of their players then went on to be sold for that much alone shows that their squad is worth far more than that.

I have this attitude as well.

However I do worry that this is going to lead to mission creep. Where we will eventually see boots on the ground (again) because the Kurdish and Iraqi forces just can't handle ISIS. ISIS have still been making gains on the ground *despite* the airstrikes - granted we haven't been bombing them for long but I would have at least expected it to stop them from gaining new territory.

The fact is that the Iraqi army, whilst well equipped, is no match for ISIS. They have no morale or discipline and the whole army is rife with corruption at the highest levels. Mosul fell because the commanders fled without warning and left their troops to the wolves. The Peshmerga seem content to defend their own strip of the North and I doubt their ability to actually strike back at ISIS now that they are so dug in up there beside them.

Meanwhile ISIS, as much as I despise them, have shown they are capable of advanced infantry tactics like feigning retreats and laying ambushes, disguising themselves as Iraqi soldiers and attacking bases from within, utilizing make-shift chemical weapons (chlorine bombs), etc.

I would love to be wrong, but I don't think the locals stand a chance against ISIS even with our air strikes. Perhaps in the long run we can degrade them enough ... but it's going to take years.

false,sabrefudge,null,null,"Here is the game I would love to play:

It begins with you as The Doctor in the middle of a regeneration.  They probably shouldn't show which Doctor you are regenerating from because it would mess with the continuity.  Meaning if they made the game now, and had you regenerate from Capaldi, the game's plot would be obsolete once Capaldi regenerates in the show.  It would also date the game very quickly after Capaldi's run.  Instead, don't show the Doctor you are regenerating from.  It could be any future Doctor, the 14th Doctor or the 97th Doctor.  The player doesn't know.  You start the game right in the middle of the regeneration, thrust the player right into the action.


But after you regenerate, you get to choose an appearance (male, female, black, white, old, young, hair, etc.) and an outfit from the TARDIS' massive wardrobe.  Maybe you could customize the TARDIS too.  The interior appearance, mostly.  

Starting you as a new doctor also lets you choose your own path.  You're not restricted to the personality of any established Doctor, because you're an entirely new regeneration.  You make the choices that define your version of the Doctor.  You could be lighthearted and merciful, dark and vengeful, or something in between.

Throughout the game, you travel through space and time.  You complete various stories (similar to episodes) that all play into one big plot/mystery that is the main plot of the game.  You collect upgrades for your sonic screwdriver, so that it can unlock more doors/cases and has a customizable appearance (gold casing, silver, blue light, green light, whatever).

Also, through DLC or in-game achievements, you can unlock the skins of all the past Doctors... so that you can replay missions as 1 through 12 (including the War Doctor).  Perhaps you could even unlock their screwdrivers or TARDIS interiors.  There would be lots of Easter Eggs and references to the series (both old and new), probably many relics from old episodes within the TARDIS.

Most importantly, the game would need to be well-written.  It would have to have a plot that kept you interested.  It would have to have large worlds and fascinating puzzles and side missions that would be fun and make up for the lack of combat.  There would still be action, but it would be stealth based.

A ""Doctor Who"" game would be incredibly difficult to pull off.  But there are so many amazing and talented game companies out there.  But I'm sure that with the right amount of time and money, it could be done.  They just really need to take their time with it, not throw it together and release it as quick as possible (which is the downfall of most movie and television videogame tie-ins).",0,1411744913,null,0,false,0,ckt59vc,t3_2hfhsh,t1_ckt59vc,t3_2hfhsh,null,1426812868,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

[It's **very** common](http://psychcentral.com/lib/substance-abuse-and-bipolar-disorder/0001033) for bipolar sufferers to also have a history of drug abuse, you can look to it during an episode and before you know it you're addicted and as you say have a 'gluttonous lack of self control'.

I said that I was in no way surprised that a man with money and unmedicated bipolar had taken cocaine and then continued to do so. This is the same guy that was in the papers in 1995 for vanishing the morning he tried to kill himself through a depressive state. This is also 10 years before he was diagnosed as bipolar, years of fame and success could fuel his habit.

I don't see any issue in how Stephen has behaved given his background. As a bipolar sufferer I fully understand how he could justify his use and fool himself into believing he wasn't addicted. I myself fell onto cocaine and mdma shortly before seeking professional help. It feels like life is going at 500%, you're full of energy and your head is spewing out constant ideas and messages. Your unfathomable drive can put you into circles of people that take the likes of cocaine to be even half as driven as you and you decide you want some of that as well to carry on whilst your body is slowly shutting down.

The other side is similar, you're a child of immigrants who doesn't go anywhere but your estate, work, mosque and maybe Pakistan every so often to visit family. The only white kids you know are the dickheads from school who you never got on with, the slutty white girls who walk around pissed up getting nailed by everyone, and the drunken thugs and loudmouths who give your mates shit and kick off at every opportunity.

It still could be, however it is young and has little traffic. Even /r/football which has 20K (as opposed to under 200 of /r/Footballdiscussion) subscribers is slow in terms of traffic and content.

i have been subbed to /r/Footballdiscussion  since it's inception and am well aware that /u/smokey815 is a mod over there (incidentally while you put down this sub and exault /r/Footballdiscussion because of /u/smokey815 keep in mind he is a mod here as well).  

I, like many other people, haven't gone over to /r/Footballdiscussion because the traffic is low and the conversation is sparse. Additionally....i come to /r/coys because it is Spurs focused and /r/Footballdiscussion  isn't",0,1411745547,null,0,false,0,ckt5lfl,t3_2hj7cw,t1_ckt5lfl,t3_2hj7cw,null,1426812719,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

They don't have to. Many companies won't, so it can be tough to find one that will. It tends to be organisations that benefit from having foreign language speakers that will sponsor you.

She'd need to get a job here, and be earning a certain amount of money for 6 months, and then you could come as her partner, though it's easier if married/engaged, I don't really know what the limits are for non-married partners, there's basically no good way to prove you're in a relationship.

This is huge. Simply put he is a solid player and would likely tie down that left wing of theirs. I have a feeling Sanchez will be attacking down our left anyway, putting Rose under pressure. A wide man on the left who can track back may very well be required.

&gt;If Chiriches and Kaboul are our CBs, it will be a long game

Agreed. Game over before it starts if this is the case. We are already flimsy in the FB position. We are going to be weak at the back any way you look at it unfortunately. 

&gt;Are you more excited or nervous for this game

Already deflated. I hope to fuck we get a result but the team hasn't been up to snuff in the last month or so. Arsenal haven't lost at home in over a year either and are coming off of their strongest PL win of the season, not a good omen. I want to see spurs knock in a goal, show some heart and it would be nice if Lamela had a great performance.

&gt;Are the scum's injury problems as bad as they claim they are in

No, Walcott is really the only one they are missing and no team is ever at full strength. Giroud and Welbeck are close enough in ability and I am sure they can cover Debuchy. The rest are squad players.

&gt;Last night I dreamt that we stole a win in the final minutes after Lamela followed up an Eriksen free-kick to smash it home. Then I had a weird lucid dream where I kept seeing Harry Kane's face appear before me, is that a sign? What will you be dreaming about tonight?

Alternatively, if we assume that things happened differently in the timeline as it stood before whichever incarnation of the Doctor intervened, she would quite likely have been hunted down and killed shortly after being awoken by the works to extend the underground line.  

Insofar as her career was the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes, one might expect that some Reichenbach Falls type situation might have been her final problem in the Victorian era - either leaving Jenny grieving, or possibly followed shortly afterwards by Jenny and (a by now surely very elderly) Strax disappearing after a close approach by a comet (or whatever it was).

The first thing to know about Cambridge is driving during rush hour is pretty awful (although cycling is great!). The train station is either in the best or worst possible place depending on where you'll be working, and there are VERY few bus lanes, so bus doesn't really work that well either (although that's being improved).

Rent in the city centre is pretty steep, although reduces pretty quickly as you go out to the fringes. Anywhere in Cambridge is cyclable to from anywhere else, so consider the money saved on petrol/train fares!

Waterbeach and Ely have quick and cheap trains (although only once per hour) and the rent there is much lower, so you may want to consider that instead. There are loads of satellite villages which I assume have lower rent but I haven't looked into that myself. Cycling from them starts becoming serious, though is still perfectly doable. There's also the guided bus to look into which is basically as fast as a train.

The social side of Cambridge is...average. City centre can get a bit busy on some evenings, but calms down very quickly. There aren't very many clubs or bars (but loads of old fashioned pubs!). Loads and loads of cultural stuff (classical music, theatre etc) if that's your thing. The centre also gets pretty lively on weekends during the day with events and performers. As you might expect with all that, it's also one of the safest cities in the country, so that's something to think about.

While there is not doubt that large quantities of aid given to what were supposed to be ""moderate"" rebels has ended up in the hands of ISIS, the official scale of aid is pretty small. As of September 2013, [£20 million had been given in non-lethal aid to opposition groups](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-response-to-developments-in-syria-and-chemical-weapons). As of this September the figure is [£30 million, of which none is weapons, and not all is for use in combat](https://www.gov.uk/government/priority/providing-non-humanitarian-assistance-in-syria), and this is compared to the main UK reponse to the conflict which is a large humanitarian aid contribution consisting of a commitment of [£700 million of aid (so far)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/factsheet-the-uks-humanitarian-aid-response-to-the-syria-crisis) to help those affected by the war.

Even if 100% of UK aid with any military application found its way to IS, then that would still be a tiny fraction of their weapons and equipment.

The House vote to approve giving aid to Islamic Extremist terrorists in Syria

The Senate also approved Obama's disastrous proposals by 78-22 on Thursday.

We should be using this to try and persuade people to not vote for any candidate that voted yes for this disastrous and ludicrous measure.
All it will do is to put more weapons into the hands of extremists and strengthen support for ISIS.
ISIS are RELYING on the US bombing them and killing nearby civilians in order to strengthen their hand. That was the whole purpose of releasing the beheading video's - to provoke the US into another foolish and ill considered war.
If ISIS were not attacked by the US and not given the assistance that they have been getting from foreign governments, they would collapse from factional in fighting and strife given time.
In the meantime the countries with an interest in stopping ISIS (primarily Syria, Iraq and Iran), should be allowed to constrain and degrade them.
It seems the US government is determined to not let that happen.

U.S. Falling Into the Islamic State’s Trap http://interc.pt/1theomQ

You cannot defeat an idea with bombs and bullets.
Bombing people has only served to massively increase the support for Islamic Extremism over the last 12 years.
Other far more effective measures to weaken, degrade and eventually defeat ISIS and Islamic Extremists in general are detailed in here. Bombing won't work.
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/how-to-defeat-isis-and-islamic.html

If US Foreign Policy over the last 12 years had actually been aimed at combating terrorists and Islamic Extremism instead of encouraging more Jihadists, ISIS wouldn't even exist. More of the same will definitely be counter productive. It will also cost the American taxpayer trillions of dollars. The Generals and the war mongers are talking about their policy being a ""generational"" war against ISIS lasting 20 years. They also said the Iraq war would pay for itself and last a maximum of 6 months - $3tn+ ($6tn+ with Afghanistan) and 11 years later .......

Of course the real reason that the US government wants to bomb ISIS is so they have the pretext of bombing Assad and a second bite of the cherry of overthrowing Assad. Once bombing starts and it has no appreciable effect, mission creep will do the rest.
Escalating the conflict in Syria and overthrowing Assad will benefit the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel, to the obvious detriment of Americans, Europeans and just about everybody else in the world (it will increase terrorism, war spending and the price of oil - none of which benefit 99% of the population of the world).

The very timely and convenient ""humanitarian crisis"" of Syrian Kurds under attack by ISIS
Just like the previous very timely and convenient ""humanitarian crisis"" of Yazidi's ""stuck"" on a mountain in Iraq.
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-very-convenient-humanitarian-crisis.html

A far simpler, less costly and much more effective approach to tackling ISIS would be to take steps to severely reduce the $2m+ a day of funding that ISIS is currently getting by selling it's oil production. But Congress are not voting on any measures like that.
ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day which it is selling at between $25 and $60 a barrel on the black market.
The crude is being transported in oil tanker trucks, mostly into Southern Turkey.
Presumably this is currently being done with the connivance (or even active collaboration) of the Turkish government.

We know that Kurdish oil is being loaded onto oil tankers at Ceyhan in Turkey from other reports.
What is the US government, Congress and the media doing to investigate and prevent ISIS from selling their reported $2m+ a day of oil production?
Whoever is helping ISIS sell their oil, transporting it or buying it, is providing direct and material support for a designated terrorist organization.

You could be bundled into a van by the police, tortured, given a show trial and executed for either a crime you didn't commit or the crime of speaking out and it will all be done legally.

Have you ever noticed that people only decry the ECHR when it's being used to protect someone we don't like? When someone we decry as a terrorist or a psychopath gets things done in the manner in line with the ECHR. When it's someone we don't like we demand they drop the ECHR and burn them at the stake in that deliciously knee-jerk reactionary manner which the public seem to love. When those same people who decried the ECHR get into a spot of trouble, they have no qualms pointing to the ECHR for their rights even if only months before the ECHR was a horrific waste of time that should be destroyed post haste. The ECHR should not be invoked selectively, because if it is it would be a disaster for all of us.

But tell me, what do you think? Do you think we should live in a country without a document lining out our Human rights? One where legally any and all of your human rights can be denied, for any reason, at the will of a government or the opinion of it's people? Or should certain people who are left out. Terror suspects? Suspected or convicted criminals? People with repugnant views? Certain groups perhaps? Or should who human rights legislation applies to be considered on a case by case basis based on opinion or feeling?

We may have had rights before the ECHR, but I wouldn't want to get rid of it for the convenience of one case. If you know anything of the past you could know human rights were acknowledged arbitrarily. Where were the Human rights of the suffragettes, pray tell? Where were the Human rights of those in Pauper's prisons, where people were often re-arrested because they couldn't pay the prison's fees? Where were the human rights of those in the press gangs, or the Irish Catholics slaughtered wholesale by Cromwell?

If we get rid of the ECHR, I don't think what replaces it, if any, will be all sunshine and rainbows, far from it.",0,1411748502,null,0,false,0,ckt74i6,t3_2hio3a,t1_ckt74i6,t1_ckt630p,null,1426812004,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14
false,Ian56,null,null," Barack Obama's attacks against ISIS

A number of empty buildings were hit in Raqqa.
ISIS had plenty of notice that the US was about to bomb Syria and had moved their fighters and weaponry away from their HQ in Raqqa 2 to 3 weeks ago.
Some of the fighters merged into civilian neighborhoods - Raqqa is a large town / small city of 250,000 people.
According to eyewitness reports the bombing was extremely intense and destroyed several buildings, but it is unlikely to have done any damage to ISIS itself.

The Western part of Syria around Aleppo and Idlib was also bombed.
According to the US this was to target Khorasan.
Khorasan is a branch of Al-Nusra and comprises around 50 fighters who are veterans of the war in Iraq against the US.

The majority of the air strikes were in the ISIS strong holds in the East of Syria where no other group, including the Syrian army has much of a presence.

There are no reports of oil field fires or such like, so we presume the US did not try and target ISIS oil production.
There are reports that the US bombed small ""mobile"" refineries but as there are no reports, reconnaissance photos or satellite pictures of any oil fires, let alone oil fires of the size that would result from hitting a small oil refinery, we can discount these reports as false.
Any similarity between ISIS ""mobile"" oil refineries and Saddam's ""mobile"" chemical weapon factories is purely coincidental.

Neither are there any reports of bombing against ISIS front lines.
E.G. there are no reports of airstrikes in the area around Kobane, where ISIS has been attacking Syrian Kurds and causing a refugee problem on the Turkish border.
We presume Obama doesn't care about the Syrian Kurds.

Tomahawk Cruise Missile's cost $1.6m each.
47 of them were used to bomb Syria last night.
Total cost of one night of Syrian airstrikes is estimated to be $79m.

The US claimed to have killed just over 50 Jihadis.

Total cost per jihadi killed $1m to $1.5m.

Total number of Muslims 1.2 billion.

On this cost basis, Obama's wars might only cost 1 to 2 quadrillion dollars (1,000 to 2,000 trillion dollars).

It is reported that 8 civilians, including 3 children were killed in the US airstrikes near Idlib.
There may have been other civilian casualties elsewhere.

A very unconvincing fig leaf that this was an ""international coalition"" was applied, to cover the extreme embarrassment that the only countries supporting bombing Syria are the absolute monarchies that have been funding, arming and training the Islamic Extremists in the first place. Saudi Arabia and Qatar took part in the raids with support from Jordan, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

Over 600 US air strikes have been conducted in the last few weeks in Iraq.
This has resulted in the recruitment of 6,000 more Jihadi's to ISIS.
Little change in territory has been seen.
ISIS control just about all the Sunni dominated areas of Iraq and none of the Shia or Kurd dominated areas. This is how it is likely to remain for the foreseeable future.

On this basis a further 10,000 airstrikes should be able to recruit a further hundred thousand jihadists at a cost of around $100bn.

Neither the Generals, the DoD, the CIA nor the FBI think that Obama's policies to tackle ISIS will work.

General Dempsey, head of US armed forces, said that it will be a ""generational war"" lasting 10 to 20 years.
Chuck Hagel said we should be looking at a ""long"" campaign.
The Army announced it was setting up a new HQ in Baghdad which might be needed for 10, 15 or 20 years.
The FBI said bombing Iraq was recruiting more Jihadists (bombing Syria hadn't started).
The CIA privately say that the US bombing Syria is like pouring gasoline on a fire.

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have already cost over $6tn and the US has got nothing except lots more enemies.
The generals are now talking a war lasting twice as long again.
So another $6tn or even more is going to get flushed down the toilet in some more pointless, counter productive and illegal wars.",0,1411748520,null,0,false,0,ckt74u8,t3_2higur,t1_ckt74u8,t3_2higur,null,1426812000,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

One packet of McVities chocolate digestive biscuits is nearly 1500kcal. Subtracting off the 270kcal energy excess (to gain 20 stone bodyfat over 10 years) that's 1200kcal extra energy burned per day - to put it another way, the pack of biscuits is 60% of the normal persons RDA and, subtracting the surplus, that's still 48% of the energy RDA.

A 30 stone person walking 3 miles per day at 3 miles per hour (that's the hour of moderate exercise per day that most people are so convinced the obese can't be getting) burns less than 700kcal. And this is exercise being done when already morbidly obese - ie when most obese people are far less active because they simply can't sustain significant amounts of activity.

As people get more obese, the amount of energy burned per unit of activity may increase, but the amount of activity tends to decrease. Surely you know that - it has to be true for your ""fuck all exercise"" claim to be true for a start.

The math just doesn't work. And even if it did, its still the same 10% excess compared with RDA (or less than 10% excess compared with what they're actually burning, by your own claims).

What's impressive is still, despite huge variations in daily exercise and activity, how close the energy consumption is to the energy usage over time. The more the daily variation, the more this small excess proves that appetite regulation exists and is only slightly out of balance even in the case of obesity.

And since when was it so unbelievable that obesity is caused by an imbalanced where slightly more energy is consumed than burned, sustained over a long period? All I ever argued about is the details within that - the existence of appetite regulation, the roles of protein and stress.

Stop Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait from funding them. They are their major donors.

Ban all Wahhabi schools in America and ask Europe to do the same. Stop Saudi Arabia funding extremist Madrassas in Pakistan. This will reduce future recruits for Islamic Extremists - be they ISIS or some other follow on group.

Even if you defeated ISIS militarily, some other Islamic Extremist group would spring up in it's place.
If you want to defeat ISIS, you should read how the SAS defeated Islamic Terrorists in Oman in the 1950's.

1. You have to take the local support base away. A guerrilla army cannot operate without local support.

2. You have to take their source of arms and funding away. See above that means getting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait to stop supporting them.

3. You have to offer a better alternative than the one ISIS offers. That means as a first step to stop bombing people. Bombing ISIS is bound to kill innocent civilians as ""collateral damage"" which will just make things worse. It also means stopping the bombing of Pakistan and Yemen. The SAS in Oman took great pains to NOT to kill civilians. America kills far too many of them - it's a large part of the reason for ordinary people's support for ISIS.

4. You have to stop Turkey giving support to Islamic Extremist groups across the Northern border of Syria.

5. You have to stop Israel giving support to Al-Nusra (an affiliate of Al-Qaeda) across the Southern border of Syria.

6. Iraq
There will never be a military solution to ISIS, unless there is an acceptable political solution to Sunni's in Iraq. Iraq is an artificial country with Kurds in the North East, Sunni's in the middle and Shia's in the South. The sectarian hatred within Iraq is now so great after a decade and more of war, hostility, death, violence and poverty, that an inclusive political settlement is simply not possible. There will have to be a 3 State solution to Iraq to defeat ISIS. With the Kurds, the Sunni's and the Shia's all having their own country.
For now ISIS should be contained in the Sunni dominated region that they now control in Iraq. They should be contained by the Kurds in the North West (as is already happening) and by the Shia militias and government in the South. A US bombing campaign will only strengthen ISIS support and serve to exacerbate the current crisis.
Given time ISIS provincial government of the region will collapse from their lack of military progress, the lack of a unifying enemy to recruit further fighters, the difficulties of governing a large mostly poor, disparate group of people with numerous different tribal loyalties.
Basic economics and human nature should be allowed to kill off ISIS.
US bombs and bullets will have the opposite effect - as it has for the last 12 years.

7. Let Assad defeat ISIS and other Islamic Extremists in Syria.
Assad has the support base among the population in Syria that will allow ISIS to be defeated there, providing there is no interference or help to ISIS and other Islamic Extremist groups from neighboring countries (Turkey, Israel and Jordan - as there currently has. As well as stopping the money and arms supplied by the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait).
The vast majority of Syrians are moderate Muslims and the last thing they want to see is Islamic Extremist Wahhabis and Salafis take over their country.

8. Withdraw American support for Israel.
Israeli war crimes such as the indiscriminate murdering of civilians in Gaza we have just witnessed and the constant Ethnic Cleansing and illegal settlement building in the West Bank is the other major source of recruitment for Islamic Extremists like ISIS and Al-Nusra.

9. Stop ISIS from selling their oil
A far simpler, less costly and much more effective measure than bombing people, would be to take steps to severely reduce the $2m+ a day of funding that ISIS is currently getting by selling it's oil production. But Congress are not voting on any measures like that.
ISIS is producing between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day which it is selling at between $25 and $60 a barrel on the black market.
The crude is being transported in oil tanker trucks, mostly into Southern Turkey.
Presumably this is currently being done with the connivance (or even active collaboration) of the Turkish government.

We know that Kurdish oil is being loaded onto oil tankers at Ceyhan in Turkey from other reports.
What is congress and the media doing to investigate and prevent ISIS from selling their reported $2m+ a day of oil production?
Whoever is helping ISIS sell their oil, transporting it or buying it, is providing direct and material support for a designated terrorist organization.

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-crisis-isis-sells-stolen-crude-oil-raising-over-1-million-per-day-1462389

A policing action in Southern Turkey to stop oil, weapons and fighters crossing the border with Syria, would be an effective counter measure to ISIS's current strength.

There are ongoing battles between the Kurds and ISIS to control the large oil refinery at Baiji and oil fields near the Kurdish border
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/us-iraq-crisis-oil-idUSKBN0GZ2BK20140904
Taking control of an industrial oil refinery would be a key strategic win for ISIS and should be prevented. If ISIS does manage to gain control of it, it should simply be blown up with a few bombs, preferably after warning the local population that bombs are about to be dropped to avoid civilian casualties. The Iraqi air force NOT the US should do this (there will be less blowback from an attack by Baghdad).

Either way where the objective is to destroy an enemy; insurgency or not I don't think planning to carry out air strikes for three years with 5 jets will achieve that goal.

IS have key positions key towns and no state. Targeting them with full scale military action is practically possible, it's just Iraq alone does not have the numbers to do it. Hundreds of thousands of ground troops and armour would achieve that goal. Towns would be reclaimed, oil fields taken back and many IS fighters would die. 

Would it fix the problem? Nope. But the actual states, Iraq, Syria, Iran etc in the area will then have the position of power and could stand a good chance of keeping control again.

Deploying 5 tornado jets to drop a couple bombs on key buildings over 3 years is neither here not there. What is the objective?

You haven't said much of anything. Though I now have a very good knowledge of Monty Python's version of history. 

You ask me why Industrial revolution hadn't come to India. I pointed out that technologies don't develop equally across different continents. Yes?

&gt; No, you do not take good and bad and decide it was 'all bad', just as I couldn't insist that it was 'only good'. Interesting that, for at least two posts, it's been important for you to respond as if the latter is what I've been saying regardless.

No actually you do, you can't point to a supposed ""good"" when its intended use was exploitation. While the railways might be a product its intended use was exploitation. You can't just divorce the product from the object of its service.

&gt;Sure, so the guy that invented the wheel ultimately invented the car....er....something doesn't quite work there.

Really, did I say that? The point was made in regards to your absurd notion of comparing technological contributions from different eras. My point they all lead to each other.

&gt;Really? That's odd - you were dismissing them as 'all wrong' earlier.

How can I dismiss evidence that was never presented, you have presented no empirical evidence whatsoever. 

&gt; Heh, yeah put those benefits in quotes, then they're less significant. And again, use the former to dismiss the latter which again only works with polarisation. At the risk of invoking Godwin, we only got to the moon because of Nazi rocket technology....so really, India shouldn't be celebrating the mars-orbiter because it was based on technology invented using slaves/ genocide. See how easy it is to do what you're doing?

Yea keep making abstract parallels may be they will eventually make sense. You can't keep separating the product from its intended use of service.

If the discussion is about whether the railway's a good invention? Then yes but that's not what the argument is about. It is about, whether colonialism was good for India? No, it wasn't.

&gt;The Iceni burnt Roman London to the ground. Imagine how fun the Roman reaction to that was.

...

&gt;Nobody has said that, anyway. And again, I'll highlight your insistence on polarising so that you can provide the response you want.

You keep saying I'm polarizing the issues, you are simply changing the issue. Here is my point of disagreement: 

&gt; It was however, amongst other things, a tremendous force for good in the world.

&gt;If anyone can stake a claim to being victims of colonisation and expansionism I would argue it is actually Africa. 

These statements are ridiculous, no amount of red herring is going to change that.

&gt;You have no real evidence for that, no way of proving it and I could say the same about UK. But your responses are so agenda-based that I can't be bothered to keep correcting you, so I think we'll leave it there.

huh? You mean the crushing of its economy isn't evidence enough to highlight the halt of India's progression. In the little more than half of a century of independence, India has more than tripled its percentage of GDP (globally to over 6%). It is still nowhere close to what it was prior to colonization.

You have made straw man arguments throughout the entire discussion, throw in some red herring and Monty Python.

 So yea, leave it at that.

Rightmove is a publicly listed company whose majority shareholders are one of the largest group of estate/letting agents in the country. It's all nicely rigged top to bottom!

Some may remember that Tesco briefly entered this space 5-6 years ago with the aim to undercut agents on cost by allowing landlords and sellers to create their own listings. They ended up getting embroiled in a legal dispute, mainly staged by a band of estate agents who claimed that home owners and landlords couldn't be trusted to write their own property descriptions.. From memory I believe they took this to the OFT and used the ""Property Misdescriptions Act"" to eventually win the case. Rightmove wouldn't go near Tesco on these grounds (so they claimed), the truth is it didn't quite fit with their business model of having lots of estate agent branches paying fees rather than one virtual online portal.

---

&gt;

&gt;Imperfect meanings in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) are expressed in different ways depending on whether the event is continuous or habitual.

&gt;For a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_aspect) action (one that was in progress at a particular time in the past), the [past progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_progressive) (past continuous) form is used, as in ""I __was eating__""; ""They __were running__ fast."" However certain verbs that express [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb) rather than action do not mark the progressive aspect (see [Uses of English verb forms: Progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Progressive)); in these cases the [simple past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_past) tense is used instead: ""He __was__ hungry""; ""We __knew__ what to do next.""

&gt;[Habitual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_aspect) (repeated) action in the past can be marked by *[used to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Used_to)*, as in ""I __used to eat__ a lot"", or by the modal verb [*would*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_modal_verbs#will), as in ""Back then, I __would eat__ early and __would walk__ to school."" (The auxiliary *would* also has other uses, such as expressing [conditional mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Conditional).)  However in many cases the habitual nature of the action does not need to be explicitly marked on the verb, and the simple past is used: ""We always __ate__ dinner at six o'clock.""

Yes, weapons were pouring in [courtesy of Gulf arab states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Qatar), but the UK has almost entirely focused on aid to help those displaced and suffering, and should be proud of doing so. Trying to claim that Iraq is in trouble because the UK shouldn't have given aid to Syrians, is dishonest.

&gt; Do you forsee any problems with assisting a separatist ethnic group within the region that has history of terrorism to pressure governments in gaining its own state?

&gt; Serioulsy, in 5 years well have the same people saying 'well we caused this by armingt he Kurds and Turkey are a Nato member with an EU memebr, if we dont fight them there we will have to fight them here.

But up to this point, maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq has been the most important consideration of US policy. So, none of the weapons given to the Iraqi Army were given to the Peshmerga, and since Iraqi Kurdistan has been [exporting oil through Turkey with the full support of the Turkish government, who since a more peaceful relationship with the PKK, actually aren't too hostile to Kurds in Iraq having greater autonomy](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-20/iraqi-kurds-turkey-to-double-oil-export-pipeline-capacity-1-.html), the US has actually often sided with the Iraqi government in [attempting to restrict Kurds exporting oil themselves until very recently](http://qz.com/239532/iraqi-kurdish-oil-may-finally-be-freely-for-sale-as-the-us-seems-to-be-dropping-its-threats/). the US funded Iraqi Army failed to protect the Kurds, giving the Kurds the means to defend their territory is justifiable. Any dispute over the future of places like Kirkuk are almost certainly a lesser threat than IS at this point

&gt; The same shit over and over and over, with the same shitty lines spun by politicians. It was less than a month that The peace prize winner was badmouthing these guys as ineffective.

&gt; Then its air strikes only, no boots, whoops 15 years and hundreds of British lives later yet more muslims blowing up on our streets.

Which war are you referring to? Afghanistan was a US war, with British forces joining ISAF inside afterwards during the ""nation building"" phase, Iraq was always represented as a full invasion and occupation (but as it turned out on false pretences), Libya was indeed just air power, and there were no UK forces on the ground. Mali was logistical support to French forces who were on the ground.

Sure, I'm worrying that there might be escalation to RAF air strikes inside Syria, however that is a different argument, and considering that intervention there was already rejected by Parliament even after evidence of chemical weapons use, unlikely to happen. Air strikes in Iraq in support of local forces, with support of both the national and neighbouring governments, is the right thing to do.",0,1411751283,null,0,1411751510,0,ckt8kqc,t3_2higur,t1_ckt8kqc,t1_ckt7ckw,null,1426811328,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Ely,"Definitely the right question to be asking.

My view (and I think the view taken by most in our parliament in review of the evidence and arguments before us) is that if we allow Da'esh to grow in power they may become a permanent state, a permanent feature of the region with an established power base. Not only will that cause enormous instability in a region that's already hugely unstable, it'll cost huge numbers of civilian lives and the oppression of millions under a tyrannical regime. So obviously for everyone in the region there's a reason to intervene to try and crush Da'esh.

But as for what *we* stand to gain from this... my argument would be that if we allow them to establish themselves we allow them the weapons, finances and resources with which to attack us. I would argue it's an inevitability that if Da'esh go unchallenged they will eventually attack us and by that point it may be too late for us to challenge them without a full-on ground invasion, which didn't go very well for us last time. We need to nip this in the bud with a more intelligent and more limited military intervention so that further down the line a much more costly and complicated one is not necessary.

Only a day or two ago the [Iraqi authorities uncovered plans](http://time.com/3430575/isis-plotting-subway-attacks-in-new-york-city-and-paris-iraqi-pm-says/) for subway bombings in Paris and New York - *which have not yet been thwarted.* Now of course, it's arguable that by intervening that makes us a target, and that's true. But I'd argue we made ourselves a target back in 2003, as well as through the Sykes-Picot agreement. I think we're a target already, and if we do not act we will still suffer attacks against our civilian population.

I also think it's important to make it clear that what MPs just voted to support was not a repeat of 2003. We will not be putting troops in Iraq, we will not be occupying the country, we are not pushing for regime change. The Iraqi government asked for western assistance in attacking Da'esh. What we agreed to do is to conduct limited and *targeted* air strikes against specific military targets. Military installations, exposed troops, artillery positions, etc. I think civilian casualties as a direct result of our attacks will be very, very low. Again, the Iraq authorities have specifically requested our assistance in precisely the manner MPs just voted to support. We know who we are targeting and we are working with local governments and western governments on this.

I'd argue the biggest risk at play here is mission creep. We'll have to see how that pans out.

I just don't see what the alternative is. If we don't act then we *will* become a target, make no mistake of that. They've already declared that they intend to make us part of the caliphate. And meanwhile millions of innocent people in the middle east will be slaughtered. And we can't placate them through diplomatic channels either. We've committed to basically the *bare minimum* of military intervention in the region, as well as providing humanitarian aid to civilians and to the regional governments fighting against Da'esh. And this time we aren't doing it alone either, we have international law on our side and the support of countries like the US and France, as well as the Syrian and Iraqi governments; even small countries like Denmark are doing their bit. We aren't trying to 'win hearts and minds,' we aren't infiltrating civilian areas, pushing for regime change, radical political reform, ""democratising"", or engaging in petty geopolitics.

If someone has a better idea *please* tell me it, because none of us *want* get unnecessarily involved in the middle east again. I just don't see what the alternative is.",0,1411751785,null,0,1411776880,0,ckt8u7c,t3_2hjexp,t1_ckt8u7c,t1_ckt71y9,null,1426811207,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Anytime a kipper talks about slashing aid, that's a tip off that they don't know what they're talking about. 

Foreign aid is never given unconditionally - it's always used to buy global influence, and it's usually tied into the sale of something British. 

If we give £1BN of ""foreign aid"" to some developing country then it'll include them spending a comparable amount of money on British fighter planes or jumbo jets. This kind of ""foreign aid"" is a way to subsidise British industry in a way that would be seen as underhand and anticompetitive if we just openly handed cash to Rolls Royce or Boeing, and of course it ties them into buying spares, maintenance and training from us for the lifespan of the aircraft.

Foreign aid is not charity, and it reveals the idiocy of anyone who talks like it is - the reasons for ""giving foreign aid"" are varied and numerous, but it's almost invariably global bribery and we keep on using it because it's effective, good value and cheaper than any kind of military action or trade embargo.

Any time someone talks about cutting foreign aid, ask them what we get in exchange for that aid, and how they propose to replace it. If they can't answer the question - and chances are they don't even know the first part - then you know they have no idea what they're talking about.

UKIP is full of simple answers that don't fix complicated problems. The world is a huge and extremely complex place, and saying ""slash aid"" is about as simplistic as it gets. ",0,1411752245,null,0,false,0,ckt92xi,t3_2hio3a,t1_ckt92xi,t1_ckt1d7q,null,1426811092,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"That's not really true. We had some elements of 'human rights' but not others. We had rules on fair trials and we rarely killed people illegally. However our discrimination laws have been improved by the ECHR, our criminal justice system has been improved and the ECHR has acted as a break on the anti-terrorism laws passed post-2001. /u/mejogid wrote a comment that I saved which detailed some of the ways the ECHR had been used to stop breaches of human rights in the UK:

&gt;Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK, copy and pasted from a previous comment I wrote:-

&gt;Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)

&gt;Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)

&gt;You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)

&gt;It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)

&gt;You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)

&gt;The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

&gt;The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

&gt;Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)

&gt;Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

&gt;Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

&gt;Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).

&gt;Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

I also don't know on what basis you're suggesting that the ECHR has been nothing but trouble given the above changes which, I hope you'll agree, are broadly positive and considering the fact that [99% of UK originating cases are thrown out](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/01/24/european-court-of-human-rights-struck-out-99-of-uk-cases-in-2012/) by the European courts for not being admissible. 

It's insane to me that generally people who want to leave the ECHR tend to argue that we have perfectly good human rights in this country so we don't need the ECHR and in the same breath they'll talk about what a nuisance the court has been in ruling that the UK government has breached someone's human rights: human rights that were written down and described by British lawyers after WW2 intended to be a distillation of the liberal elements of British law. How we must have changed if the distillation of British law on the rights of citizens in the 1950s is so strict to us today, especially to Tories.

We'd never heard of it until the other week. Had a read up online then went ballistic (in a very polite &amp; civil manner) to the letting agent to impress upon them 100% that we didn't want Spark anywhere near us or the property before we moved in.

To be brief, if you're still interested:

* Letting agent puts clause in contact that says: ""We recommend Spark Energy and they will supply the property from the time you move in [or they use language which implies that Spark are there as standard]. But you are free to switch suppliers at any time.""
* Most folk sign contract not caring, or not seeing.     
 
Scenario 1     

* First 'estimated' bill comes through, very often for hundreds for just a short period.
* Tenant says ""Wtf?"" and queries, giving Spark meter reading which indicates that the bill shouldn't be bigger than the GDP of Belgium. Spark holds them to pay a bit of it - say £80 of £500 - while they're sorting it out.
* Spark then fail to get back to customer, ignore phone calls etc.
* Tenant is left with a shitty bill and can't switch easily (see below).
* Tenant keeps receiving bills etc. Round and around.

Scenario 2     

* Newly arrived tenants or folks who had had a shitty bill from Spark, try and switch, whether they knew about the clause or not.
* Spark put a halt on the new energy company who tenant wants to switch to, citing ""Outstanding bill"" etc. and won't allow the property to change providers until it's sorted.
* Tenant receives one of those 'estimated' bills for £fuckton.
* Tenant is given the run around, as above.

Hence we were quite keen that Spark don't even get a sniff of a toe of a foot in the door. The letting agent has kept making it clear that we can ""switch any time we want"", but I'm not really in a position to tell them what I think of Spark's tactics. I don't really want to make enemies of the agent before we've even moved in!

I was having a look around for costs from energy providers last night. I went through the websites of a few, and used a comparison site. I decided to have a look at Spark to see what they'd cost.

That this House:

Condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing;

Recognises the clear threat ISIL pose to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK government for such support;

Further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage;

Acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the government of Iraq, including countries throughout the Middle East;

Further acknowledges the request of the government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens, and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq;

Notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign, and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament;

Accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq;

http://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/LGGA01/LGGA01_home.cfm

From the report:

&gt;Where we observed a difference in the 2012 analysis 
was when we explored the relationship between 
academy status and the average GCSE score without 
equivalents, i.e. the best eight GCSE results. Analysis 
indicated that there was a different association between 
academy status, the length of time designated as 
an academy and average school level attainment. 
**In the models that included prior attainment we 
saw no significant difference in the progress made 
between KS2 and KS4** for non-academy schools and 
academies that had been open for less than two years. 
**A significant difference was seen for academy schools 
that had been open for more than two years. These 
schools, on average, made less progress between 
KS2 and KS4 than non-academy schools.**

What that means is that academy school appear to do better by switching over to using easier tests when they first become an academy but then, once this boost in their results is accounted for, actually deteriorate in quality compared to a regular school.

The company will connect homes and businesses in the city to FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) broadband as part of a trial involving Sky and TalkTalk. 
 
Roughly 20,000 homes across the city will be able to access download speeds of up to 1Gbps (1,000Mbps) once the project is complete. 

Catherine Rowe, executive director of networks and telecoms for Fujitsu UK &amp; Ireland said: “This is an extremely exciting opportunity for Fujitsu to work with Sky, TalkTalk and CityFibre as the chosen constructor for the build of Fibre to the Premises in York.

“Having ultra-fast fibre network all the way to the home or business will provide a step-change in connectivity speeds that will enable the next generation of exciting products and services to be developed apace by Sky and TalkTalk.”

Fujitsu was previously competing with BT for BDUK (Broadband Delivery for the UK) contracts in North Yorkshire and Cumbria. 

The Japanese company was eventually beaten to the Cumbria contract by BT and eventually Fujitsu bowed out of the whole process, leaving BT the sole runner in a one-horse race. 

The news follows a two-year partnership between Fujitsu and CityFibre which saw a high capacity 103 kilometre fibre backbone built around York. 

Fujitsu will be responsible for building the network’s full infrastructure, including network planning, civil and network construction, testing and interconnection of the FTTP network.

We're almost certainly going to kill countless more civilians than ISIS will because our bombs are indiscriminate and only so accurate. We killed over half a million innocents in Iraq because Saddam was a bad guy and now look at Iraq.

Who the fuck is to say that taking out ISIS is going to make anything better?

Is there any real justification for any of the sensationalised writing here? Statistics on quality of academies vs regular schools? What grades are people getting? What are the future prospects of students?

I'm sorry but the article starts out suggesting ludicrous edge cases and taking the idea to such extremes (Hewlett Packard times table) without justifying that kind of argument that I just couldn't carry on. I know it's cool and trendy to hate on any kind of privatisation in any way at all here on reddit but I would be far more interested in something that justifies the argument with comparative data. In particular I'd like to see what the grades of students at places that are now academies are in comparison to when they were regular schools. If they were shit before and got better afterwards I'm for them.

EDIT: Cool, I found two studies, both of which suggest that academies are improving (marginally) GCSE grades faster than regular schools.

If he was the weakest link in an an otherwise strong chain, I'd say yes, drop him. I'm sure Brendan would too. But he is not. He hasn't been great, but arguably apart from Sterling and Moreno, no one has been. 

**Minutes Played**
I do not think he is geared for playing as many minutes as he does. My ""other"" team is the San Antonio Spurs and they have perfected the art of managing the minutes of their aging stars. Of course the sports are completely different, and you can fluidly come in and out of a game to conserve your energy. In Gerrard's case, I wonder if he'd be effective playing for upto about 50-60 minutes and coming off. He also most definitely should not be starting as many games in a tightly wound back-to-back schedule like ours currently. 

**Legacy &amp; Leadership**
I find it pretty pathetic to be honest, how quickly so many fans turn to him as scapegoat. I wonder how long those fans have been fans. Of course there is Istanbul, but the times he has helped us over finishing lines by the scruff our necks are many more than just that one glorious night. Brendan is right to start him and keep faith with him. 

**General Formation**
That said, with Brendan being right in starting him, but maybe not justified in starting him so often, or keeping him on as long, I think our formation in general is not favoring him. He is sitting too far back, as are all of our team, and when he is that far back with his lack of mobility, he is a liability. 

So in summary - I do not think he is the weakest link. I think he should be started but minutes and potentially starts being limited. He has a legacy of leadership that does not change because of 5 games. And the formation and general pace of our 5-game run has not been ideal for him, or really for anyone.

false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,"1) Most Catholics *do* just ignore the flag. From a historical point though, it's been waved about in the faces of Catholics in a triumphalist manner by loyal loyalists just to wind them up - I'd rather no flags than all flags. They also act as 'territory markers' - you don't feel welcome in certain areas because they have the flag of 'themmuns' flying, or they don't feel welcome in ours because the flag belonging to 'ussuns' is flying.

2) Names are a big indicator. I have a ridiculously Irish name - and like I said above, if I'm in an area that is obviously PUL (Protestant/Unionist/Loyalist), I tell my friends to call me 'Charlie' (starts with the same letter as mine, first off the top of my head) because it sounds British. You have people here called Niamh O'Sullivan or Billy Graham. One obviously taigy and one obviously hunny.

There's also the 'Say H' test. I've been told people from either side of the community say the letter H differently (it sounds bizarre, but multiple people on both sides seem to believe this).

Another test is the 'Sing The Sash/Sing [rebel song]' if you're an unfamiliar face in a certain area. Failure to do so resulted in a harsh beating upon failure. At least in my town on both sides it did.

3) Marches are controversial due to the way the marchers act.

They *insist* (and usually riot if they don't get their way) on marching through predominately Catholic areas carrying banners that commemorate people who killed Catholics, Catholics that may just be from the area they are demanding they march through. Then there are the jeers of '*You're second class citizens!*' and the like - they march in an absolutely disgraceful manner when its through a community they aren't welcome in, and treat people like lesser beings. There is only so much you can ignore - it's pretty hard to ignore being spat upon when you're outside your own home, or people sneering and calling you and your family scum simply for living in a certain area.

**The Austerity Delusion
Why a Bad Idea Won Over the West**

&gt; The eurozone countries, the United Kingdom, and the Baltic states have volunteered as subjects in a grand experiment that aims to find out if it is possible for an economically stagnant country to cut its way to prosperity. Austerity -- the deliberate deflation of domestic wages and prices through cuts to public spending -- is designed to reduce a state’s debts and deficits, increase its economic competitiveness, and restore what is vaguely referred to as “business confidence.” The last point is key: advocates of austerity believe that slashing spending spurs private investment, since it signals that the government will neither be crowding out the market for investment with its own stimulus efforts nor be adding to its debt burden. Consumers and producers, the argument goes, will feel confident about the future and will spend more, allowing the economy to grow again. ^[Source](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139105/mark-blyth/the-austerity-delusion)

..............
&gt; Austerity is a seductive idea because of the simplicity of its core claim -- that you can’t cure debt with more debt. This is true as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. Three less obvious factors undermine the simple argument that countries in the red need to stop spending. The first factor is distributional, since the effects of austerity are felt differently across different levels of society. Those at the bottom of the income distribution lose proportionately more than those at the top, because they rely far more on government services and have little wealth with which to cushion the blows. The 400 richest Americans own more assets than the poorest 150 million; the bottom 15 percent, some 46 million people, live in households earning less than $22,050 per year. Trying to get the lower end of the income distribution to pay the price of austerity through cuts in public spending is both cruel and mathematically difficult. Those who can pay won’t, while those who can’t pay are being asked to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; The second factor is compositional; everybody cannot cut their way to growth at the same time. To put this in the European context, although it makes sense for any one state to reduce its debt, if all states in the currency union, which are one another’s major trading partners, cut their spending simultaneously, the result can only be a contraction of the regional economy as a whole. Proponents of austerity are blind to this danger because they get the relationship between saving and spending backward. They think that public frugality will eventually promote private spending. But someone has to spend for someone else to save, or else the saver will have no income to hold on to. Similarly, for a country to benefit from a reduction in its domestic wages, thus becoming more competitive on costs, there must be another country willing to spend its money on what the first country produces. If all states try to cut or save at once, as is the case in the eurozone today, then no one is left to do the necessary spending to drive growth.
&gt; 
&gt; The third factor is logical; the notion that slashing government spending boosts investor confidence does not stand up to scrutiny. As the economist Paul Krugman and others have argued, this claim assumes that consumers anticipate and incorporate all government policy changes into their lifetime budget calculations. When the government signals that it plans to cut its expenditures dramatically, the argument goes, consumers realize that their future tax burdens will decrease. This leads them to spend more today than they would have done without the cuts, thereby ending the recession despite the collapse of the economy going on all around them. The assumption that this behavior will actually be exhibited by financially illiterate, real-world consumers who are terrified of losing their jobs in the midst of a policy-induced recession is heroic at best and foolish at worst.
&gt; 
&gt; Austerity, then, is a dangerous idea, because it ignores the externalities it generates, the impact of one person’s choices on another’s, and the low probability that people will actually behave in the way that the theory requires.^[Source](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139105/mark-blyth/the-austerity-delusion)

**From Joseph Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents, 2002**

&gt; * The IMF insisted on selling off state-run enterprises rapidly – countries that privatized fast received praise.  Fast, of course, did not mean more efficiently and at a lower social cost – because of the negative results of many a blind privatization, the very idea gained notoriety.  
&gt; * The IMF “simply assumed that markets arise quickly to meet every need, when in fact, many government activities arise because markets have failed to provide essential services.  

Austerity is not the answer to current economic woes, several parts of the world have bucked the trend with positive results

**From C.P. Chandrasekhar, Professor of Economics, Jawaharlal Nehru University**
&gt; Fiscal policies operated to reduce inequality through progressive income taxation and highly redistributive social transfers targeting education and health spending as well as public child and old-age benefits. There were increases in formal employment, led by significant increases in public employment, through the expansion of and improvement of quality in public services in areas such as health and education, as well as through “in-sourcing” activities that were earlier outsourced to private companies by governments. Wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers were reduced by increases in educational access and enrolment, and this contributed to the recent drop in income inequality. Legal minimum wages rose through most of the 2000s, and in some countries like Brazil they more than doubled in real terms. Incidentally this also reduced gender wage gaps, since women workers tend to be clustered in the lower end of the wage distribution, at and around the minimum wage. ^[Source](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/09/is-rising-inequality-inevitable.html)",0,1411758014,null,0,1411758369,0,cktbz88,t3_2hikb9,t1_cktbz88,t1_ckt7afl,null,1426809670,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

In theory, any MP is free to vote on any division any way they like. It's up to them and them alone how they vote, ultimately they are accountable to their local constituents that voted for them to be an MP. It's called representative democracy.

We also have political parties. This is where people with similar beliefs and values club together and decide they are all going to vote the same way in parliament in order to reach a majority in the house. Parties decide whether their MPs have what is called a ""free vote"", or a ""whipped vote"". In a free vote MPs are told they are allowed to vote however they like. Go nuts. They don't even have to vote if they don't want to. In a whipped vote, the parties tell their members that they must vote a certain way. 

There are different levels to the whipping that tell the MPs how seriously to take their parties instructions. For example, a ""three line whip"" means they're really, really serious about this one and the MP better vote the same way as the party or he's going to be in real trouble for not agreeing with everyone else. I assume this was a ""three line whip"" vote. INTERESTING FACT: It's called a three line whip because the way the member should be voting is underlined three times on the instructions handed to them by the whips who are people given the job by the parties.

So Labour have fired him from the Labour Party, so he's no longer Shadow Defense Guy. But he's still an MP, because nobody can fire him from that, he's there to represent the people of his constituency.

I don't know that I agree with either aspect of this comment. I think Bentaleb has been the best central midfielder in the squad at linking defense and attack--certainly better than Dembele who moves the ball on slower than any player in our squad. 

I can think of several instances (including against Forest) where it was Bentaleb who won the ball high up the pitch and then played the penultimate pass that led to a counter-attacking goal. He is excellent at this already. 

I also think that we've done a far better job at linking attack and defense this season, but in a couple of recent matches we just haven't moved the ball fast enough, or the attacking trio have been wasteful, or the forward has been static and useless. 

We've only really had 2.5 matches where we looked toothless in attack. One was a typical Europa League group stage slog which has happened under the last 4+ managers, another was the first half against Forest, and of course the dire WBA game which is indefensible. 

I'm not saying Bentaleb should be starting against Arsenal of course, but if the goal is to move the ball forward quickly Dembele is not the answer. I'd start Stambouli. ",0,1411758742,null,0,false,0,cktcbzg,t3_2hj55k,t1_cktcbzg,t1_ckt4iwd,null,1426809505,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

false,Anotherfuckwit,english,England,"academies do not get 'more' money than authority schools.

there is a national funding formula which states how much schools receive. Currently, local authorities can play around with this a little but in each authority academies receive the exact same amount of funding per pupil than the next.

where there is a difference it is because local authorities 'top slice' each school's budget to pay for educational services. they cannot do this to academies and so the %of the budget paid to local authorities by maintained schools remains with the academy.

the local authority uses this money to pay for an ever decreasing and over stretched workforce. so tight are their budgets that they have, for a number of years now, had to target only the poorest performing schools or those at risk. this means that good schools receive little or no support, advice guidance, etc. from the local authority despite 'paying' around 6% of their budget to them.

Many good and outstanding schools decided that it would be better for their pupils if they left the authority and became more able to choose how they spent the extra funds. these are *converter* academies.

A converter academy must either provide direct support for, or be part of a consortium of academies that support, at least one other school that has failed under the local authority control. these failing schools become 'sponsored' academies and they are failing *before* becoming an academy. the converters are responsible for and accountable to the department for education for raising standards in the sponsored school.

headteachers in converter academies are successful and comfortable in their own workplace, earning a good salary. when the conversion takes place many suddenly become responsible for their own school and also for Shithole Academy across town, essentially doubling their workload and responsibilities. hence governors offering pay increases/incentives.

a Headteacher never sets his own salary.

I am a Headteacher of a converter academy. my salary is identical to the three headteachers in the closest state schools. I am responsible for maintaining standards at my own school as well as using my own staff to work in Shithole Primary 10 miles away.

the 'extra' money we receive (£46k) is spent on extra staff to cover for those who are out of their class retraining disenfranchised, demoralised and demotivated staff at SHP. Some also pays for extra office staff needed because we now manage and pay our own staff.

There are some disadvantages to the academies programme and for many schools they may outweigh the advantages. On balance (*just*) I'd say that my school (and by school I really mean pupils) is slightly better off. mostly because we can teach what we and our parents feel will be of the greatest benefit to our pupils; not a universally hated National Curriculum.

Large companies will, however, give you a season ticket loan - they'll give you a lump sum to cover your annual season ticket, then deduct it monthly (and without interest) from your salary.

Just a heads-up though: Maidstone is in Kent, and Southeastern trains are among the most expensive in the country. They also seem to increase their prices by the maximum amount every year. 

It's gonna be tough, however you do it. Rent in London is likely to set you back £600, and a train from Maidstone is going to be closer to £400. But to save that £200, you're going to be spending **at least** two hours a day sitting on that train. Plus getting to and from the station.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I took a class that briefly covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland. 

Brief sounds like an understatement. 

&gt; Why does hanging the British flag cause so much controversy. Why don't the Irish Catholics ignore the flag and continue on with their lives? I understand that many Republicans feel Irish but what harm does the flag bring? Why not allow both sides to hang whatever flags they want? 

The flags are everywhere. No, really, there's a really excessive amount of flags. 

Those who erect them say they're just celebrating their culture, but the reality is and always has been that they're just erecting them to antagonise Catholics.

There have been calls from the Loyalist/Unionist community in recent years that the flags are put up as a kind of defense mechanism by people who feel their cultural identity is being taken from them by Catholics. 

This is an entirely bullshit claim that originates solely in Unionists' annoyance that they're not able to get away with antagonising Catholics in the same way they used to. 

Still, Unionists do have a right to proudly proclaim their love of unionism through flags if they want - after all, it's a free country. So fair enough, right? 

Well, if you insist, but to be honest, and I don't know about anyone else, but they're annoying because

A. There's so many of them. It's hard to overstate if you're not used to it.

B. They're put up as a deliberate middle-finger to everyone else in the country who isn't as extreme as they are. 

C. They detract from the natural beauty of the countryside and are used in towns and cities as demarcation lines (Catholics welcome, Catholics not welcome.)

D. After a while, you can only take so many flags before you start wanting to kill yourself. 

They're just ugly. Why should people ignore something that has such an ugly effect on the physical and social landscape? It would be mad to tolerate that forever. 

&gt; 2) How can people tell if your Catholic or Protestant? 

Magical powers, mainly. 

&gt; 3) Why are the marches by the Unionists so controversial? From my understanding it has something to do with the names on the jackets. Why doesn't the Catholic community ignore the marches? A part of moving on means ignoring petty stuff from the other side? 

The marches celebrate/commemorate various battles waged in Ireland between Nationalists and Unionists. Fine. Except, again, this has been hijacked by extremists to be used aggressively and antagonistically against Catholics. 

The end result is that you've got a load of men marching about in silly outfits who's main intention comes across as an attempt to threaten Catholics that ""we're still in control and don't you forget it,"" - exaggerated by them marching in military fashion, like garrisons of threatening looking, red-faced Catholic killers. 

It's fucked up. 

&gt; From my understanding it has something to do with the names on the jackets.

K. You should probably ask for a refund on that class. 

&gt; Why doesn't the Catholic community ignore the marches?

That's like asking why doesn't the USA ignore 9/11?

Catholics/Nationalists also have their own fair share of antagonistic parades and commemorations, as any of the multitudes of Ex-IRA men turned Tour Guides can testify to, if you ever have an hour and a half and 20 quid to kill in Belfast.

I must correct you however on one issue, and challenge on another.

The first is the Lib-Dem policy which raised the tax threshold for those in the lowest tax bracket (of which I ready admit I am a member). It was very good policy, and a good idea, however it is undermined by the VAT raise that happened in 2011. This added approximately £450 to everyones budget per annum on basic consumer items (though not food which you don't pay VAT on I believe). In this light the policy was piecemeal, because of three years everyone had paid £1350 than they otherwise would have, but it is only this year they received £500 back. Meaning they have still effectively lost £850 in real terms gross (not before inflation and other costs.) 

The second is that this government helps small businesses. I readily admit to not being too familiar with their policy proposals in this regard and will gladly be more informed by other members. Yet I wonder if the Tories commitment to large multinationals undermines any policy which supports the SME sector. One of global companies great strengths is to use the orthodox competitive model (keep costs low = price low) to undermine smaller competition through economies of scale. How can this help our SME sector? SMEs in the UK account for over half of our private sector workforce yet leaving them unarmed in the fight against global business as Thatchers economics dictate would render them floundering.

I welcome more information on points that need to be corrected, I'm empiricist academic first and a lefty second.

A cynic would say that this line is partially what this is about. The Saudis and the Iranians are at each other's throats, we have bad history with Iran and we've backed the Saudis as a predictable regional power that behaves as we want it to. 

When the Arab spring kicked off in Syria we were potentially looking at a proxy war between the Iranian (and Kremlin)-backed Assad regime and Saudi-backed Sunni militias. It may be a reason why Obama and Cameron were so keen to see Assad removed. 

Now everything is a mess. ISIS is an enemy of Assad, of the west, of Saudi Arabia and of Iran.

&gt; ""Where is America, where is England, why are people not helping?"" a villager called Ali told Reuters news agency.

I'm sure he's pissed off Scottish people by calling the UK England but you can't simply suggest that no one think bombing will help. The Iraqi government does for one as clearly do some civilians. 

I would also question what you say about bombs being indiscriminate. This not WW2. Our bombs are mostly guided by RAF personnel and lasers. Tomahawk missiles  can certainly hit a small metre square target from many miles away. The RAF has drones and satellites to provide surveillance and Iraqi &amp; Kurdish forces on the ground to scout. We aren't carpet bombing the place, were making precision air strikes on known targets.

 Remember most of the civilian casualties in Iraq in 2003 came after the invasion and after air strikes. Sectarian violence and jihadist bombs killed the vast majority of the civilians not our bombs. Yes the violence wouldn't have started if we hadn't gone in but our bombing was not the problem, the lack of legitimate government was and here we have a legitimate government who want us there.

false,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt; Have you been on the back of a bike before? As the idea of topping 150 on public roads with a green passenger fills me with dread. 

Yes. I spent three summer months blissfully riding pillion. Fastest we did was just over 100mp on a straight. I remember thinking 'if we crash and I die now, I will die happy, and I don't care.' Bliss. Sadly I no longer have my leathers (and actually, the jacket was far too loose to be of much good in a crash, I'm not entirely sure why Mr Safety bought it for me now I come to think about it).

&gt;Have you considered a track day?
