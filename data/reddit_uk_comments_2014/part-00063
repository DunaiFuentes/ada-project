This is after our entire Linux IT staff were let off due to ""lack of funds"" leaving Bournemouth's flagship VFX and animation courses, whom use upwards of 300 Linux only machines, without a single bit of support other than the paltry remaining Windows only staff that are unqualified to maintain our systems.

Students and staff have on several occasions now bombed the support tickets system regarding Linux problems (hundreds of tickets a day) to grind the system to a halt in order to highlight our problems. 

It's appalling the way the university sees funding the vfx courses, a backbone to BU which:

* [Houses the National Centre for Computer Animation (NCCA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_Computer_Animation)

* [Regarded as the country's leading VFX institute](http://careers.theguardian.com/bournemouth-university-national-centre-computer-animation)

* [Winner of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize](http://www.royalanniversarytrust.org.uk/news/winners-announced)

* Has [Oscar winning staff](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2567270/)

And many points, as unnecessary.

It's because Atos, I mean ""OH Assist"" *is in charge of the care.data data-servers and the care.data extraction programme.*

####Atos to work on NHS care data project despite ongoing 'mess' over disability benefit assessments - 26 February 2014

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/atos-to-work-on-nhs-care-data-project-despite-ongoing-mess-over-disability-benefit-assessments-9153885.html

&gt; Outsourcing company Atos will be managing the removal of personal data from GP records, despite question marks over the success of its reassessment of those on disability benefits.

&gt; The French IT company, which has come under fire for its role in testing people currently receiving disability benefits, will manage the extraction of patient records from GP surgeries as part of the controversial NHS data-sharing scheme.

&gt; The data that will be extracted by Atos from GP systems includes information on family history, vaccinations, referrals for treatment, diagnoses and information about prescriptions.

&gt; It will also include data such as a patient's blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol levels.

&gt; Personal confidential data (PCD) identifiers will also be taken, such as date of birth, postcode, NHS number and gender.

&gt; Last week, Atos confirmed it was seeking an early exit from its contract with the Government in the face of persistent death threats to staff.

&gt; Atos Healthcare said it had been in discussions with officials for “several months” about ending its £500 million work capability assessment contract which is due to run to August 2015.

####Atos awarded contract for NHS records - 25 Feb 2014

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10661359/Atos-awarded-contract-for-NHS-records.html

&gt; [...] MPs expressed further concern when Max Jones, director of information and data services, for the Health and Social Care Information Centre, disclosed that the contract to extract data from GP records will be held by Atos, a firm which has attracted previous controversy.

&gt; Mr Jones said that once data has been extracted from GP surgeries, it would be held in a “safe haven” held by the centre.

&gt; Select committees raised fears that the disclosure could further damage public confidence in the scheme, raising fears that personal medical data would be passed to those assessing benefit claims.

&gt; Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said: “There are many sensitivities around Atos - it’s reasonable to see why the public might be concerned about that.”

&gt; She questioned whether the DWP would be allowed to access the database.

&gt; Dr Dan Poulter, Health Minister said such requests sould not be allowed, stating: “It must be in the interests of the providers and recipients of healthcare and social care in England - that does not mean the DWP.”

####Quotes from the Health Committee Inquiry into the care.data programme - 25 February 2014

[Landing page of inquiry][3] | [Direct PDF link to evidence given][4]

[3]: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/health-committee/news/14-02-25-cdd-ev/

[4]: http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidencePdf/6788

*Q63*  
&gt; Rosie Cooper: Do you actually think that Atos is a fit and proper company to be extracting care data?

&gt; Sharmila Nebhrajani: I don’t.

&gt; Rosie Cooper: It is outrageous.

*Q131*  
&gt; Dr Wollaston: Are you planning currently to share this information with the DWP?

&gt; Tim Kelsey: At the moment we are completely prohibited from doing that unless the DWP
can make a case that somehow it is helping health and social care.

&gt; Max Jones: Reading directly from the Health and Social Care Act, this has to be “in the
interests of the health service in England or of the recipients or providers of adult social
care in England.” That is the test that would be applied.

*Q132*  
&gt; Dr Wollaston: But you could see a situation in which the DWP might argue that it would be quite helpful for them to contribute to the process, say, for example, in fitness to work. Would you say now that you would not be giving other Government Departments that data?

&gt; Dr Poulter: The Act is, in my view, very clear about the purposes for which data can be used, so I think the purposes you are describing do not fall within what is written in section 254(2)(b) of the Act.

&gt; Valerie Vaz: What is the definition of “the interests”?

&gt; Dr Wollaston: But how will that adjudication be made and will that be very clear to people so they can opt out at that point? We will have a clear offer to the public. Thank you.

&gt; Chair: Ultimately by a court.

####Call for council 'diet police' to inspect the private sector - 05 Dec 2011

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8934415/Call-for-council-diet-police-to-inspect-the-private-sector.html

&gt; Council inspectors should start monitoring what private sector employees eat at work in order to help improve the country’s health and to reduce sickness rates, a report has concluded. 

&gt; Drastic action is needed to halt the cycle of ill health amid an alarming “sick note culture”, it found.

&gt; The report from 2020Health, a think tank, found that the economy is losing tens of billions of pounds in productivity because of a high number of sick days.

&gt; The report recommended the role of council “diet police” be increased to offer advice to the private sector. The authors said the proposals in the report, released today, would help reduce the “sick note culture”. 

&gt; It is estimated that about 3.4 million working days could be saved annually in the NHS, Europe’s largest employer, alone if it improved the health of its workforce.

&gt; Julia Manning, the think tank’s chief executive, said: “Our proposals would go a long way towards repairing both the nation’s health and its economic fortunes. The importance of health to economies is well established. 

&gt; [The PM] has warned that Britain's sicknote culture in the workplace was acting as a ""conveyor belt to a life on benefits"".

&gt; The Prime Minister said he would act on expert advice that recommended that family doctors should be stripped of the power to sign people off work long-term.

&gt; ""‘Of course some of these people genuinely can’t work, and we must support them. That’s only fair,"" the Prime Minister said.

&gt; ""But it’s also fair that those who can return to work should be supported to do so. We need to end the something for nothing culture.

&gt; ""‘While 90 per cent of sickness cases are short-term – that stomach bug or flu that we all suffer from occasionally – nearly half of all days lost to sickness absence are because of cases that last four weeks or more.""

&gt; Ministers believe that about one in five of those who are absent on long-term sick leave should either never have been signed off in the first place or could go back to work.

&gt; The expert report, commissioned for Downing Street, suggested more than three-quarters of GPs admitted they had signed people off sick for reasons other than their physical health.

&gt; [The PM] said he was alarmed by evidence of the scale of the problem from a report by Dame Carol Black, an expert on health at work, and David Frost, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.

I feel that over the next few years we'll be walking a fine-ish line between spending to remain competitive on the pitch and financing the stadium redevelopment...sort of like Arsenal have been for the better part of the last decade.  As you and others have said in this thread, progress and a sustained run of qualifying for the CL would dramatically help us. But as others too have said, FSG are professionals with sustained and successful ownership experience in sports with the Boston Red Sox in America.

We need house prices to drop and all the government seems to care about is encouraging more rich people moving in by granting them 'non-domicile' status (zero tax) and encouraging them to 'invest' in housing.  How is buying housing 'investing' (other than buoying housing prices!), it's just usery - they don't make or build anything they just take 1/2 to 2/3 of the salary of the people who have to rent - cos buying is not an option since house prices are too bloody high. 

The Tories and the papers (and spinless Labour PR-MPs) try to blame the housing issues entirely on immigration - but a major cause is that the only people who can buy houses are those with multiple properties already.  If they increased tax incrementally on 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.. properties - people would move their assets elsewhere and housing prices would plummet.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"University staff have had a 13% pay cut over 4 years

Students having staff who can't afford to live (many don't earn the living wages) and lectures who are stressed out and over-worked isn't good for their learning. Ultimately what in the best interest for their staff and teachers, is in the best interest for them.

It's unfortunate that teachers going on strike affect students. But **no** lecturer actually want to go on strike, not only because they lose a day’s pay but because they actually do care about their subject and the teaching of their students. All the staff I know have been high distressed over striking, some have rescheduled, others - though supporting the strike - feel a greater duty above any strike to their students.

I think it's our job as students to give our full support to all striking staff. Let's not forget the strike is also over the 15% gender pay gap. The university should be democratically run by students and staff, management and bureaucracy should be abolished or at least marginalised. Control by those concerned and critical thinking should return to a meaningful education.

Students are paying £9,000 a year, students should be unhappy that none of that massive increase will actually go to those that teach them, those who facilitate their learning. That those who teach them are having a pay cut for the 5th year in a row. You could subvert the neoliberal agenda and say, as consumers, students deserve better teaching, and teachers who are paid a decent amount and staff who can survive. Ignoring the intellectual and moral problems of commodifying higher education, students are consumers without any of the benefits of consumers (i.e. they have to pay, but get no say or control over what they buy).

It really isn't my intention as overall I'm quite positive about the direction of the club and what the owners have done and are doing.  I tend to look at numbers as simply that- numbers.  They don't really lie and to date under FSG our finances have not been great.  That said, the encouraging signs are they continue to spend (even if it's via loans/debt) when they didn't have to.  I believe 100% they want the club to succeed and surely them authorizing another £16M on Konoplyanka (even if it didn't work out) on top of the pretty hefty spend in the summer is indication that they're willing to spend for the club to be successful.

My reservations are chiefly about the future and the belief that at some point they are undoubtedly going to expect the club to not be losing money every year.  I have 0 problems with this as a matter of principle as it's absolutely the way forward and I do believe they have a plan to get there, but it does do my head in a bit to hear people moaning about not spending 'just a few million more' on certain players or posts I've seen saying things like 'we should easily have 40M+ to spend in the summer'.

As for loan-to-equity, my understanding and reading through the link you provided seems to confirm this, is that any loss over 5M Euros has to basically be covered by owner equity.  Which means I would expect that they may well be forced to turn some of that into equity in the club, if not all of it, although by the same token given our spending I don't know that FSG are terribly worried about the consequences of not complying with FFP (too many clubs would be negative impacted if UEFA tried to play hard ball at this point in time).

Again, I think FSG are doing a fine job and I am by no means concerned for the health and well-being of the club and I apologize if that's the impression I gave, it's really more around setting proper expectations for the supporters that my concern lies.",0,1393919750,null,0,false,0,cftyjzl,t3_1zh2ln,t1_cftyjzl,t1_cftx1fi,null,1432650576,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Also your assertion that palm oil is particularly bad is probably incorrect too. Presumably you think this as it is primarily a mix of saturated fatty acids? Saturated fats are increasingly being shown to not be the boogeyman of cardiovascular disease originally thought.

true,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"This is what I believe is happening:

The events in Ukraine / Crimea are the result of a complex interplay of geography and politics.  Crimea is predominantly of Russian ethnicity, and Russia's primary warm-water naval port for force projection into the Mediterranean is in Sevastopol.  

Ukraine had a pro-Russian federation president, and a large pro-EU populace who want to be part of the EU to benefit from trade and free travel through the Eurozone.  Yanukovych was ejected by the pro-EU, pro-independence movement in the Ukraine.  This alone would have probably got up Putin's nose, as he doesn't really like the West at all. 

The Ukrainian parliament then made various noises about reneging on their treaty which gives Russia access to the base in Sevastopol till the middle of the century - this is not good news for Russia strategically.  Couple this with the loss of face caused by a friendly state suddenly going over to the other side, and it's understandable why Putin is pissed.  

USSR defensive protocol was to use friendly vassal states as a buffer zone between the West and the USSR, and now Russia's lost one of those buffers - this would be a worrying development to anyone in that region.  (Imagine Germany's reaction if Poland, literally overnight, ejected their government and elected hard core National Socialists or Communists - that's kind of how this will appear to Putin.)

The thing you have to remember is that Putin is ex-KGB; while he doesn't seem to lament the passing of the USSR he probably lives and breathes USSR defensive doctrine

So, Putin acted in a way which is in keeping with the Russian way of doing things - use force early and overwhelmingly, then negotiate from a position of strength.  From the long view this isn't all that different to what the USA would do if for e.g. Germany suddenly tried to kick them out of Rammstein air force base - advance, light elements of the US military would be deployed to safeguard sensitive military material and US strategic influence, and the US would issue threats of increasing seriousness.   

So, basically - Putin is acting to guard Russia's influence in the region, and possibly increase it during a period of instability.  Is this a sane thing to do?  Not really, but given the historic apathy of the West when it comes to standing up to dictators, he probably believes he can get away with annexing the Crimea, splitting it off as an 'independent' state, and both gaining some defensive glacis and significantly weakening a neighbour.  Bonus points for scoring an easy victory, improving army morale, and gaining points at home.

Personally, I think he's a cunt, and I wish he'd choke on some borscht.  Unfortunately, there are many more just like him waiting to succeed him.

Sensible *why* - because it's easier? Because it's less effort for the majority (as you put it)?

Or because you feel that working class culture is somehow better than middle and upper class culture? 

&gt; You used the loaded phrase ""lowest common denominator"" and implied that the minority (i.e. the middle and upper classes) are better.

There's nothing loaded about the phrase - the distinction is made in the names of the classes which *you* readily adopt: working, middle and upper. Working is a nice way of saying 'lower' and so the implications are right there in the language used.

&gt;

&gt;The **Flag of Ulster** is a historic banner used to represent [Ulster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster), one of the four [provinces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland) of [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland). The [Red Hand of Ulster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hand_of_Ulster) is a symbol that is either derived from the [O'Neill dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_dynasty), then the most prominent Irish clan in Ulster, or the Dextra Dei of early Christian iconography. The gold background featuring a red cross comes from the coat of arms of the [Burkes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burke), a [Hiberno-Norman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-Norman) noble family.

On a broad level, Western diets are increasing chronic health problems though, and whether these are related to salt, sugar or saturated fat, processed food provides too much of all of them.  

I also admit that my objections to palm oil are as much environmental/political as they are about human health, however, it also exhibits many of the properties of trans fats, is loaded with saturated fats as you say, and is most often linked to high levels of LDL which most sources agree is not a good thing.  Personally, I won't use it, for all sorts of reasons, but I accept that human nutrition and the advice surrounding it is complex and confusing, not least because the relevant campaign groups, industries and marketing departments lobby hard for their products, seek to counter the opposition with PR, and sometimes actively produce ""science"" which supports their case.

The original series brief featured ""the handsome well-dressed heroine aged about 30"" (who would become Barbara Wright) to ""consider the older woman"", as well as ""the maturer man, 35-40, with some character twist"", which was to appeal to the men who would make up the post-Grandstand audience. This maturer man became the Doctor. Both characters were audience surrogates for adult demographics, and along with Ian Chesterton (the audience surrogate for the teenage population) had the largest role in the first season. As for whether or not the BBC consider it a children's show, the fact that it's broadcast on BBC1, with repeats on BBC3 and BBC4 from time to time, but never CBBC, suggests that it fits their prime-time drama section rather than their children's programming section.

It's a tough draw.  I agree with the article that 4-4-2 might be the best option at home.  I don't love Adebayor playing up front on his own, as our lack in penetration in midfield means that he often has to drop back to take possession, and then we literally have no one up front or in the box.

Soldado playing off Ade is what I'd like to see going forward for most games.  Without Matic, Benfica's midfield don't look as tough, but the key will be to patrol the zone between our mids and defence.

To be fair the security services issued a d-notice informing the British media not to discuss the Snowden leaks so coverage in this country was relatively muted considering it was such a huge story.

Given the state of the Ukraine at present I think an election would be a close-run thing, but the thing is that the Ukrainians want an elected governement that is accountable to them, and regardless of whether a pro-Russian or pro-EU president is elected, I think that so long as that person does not act autocratically or despotically things will calm down.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;You'd be surprised, I think, by the number of people who would tell you that you're talking bullshit from up north.

Oddly, I noticed more mobility between the old working and middle class in Scotland where I grew up than down in the SW/SE. In Glasgow unskilled workers were dead keen to see their kids get an education. When I moved down south I started to find labourers who didn't want their kids to stay on at school because ""I didn't do it and it was good enough for me"".  But those people have probably dropped into the underclass by now. 

&gt;There is still a significant difference between the middle and working class with regards to education. Middle class is about having social connections as it is about having relative wealth. 

Agree that it's not about money. A self employed plumber can earn more than a junior doctor. (The fact that I made this distinction between plumbers and doctors shows that I still feel some vestiges of a class distinction...)

In my close we have an aircraft designer, a dustman, two chippies, some teachers, and a social worker. We all live in the same kind of houses, go to similar places for our holidays, our kids go to the same schools, and are just as likely to go to university. 

But the new middle/working class increasingly don't have the connections to join the people who really run things. I've met a gardener and a taxi driver who are both working their bollocks off to send their kids to private schools even though the state schools round here are very good, because they want them to plug into those sort of connections. I don't know if this is going to work: I suspect not. 

It's getting worse for the people who've dripped out of the bottom. The dustman in our street bought his house a while ago, and maintained his pay rate on privatisation due to TUPE, but the next generation won't be paid as much, and will probably be on some sort of zero hours contract.

&gt;I'm happy to discuss this further, it's a really interesting part of sociology/society as a whole.

All the stuff I wrote above is very anecdotal. It would be interesting to work out a way of looking at this statistically. [The BBC did a big survey last year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22007058) but I'm unconvinced about the results.

With the west and the G7 nations unlikely to pursue military options in retaliation to Russian aggression to deploy troops in Crimea region of Ukraine, threats of economic sanctions is being talked up.

President Obama said that the US will take a series of steps, both economic and diplomatic, to isolate Russia. They have suspended trade and investment talks already.

The UK has equally talked up the potential for sanctions, with the potential for an agreement on the details of those sanctions could be reached at the end of the week in an emergency EU summit.

Yet still there remains a degree of ambiguity as to the form in which what those sanctions could take. The UK government wittingly leaked their initial thoughts on sanctions yesterday when a minister quite blatantly left documents on the cabinets view on sanctions in full view for the worlds media to photograph and analyse. That documents identified a preference for restricting travel and visa, as opposed to tougher economic sanctions. In essence, it showed a lack of appetite amidst the UK government for tough bargaining with Russia.

Yet the true cost of sanctions, if Russia is hit hard, could hurt the UK much more than people think.
First and foremost, let’s remind ourselves here that Russia holds ALL the cards:

The Ukraine carries 50% of Russian gas through pipelines to Europe (this is down from 80% a few years ago thanks to the creation of the Nordstream pipeline)

The Ukraine enjoys subsidised gas imports far below market prices from Russia, a deal that finishes at the end of this month

The Ukraine owes Russia $1.5bn for its subsidised gas imports

The Ukraine is in negotiations with the IMF for a $15bn bailout

Russia made the first move by deploying troops in Crimea and strategically is positioning itself to protect its pipelines, making retaliatory military moves very difficult

Ukraine has no financial appetite to engage with Russia on a military level

Russia has a natural hedge
Russia also has a natural hedge against a financial crisis of this nature. A weak Ruble actually helps Russian exports as non-Ruble holders can buy more Russian goods. In the same sense, commodity prices have also gone up significantly since the start of the crisis. Natural gas futures contracts for delivery in the next month has rallied by 10% for example, despite the fact Gazprom says there has been no disruption to production thus far and we also know stockpiles are relatively high following an uneventful winter.

And to draw you back to the bullet points noted above, the Ukraine needs Russia for money and fuel and Russia needs the Ukraine to help it to supply Europe’s fuel. They will always have a relationship as a consequence. This will not change and neither of them want it to. After all, where else can the Ukraine get such a good deal?

London could be hurt by Russian sanctions
There is a case that sanctions against Russia could in fact hurt the London and as such, the UK, with London being the heartbeat of the UK economy.

First and foremost, a huge amount of Russian assets lie in the UK. Russian wealth is placed in key western banks, whilst the popularity of strategic assets in the UK such as the London property market and even football clubs (Chelsea FC) has held true for oligarchs and wealthy Russian investors for some time. It has been speculated that the majority of the residential property sales in London with a value of £2m or more has been undertaken by wealthy foreign investors, with the majority of these being Russian and Chinese. If these assets are frozen and Russians cannot buy into London properties, one of the sources of London’s price bubble will be taken away, putting property prices in London at risk.

Secondly, there could also be an unwanted impact on UK pensions. BP owns 20% of Russian energy giant Rosneft, a stake that was a consequence of BP’s decision to sell TNK-BP. The stake in Rosneft awards BP consistent healthy dividends of circa $800m per year. The majority of pension funds are invested in large UK companies such as Vodafone, Shell and BP. Sanctions, if they take the form of assets such as Russian companies, could harm this.

So perhaps there is much more to sanctions that meets the eyes, which is perhaps why the UK government is trying to use the media to talk down the severity of what form they could take.",0,1393931037,null,0,false,0,cfu0em4,t3_1zin4j,t1_cfu0em4,t1_cfu0ebf,null,1432651449,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

If you are unemployed then your standard of living will go down and there will be greater stress on the economy as increasingly large parts of it are unable to contribute.

(At the end of the day, somebody somewhere is promised a bushel of corn)
This in turn will eventually affect more and more social demographics, perhaps even eventually those at the very top. 

We would have to cut the birth rate first, but then you run into the issues surrounding an aging population of retirees starting to outnumber everyone else, who are living longer but are becoming increasingly more dependent on care services. I suppose eventually it may balance out, but it's going to be tough for a generation or two. Whilst at my most optimistic, I may agree that Technology and automation may provide the answer for much of mankind's issues, I feel that we are not yet at the stage where that is possible. You would need stuff from the realms of science fiction, nano factories that can create food and objects on demand from whatever raw material for free.

true,ieya404,null,null,"As far as I understand it, this goes back to Edinburgh's waterfront development.

This was a plan to heavily redevelop the waterfront, which oddly enough has a lot of derelict land, or light industrial use; I *think* the idea was that up to another 40,000 or so people would live there.

Now, one problem there is that the road network across north Edinburgh has limited capacity; Ferry Road is a major artery, and that chokes up badly at times as it is.

But what if thousands of people could move around (perhaps commuting to the city centre, or heading out to the airport even) without adding lots of extra road traffic?

And hence why the tram idea was pushed.

Now, it's hit a few snags along the way.

The original plan had three lines - one from the airport, into the city centre, and then down to Leith (the waterfront).  A second line would run along the waterfront and then south through the city, past the Western General hospital, and reconnecting with the first line near Murrayfield to make a loop.  And a third line would head southeast from the city centre, past the university and out to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.

The third line was to be funded by congestion charging.  The council conceded a referendum on the congestion charge.  Edinburgh voted against it (by something like a 75:25 margin).  Congestion charging is not going to happen, and so line three got put on ice.

Then, the council managed to completely arse up the whole project management and contracts side of things, so the construction phase took way longer than it should've, and went progressively further over budget.  Line two went as the costs escalated, and latterly the section of line one that should've gone from the city centre down to the waterfront went too (just as well that waterfront development stalled after the financial crisis, eh!).  It's fair to say that businesses and residents along that section of the route, who endured years of roadworks and aren't even getting a tramline now, are probably some of the less enthused people in the city.

Probably worth mentioning, too, that while the trams could've been run along the routes where there were once train tracks through north Edinburgh (which would have been relatively inexpensive, as unlike roads there'd be no need to dig them up and re-route utilities running underneath them), there was sufficient opposition from the folk who use them now (cycle paths, dog walking, wildlife corridors) that that didn't happen.

So, we're now in a situation where we're down to a single line, running from the airport to the city centre, and it's cost about three quarters of a billion pounds so far, with another quarter of a billion or so expected in loan payments over the next.. I think it's 25 years.  Roughly double the original cost, for less than a third of the originally projected network.

The trams are roughly three times the length of existing double decker buses (and our local bus company, Lothian Buses, is very highly regarded - they provide an excellent service across the city), yet actually have less seating than a single bus (the plus side for the trams being that another 170 or so people can travel standing inside, and in fairness they do provide easy access for wheelchairs/prams).

According to published timetables, the existing airport bus (which runs from the airport to Waverley Station in the city centre) is both slightly cheaper and slightly faster...

The vast majority of the city's population will get no benefit from the trams at all.

&gt;But you don't have to own a television, thus it is not mandatory.

You're ignoring the point of the licenses' existence - as well as the parallel about asserting that seatbelts were pointless/ needless until it became law to wear them.

&gt;What a pathetic comparison.

Comparing public services is pathetic? Only if you're asserting that you have no obligation to pay. The services I listed are things that everyone will use, at some stage. It's very, very unlikely that nobody will ever watch/ listen to/ browse anything by the BBC, ever.

&gt;Someone who does not want to watch television, or own a television or even use BBC services should not be compelled to pay a fee every year.

That's what some people think about the fire services. Doesn't make 'em right.

&gt;&gt;They would not be interested in the ""better content by paying for less"" because they would never use the services.

And I will never use the NHS, so I don't have to pay for others or in advance for it, right?

&gt;I never said that the BBC should not exist.

I didn't say you did. I was illustrating what happens if others use your excuse, and why that's a bad thing.

&gt;This is invoking an argument I never made.

It's an extrapolation based on what would happen if more license payers adopted your attitude. It's based on your actions, not your justification for them (such as it is).

&gt;I didn't start this thread. 

No, you're sustaining it.

&gt; My participation in this thread also has nothing to do with me thinking I need to justify myself to you.

You need to justify your assertions full stop, because ultimately your only defence has been 'it's not illegal'. My highlighting it doesn't mean I am unique in my outlook, and if you're 'participating', then you have to demonstrate how you arrive at a conclusion almost everyone else doesn't.

&gt;You've asserted that and applied ridiculous examples to make that point ignoring entirely why those things were criminalised at all.

Make weak justifications, and you're going to get questions (sorry about that) - which is why I gave examples of no-brainers that ended up having to be criminalised because some people will stick to the dumbest excuses over what amounts to a trivial amount of money.

&gt;I haven't seen Sherlock.

I-I-I.

&gt;There is no ethical reason for compelling each individual in Britain to pay into a media service that they may or may not be interested in watching.

There are lots of ethical reasons, some of which I've already listed. More/ better content for all. No Ads on TV or radio. Educational (and a whole bunch of other) content on the website. The list is actually long enough that it demonstrates how much actual thought you've given this, to make a statement like that. You are aware of the difference between a private company and a public service, right?

&gt;It is not comparable to the NHS, Fire Services or Police. At all.

Which is an odd statement considering I've already listed why we pay for Fire Services, Police etc. that we almost never use (all public services). Just because you want to assert that the BBC should be treated like a private company doesn't change the fact that it's not, and has never been treated as such.

&gt;None of those things I watch

You asserted that aggregate content was better. I've given examples of how this is not true. It's odd that you're quite willing to dictate the apparent low-quality of BBC output when you apparently haven't actually seen any of it at all.

&gt;At any rate, the idea of a ""best"" show is considerably subjective.

Sure, nobody in the world would agree that (for example) the UK Top Gear is the best one. The likes of that and Doctor Who (etc.) aren't successful abroad in any way at all.

&gt;Perhaps, but the amount extra you get is considerable.

Quantity &lt;&gt; quality. Hence 150 channels and nothing's on.

&gt;That's their argument, not mine. I am not them.

But you're using the same logic - and instead of providing a counterpoint you've resorted to distancing yourself instead, without explanation as to why your situation is any different.

&gt;A loophole is unintended.

It's existed since before the internet.

&gt;The iPlayer being free appears to be deliberate. 

This has come about because of the trouble and money involved in trying to track down internet-based non-license payers. If they raise a paywall, then it kind of defeats the purpose (as would asking for your credit card at A&amp;E) and is questionable when so few don't think much of (or mind) £12 a month considering the principle.

&gt;Contact the BBC if this bothers you so much.

Come up with a decent excuse that doesn't involve pretending to not recognise public from private services on a public board - or don't post, if this bothers you so much.

&gt;And no, it doesn't sound familiar.

Of course not. Nobody does this at all, anywhere, ever :-)

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"I've seen mixed results from kids from my sort of background who have gone to private schools. It probably depends on the school. Some have more confidence and a better education. Others find they don't quite fit in because their parents don't have a boatload of cash. One of my former colleagues scrimped and saved to send his daughter  to a private school. The other kids had ponies, so he bought her  a pony. He found her crying up in her bedroom because the pony wasn't a thoroughbred. He withdrew her from the school.

Good state schools work hard to give their pupils the same level of connections and opportunities. The bog standard comprehensive I went to in Scotland sent people to Oxford or Cambridge nearly every year. The one I send my kids to sponsors loads of events where they can work with local businesses, meet local politicians, all the good networking stuff. The trouble is that not all state schools are as good as that. 

But you won't mix with the likes of David Cameron at a state school. Then again, if your parents don't already move in the right circles, you won't mix with our overlords even if you go to a good private school.

This is all interesting stuff, but an even more interesting question is what we do about it. We've got a large and growing underclass which leaves people trapped and which will only get bigger with the demise of unskilled work. I'm coming round to the idea of a [basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income), plus building lots of social housing.

 What I'm curious about is how much of this is us paying for the sins of our past. For instance, we would have posted large losses on the sale of Andy carrol and Stewart downing for this financial year. We would have made about an 18m loss on carrol, and probably at least 10 on downing. This could be a contributing factor on why we posted such a large loss.

In a way yes.  But often this stupidity hurt them and the family.  A member of staff was caught with her hand in the till.  Witnessed by two parents, checking the cash tend, it was indeed missing.  She'd also been showing up late for work, my parents decided not to call the police.  This was a big mistake.  The other staff (mostly girls, only two males on the payrole) were unkind about this, and she resigned shortly after.  Rather she didn't come into work for 3 days and refused to answer phone calls.

Fast forward a week, and an investigation is launched into my father for molestation of babies claims.  This is odd, as babies having 1:3 staffing ratio, well physically it would be very difficult to do this without other staff noticing.  Anyway, my parents are told that they are to volenterally remove him from been in contact with children.  This is a problem because he was normally the 'reserve' doing the administration work / cleaning etc, but if a staffer was sick, he could fill in.

How long do you think the investigation took?  Based on an anonymous source, parents of children were interviewed (at least this was done without prejudice, they were told it was a random screening as part of regular inspections).

The problem is you can't prove innocence.

The claims however I think ruined my fathers trust, he couldn't believe someone would lie about something like this.   It also ruined them economically.  They effectively had my fathers wage being almost unfundable.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"This is a really tricky question to pin-down. Because it leads to other questions and is itself based on other questions.

A starting point:

* Tribal cultures of humans used to spend about 3-4 hours a day ""working"".
* Industrialization in the UK with factories could lead to iirc something like 15 hours or so per day.
* Our modern lives in Western (WEIRD!) societies in the UK for example are about 8 hour days so you can see we're right in the middle between those two.

Ways to think about work:

1. Job = Pays money for hours put in. No other reward. Usually comprises of events that have no lasting value and little intrinsic value.
2. Career = Pays money for hours put in, but with progression and expandion of skills and/or responsibilities. Value is in increasing returns on investment of your finite resource: Time in exchange for your skills. Learning occurs at higher frequency, challenge occurs at higher frequency and therefore some more meaningful experiences can be gained. But this type of work can also be work time exchange for salary and the preceding merely to improve that ratio with no intrinsic value and little exterior value to the rest of your life.
3. Lifestyle = Ultimately you might come to the conclusion your work-life balance is important or any work decision necessitates a lifestyle choice: The company you keep, the values you hold, the place and opportunities available to you and hence the sum total experience of your life and that of people you are connected to. For some people total work appears to fill this niche, but they are limited the full range of experiences that that extreme choice leads to the opportunity-cost of.

Not everyone is the same, and experience is a very subject outcome, but I think work that is possible to integrate into life and atst allow for other experiences in a more optimal form is the best outcome: Whether that includes or excludes more time working, then becomes somewhat irrelevant as work-leisure both blend or reinforce each other with greater productive outcomes (internal and external).

I think many jobs describe Job and time reduction on those is time regained. I think some jobs are career and time reduction on those needs to be equalled by equally productive time elsewhere. And I think there are not enough jobs that are Lifestyle jobs, unless they require exceptional individuals or individuals who work targetted to realize this ideal.

It raises the point that our current losses would put us outside of the pure FFP criteria, and then on balance says that certain things that can be excluded from FFP losses would probably help us out and put us on the safe side.

I think at the very least the whole article is a little more grounded and balanced than people trying to put a positive spin on a loss of nearly £50m by claiming that we now have ""less debt"" just because it's been reshuffled around a bit. We've reduced the amount of debt we're required to pay interest on, but we still owe more money at the end of that financial period than we did at the start and in financial terms we're still operating at a loss (though we're actually in slight profit if you ignore the extra losses associated with player transfers).

That said, with profit and loss statements you typically can't just look at the end figures and the bottom line and get the whole picture - it's important to compare with the previous year's figures (which is why they're always included in P&amp;L reports) and in that regard the numbers are at least moving in the right way. If we get Champions League then I'd expect us to be in profit or barely making a loss in the coming seasons, aside from investment in the redevelopment of Anfield (which is excluded from FFP and should be a net return in the long-term anyway).

true,Skavau,null,null,"&gt;Which is highlighting the difference between ad-based, private channels and a public service.

You seem to have missed the point. Channel 4, ITV etc are effectively subscription based because the TV License stipulates that owning a television requires you to have one.

This is unfair on them as people have to purchase a license to watch them even though they do not receive money from that.

&gt;You're ignoring the point of the licenses' existence. And the parallel about asserting that seatbelts were pointless because it wasn't law to wear them.

Wearing a seatbelt is a matter of safety. Having or not having a TV License is not. Apples and Oranges.

&gt;Comparing public services is pathetic?

Yes, if they differ in content and importance.

&gt;Only if you're asserting that you have no obligation to pay.

I don't, and shouldn't when it comes to the BBC License fee.

&gt;The services I listed are things that everyone will use, at some stage. It's very, very unlikely that nobody will ever watch/ listen to/ browse anything by the BBC, ever.

Perhaps. It is entirely plausible however that someone's exposure to the BBC will just be their website, or the very occasional radio station. That does not warrant the price of the license fee which frankly needs to modernise.

&gt;That's what some people think about the fire services. Doesn't make 'em right.

The Fire Service is there to save lives and prevent mass damage to properties and businesses. We are all indirectly or directly served by them. This is even greater when it comes to the Police and the NHS. Make better comparisons.

&gt;And I will never use the NHS, so I don't have to pay for others or in advance for it, right?

Unless you plan on going exclusively private for all your health care you will at some point, use the NHS. I would go so far as to assume that you also already have. This comparison is just comical.

The NHS is far, far more important than propping up a broadcasting service.

&gt;I didn't say you did. I was illustrating what happens if others use your excuse, and why that's a bad thing.

What excuse have I used exactly? I do not feel obligated by guilt or law to pay a license fee for a broadcasting service. Saying that isn't an excuse, it is a reason for why I do not buy into an optional fee.

Now if everyone decided to opt-out of the BBC? Well, too bad. That would be what most people would decide. It would at that point become far more dangerous and harmful to society to demand millions of people buy into a service they have no plans on using. 

&gt;No, you're sustaining it.

As is everyone else who has replied. What is your point?

&gt;You need to justify your assertions full stop, because ultimately your only defence has been 'it's not illegal'.

No I don't. This discussion to me is mental masturbation. I like debate and discussion. I don't ""need"" to do or say anything to you or anyone on Reddit. I choose to reply, as do you.

This kind of presumption by you is nothing more than delusions of grandeur, really.

&gt;Make lame justifications, and you're get questions (sorry about that) - which is why I gave examples of no-brainers that ended up having to be criminalised because some people will stick to the dumbest excuses over what amounts to a trivial amount of money.

Seatbelt Laws and Smoking In Cars = Dangerous.

Not paying a license fee for an advertisement free media service = Not Dangerous.

&gt;I-I-I.

Yes, ""I"", ""I"", ""I"". I do not feel obligated to buy into a media service that I do not consume.

&gt;There are lots of ethical reasons, some of which I've already listed. More/ better content for all.

I would wager that the quality of content produced would not decline without the BBC nor would the amount. Apart from which, as good as this might sound to you, this is not a valid reason to impose the License Fee as a mandatory tax. Under your proposals you would have to rename the License Fee to ""Media Fee"" or ""British Broadcast Fee"" or something because as it stands it is currently a license fee people require if they own a television.

On this point, I also must ask: Are you against the Black &amp; White License Fee? It is cheaper. Do you see those who have that as making excuses as presumably they should pay full price for the greater public good?

&gt;No Ads on TV or radio.

Not good enough of a reason to impose a mandatory tax.

&gt;Educational content on the website.

There are loads of educational websites out there. The BBC is barely used for that purpose. Not good enough of a reason.

&gt;You are aware of the difference between a private company and a public service, right?

Yes.

&gt;Which is an odd statement considering I've already listed why we pay for Fire Services, Police etc. that we almost never use (all public services).

The idea that we never use the Police or the NHS is laughable. Their continued existence and services are the background to all aspects of public life. The Fire Service less so, but it is a vital service that requires public money.

&gt;Just because you want to assert that the BBC should be treated like a private company doesn't change the fact that it's not, and has never been treated as such.

I'm saying that it currently is not mandatory. If you wish to petition the government to change that, by all means.

&gt;You asserted that aggregate content was better. I've given examples of how this is not true. It's odd that you're quite willing to dictate the apparent low-quality of BBC output when you apparently haven't actually seen any of it at all.

I have seen a fair amount of BBC output. Mostly panel shows, sitcoms and the odd documentary. Not much in recent years mind, but I am aware of it.

&gt;Sure, nobody in the world would agree that (for example) the UK Top Gear is the best one. The likes of that and Doctor Who (etc.) aren't successful abroad in any way at all.

I don't know anything about programs like Top Gear. I am aware of its brilliant reputation. Doctor Who, which I have seen in the past, is not up there on the quality of other serial dramas.

At any rate, however good the BBC may or may not be it does not justify compelling an entire population to support it.

&gt;Quantity &lt;&gt; quality. Hence 150 channels and nothing's on.

People who say that don't look hard enough. When I read the TV Listings I am rarely impressed by the BBC output on any given night.

&gt;Come up with a decent excuse that doesn't involve pretending to not recognise public from private services on a public board, if this bothers you so much.

This has meant services have got worse, meaning more people are willing to say 'I don't want public services as they are shit, I want the money in my back pocket'. This is exactly what the Tories want, as they have some sort of fetish for stripping the state bare because it means those who have money get to keep it, and those who don't get fucked over. By reducing the effectiveness of public services by reducing funding, they're getting people to think it is impossible for the state to run them, even though they are running them poorly on purpose.

The solution isn't that because public services aren't perfect we should scrap as many as possible, the solution is to improve these public services. While *you* might not use the NHS, and *you* might not receive full benefits, and *you* might get lots of money from reducing taxes, the majority are not like you, and won't benefit greatly from tax cuts, and will be burdened by stripping the state bare because of it, and it's this individualistic selfishness which got us into this situation in the first place.

My issue is with how it is being done. Currently, the students are the only ones who are going to lose out massively in this. They are now paying £9,000 a year for a degree, and if the strikes go ahead as planned and dissertations do not get marked, then they are being denied the degree they will have worked hard and put themselves £27,000 in debt for. What will happen then?

I hope the staff can get the students on their side for this though, I know that the decision to strike over the dissertation period will not have been taken lightly.

Isn't it illegal to pay for the same job based on gender?

If you dropped out of a course and want to start a new one, how much funding you can get depends on how long you spent on your first course.


Every year of student finance you received on your first course will count against a year of your new course. But remember that you get a bonus year of finance. So the end result looks like this:

Two years of previous study: You'll have to pay your own way for the first year of your course, but you'll get student finance for every year after that.

It's possible, but the difficulty is:

It's gone so far over budget, that we have half of one line, for almost twice the price of what two lines were supposed to cost us.

As a result, the thing's basically guaranteed to run at a loss (thus draining money from other areas), and it serves a fairly narrow slice of the city - for most people it's of no use at all as it goes nowhere near where they live or work.

It should certainly be faster than the bus over the more western section (as it's entirely off the road and shadows the main train line), though worth noting that by the official timetables, the airport bus is faster.

As to traffic jams ... we've **already** had an example of how the trams can *cause* traffic jams, because they're [unable to divert around an ambulance that's parked up to attend an emergency](http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/transport/ambulance-parked-on-tram-tracks-raises-jam-fears-1-3320507)...",0,1393942272,null,0,false,0,cfu2nzg,t3_1zithf,t1_cfu2nzg,t1_cfu2g8m,null,1432652513,5,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,5

I recall reading similar too - I think the figure cited was that for the money being spent on the trams, they could've made Lothian Buses entire network free to use for about a decade.

However, that was never an option, because the tram money had to be on capital expenditure, not operating costs.

Mind you, for what's gone on the trams, we could've replaced Lothian's entire bus fleet with spangly new hybrid (like the single deckers on the number 1 route, or the double deckers on the 10) or even fully electric buses...

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I assume you mean [this poll](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24454006), where 1,031 people were surveyed on public services?

It was an interesting read actually, and shows what you can do with statistics:

&gt; But today's poll by ICM suggests six out of 10 people think service quality has been maintained or improved. 

From the linked net results, 15% thought services got better, 40% thought things got worse, and 42% thought things stayed the same. So, if I wanted to support the cuts, I could say, as the article does, that 6 out of 10 (or 55%, more like 5.5 out of 10, 11 out of 20) thought things stayed the same or got better, but if I wanted to oppose the cuts, I could say 8 out of 10 (or 8.2 out of 10, 41 out of 51) thought things got worse or stayed the same. Both convey much different messages, but both are correct. 

But back on your topic. Only 15% think public services got better. 42% thought they got worse. It appears the majority don't agree with you, judging by the poll I assume you're working off. 

Also, it depends on which topic you are talking about. On the topics you mention in your first reply, hospitals, GPs and social care (care for the elderly), it seems the majority think services got worse:

* Hospitals: 27% better, 36% same, 30% worse

* GPs: 29% better, 41% same, 28% worse

* Elderly care: 11% better, 22% same, 22% worse

While in hospitals and GPs things seem pretty even, and not much can be taken from it, this government saw many more people perceiving elderly care and worse. Most importantly, none of those stats agree with your point which implied many saw even modest improvements over the last government, with 82% thinking things either stayed the same or got worse.

From the [FAQ](https://purseio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201163570-What-if-I-need-to-return-exchange-or-report-damaged-items-)

For all items that are fulfilled (i.e. shipped) by Amazon, you will be able to contact Amazon directly to make these changes using the Amazon Order ID that Buyer provides. Once you receive the order from Amazon and confirm receiving, your BTC will be released from escrow and the Amazon Order ID will be emailed to you.
Items fulfilled or shipped by third party merchant require you to contact the merchant directly to resolve, with policies that vary between them. Because Amazon encourages a high level of customer satisfaction, merchants are usually very happy to work with you. 

  
&gt; And how do you mediate disputes between buyers and sellers?

Amazon has order IDs that can be used to verify the purchase, in addition to tracking numbers. We use this as well as the records we keep on the wishlist. So far, any disputes were result of honest mistakes or obvious scammers/trolls, so it has been pretty straight forward.

true,rydleo,null,null,"What I mean is potential sale price versus currently amortized value being positive rather than a negative.  Look at Carroll as an example:

We initially signed him on a 5.5 year contract for £36.1M.  So, his amortized book value is ~£6.56M per year (amount which shows up buried in the 'player amortization' cost on each FY report).

We then sold Carroll for £15.4M 2.5 years into his contract, meaning his book value at the club was still ~£6.56M x 3 years remaining = ~£19.7M.  So, we have to take our liability of £19.7M and subtract revenue received of £15.4 = a loss on Carroll in the 13/14 fiscal year of ~£4.3M.  It would actually be a little higher than that as we also had to pay him a loyalty bonus of at least 5% of the transfer fee, so reduce the amount paid by West Ham by another ~£700k or so.

Anyways, I can only think of a few players where the amount to be gained if they were sold versus what is left of their amortized value would be a big enough positive to make a massive difference in the books- Sterling, Sturridge, and Suarez.

Anyway, translation....

To solve the problem of defence, Liverpool will try to get an important player, Spurs' Jan Vertonghen, with offers to play in the Champions League next season. Can LFC manage this?

Liverpool is now the preferred choice for Vertonghen and is the first choice for Brendan Rodgers in the summer. He has now had two seasons with the Spurs and is ready to move if the club fail to get into the CL next season. In his first season in the Premier League, he got the awards 'Premier League Team of the Year 12/13' and 'Player of the Month in March 2013' for his outstanding performances.

Jan Vertonghen says...

""I want to play in the Champions League with Tottenham, I hope to try to do this this year. If not , I cannot give any comments. We will wait until the end of the season and after the World Cup in Brazil.

Spurs are now ranked No. 5, 4 points behind Man City. Two players who were recently purchased were expensive; Soldado and Lamela has yet to show their true ability. AVB stagnated for a long time and was replaced with interim coach Tim Sherwood. 

Right now we already have a lot of defensive players, whether they have not been given a chance to play or who have always been aroud. The list; Skrtel, Sakho, Agger, Toure, Coates, Ilori and also some players from the reserve/academy; Wisdom, Kelly, etc. 

The first option this far ; Skrtel &amp; Sakho; Agger, Toure. Coates &amp; Ilori as backups. If we want to buy Vertonghen, it would be difficult to guarantee he will play every game and chances are he will play left back. If he is given a role only in the left back position, he will probably not go for Liverpool.

Vertonghen is very vocal and always expresses unrest if necessary. At Spurs, he always wanted to play central defence and not at left back, while under AVB. In his second season in the Premier League, he's built a reputation among the best central defender EPL best and is sure not to be sold cheap.

Roumor says Barcelona bid 25 million pound for him so if Liverpool are serious about wanting want him, we have to spend more than that. I suppose we'll try to get him but Spurs will not even sell to other EPL contenders (except if the sale price higher, like Manchester City *(wut?)* ) He's a good player but if we want to him to play left back , preferably buy players more comfortable in that position.

true,rzam,lfc68,,"I started following Liverpool during that 2005 Champions League run that culminated in Istanbul. I was 15 and really getting into the sport, and I totally fell in love with everything about Liverpool -- the history, the city, the players (Stevie became a personal hero), how that team played under Rafa and how they persevered against richer, more talented squads to win the Cup. And not least, the fans and the passion they have for the club.

If there was any doubt before about my allegiances, this was *the* match that clinched it for me -- the epitome of why the club is so fucking special, and why Liverpool fans are so highly-regarded around the world. I'd never seen any crowd at any sporting event (especially growing up in the States) so invested in a contest. Anfield was the world's largest fucking choir that night, the songs rattled out of the TV with such vigor that I could only imagine what it was like to actually be there. Looking back on it now, it was a special moment -- Rafa's first year, the team not doing well in the league but defying all odds in Europe since The Beauty against Olympiakos. Chelsea would be the English champions that year, but we went into the Bridge and shut them out in the first leg -- which in turn made the second leg pretty much the biggest fucking match of all time, if you were following the team at that point.

And that's exactly how Anfield treated it that night. I guess it's something to do with our tradition in the competition, going back to the 70s when the standing Kop produced a [legendary atmosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9B26fXTj4c) on European nights, but there is nothing like a crucial Champions League match at the ground -- it's something that's literally captivated football fans around the world for decades. It's why I love the club, and it's a damn shame that the entire football world has been deprived of the sight for the past four and a half years. But not much longer.

(P.S. I asked George Sephton, the Voice of Anfield, about the Chelsea match on Twitter. [He said](https://twitter.com/VoiceOfAnfield/status/440626002310352896) it was undoubtedly the greatest atmosphere he's ever witnessed at the stadium.)",0,1393946470,null,0,false,0,cfu42i2,t3_1zgi0x,t1_cfu42i2,t3_1zgi0x,null,1432653174,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;

&gt;The **Czech Footballer of the Year** ([Czech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language): Fotbalista roku) is awarded in the [Czech Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) by the [Football Association of the Czech Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_the_Czech_Republic) (ČMFS). Eligibility extends to Czech players in the Czech Republic and abroad. Awards for young player, coach and [Gambrinus liga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambrinus_liga) personality of the year are also awarded. The award was first presented in 1965, as an award for the whole of Czechoslovakia. It was won by [Ján Popluhár](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1n_Popluh%C3%A1r). 

&gt;[Petr Čech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_%C4%8Cech) won the award for an unprecedented sixth time in the 2012 ceremony, passing the previous record of five wins held by fellow goalkeeper [Ivo Viktor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Viktor).  Viktor had previously won the award more times than any other player, having won the award five times in the Czechoslovak era between 1968 and 1976. 

&gt;The other football award in the Czech Republic is the [Golden Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Ball_(Czech_Republic\)), awarded by sport journalists.

I seriously doubt that any lecturer is on any less than ~£30k/year, which is far above the living wage. They're still underpaid compared to lecturers in other countries, but it's hardly minimum wage. I would also note that most of the lecturers would have a PhD and could probably earn a fair bit more working in the private sector.. I know I could.

From what I've observed, the majority of staff demanding pay rises are the support/admin staff.. who are probably on a fair bit less than the lecturers.

The university I work at is a complete shambles when it comes to anything bureaucratic.. be it IT, HR, finance, etc.

It's bad in the sense that there has been very little improvement in my mind in terms of things like wages, as an example.  For all of the talk about our 'new wage structure' there seems to be little fruit bearing from that.  Revenue is increasing, albeit slowly, which is good.  Commerical revenue is on a nice growth curve, which is also good.  As I said elsewhere in this thread, the single biggest issue I see when looking at the accounts for the last several years is we've made absolutely nothing from player sales and in fact most are negative book value (meaning they are taking away from the revenue stream not adding to it).  That can be construed as paying for the sins of the past as simply put all of the players we've sold lately were well overpaid for initially and then underperformed which is what led to this condition existing.  Unfortunately, Sturridge and Coutinho aside, I'm not sure that BR's eventual player sales will fare much better, to be honest.

With respect to Downing and Carroll, they were sold this FY, so their impact isn't in this particular fiscal release.  Eventually we'll see around a £4M loss on the sale of Carroll (sale price - amortized book value) and probably a £2M or so loss on the sale of Downing as I recall last time I did the math to figure it out.  The sale of Shelvey will largely offset that, though.  Unfortunately, our player amortization is set to grow by upwards of £10M for FY 13/14 since we added &gt; £50M of players to the squad which means additional burden that was not offset, or at least not offset by sales of players.",0,1393949315,null,0,false,0,cfu56p1,t3_1zh2ln,t1_cfu56p1,t1_cfu1yrb,null,1432653700,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

That saying worked fine in the 50's/60's. These days you need two incomes to afford a mortgage and bills. 

As it stands, we're two responsible people and kids are simply not on the agenda until one of us earns enough to support the other to stay home + kid. Given taxation levels on higher incomes, I imagine that simply isn't going to happen.

Yes thanks, I know what an asset is. I don't understand your assertion about no cash and spare bedrooms? If you have a house worth over £30,000 than you may have to sell it to afford to live in a care home. That shouldn't be a problem, as you no longer live in your house, because you've moved to a care home. That's why people spend their life building up assets.

&gt; They contributed, why shouldn't they be entitled to keep things they worked for? Especially things that have been triple taxed.

Because they have no use for it anymore? And other people do?

City is reported as saying their youth program is going to cost 'up to £10M' but they're in the midst of actually spending quite a lot on construction of facilities and the like so I don't think our figures would be as high based on that.  They could be though, there is no way to really tell how much we spend on youth development as it's not explicitly broken down for this financial release.  

I also don't see the stadium redevelopment at this point as being so large, to be honest.  There is simply no where to bury the cost of that and nothing stands out as being unusually high.  Stadium redevelopment costs (of which there are undoubtedly some) would have to be mostly buried in the 'other operating costs' bucket which totaled ~£28M for the FY which is a little high compared to previous years (I seem to remember this being closer to £20M in the past).

Either way, we most definitely fail the break even FFP test and it will be incumbent on the club to prove to UEFA that with exceptions we meet their requirements.  Personally, my opinion based on what I personally see in the finances is that we will fail this as well.

&gt; **5.1 The Scoring System**

 
&gt; *5.1.1* The scoring system is fixed for positions 1 - 16 (the A Tour, in the open division). The points scored by teams finishing below 16th (the Open B and C Tour, or the lower portion of the mixed tour) vary depending on the number of teams at the tournament. 


&gt; *5.1.2* Within the fixed points (1 – 16) there are bonus points for certain finishing positions; in particular 1st, 5th, and 13th. 


&gt; *5.1.3* At Open Tour 1 and Open Tour 2, the top two teams in the B-tour/C-tour will score the same points as the bottom two in the A-tour/B-tour, i.e. 15th and 17th both score the points for 15th position; and similarly for 16th/18th, 31st/33rd, and 32nd/34th. For the purposes of calculating points for other teams, those teams from 17th-18th and 33rd-34th are ignored, meaning that 19th overal scores the points normally awarded to 17th, and so on down the rankings. At Open Tour 3, the  points for all Open teams will be awarded normally as per the algorithm. 

  
&gt; * 1st 250
* 2nd 230 
* 3rd 222 
* 4th 210 
* 5th 205 
* 6th 190
* 7th 182 
* 8th 170 
* 9th162 
* 10th 150 
* 11th 141 
* 12th 130 
* 13th 125 
* 14th 110 
* 15th 101 
* 16th 90

&gt;Positions are based on the combined A and B Tour placings. So – if there are 16 teams in the A Tour, the winner of the B Tour is deemed to be in 17th position. Teams below 16th finishing in m'th position (with N teams in the tournament) score 

    80*(N+1-m)/(N-16)

&gt; points, (rounding to the nearest integer). Below is an example of this calculation for a 32 team event with 16 teams in the A Tour.

&gt;* 17th 80 
* 18th 75 
* 19th 70 
* 20th 65 
* 21st 60 
* 22nd 55 
* 23rd 50 
* 24th 45 
* 25th 40 
* 26th 35 
* 27th 30 
* 28th 25 
* 29th 20 
* 30th 15 
* 31st 10

Time would be better spent on targets which would be safer and cheaper. I've suggested Lovren before. He'd essentially replace Skrtel in the team, which I'd imagine we'd be able to almost break even on expenses if we sell him or Agger. I'd prefer to Skrtel to go tbh, I love Skrtel, but every time we play him, I wonder whether the world class defender will turn up, or Titus Bramble JR.

I just think Agger would be great backup/rotational for the back, and he's more of a leader to have a round the team. I also think we'd get a better price for Skrtel after this year. Agger's been constantly injured.

-**-

Set up a business with new business bank account.

Put your BTC transactions through it.

Have a good reason for having irregular and wildly variable inputs/outputs to this account. i.e. a plausible business idea which results in such transactions. For example : ""Hello Mr Bank manager, I would like to turn my hobby of collecting celebrity autographs into a proper business as I have recently discovered some of my collection are worth 10s of thousands of pounds. I have been doing this for 20 years and have a worldwide network of collectors/suppliers/dealers and reckon I could make it into a great business. If successful I may expand into other associated areas which I have knowledge of such as celebrity memorabilia. I will need a business account and ability to trade internationally anywhere in the world. For the first year I expect my turnover will be well below the VAT threshold so I will start as not VAT registered and will only register when it looks like this will be exceeded (most of my customers will be individual collectors, not businesses). I already have an accountant, he is xxx yyy ."" You will get a business bank account provided you do not ever mention the word ""Bitcoin"". From time to time the bank may invite you for a chat , ignore/decline these request which are really intended just to sell you something, in reality they have very little interest in what you are doing.

During your first year of autograph trading you decide to branch out into other areas of business, i.e. buying and selling of Bitcoin. There is no obligation to tell the bank you have diversified your initial business plan.

Keep comprehensive records so that if any inquiries are made you can prove you were simply bitcoin trading and not money laundering.

""The increase in revenue continues a steady upward trend since Fenway Sports Group took over the club in October 2010 while, during the same period, external debt has fallen by almost £200m.""

Notice the use of ""2010"".  When FSG (then NESV) bought Liverpool Football Club, the club owed £237M or thereabouts to two banks.  NESV paid £300M for the club and ~£200M of that was used to pay off debt to RBS and Wachovia, leaving Liverpool Football Club (at that time) with ~£37M in total debt.  Since then, the club has been losing money which has been financed through a combination of bank loans and no-interest loans from the owners.

This latest full fiscal report shows Liverpool Football club now have the following debt:

-  £48.1M in bank loans (down from the year previous when it was £69.8M)
-  £69.8M in loans from UKSV (up from the previous year when it was £22.2M)

So, year on year, bank loans have decreased by ~£19M (which is definitely a good thing), but overall debt to those 2 has increased, albeit the UKSV one is a no-interest loan (which is also a good thing).  

Compared to pre-acquisiton LFC (which is what they are doing and is, in my opinion, BS as that was 4 years ago now), the bank debt is clearly much lower, but what they're not saying is bank debt is up from post-acquisition LFC, thus why I would personally say they are best being misleading.

I never said we weren't in good financial health at all, I said the losses need to stop, which they do as it's not sustainable to expect FSG to continually be injecting no-interest loans into the club's coffers to cover the losses we're making.  If we get CL this year along with the increased revenue from TV rights, those two revenue items will go a very long way to helping to balance the budget (i.e. our costs will be similar, but our revenue should increase into the ~£240M+ range).",0,1393953881,null,0,false,0,cfu77de,t3_1zippo,t1_cfu77de,t1_cfu0gf4,null,1432654723,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

- FSG are saving our collective asses with their no-interest loans, which is not something they have to do

- FSG are incredibly competent and know what they are doing.  I have full faith in their ability to turn the club around financially and that they have a plan to do just that over the longer term.

- That said, it's clearly spin to say they have reduced bank debt and it's a case of cherry picking the stats to support your narrative.  They have reduced bank debt year over year and versus where we were under H&amp;G, but they have not reduced bank debt back down to immediate post-acquistion levels (when it was only £37M or so).

- The above said, this is not a knock on them at all!  What other choice do they have when the club is losing near £50M every year other than to pay for it somehow?  They could have pulled a Villa and sold our best players, but they didn't and haven't.

It's strange, I don't think I realised how much it did at the time.  It was pretty obvious the claims were bogus, not one member of staff ever thought it was (or let me find out).  One even commented that he always had to do some paperwork if ever a nappy needed changing!  But it really hit my father.  I don't think he understood someone could be so malicious.

I was a teenager at the time, I was also sadly bed ridden for a long while, this gave me a lot of time for philosophy.  I realised that most people were very stupid.  I used to think people were mean or evil, but I realised that they probably feel entirely justified in the situation.  Looking back I bet that girl thought she wasn't paid enough, so stealing was just, that her treatment was unfair, that someone else was to blame and should be feeling her pain.

It wasn't just the duplicity of people, but I think I realised that they are blind to it themselves, that they just don't see the evidence before them.  This was also combined with my own experiences at the time, until I fell ill I'd been in the bottom sets in school, my hand writing and spelling was so poor, I was chucked in.  When I started having endless hospital visits, I was transferred to a different schooling system, they immediately tested me for dyslexia, certain cognitive exercises and then an IQ test.  This helped me understand that my world view isn't normal, just as much as I struggle to write, which most take for granted, most people struggle to make mathematical analysis in a way that is incredibly obvious to me.  This led to a lot of frustration as a kid, interacting with people who you think should be able to think the way you think, but just can't possibly grasp it.  To me, making such allegations would serve no purpose, I would not profit from the situation, I can not comprehend why someone wouldn't see they just make themselves a worse person.  Yet I learned to understand to not try and expect people to think like me at all.  I think that was a big step, and it helps a lot, before I used to get very frustrated with this fact.  I think this put me in a much better place by the time I got to A-levels and Uni, I learned to not expect so much from people.  I fear that before I've probably made a lot of people feel very stupid, hell I still probably do without thinking.

&gt;  For some people it is striving hard and creating a better type of battery, or a new design for a set of clothes, or curing cancer, or spending time getting high....it's down to each persons motivation. Leave people alone to do what they want and give them the framework to achieve it.

Yes! And they can continue to do all of those things without the anxiety of where the next paycheck will come from. So many things (especially in health) have been infected by a need to make money. I remember reading on reddit a post written by a psychotherapist who was completely disillusioned by his work because all he was doing was pandering to the pharmaceutical companies who paid his bills. Take away the problem of money and people actually can follow their passions. I absolutely agree, leave people alone and let them do what they want, that's the essence of what I'm arguing for. This isn't possible in the current world we live in because people are always trying to make more and more money. What's right is distorted by this constant desire for more things, and fear of not having enough. Happiness has never been founded in having lots of stuff. This is something people ought to get past before becoming adults but the vast majority don't. 

We *can* have a society in which we all work together to provide for our needs and hobbies etc. without having to work so much. We don't do it because a small minority are making *bank* and want to continue doing so. We need a complete overhaul of our economic system, and of society at large (which realistically will probably only happen gradually).

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"No, it shouldn't.  There aren't enough of them and Gerrard is likely done after the world cup, he's getting old for international football.  What the future England team should be based around is the new, more progressive style that managers like rodgers, Martinez, and Pcchetino are programming into their young players.  Basically:

I really like the idea of Gerrard/Hendo/Wilshere through the middle right now with Sturridge up top and Lallana/Rooney to either side of him.  Rooney, in spite of how much I dislike him, is a brilliant footballer.  Him and Sturridge could almost certainly link up together similar to how Sturridge/Suarez work now with all the movement and interchanging.  If they can get going together then England's attack becomes a right terror to deal with.  

Meanwhile that midfield lineup provides a near endless supply of energy and effective pressing from Wilshere/Henderson, good distribution through all 3 of them, and great creativity from Gerrard.  It's basically Liverpool's current midfield but swapping Coutinho for Wilshere, which provides a bit more defensive stability at a slight loss of attacking presence/creativity (Coutinho is a better attacker IMO but Wilshere is still able to contribute very well going forward) compared to the normal Liverpool setup.  If Gerrard is injured or after he retires from the England side then you've got a ready-made replacement for him in the deeper role with Wilshere, who even Wenger maintains will be best playing deep as he develops.  At that point Barkley comes in as the third midfielder and you don't have to completely overhaul the system to accomodate the new boys, the pieces fit together.  

The issue here is that the football the side would be set up to play like this is not the type of play Hodgson has ever been known for.  It's much more ""continental european"" football, geared towards heavy pressing and good possession play with fast transitions and quick passing.  Roy likes his long ball, and he loves to sit deep with those boring, stifling defensive formations.  a more progressive manager will have to take over before we start to really see this, which I think is a shame because I believe that England has a rather solid crop of young players coming through that are going to be able to really spearhead a transformation of England's playstyle and tactics, but they'll need the right manager to mold them together.  Their club managers are really programming them to play this way (Rodgers, Martinez, Wenger, Pocchetino) and to me, it's going to force England to change.  I think that change will be a really good thing provided the transition is smooth.  I don't think Hodgson is the right person to do this at all, and I hope he doesn't last past the world cup.

true,jakegrubbs19,lfc99,,"I get the net change in the debt is still zero. But when dealing in figures this large, you have to look at the net present value. The fact that this loan came in being interest free, saves the club money because the original loan wasn't going to simply paid off in a years time. So that loan actually saves the club a significant amount of money. 

So the car purchase analogy doesn't quite serve the purpose because the amount in interest is so significant. A better comparison would be refinancing a home. If you have a high interest rate and you're struggling to meet the mortgage payments the bank is demanding and then suddenly a different bank pops up and offers to pay off the remaining debt via an interest fee loan, you take that deal. Because in the course of the repayment, the amount you owe will never change. Instead of compounding interest throughout the year. 


The standard APR of home purchases that large is around 3.337%, (again no idea the APR of loans like that in the business world so I continue with my house purchasing analogy using a £2 million home) with a 7/1 repayment schedule. So you end up paying almost  £250,000 in interest. With larger loans this number increases dramatically, especially if the repayment period is longer than 7 years. So this loan is a huge money saver.

Why? Because if any customers came in and asked where they were, we were told to 'encourage' them to bring their computers in to the PC Clinic for a diagnostic check, which basically involved some baboon spraying a can of compressed air.

First customer comes in and requests a copy of the latest Norton product, so I trundle off into the warehouse to find one, where I am met by an irate manager who asks what the hell I am doing.

99% of the staff don't know what the fuck they're talking about, but management doesn't care if they lie through their teeth to customers as long as they sell insurance and accessories to every customer.

Staff bonuses are very dependent on the amount of insurance sold, so the ""star salesmen"" essentially bully customers into buying it, often by offering the first month free (on a month rolling contract) at the last minute at the checkout and pretty much arguing with the customer until they take it. 

Also all employees are taught ""fives"" which is supposedly a psychological method for convincing someone they want to buy insurance- it's almost Derren Brown level stuff. 

Most of the salesmen don't care whether the customer got the right product/solved their problem as long as they get their commission- they're the kind of unscrupulous people that would be investment bankers if they weren't all incredibly thick.

No, but that isn't always a bad thing.  [*Leiden oder triumphieren,
Amboß oder Hammer sein.*](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=6333)  The idea that ultimately people have some element of choice, you must ensure you triumph, not suffer, you must be the hammer, not the anvil.  The poem is largely about strength, but there is underlying message I feel about the idea of competition, that you reap benefits from the learning and life lessons you gather sooner than later.

It was suggested that I had a lot of autistic traits, I lack intuition in social situations that I don't have experience of, luckily in the world of maths and computer programming, this makes me comparatively normal.  My point is, that past experiences, even unpleasant ones now serve me.  I'm starting up a new company (well have been for months now) my previous business partner fucked me over, but in doing so I learned a lot.  Fast forward a few years and this time I've agreed things upfront, my co-founder has over a decade more experience than me, but quickly commented he'd never met someone my age who was so experienced (ie negotiating hard).  Even thou I lost money, in the long run, it will have made me more, if it was tuition, the price was fair.

&gt;but I see where you're coming from.

Just the idea that we are all the same is utter bullshit.  Some can sing with perfect pitch, others can barely carry a tune no matter how hard they try.

My only criticism if I have one at all is not of the existence of the loan(s) or what FSG is doing but the somewhat misleading manner for which they are talking about bank debt that existed before they bought the club versus bank debt after.

Looking at it from a timeline perspective:

    1) LFC pre-acquistion debt:  £237M
    2) LFC immediate post-acquistion debt:  £37M
    3) LFC 2011/12 reported bank debt:  £69.8M
    4) LFC current bank debt:  £48.1M

They are comparing lines 4 to lines 3 (the £19M reduction in external debt) and comparing line 4 to line 1 (the £200M reduction in debt), but conveniently ignoring line 2.  That's not an issue necessarily and they're not lying to anything, but there is definitely spin involved.  That is really my only point in all of this.

true,WakaFlockaGeese,null,null,"I'm a Benfica supporter, and the article misses something huge: the team that played against PAOK is not the strongest / usual Benfica team. This season, the manager has been rotating the squad a lot, which has meant that in every cup game, be that domestic or international, we haven't fielded our main team (since the LC Group Stage, anyway). This might remain true in the coming game, but I don't think it will, because UEFA competitions are a very important source of revenue for the club, and now that we have a sizeable cushion in the Primeira Liga and a strong opposition in the Europa League, I think we will see the ""default"" Benfica starting XI on the 13th. 

The regular starting XI, a **4 - 1 - 3 - 2**, looks like this:

Position | Player
:--|:--
GK | Oblak 
RB | Maxi Pereira
CB | Luisão
CB | Garay
LB | Siqueira
CDM | Fejsa
RM | Markovic
LM | Gaitán
CAM | Enzo Pérez
ST| Lima
ST | Rodrigo




- The defense isn't much different than the one used against the Greeks. The RB and CBs are the same, the LB is a straight upgrade.

- The midfield and the attack, however, function much differently. **Defensively**, Fejsa, Matic's direct replacement, is a developing talent - not yet on par with his predecessor, but far from weak. Whereas Nemanja had the whole center midfield on lock, dropping super deep in defense and advancing up the field with the ball in his feet, Fejsa, who plays more defensively than Matic did, has a much more simple process: get the ball from the opponent and play a short pass, laterally or forward, starting the counter attack. **Offensively**, the dual strikers and the presence of a creative mid give Benfica's attack much more fluidity than with the system with two center mids used against PAOK. Enzo, the creative mid,  drops low, and when he gets the ball, he utilizes his speed to bolt forward, supported in the wings by two equally fast players: Gaitán on the left and Markovic on the right. The two strikers, Lima and Rodrigo, are clinical finishers, the latter more on form than the former.


Idk, this wasn't ""in depth"", but I thought it was important for y'all to know that the article was getting something very wrong, and maybe you'd be interested in a supporter's perspective. 

**TL; DR**: the article didn't discuss Benfica's stronger starting XI. It's correct in its assessment of the system it goes over, but it might not be the one that the team plays with against you lot.

It was down to the ridiculous sales targets the sales staff have. Contrary to popular belief, the staff aren't on commission. When I worked there (2008-2011) the targets for addons on laptops/desktops were roughly as follows:

* Whatever Happens/PC Performance (extended warranty) - 25% of laptop/desktop sales needed this
* Norton 360 - 70% needed this
* Office - 30% needed this
* Accessories (mice, bags, USB sticks etc) - 80% needed this

We *hated* Collect at Store computer sales as we knew it would usually fuck our targets up. The customers who ordered for collection tended to be slightly more tech-savvy and also tended to have a fixed price in their mind. Usually the exact amount that the computer they have just ordered cost.

If these targets weren't met (clue: they never were), none of the staff got their monthly bonus. As a tech guy I never really got bonuses anyway as we weren't really sales and therefore didn't deserve them.

We don't need these people in ticket offices and yet they were striking just for the ability to work... to do something pointless.

It's insane that people are trying to block technological advances just so that they continue to work when they shouldn't have to.

Well no, I'm no economist, but it takes basic common sense to notice how wasteful and pointless a lot of this work is. I think it really does require a chance of society in general. Think about our healthcare system. Very costly right? Well... it really needn't be.

Townsend is just too one dimensional for me and shifting towards this kind of play requires a more rounded player.  He can certainly develop into a great fit though, he's very talented.

I think you're giving Hodgson too much credit.  Look what he did with Liverpool, where he inherited a side that had been playing a more spanish style for years under Rafa.  I think it was a quote from Agger where he said something along the lines of not being used to liking having to play so many long balls and not liking it.  Maybe I'm not giving him enough, but I really don't like him as a manager and it isn't just for how bad he was with Liverpool, it's for how he always sets his teams up to play deep defensively and try to just nick a goal off the long ball at some point.  It's boring and predictable, but it can serve less talented sides (like Fulham or West Brom when he was at either club) pretty well as they can capitalize on a frustrated side that gets a little greedy just fine.  With more talented players in the mix (such as Liverpool or England) you're just stifling their ability and not allowing them to exert their influence on the game, which will stunt their impact and make them play worse.

Supply and demand. Once there's a sufficient number of families with two income earners, there's more money sloshing around for things like mortgages. 

Combine that with fewer houses being built, and house prices reach the point where (barring things like inheritances) you NEED to have two incomes to reasonably afford a house. 

If both of you are working, chances are you need two cars. Even if you practice bangernomics, you still have two fuel tanks to fill, two sets of road tax and insurance for two. You also have to pay childcare which previously you wouldn't have done.

Although this is not precisely correct this is the way that its set out...

The difference between HLS and ELS is basically the length of time that it will take to implement so your ELS covers buffer strips in fields, and the number of existing trees over a certain height and girth whereas HLS covers things that take a long time to implement eg replanting hedgerows (HUGE financial outlay), or replanting trees. The money that you get for ELS schemes is tiny in comparison to some of the HLS schemes so if you want to get the big subs in a few years time you've got to have these massive schemes in place now. Farming is not an industry that can rapidly change to suit government agenda, most farms have very long term growth plans and crop rotations. If the government decided to make it ""easier"" to do certain things then I doubt that the ""benefits"" would be realistically seen before a change in office.

Edinburgh council had reasonable-sized groups from all four of Scotland's major parties, and was run by an SNP-Lib Dem coalition at the time.

Labour put forward a motion, backed by the Tories, to not borrow the extra £231 million pounds that would be needed to run as far as York Place, and to instead stop it at Haymarket.

The SNP sat on their hands and abstained, and so the Lib Dems voting against that wasn't enough ... result, the council decision to terminate at Haymarket.

The SNP *government* then said, that's a ""significant departure from the original concept"", and if you do this then we're not going to give you the final tranche of £72m of government funding.

That then led to the council re-voting, and duly agreeing to borrow the nearly quarter of a billion pounds (or about £500 for every man, woman, and child in the city) to get it as far as York Place.

Quite how the fuck terminating at York Place isn't a ""significant departure from the original concept"" when it was supposed to get down to the waterfront, I don't know...

Lowton’s second season at Villa Park has fallen flat with the right-back struggling to repeat his impressive impact from his debut campaign.

There have been several enquiries from clubs about taking Lowton on loan, but Villa and the player himself prefer him to stay and challenge Leandro Bacuna.

Lowton, who signed a new deal last summer to keep him at Villa until 2017, has been left out of Lambert’s last three matchday squads for the draw at Cardiff, defeat at Newcastle and victory over Norwich.

It follows a disciplinary issue in mid-January when Lowton was fined a week’s wages for reporting late for training at Bodymoor Heath after getting stuck in traffic on the M1.

The 24-year-old former Sheffield United favourite was omitted from the squad for the following day’s draw at Liverpool, but regained his place for the win over West Brom, was an unused substitute for the draw at Everton and started the defeat to West Ham.

Lambert insisted last month that he had not fallen out with Lowton and it is understood the defender has told the manager he is determined to regain his first team place.

Last season, during his first year in the top flight, Lowton was a virtual ever-present, starting all but one of Villa’s Premier League matches.

Lowton was critical of his dip in form earlier this season, admitting his performances had not been good enough.",0,1393976866,null,0,false,0,cfuikho,t3_1zkshd,t1_cfuikho,t3_1zkshd,null,1432660145,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

Without money you can't eat, have a home, move from here to there, you can't have clothes and whatnot. You have to do something that gets you money, you have pretty much no choice about it.

A very privileged few find themselves in that position, usually due to a lucky birth. Most people struggle to get enough. To think this is a vector of freedom is bordering on the idiotic.

It seems to me that you are confusing the word *money* with the occasional meaning of it being - to have an excessive amount of money. You are without context.

Dreams give us hope and hope is a beautiful thing. 

Come May, we might be sitting 3rd with 2 points away from top. Will we be utterly disappointed? Yes. Will we feel regret that we ever dreamed? NO. 

Everyone on here is saying, lets take one game at a time. I agree that's the mentality the players/managers should be taking. They should not be eyeing the prize when there's still such a long way to go. However as fans, where our individual actions does not affect the team what so ever, should be allowed to dream and think about what COULD HAPPEN.

Just like theRedMenTV said, the chant should continue, it'll give the players the confidence they need too.

true,LightningGeek,eng-staffordshire,Wolves,"&gt; Careful, it's an effective pay cut based on the fact that nominal increases have been outstripped by inflation. I don't actually know of anyone who took an actual cut.

Good point and is one that is affecting a lot of people.

However, I've done a quick bit of research, and the average pay in 2010-2011 for [full time, none professors in the UK is £43,000 a year.](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/10_May_2012/attachments/Average_salary_of_academic_staff.pdf) The lowest pay I found was for male, full time, none professors staff at Heythrop College, University of London, who get an average of £24,336, although that is a bit of an anomaly and the next closest figures are all around £35k - £40k a year for men and women. They aren't amazing wages, but they are certainly well above the living wage (£15,000) and almost all are above the average UK wage (£27,000). Of course, their earnings should match inflation at the very least and I do not blame them for striking to get that, as well as it being a protest against those at the top giving themselves high pay rises for no reason.

&gt;It quite difficult to publish papers and propose funding bids- which are the main criteria for promotion - whilst on maternity leave. The gender gap I would imagine will be manifested through differential promotion.

I'm not sure where I stand on this. On one hand, men and women should be paid the same if they are doing the same job, at the same level as each other. However, if the required work is not done for a promotion, even if it is due to pregnancy, then I see no problem with a pay discrepancy. Unfortunately it is a hard decision women must make between having a career and having a family, but depending on the job, taking a year out of work can mean you are no longer up to speed as well as requiring training to ensure you are still qualified at your previous levels. A university lecturer most likely does not fit into this category though, so pay gaps should indeed be closer.",0,1393982419,null,0,false,0,cful2lc,t3_1zh91d,t1_cful2lc,t1_cfu3toc,null,1432661391,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I guess this makes sense to them on some level - ie. 'I understand whats happening here, Johnson is paid to much, therefore he is lazy and has lost his drive to succeed.' or 'johnson is angry that he is being forced to take a paycut, so he isnt trying'

last year it was 'Joe Allen is too small and scared of the tackle, therefore he always passes sideways or backwards'

The simple truth in both of these cases, is that playing through an injury is incredibly uncomfortable and has a massive impact on performance.

Funny story how I became a Spurs fan. I friend of mine had asked me what my favourite soccer team was. I didn't have one at the time I was following TFC and my dad was a big Barcelona fan but I wasn't into English soccer. We were at lunch and the guys next to we're talking about basketball, so I mixed the two up and I said my favourite team were the Spurs (San Antonio Spurs for you outsiders) then he told me he was an arsenal fan and started talking shit about all these players I had never heard of. I though to myself what the hell is a Gareth bale sure enough I googled it wondering why a soccer team in England had beef with a basketball team in Texas. Sure enough I learned it was its team blah blah blah still hadn't gotten into English soccer. Rewind three months later I'm at my cousins house watching Manchester City vs QPR final game of the season and I thought to myself holy sweet monkey balls that's the greatest game I have ever watched, and decided then next year I would get into it. Sure enough I picked spurs I had heard they had hired a Portuguese as there manger (I am part Portuguese) they had loads of talent so I committed to them. That guy who was the Arsenal fan left my school and I kept in touch from time to time through facebook but sadly died he died in a car accident.
