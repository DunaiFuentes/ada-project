Of course, no one can really tell you what to do! However, this depends on how serious you are about teaching English abroad. These days, Japan will take anyone with a BA if you just want to do the JET Programme or be an ALT or work at an eikaiwa (conversation school). In S. Korea, I'm sure their tuition/conversation schools also take people with BAs. 

If you're serious about it, then go for English and do a CELTA. If you're very serious, go for a TESOL BA (a few places have them) and a CELTA. If you're super duper serious, go for a BA in English (or anything), a CELTA, and an MA in TESOL. That combination will get you a job teaching at a University anywhere, although it's very competitive in England and the EU at the moment. 

Once you decide on your major, you'll need to contact the admissions offices at the Universities. There is usually one for each ""school"" (e.g. a Sciences admissions office for Biology/Pharmacy/etc.) and talk to them about your grades and look up their requirements. They usually have SAT/ACT scores and other information on the website for that specific ""school.""

He has given me a hero who can really make me hope. The Doctor is someone who I can look at, see all the sacrifice and pain that he has suffered. The terrible choices he has had to make and yet he still has wonder, hope, and love. A hero who abdicates mercy to his darkest enemies, who doesn't drop to the level of violence at the first sign of tough times. Willing to lay down his life and happiness over and over again.
All of this makes me think of the times in my life I feel empty or hopeless, when the rewards and happiness felt to far away to matter, and choose the better path even though it may hurt.

I would have to say the moments of his sacrifices effect me the most, the loss of rose, river, and his people and his reaction to it all strikes a cord in me I cannot quite describe. His quiet glory so filled with pain. and loneliness.

I love stories. The complex relationships and consistency throughout the long series, the hidden lessons, and everything in between.

Take a look at any of the links you've put up and find me a direct correlation between Islam and pedophilia being encouraged by it, which by the way is what we were talking about and not about war or violence.

Round up every pedophile and predator in Rotherham and anywhere else, and compare it to the numbers of Muslims in the UK, In fact, round off every convicted Muslim sexual predator in the world and compare that number to the number of Muslims who are regular folk just like you and me, and what you will find is that the words 'some arseholes' is quite fitting. 

I repeat, are you making the claim that they are informed by their faith that molesting children is what God/Allah wants? Don't conflate pedophilia and jihad/holy war, because they are *different* arguments.

But if you want to quantify *that* argument, violent Islamic states (both legitimate and non-legitimate ones) in the Middle East do not speak for all muslims and all of Islam, either. So round up every ISIL member, and compare their interpretations of Islam with the state of Indonesia or Malaysian citizens as an example. 

Does Islam have a fundamentalist slant to it that's disgusting? No more than the Bible does or indeed any religious text has done. But it's not turning or influencing every Muslim to be a pedophile when they grow up.

1) Assuming you are being paid the same, housing and the cost of living is less in the South-West;    
2) You can live in a place that is pretty well set for most sporty activities year-round.  Fancy surfing? Go to Newquay.  Fancy walking? Go to Bodmin or Dartmoor. There are decent facilities for most tastes in Cornwall, and more so in Devon;    
3) Although Truro is a long way from the capital, that should not be seen as a bad thing.  If all else fails (I.e. you don't want to drive the 270 miles or so to London) Newquay airport is about 25 minutes' drive from Truro and they offer regular flights to London from there, usually for less than the cost of train travel;    
4) Air quality is better down here;    
5) Cornwall is a fairly placid place to live - there is crime, of course, but still quite peaceful;    
6) All the major syndicated stores etc are in Truro, failing that St Austell, failing that go to the glory of the South-West, the wonderful shit hole of Plymouth (my home town ;-)  ) Of course there's always Exeter,but we don't talk about there ;-) Entertainment in the form of cinema is well served, although if big stage shows are your thing, these are a little more hard to come by.

Uh, no... I read the comments on the thread and yours figured quite often and regardless of what was said - always supported Brand. You must have also gone through the thread commenting on any criticism of Brand.

&gt; He gives the proceeds from his books away to employ drug addicts and those out of work, he helps people threatened with eviction in his free time and he opens up a political discourse but all you sad little snides can do is criticise him for sticking his head above the parapet.

Oh no doubt he does good things - I don't think I've ever claimed otherwise - but being a big speaker is his business and so yes, when he's in the wrong, he'll attract criticism. If he doesn't like that, he's in the wrong business. If *you* don't like it - tough shit. 

Nobody is perfect but the neat thing about words is that we can use them to call someone out on the bad things without immediately leaping to say 'Brand is *literally the devil*' - I've not said that and it doesn't look like anyone else here is either. 

But if you're going to put yourself in the spotlight on these issues and then be found to be associated with them (even accidentally) you'd better be prepared to put that right. In this case, if he doesn't, that's a bad move on his part and we have every right to comment as such if we want to.

I agree the experience issue isn't necessarily true. While ideally two-three companies shows you can work in different environments, your history demonstrates stability. You're showing your employer that you're loyal and that if they take you on/train you it won't be a waste of their time. 
Try looking in different places for smaller companies that may be getting less applications. There's also always the option of working for a temp agency. It'll get you some fast work and money when you first get to London, as well as demonstrating your versatility.

I would expect someone who stands up and is *so vocal* on these issues to take an active interest in their own lifestyle and making sure it reflects that. For instance if someone is speaking out against drug abuse, I would lose respect if they were found to be doing a few grammes of coke each weekend.

If he can find out his current landlord doesn't pay his taxes then don't give him any more money and move elsewhere - Brand has the luxury of being quite well off, he *can* do that and is lucky to be able to. 

In doing so he can actually win here. ""Look at me *moving house* because I stand for what I believe in and won't give this dodger my money any more"". But if he stays there - that's an admission that he'll stand for the problem but not do anything about it if push comes to shove.

Never disputed that.

&gt; Being shouted down in public places is part of public discourse and always has been but there is nothing anyone can legally do to actually stop you from speaking and in private spaces you have a right to control that. Talking of which it's wrong to conflate the idea of free speech with the idea of a right to the opportunity to use other people platforms to speak. 

I guarantee you any shouting match in a public place would attract the interest of the police and warnings about ""disturbing the peace"" in a matter of minutes.

But as to your second point, this very matter has been debated in relation to the Right to Be Forgotten and the elimination of search results. There is very little difference between denying someone a platform and silencing them, in practice, which is the point I was speaking to when I referenced the letter and the spirit of the law.

&gt; Freedom of speech is the right to speak not the right to be heard and it has never had anything to do with equal or honestly even fair representation in a debate. It's first and foremost intended to be protection from your government and is not intended to shield you from the reaction or speech of your peers. In fact many of the restrictions on our speech is to do with an attempt to strike a balance between freedom of speech and protecting people from the speech of others. 

Freedom of speech is not the right to be heard, but it does imply the right to hear what others have to say. By marginalising unpopular views you limit what others can read and hear, which is hardly democratic, liberal or intellectual.

London and the surrounding areas, including the South East, are crazy. The pieces there are mainly caused by foreign investment and overpopulation.

From reading lots of comments on guardian articles and forums etc, the general consensus is that prices are beginning to fall in most London boroughs and we may see at least a slowdown in prices rises in the next year or two. People will argue with that but I'm sure I read that the official government report on house prices shows a year on year fall in most boroughs.

The interest rate rise next year, which is almost certain to happen, will probably limit rises too as lending becomes more expensive and existing homeowners have to spend more on their mortgage.

My opinion, if you're looking to stay in the house you will be buying for a long time then go for it. Even if your house price was to fall by 20% the day after you buy it, if you stay there for 10 years then inflation should at least help you make up a considerable amount of that back. If you're buying for the short term, it may make sense to see what happens next year regarding interest rates, the budget and the election as that will dictate a lot with regards to the housing market.

I should probably add that this reply is pointed towards your location too. I have recently bought in the North of England because the price rises haven't been as steep here and prices are much lower which would offset any dramatic fall.

You should also hold off on buying until you have a good combined income. It's a general rule of thumb that your mortgage and associated costs such as insurance etc, should not take up more than approximately 30% of your income. On £28,000 and £0, your household income would be £1,750 per month.

&gt;and lots of time article headlines are insanely boring/dry/uninformative so require some modification for clarity/attention etc

There are plenty of places on reddit where you can link clickbaity sensationalized headlines, a subreddit dedicated to politics shouldn't be one of them.

A good example is your very title, where you specifically mention a 'weapons cache' when the article says

&gt;""cache of weapons including an imitation firearm, an air pistol, axes and knives""

Not really much of an weapons cache is it? There's not one single functioning firearm mentioned. The author of the article obviously agreed and thus didn't see the need to mention it in the title.

You also mention plans of mass murder, yet nowhere in the article do they mention these plans of mass murder. In fact they say:

&gt;The CPS said it had decided not to prosecute McGee as a terrorist because “it was never McGee’s intention to use the device for any terrorist or violent purpose, and that he had no firm intention to activate the device. That’s why he was prosecuted under the Explosive Substance Act.”

And

&gt; Worth noting, the argument here isn't that Adebolajo is so damned lovely that we should be nice to him. It's that human rights protections forbid the implementation of a whole-life sentence. 

&gt; Why? 

&gt; The Court in Strasbourg [ruled](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-122664#{""itemid"":[""001-122664""]}) that a prison sentence without the prospect of release is a disproportionate and inhuman sentence. 

&gt; Our ""life sentences"" are currently split into two parts: a tariff (which must be served in full) and then an indeterminate period of additional detention during which we assess whether the prisoner is safe to be released. If they are never deemed safe to be released, then they die in prison. The European Court of Human Rights finds these sentences compatible with the Convention. However, a determination that someone will never be released, regardless of their behaviour in prison, rehabilitation, development etc. is disproportionate. In essence: we already have a procedure to keep people in prison for life and the only people that whole-life tariffs affect are those who *are* safe to be released but never can be.

&gt; It's inhuman because people with long sentences, in practice, operate on the basis of hope: that hope that they may one day be released. The Court said that removing that hope is inhumane, especially because the longer someone is in prison the more valuable that hope becomes.

&gt; Or so says the Court.

&gt; The UK government argued that because the Home Secretary can offer compassionate leave, that they do have a chance of release. Our Court of Appeal [agreed,](http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/r-v-mcloughlin-and-r-v-newell.pdf) saying that the Court was wrong to say that there was no chance of release. There is [precedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Horncastle) for the European Court striking down a measure of English criminal law, the English courts pointing out that the Court was wrong and the Court correcting their decision. However, the Court made a [ruling](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26638002) a couple weeks ago which indicates that they do not think compassionate leave satisfies realistic hope of release. 

&gt; So, as it stands, Adebolajo's sentence is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence: appeal.

Look at those wingers we were up against - Routledge, Montero and Dyer off the bench. Who are we gonna serve up to balance that? I was crying out for a box to box midfielder last year and I still think Fer can provide that - what stands out for me from last night game are his positives - his header was saved, but at least he put it in, and then there was that beautiful sliding tackle that dispossessed his man, only for their leftback to foul him to the ground. He has a lot to offer the team, but I maintain that it's up the middle. And yet for whatever reason Harry is running him up the wing. Maybe he wanted to prioritise muscle to try and neutralise the threats down the sidelines? Or maybe he just doesn't trust the wingers that are available - Phillips, Hoilett, Traoré? Hangover from the Summer acquisitions that were tailored for the wingback formation? While I appreciate his versatility, Vargas should be up top. Barton and Henry aren't going to move the ball up the middle, and as much as Niko is a likeable player...I think he's a luxury player and defensively a liability/yellow card machine.

The overall inability to score is a wider issue though - we've still only got one man with more than a goal to his name. This perpetual inability to offer threats from elsewhere is poisonous. In games like last night, there's almost no point using Austin alone. A poacher needs opportunities and there was no-one there to provide them. You might as well start Zamora and have him hold the ball up for midfielders to run in and have a go, and bring Austin on late in the game.

Why should the scots give a fuck what happens in the rest of the UK? If I was a Scottish MP I'd have voted for that also - why? Because it keeps the educated Scots in Scottish universities and continues to widen the gap of ""togetherness"" in the UK which'll lead to independence. Afterall if you're a scot why go to the UK for education if you get it free in Scotland.

Essentially - the current and newest educated Scottish generation hasn't had the interaction with rest of the UK they did prior to free education in England

Germany introduces a paltry tuition fee and within a few years repeals it due to public pressure. The English young elect the Lib dems off the back off tution fees and he U turns once he's elected. This suggests to me that politics in England is inherently broken. So again I'd take an independent Scotland over the political bankruptcy of westminister any day of the week.

That simply isnt true. Massive amounts of effort were made to combat the IRA on Irish territory. This can be seen in how the anti-terror laws are more draconian in Ireland than in Britain. Principally the existance of the Special criminal court which allows non-jury trials and very long sentences for terrorist activities. It wasnt so long ago that Britain sought to bring in non jury trials but they were cancelled due to outrage and human rights concerns. They had at the time been an accepted tool of anti terrorism for Ireland for a long long time.

&gt;Furthermore, you seem to think that this is a case of ""the Irish Government"" versus ""the British Government"". Much as most 'British' people nominally supported the unionist cause most 'Irish' people nominally (or in many cases actively) supported the republican cause. 

Also incorrect. While sympathies may have leaned very much toward the civil rights movement in the early part of the troubles, sympathy for the tactics and aims of the IRA were very low during the troubles, this can be seen in the dismal performance of Sinn Fein during the troubles. Certainly some sympathy was there but most people were horrified at what the IRA were doing and the blame that ordinary Irish people received for it. We just wanted it to stop, thats why 96% of the electorate voted in favour of the good friday agreement.

A politician recanting on his leftist election promises is no proof that the electorate that voted for him isn't leftist. It just means they trusted the wrong person.

No you don't. You spit in a small tube.

&gt;It will, however, detect if you have a common variation that increases your risk of, for example, breast or colon cancer, since you inherited this risk, and that inherited DNA is in every cell of your body.

You must remember - and this is where the FDA stepped in in America - that these variations for the most part come from genome wide association studies (GWAS) and imply that within the populations studied certain SNPs may be associated with phenotypic traits to a level of accuracy for that population. It is then somewhat misleading to extrapolate this SNP associated trait out to the general population on a whole and give likelihoods for diseases as a % +/- of you risks to that association. 23andMe do link to primary research and to SNPedia and other variant database resources that will have further information on your specific SNPs but how many of the public will actually read those and assess critically them is another matter.

Moreover, these types of tests are quite error prone and there doesn't seem to be any indication that there are replicates created for each person, so I do worry on their accuracy but since they are not being used as a diagnostic this doesn't necessarily matter - although it could potentially worry some people.

You don't see, for example, all participants in the new 'Do they know it's christmas' being asked why they haven't given every last penny to charity? If not, arn't they a hypocrite?

The reason he's angry is he sees the reporter trying to take away from the main issue which is vastly more important that what house any one person lives in. It's like so what, does that reporter not believe the inequality should be addressed? If so, why is he attacking one of the few people who are vocal about that? Again, it doesn't matter if he's a hypocrite if his points are sound. But the mainstream media will play the distraction game again and again, backed up by conservatives and people who just find Brand annoying.

To say he throws a hissy fit when challenged is I think disingenuous. Think how many times he's been challenged on these issues, he's usually pretty eloquent.

Austerity, we're all in it together. OBR warns 60% of cuts still to come, but those that can afford to own property enjoy a £800m tax break.

Edit:  This was absolutely targeted at London house owners. Instead of paying 3% of the **total** purchase price as tax, you now pay nothing on the first 125K,  2% on the bit till 250K then 5% on the rest.  You'll save thousands on a house purchase.

So here's what now happens.  Affordable houses locked at 124K and 249K to avoid stamp duty jumps, can now rise in price as the tax jump is less horrific. 

So affordable houses in the north can now drift past the 124K barrier, and Londoners will save a fortune on moving homes for a few weeks, until the market adjusts to the new level of affordability.  You won't save 4 grand, the house price will rise because the seller knows you are no longer having to pay 3% of the total price, just 5% on the bit above 250K...

If he had gone into this debate fully prepared to face the music and say 'yes, I am extremely fortunate to be able to afford expensive property, my issue stands with the mass purchase of prime real estate by foreign investors.  This should be limited by the government, ultimately forcing up the prices that I and other equally blessed people have to pay for our top-end apartments, but taking the burden of market-pressure off of those least able to contend with it.'  Then there's very little the Sun or any Channel 4 reporter can do to undermine his personal position and it instead forces a debate around the issue itself, and not about him, which seems to be detracting from those on the estate itself.

As we were waiting to check in, a young dude with a guitar case (he was on foot) was asking people if he could travel with them, until he was sent away by one of the P&amp;O staff. When he walked past us, we offered to take him, so he got in our car. We were then told by the staff member we couldn't check in because of him, which was ridiculous, because P&amp;O doesn't get a say in who we traveled with. So we avoided P&amp;O for years and sailed with SeaFrance instead. They were usually cheaper than P&amp;O and they had a pretty nice restaurant, too!

When SeaFrance went bust, we switched to whichever was cheapest and wasn't P&amp;O (we're good at holding grudges). MyFerryLink was great at first, and then it became obvious they wanted to concentrate on professional drivers, as there was barely any room to sit for regular passengers and the seats there were, were often filthy. We also noticed that safety notices and signs pointing to muster stations had been painted over and removed. It all looked really shabby, tbh.

DFDS is better in that respect (in our experience, anyway) and we used to get priority boarding with access to the first class lounge, which was nice and quiet. My elderly parents still do this on their trips via Dunkirk. The reason we eventually went back to P&amp;O, was that DFDS has less ferries per day on the Dover-Calais route.

I find him... *too* energetic. *Too* whacky and attention grabbing. I find his approach to be repulsive, even if the message is one that he does believe in. 

I find that the way he speaks to people... he enjoys the sound of his own voice too much. He could be more effective if he saved that for self promotion and actually slowed himself down a little. 

Pretty much any and every interview I've seen, it seems to be a case of 'cram as many sentences and verbal 'colour' in to a statement as possible' and it detracts from the core message. 

I've a friend on Facebook who does this. Rather than right 'I saw a band yesterday, they were great, I had a chat with them.' he'll say 'Had the privilege of passing my evening in the company of the finest accompaniment of musical talent it's been my humble pleasure to share discourse with this frigid winter' (etc.). 

The overall message is the same, but it's almost like he's showing off with his choice of language. It's very wearing to listen to. 

That and the way it ties in which is self promotion is what turns me off him. I'm just not his target audience. Ironically I support some of his ideals. 

I did a quick search and would like to share this link and highlight something that summarises something I'm trying to say here: 

http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/russell-brand-good-pundit-bad-thinker/281063/

&gt; Brand has become a goofy warrior, trying to balance seriousness with comedy. This is difficult not just for the performer, but for the audience as well. In 2011, when Stephen Colbert stepped out of character while testifying to Congress and read from the Book of Matthew in defense of treating undocumented immigrants compassionately, it was both gratifying (he actually does have sensible opinions) and confusing (with that much influence and those convictions, why isn’t he serious more often?).

&gt; Brand, though, has clearly decided to wield his influence. In the Morning Joe interview, he asked his hosts to look beyond the superficial, past his appearance—long curly hair, a dark beard, and generous chest hair to match behind an open button-down shirt. He asked, basically, to be taken seriously by his hosts. All of that served to give him more credibility with a younger, alternative audience, one willing to listen to his blithe calls for revolution, despite the fact that he clearly hasn’t thought much about actual revolution. Actual revolution, after all, is stylish.",0,1417614282,null,0,false,0,cmjvhsd,t3_2o54wx,t1_cmjvhsd,t1_cmjv74c,null,1425704176,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I said it was growing at  less than 1% a quarter sunshine. And I was correct.

&gt; He's just raised taxes massively on buying a house. It'll kill house prices and it'll kill house prices the most in London.

He just lowered taxes for ""98%"" of home owners. His exact words, he also very clearly stated ""London house buyers will pay substantially less"" stamp duty.  

It's a tax break that will cost ""800 million"". 

The only people worse off are mansion owners. Everyone else pays less because it now works like income tax, you only pay tax on the bit within that band.

What this means in the north, is houses that were kept artificially low at say 124K can now start to creep up, because stamp duty isn't such a big jump anymore.

You clearly didn't watch the speech live, and you're clearly more interested in attacking posters than thinking through the consequences of his announcements.  Consider yourself ignored from now on.

The nice thing is that in the market for insurance, information = profit, so there's a natural mechanism for this data to get better *without* the government touching it.

In short, the market has already done most of the work, because there's value in having this information available. The idea of an army of clipboarded government assessors spitballing a value for land is a nonstarter - it will likely be based on simple statistical analysis of a range of market valuations.

And it's likely that if the government because a mass-consumer of this information for valuation purposes, that a) the information will get more accurate and b) the information will be cheaper to get over time.

Exactly.  I'm 37 years old and cannot recall the last time protesting on the streets changed Government policy.  Every change of heart in Parliament has usually come about because of;

- opposition from MPs and/or the House of Lords

A good place to start is reading publication 519 US Tax Guide for Aliens as this is all rather complicated especially for your first year as a resident alien.

You say you are moving in March, in your first year you would be required to file to the IRS a Dual Status return - which is essentially 2 returns

The first of these covers your earning in the current tax year prior to moving to the US - i.e. Jan - March
The second is for your earnings whilst in the US.

As other have stated the US tax return requires reporting of worldwide income.

Although you will have federal and state income tax deducted from your salary you will be required to file both federal and state returns for the year. If you are renting your house out in the UK you will also have to file self assessment to HMRC.

You will have a UK personal allowance for your UK return.

BUT your UK rental income forms part of your worldwide income for the purposes of the US tax return - so even if the rental income is within your UK personal allowance you will still be paying tax on it in US - however if over the threshold of personal allowance and you are paying UK income tax on the income you would be able to deduct the tax paid from the US tax amount due.

I would recommend persuading to get your employer to pay for a professional who is fully conversant with Dual Status Returns to provide you with assistance - do not spend anything on any software that our US friends seemed obsessed with to help complete the forms as they do not work for Dual Status Returns (as I found to my cost). 

If your employer does not want to pay for this and you are feeling brave sit down with a few large drinks read publication 519 - find the following forms on the IRS web site:

1040SE
1040NR
f8938

read their instructions, remember to complete FBAR, realise the US banking system is archaic, have another drink,remember you don't have to file until April 15th - worry about it again next April

You do not mention your circumstances relating to dependents but I believe if filing a dual status return you are not entitled to the full amount of exemption (equivalent of personal allowances) - I ended up paying a huge amount more tax in year 1 than had been deducted at source, or than i had expected. 

I did not employ anyone to assist as I thought it couldn't be that hard but knowing what I know now if I were in the same boat I would employ who had experience of this to do it for me - purely to help navigate exactly what forms are required and to maximise any potential deductions/exemptions - I understand it is far simpler after year 1 - but I left the US midway through the next year.

I'm quite happy to see regulation against these kind of tactics.  Now read the tactics used with gambling (I assume you read that post mentioned in OP?).  These are powerful, well funded people doing their best to get as much money out of clients as possible, much like the tobacco industry does.  Including lying to people and paying Doctors to recommend smoking.

&gt; I know the effects of addiction as most people do be it gambling, smoking, alcohol. 

I don't think you do.  Other than two anecdotal subjects with regards to smoking.

I think you're a young lad that's been raised well, but I also think you view the world around you expecting other people to have been raised just as well as yourself.

However, I feel that if we're being intellectually honest about this, almost everyone who looks into this in good faith will decide that not all the mechanisms are that poorly understood, and it's very likely we're in for a rough time. Anyone who decides it's definitely not true after all that is probably a bit suspect. 

To be honest, I'm shit scared about what's going to happen and the thought that all the progress we have made might be for nothing as nature's debt collectors come knocking keeps me up at night.

Needless to say however, the lectures covered a lot more than the bare-bones notes (I guess you could have filled in with background reading), and you wouldn't have got much further than 101 without coming to lectures. They didn't take attendance at labs, but since your problem sheets counted for credit, not doing labs was like not turning up to an exam.

There was quite an air of independence - it was a Russell Group research-oriented university. Get the grades, we're not going to nanny you. You only got called in if you were failing and they needed to work out whether to advise you to drop the course (and not waste your money on failing) or whether there was a welfare issue that was interfering with your studies or something they needed to be doing. Obviously if you had a long-term condition or had been knocked out for a couple of months by Glandular Fever or something then they would be sympathetic towards offering a leave of absence and basically giving you a year out - holding your place open to rejoin the course next year rather than dropping you from the course and making you reapply.

Some universities however are much more like school, take attendance, will boot you out if you consistently miss lectures, etc.

Of course, if there's no businesses that *want* to rent the desirable premises at the higher rate, the landlord can either be stuck paying a high tax bill every month with no revenue, drop their rent to minimize their losses, or maybe just sell the land on and let someone else make a profit off the desirable land.

The whole point of LVT is 'Use it or lose it'. Most houses aren't necessarily prime commercial real estate but can end up paying the equivalent of £18,000 per hectare per year in council tax, whereas large landowners with non-residential land in desirable areas (e.g. all those undeveloped greyfield sites :)) pay £0 per hectare.

The radical thing about LVT is it forces those people, regardless if they're using the land well or not, to pay the same rate per hectare. Shoebox houses on squeezed plots end up paying pittance and the landbanker with three large greyfield sites sitting idle year after year pays a fortune.

To be fair I too doubt Farage has spent too much time thinking about it beyond immediate economic consequences.  I think he's deferred much of that within the party.   I have no doubt however, regardless of whether people agree with his conclusions, that Roger Helmer UKIP's energy spokesman has spent a lot of time researching the data to the point of obsession.

There is a huge elephant in the room however, and whatever one's own point of view might be last month the US and Chinese reached an agreement on emissions which undermines all other European energy policy unless they account for it.

The US and China agreed on an emissions ceiling.  Good news, huh?  *About time*, one might think.  The problem is the emissions ceiling is set at 2030 levels, which means all their emissions are going to be going up, and their energy price is going to be increasingly more competitive compared to those committed to reductions by 2020 and going through to 2030.

There is no point cutting emissions from industry in Europe or the UK if that industry is going to be able to move where they're increasing emissions and where their own coal powerstations produce 3x more emissions than our own coal powerstations which we're closing.

The fate of the global environment takes on a different hue when the very restrictions you place on your own *local* emissions lead to an increase *global* emissions.

Central London mansions are a law unto themselves anyway, and none of us can afford them so let's just look at that 98% who are better off.

In the north there are apartments and housing that are priced at 124K to avoid stamp duty.  If these now rise to 126K, the tax bill will be £100 (1% of 126K-125K).   For 100 quid there's no incentive to keep the asking price below 125K.

So the buyer has ""saved"" £100 but has paid 2K more for the property...  

In this example, the current system keeps some properties affordable by locking them just below the threshold.  Same thing occurs at 249K for family homes.

In the south, where even starter apartments are at 250K, the new system saves you a few grand. Brilliant.   

But does that mean you save that money, or does that mean the seller will simply raise the asking price?

It's a seller's market, and if the seller knows you have another 4 grand in your pocket, what do you think is going to happen?  If the seller doesn't raise the asking price, then expect to be gazumped by someone who couldn't afford the property, but now can because they are now 4 grand better off as well...

In a market where the resource is in high demand and is finite, price will always eventually match affordability. 

If you're buying before the next election, I think this is a brilliant tax break. But I can't see the benefit lasting long.

The slab tax method was terrible, and this is a fairer tax, but I don't see it benefiting anyone other than property porfolio owners for long.",0,1417617778,null,0,false,0,cmjwtjj,t3_2o5ijv,t1_cmjwtjj,t3_2o5ijv,null,1425703556,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You may call this all undemocratic but democracy *is* decision by majority rule and at some point debates have to be settled and that inherently mean that one side is losing or have lost.

- Somebody who is unsure of their sexuality or whose sexuality is fluid

- A collection of people (eg a band or sports team) that feels unified by their variety of sexualities, or desire to be inclusive to all sexualities (a band that has a heterosexual drummer, gay bassist, bisexual singer and asexual guitar player may call themselves a 'queer' band, if they feel their sexualities are important).

Though really with current demand for tickets already at ridiculous levels at current prices, I don't buy how reducing ticket prices definitely makes it better for the fans. There's no guarantee that lowering prices further won't just make things easier for touts.

It's a fucking massive waiting list for season tickets at £900 or whatever they are right now, if they dropped it to £500 or something it'd be even worse. 

The only way to ensure decent atmospheres at Anfield is to ensure that your die-hard supporters can afford to go *and* that the majority of your tickets are going to those people, instead of just making it cheaper for tourists and touts to get them.

Longer term you're right in saying that the market will adjust itself around this and the result may be that the lower end rises in value and as such pushes all prices up.

However, the same principle could applied to the top end. Another poster said it means less stamp duty for all properties below £925k. So if you have a £950k house, then it may bring those house prices down to £925k, which could then lower the value of all properties below it.

Due to this I'd imagine prices won't sharply rise/fall as a direct result of this, but does mean that the whole cost of buying a house will be cheaper for most.

If you're certain that the pension system will change, account for it in your retirement planning. You don't have to go all or nothing with a pension. A good retirement plan would never consist of only a pension.

We already know *roughly* what is *probably* going to happen with the pension system in the coming decades (a rise from 55 to 57 in 2028 and then probably closer to 60 by the mid 2040s) which alone is enough information for you to account for it in your retirement plan, and you can always add extra wiggle room by *assuming* it'll be 60 when you come to retire. There is of course always going to be an element of risk that something far beyond what you ever planned could happen, but with *good* planning you greatly reduce that risk and plans can change later on and what's the worst case scenario? You have to work 2 extra years? That's not the end of the world for a worst case scenario.

Retirement planning is like everything else with personal finance: diversify. Your pension should not be your entire retirement plan, just one element. Want to retire at 55 but think the pension age may be 60 by the time you reach 55? Have the equivalent of 5 years of your pension outside of the pension system... your pension is probably going to need to last you 30 years, 5 years is a very small portion of that.

What it does show is that people are rapidly engaging with parties that would previously have been dismissed as a wasted vote... But, regardless of that engagement it's still 'a wasted vote.' Even the SNP won't be able to govern in coalition - they wouldn't out of principle with the Tories and labour wouldn't be prepared to pay the price they'd ask... Not to mention it would turn labours misfortunes in Scotland into a permanent rout. It would effectively mark the retreat of labour from Scotland and have a lasting impact on their ability to form a Westminster majority.

Even if the SNP return an unparalleled 70% of seats, they still won't have enough MPs to outvote the English or force either main party into coalition. What it could actually do is entrench the core English vote for the conservatives, giving Scots the one party they really don't want in power.

All this talk of vote Farage get Miliband, vote Miliband get Salmond, vote Cameron and get Miliband and vote Clegg get Rekt is nonsense in my opinion. Despite what people might be thinking the bottom line is the most likely party in power in 2015 is either the conservatives or labour. In my opinion the only coalition we might see would be Con-UKIP but UKIP are even less likely to win enough seats to effect a coalition than the SNP or LDs.

This question itself is difficult to answer. Consider the 2 alternatives :

1. House prices are rising. This looks bad as the longer you leave it the more you'll have to pay.
2. House prices are falling. This looks bad as you're buying something that's losing value over time.

I think the only correct approach is wait until you really want to buy and have the money available, and go for it. Your house shouldn't be primarily a financial investment - it's where you live. It's too difficult to try and second guess all the macro level stuff that's going on that will affect house prices in the next 1,2,5,10 years etc.

A 48 hour week is the *maximum* an employer can demand that you work for. Most people can work for more if overtime is offered. 

What you cannot opt out of are basic legal standards which are there to protect everyone who works in the field. For example, issues of health and safety, which is the issue that these banned acts are related to.

false,Brichals,null,null,"Well I think that the premise of CO2 causing raise of temperature is based on a huge oversight. 

The amount of gas that dissolves in water is inversely proportional to temperature. So as temperature rises, the CO2 in oceans goes from the dissolved state, where it's busily making crustaceans and chalk, and into the atmosphere as gas.

It's why lager is served cold, to keep the gas in.

Maybe the scientists account for this but in popular science you just see charts of temperature rising followed by an accompanying rise in gaseous CO2. If you look at records over millions of years this trend is always correlated. It's 6th form physical chemistry really.

This is why I'm skeptical, but I've not looked into it really beyond what is presented to us in the popular media.

EDIT: To downvoters, try to see my point.

[Bear in mind this principle of CO2 solubility being higher in colder water.](http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/solutions/faq/temperature-gas-solubility.shtml)

[Then look at this typical climate change popular science output, sorry it's a shitty link but I think it's representative.](http://www.daviesand.com/Choices/Precautionary_Planning/New_Data/)

It is absolutely clear that CO2 rise follows temperature rise in that figure, which the article says is not. This article is absolutely jumbled and confused, as I suspect the science behind it also is. The Lechatelier principle is not mentioned at all, but it's the most obvious first mechanism to account for being a universal property of gases in liquids at temperature variations. 

Academics aren't necessarily smart people and they have a busy job. They apply for grants on an agenda and supply results on an agenda under a lot of pressure. It's just how it is.

EDIT2: If you look at that Ice Core sample over the last 4 ice ages you can see there is absolutely no abnormal behaviour going on. The Blue line gets more blurry as it gets more to our date.

false,jubbleu,null,null,"I do think a lot of it has to do with the way he presents himself - he really has built his persona around how intelligent he is (or thinks he is).  To put it nicely, he really does try to use the full extent of his vocabulary to strongly present his opinions (the niche of both the comedian and the politician I guess).  I always quite enjoyed it, when he stuck to comedy - I thought he was quite entertaining.  But now he's ventured into realms where he seems a bit misguided and, at times, ignorant (maybe this impression is just an inevitable consequence of me often having a conflicting ideology) - in combination with the 'intelligent persona' I feel he comes across as 'saying big words for the sake of it', which is quite grinding.  The best example of it has to be the 'Parklife' cover - that song is LITERALLY based around saying lots of big words quickly in a relatively unintelligible way.  (And a full disclaimer, I'm a History graduate, now a Law student, procrastinating from writing an essay on EU law, I can't help but feel pretty self-conscious about 'using big words for the sake of it', and I apologise for any hypocrisy on the 'self-righteous pillock' front.)

I almost feel he is putting himself forward like that, inadvertently or otherwise, by marching into the political landscape and all but declaring himself a rallying symbol (and proposing to stand for public office).  When you publish a book called 'Revolution' and clearly market it to the politically disillusioned you're either crusading for their benefit or your own.  If it's the latter, it's just pretty deplorable, and if it's the former I just can't help but feel there's better ways to do it. (Another disclaimer if it turns out he's donating all the profits of the book to charity or some such...)  It is somewhat admirable to encourage people to believe they're not powerless in the world of politics, and I'm all for combating political apathy, but encouraging young people not to vote isn't going to help that cause.  I understand people are upset that they don't feel like their politician's priority, but the government aren't going out of their way to try and piss off voters, they need them to vote them in!  I'm sure if they could click their fingers and have complete political stability, 100% unemployment and full contentment, any politician would do it because at the very least it would make their life easier.  What we need isn't more people standing around shouting 'down with this sort of thing' - we've had general vocal discontent for thousands of years - but someone who, if they're going to wallow into the political debate, should at least get their ideas straight about what they want changed and at least some kind of vague idea about how to do it.  No one's suggesting he needs ironed out pedantics, he's not a full-stocked government department, but I can't help but feel that pretty directionless expressions of dissatisfaction are at best ineffective, or at worst, detract from the real issue (as has happened here.)

I think the website is somewhere around http://www.dota2.com/leagues/signup/ - going there when you have admin access to a ticket might give you access, not sure. I haven't been an admin since they brought that function in.

 [**Fencing response**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing%20response): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __fencing response__ is a peculiar position of the arms following a [concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion). Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem), the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football), [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey), [rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football) and [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts). It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries. 

&gt;====

That over 1 in 50 Scots are now members of the SNP is pretty extraordinary (that's 2.2% of the electorate; Conservative members make up 0.3% of the UK electorate), as is the fact that they joined in those few weeks specifically due to the referendum result.

insurance on your own property is optional, and statistically it makes no financial sense to insure if you have plenty of money, over 10000 years you would end up paying more in insurance than the payouts would be for the number of disasters that strike, otherwise insurers would make no money. 

Buildings insurance is based on a rebuild cost if disaster strikes, again value is not important.

There is no reason to get insurance on a small or medium plot of land, very little that can go wrong there besides the legally required insurance which is in case of compo claims and is not related to value.

In terms of a lender they wouldn't insure, again over 10000 mortgages it makes no financial sense to insure a debt, the debt is secured against the land itself but they will go from the purchase price which is flawed because it's only based on the price at the time.

I suppose the ""Doctor is an alien"" explanation works as well as any, but in that case, he doesn't have the right to judge us either, and he does - all the time.  I still remember how angry he got when Harriet Jones ordered the destruction of that alien ship, and essentially got her kicked out of office as a result.

The only reason I'm not even more mad is because it was the British PM.  If he had done the same thing to an American president, I'm not sure that I could have forgiven him.  ;-) 

The thing is, I don't know that I disagree with what Jones did.  For all she knew, those aliens could have come back to destroy us.  All she had was the Doctor's word that they were leaving.

How did you take that from what I said? Police officers, soldiers and stuntmen are so vastly different careers from porn actors that I really don't think you can make much of a comparison.

Regardless, in all of those professions, there is a massive emphasis on risk reduction and harm reduction. All of them are at risk of harm, but the soldier and the police officer gets body armour, and they all get a huge network of medical and training support. 

Is that really comparable to a porn star getting slapped around the face in a film? I don't think so. There is no attempt to keep them from harm. Harm is the intended consequence in their case. That is what these new rules are protecting them from.  

&gt;Gimme numbers. 

I don't believe any such primary psychological research exists, so all we have to go on are the words of women who have left the industry. Feel free to show me any research you have that says the opposite if you have it, but everything I have seen shows that most women regret their time in the industry. And like I said, what makes their career needs different from anyone else's? If you would not be satisfied with the work they are doing, why would they be? 

&gt;You're taking an entire profession and homogenising it

Not really, I'm sure the producers and camera operators, editors ect... are fine with their jobs. Its the actors who on the whole would rather not be there.

&gt; 

Most UKIP voters I have met think they are a two issue party. Most UKIP voters (and I have met many) don't know any of their policies other than leave the EU and cut immigration, and even on the immigration issue some are wrong when they say UKIP intends to kick out some EU migrants once the UK leaves. One UKIP voter flat out told me that ""UKIP doesn't have any other policies"". I think you are mixing UKIP voters with UKIP supporters. UKIP supporters tend to read the manifesto. UKIP voters don't, [as shown by this little recent event.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-mp-mark-reckless-left-feeling-sore-after-nigel-farage-changed-immigration-policy-9877429.html) Mark Reckless, and indeed many UKIP voters wrongly believe(d) that UKIP will reduce the number of immigrants living in the UK, they won't. They'll just reduce the numbers coming in.

Most non SNP people can at least name other policies that the SNP have, hence why they have the majority in Holyrood. One issue parties don't get majorities like that, one issue parties are parties you vote for in the list seats. They know the SNP supports moving trident out of Scotland (because having nuclear weapons within blast radius of our largest city is unfavourable to say the least), re industrialising Scotland, the promotion of renewable energy (after all we're blasted every which way by wind and we're wetter than a female paedophile in a preschool) and if not independence, more autonomy for Scotland. Hell, I voted yes but if we have to stay within the UK I don't see any reason why we can't have the powers the Isle of Man has. 

Although the SNP does want independence, outside that they want autonomy for Scotland in most, if not all matters, and they are the only party that seems to support this who aren't softies or nutters. And the fact is although 55% of Scottish voters voted no, the majority do want more powers, and the SNP seem to be the best route for that as we feel the Westminster parties won't deliver, the Greens, bless their hearts, can't deliver and the SSP are fucking batshit. In general the SNP are well liked, even if some of those don't want independence, people tend to feel like they've done a decent job in Holyrood.

Its for society to decide what is acceptable. All workers should expect the same standard of working conditions, no matter what industry they work in. A porn actor gets up in the morning to go to work the same way everyone else does, they deserve the same level of protection.

Why should any worker expect to get slapped in the face, or spat on, or pissed on when they get to work. Or not be able to progress in their industry if they refuse? 

You would not accept those working conditions for yourself, so why should they be forced on anyone else? 

&gt;You're also assuming it's the boss doing the pissing. My understanding is that both parties are performers, and that it's the female performer who has power of veto.

The idea is that, at least in theory, the prisoner could rehabilitate himself to a point where the state feels he is safe to be released, and that if we say rehabilitation is an aspect of our criminal justice system then the state must contemplate that possibility. Compassionate release has nothing to do with anything the prisoner has done, but is instead based on whether or not he's about to die of cancer, or some such. I'm not sure prisoners' hope of release could genuinely be thought to include the hope that they can spend a couple weeks incapacitated in a bed before dying.

That try's to illustrate where the leak is. Basically it's the best possible outcome as the pressure increase is contained by steel casing and is not exposed to any of the formation. 

What they are saying in the second part is that they have cemented off the perforations as part of the well suspension/abandonment.  The perforations are holes created through the casing and cement so that Frac fluid can be pumped into the reservoir and then reservoir oil/gas and Frac fluid be produced back.  It sounds like this cement job is average and that when they pressure up (14.5ppg) there is a pressure lost to the reservoir.  Which means they can't test the well bore integrity below this point.  To do that they are going to try and bypass these perforations and land probably with cool tubing a packer which will then seal off the perforations from any pressure testing. 

They can now pressure test the lower completion and see the well bore integrity.

Except there is no need for ordinary citizens to discuss the events of the day in parliament using proper parliamentary procedure. The events retain their meaning. Using non-scientific terms in a scientific context strip the issues under discussion of their real and precise meaning. 

PMQs is a debate in any meaningful sense of the word. When you stop someone from calling it that in an ordinary context you're not fighting for truth and justice, you're being a massively pedantic bell end that is stripping the debate you are attempting (badly) to engage with of its meaning.

Why should they provide footpaths, access, pollinator strips, bird mating areas, improving soil structure, growing hedges for no money?  if we went to a system of farming purely for commercial interest (ie: funded by selling goods) farmers would rip out more hedgerows and farm the land to the bone.

Just because the policy won't solves all of the decade old issues within the UK housing market, doesn't mean it won't help people.

&gt; What will these people that can't afford to save something as low as £5000 do when interest rates go up?
Again, if £5000 is the difference between you buying a house or not at around £250,000, I suggest you step back and do some basic fucking maths. YOU CAN NOT AFFORD IT.

Because young people may have a decent income, but little wealth. Where prices are high and they need to accumulate wealth before buying, reducing the up front cost will help them. Furthermore, if the alternative is renting a house, this is often be more expensive than a mortgage, so it is a sensible decision to buy even if rates go up because the worst that can happen is that they end up paying about the same that they were before.

Weren't these machines totally prohibited before Blair? If so, this is still a generous concession to the gambling chains.

Bookies love FOBTs because they're so impulsive. If you want to spunk £200 or £2000, you can still do that by placing a bet on the horses. That gives punters a proper amount of time to reflect on their gambling, and obviously it's less profitable.

false,hotcod,null,null,"Semantically speaking you are right that this can be called censorship, in fact my original post was predicated purely on the idea that censorship has become a loaded term in that it's now more closely associated with government censorship. The difference for me is that while an idea can be pushed to the fringe of the public debate it can't be removed totally from it and that is key because all ideas start out on the fringe and if the arguments are compelling they won't stay there for long. This happens all the time

&gt;But outside of the objective realm there have been lots of attempts by political groups to silence opinions or media they dislike through other means.

This isn't a new thing, I was bemoaning the new terrorism laws as an example of the new McCarthyism here the other day. What's changing however is that we are become more aware of it because the power of people to control the flow of information has been crumbling and people are becoming more critical and wise to it.  

&gt;I do have a problem with students who will not even let people they disagree with have a platform at university debates, which are supposed to be venues where offensive ideas can be aired. That is an ugly fashion in public life at the moment that should be opposed, and will undoubtedly spread as the next generation of graduates move into positions of influence in the media and elsewhere.

Having your ideas challenged is often the best way to come to understand them, I try and do it all the time and it has often lead to me changing my mind but in the end there are some ideas that have solidified for me and it would take something monumental for them to be change. For example I don't have debate a racist in my space at this point because experience has taught me it'll be the same old bullshit and all I'd be doing is giving them a soap box to spout that from.

A LVT would incentivise productive uses of land, so yes, moving away form 'unkepmtpt nature'. But most of that unkempt nature actually isn't all that unkempt, it is deliberately kept barren to allow for hunting etc, which isn't really 'wild'.

Having corrected the equations, I'm actually surprised to find that the net effect is a smallish decrease at the low-end and a substantial *increase* at the top end. 

It's not all that much of a difference on low-valued properties - consistently either neutral or a cut, but mostly just smooths out the curve to avoid the sudden sting each time you go over a threshold. But on very high value properties (anything over about £1.1M) it results in a lot more tax paid. 

Even the *giant* jump as you go over the threshold at $2M (and suddenly get charged at 7% instead of 5% on the entirety of the value) doesn't go higher than the new version.

So it does make things a little cheaper for the land-grabbing elderly... but equally makes it cheaper for the young first-time buyer so long as they can manage to buy a place at all.

This happens all the time

I find this view disputable. I don't think ideas' popularity is just predicated on merit.

&gt; This isn't a new thing, I was bemoaning the new terrorism laws as an example of the new McCarthyism here the other day. What's changing however is that we are become more aware of it because the power of people to control the flow of information has been crumbling and people are becoming more critical and wise to it. 

I don't think it's a new thing, but I think the reason for it has changed. It used to be the conservatives who would attack controversial media, but increasingly it seems that progressives are becoming censorious, and many conservatives have not improved (see the latest porn ban). The left's commitment to upholding freedom of speech is being hugely damaged by this, in my view.

&gt; Having your ideas challenged is often the best way to come to understand them, I try and do it all the time and it has often lead to me changing my mind but in the end there are some ideas that have solidified for me and it would take something monumental for them to be change. For example I don't have debate a racist in my space at this point because experience has taught me it'll be the same old bullshit and all I'd be doing is giving them a soap box to spout that from.

However, either (a) you applied for the planning permission -- why?  (b) you bought the land with the planning permission, in which case you were willing to pay top-dollar for that oak tree (remember that 80% of the cost of a property is the cost of the land-with-planning, so you will have paid _a lot_ for that land).  If you value the oak tree as much as the McDonalds, who is anyone to tell you you must build a McDonalds on it when you don't want to?  You knew what you were getting into when you bought it though.

One particular advantage of LVT in fact is that it necessarily informs land price.  You buy it knowing what LVT is due, and that affects what you are willing to pay.  Hence LVT supplies the (desparately needed in the UK) downward pressure on property prices.

Exactly the same thing goes on already with stamp duty.  Stamp duty is paid by the seller not the buyer (perhaps not what you'd expect) -- since the buyer doesn't magically get more money simply because stamp duty is due, so it reduces the amount they are willing to pay by exactly the stamp duty.

People are trying to encourage the use of cis-gender as a thing to make being trans-gender as normal as being cis-gender. As it stands at the moment, in the current popular language, being trans-gender is automatically othering, if you see what I mean? It automatically makes the norm being cis, which it probably shouldn't be in an equal society. No one is forcing you to use it, but knowing what it means is a big step in making language more equal.

Queer as a word has been around for a very very very long time as an umbrella term for people who essentially, aren't straight cis people. So it includes everyone who is a minority orientation or gender identity. It was used as a slur in the past and has been reclaimed in a sense, although a lot of people just never stopped using it.

&gt; PMQs is a debate in any meaningful sense of the word. When you stop someone from calling it that in an ordinary context you're not fighting for truth and justice, you're being a massively pedantic bell end that is stripping the debate you are attempting (badly) to engage with of its meaning.

* ad hominem
* tu quoque
* personal incredulity
* no true scotsman

false,strolls,null,null,"The UK Independence party employs six people to protect Nigel Farage in spite of a funding crunch that has led donors to warn that it needs to raise millions of pounds before the election.

Party officials have told the Financial Times that the six work in rotation to protect the Ukip leader and one of them is also his driver. The Times reported on Wednesday that Mr Farage receives a £60,000 annual “mileage expense allowance” to cover the chauffeur and motoring costs, a figure Ukip would not confirm or deny.

Ukip aides say Mr Farage has employed the security detail, paid through party funds, since he was surrounded by protesters during a visit to Scotland last May.

One ally said: “Ever since he was threatened in Scotland he has had to have security. He hates it, but that’s just the way politics is now. We do lots of public events without a pre-vetted audience, and unfortunately we need security to be able to do that.”

The ally added: “This is not European Union money, this comes from the party’s private funds.”

Stuart Wheeler, the Conservative donor who defected to Ukip in 2011, said last month the party was in desperate need of more funds and was aiming to raise £6m-£7m before the election. The party’s accounts show it had £600,000 in the bank at the start of the year.

Figures released by the Electoral Commission show the party received less than £100,000 in the third quarter of this year in spite of the high-profile support of both Mr Wheeler and Arron Banks, who defected from the Tories this year.

Mr Banks promised in October that he would give the party £1m, and Ukip expects the money to start filtering through during the coming months.

Paul Sykes, who defected from the Tories in 1991, has proved Ukip’s most generous supporter this year, giving £1.3m of the £2.3m in total donations the party has reported. He spent that money on a poster campaign ahead of the European elections, in which Ukip was successful.

Mr Sykes supports a push to challenge Labour in its northern heartlands but senior Ukip members warn that a campaign away from the party’s southeast strongholds will be expensive.

The Liberal Democrat party, which polls show is attracting half as much public support as Ukip, spent almost £5m during the 2010 election campaign.

Ukip has in recent weeks won by-elections in Clacton and Rochester, where the sitting Tory MPs defected.

After Rochester, Mr Farage said he would target dozens of seats next year, although the party is yet to taste victory in the North. The closest it came was in Heywood and Middleton, where the Ukip candidate came within 617 votes of taking the seat from Labour.

Mr Sykes has said he does not expect to make further donations before the election, and has pushed local constituency groups to make the party less reliant on big donors.

The most recent donation figures show that among the party’s most high-profile donors, Andrew Reid, the treasurer, gave £6,498, and Robin Birley, a long-term supporter, £5,000.

- You can't have full bondage and a gag unless it's made clear in the scene that there is a safety signal that can be clearly seen.

- You can choke a girl with your dick as long as you don't tell her to choke on your dick. 

Choking on a dick is fine but don't you dare talk dirty.


- Face sitting is fine as long as the air ways are visibly clear.

So don't actually sit on a face, just squat near one


- Fisting isn't allowed but all ten digits in is fine as long as it's not past the last knuckle

By that point there's not much of a difference.


All of these and pretty much everything else on the list appears to be to prevent injury to people trying it at home, the choking on the dick one is strange though, you can do it as long as you don't draw attention to the fact it's choking.

The problem the club faces on this front is two-fold: 

1. Because of the massive financial problems we faced before and after going into administration, the stadium doesn't actually belong to the club. Dens Park belongs to a local businessman by the name of John Bennett. Under the terms by which he leased it back to us, any renovations that are made to the stadium would have to be paid for by the club. Unfortunately this would then increase the cost to buy it back from him, which the new owners have assured fans is in their 5 year plan.

2. On top of that there are a section of supporters who adamantly oppose any modernisation, claiming that it would destroy the character of the stadium turning it into one of the pre-packaged nondescript stadiums that exist all over Scotland.

Also, there are seats, they just don't have any backs on them. Why this is, I have no idea but I personally find it comfier than having to sit against the hard plastic back that's used in the other stands.

If we sacrifice points to United in order to get into the knockout stages this season, we're just making it substantially more likely that we will not be in the Champion's League next season.  This needs to be done in steps, we absolutely do not have the right players to go deep in the UCL AND maintain the top 4 spot in the league right now.  As it is, the main goal should be to be in the Champion's League next season.  Once we're able to establish outselves as a top 4 side once again, we start moving to go deeper in the CL.  Getting into, and staying in the Champion's League is absolutely vital to the health and success of the club.  If we have to sacrifice the knockout stage this season in order to be in the group stage again next season then that's exactly what we need to do.

Obviously it would be real fucking nice to have our cake and eat it too, but we don't have the players, or ability to attract the right players, for that just yet.  2-3 seasons in the Champion's League each time should see our reputation raised enough to not miss out on players like Sanchez anymore, then we go forward another step.  As Rodgers said, we arrived in the top 4 a season ahead of schedule, and because of that we need to be doing everything possible to keep hold of that CL spot.  The Premier League is absolutely the most important competition we are in this season, bar none.

EDIT: I actually think we're capable of winning both games regardless, however if I have to pick one to make sure we win it'll be the league game.  If there's a managerial decision to be made about which personnel to use to make sure the team is fresh for one game or the other, I'd pick the league game to bring the best team to.

Here are several potential feedback loops:

- Warming causes polar ice to melt. Dark seawater and rock absorbs more heat from the sun than ice, and hence further warming occurs.

- Warming causes trapped methane deposits to be released from permafrost and from the sea floor. Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and hence it requires relatively small amounts to cause further climate change

- Warming may cause less rainfall in the amazon. This could in turn make the area drier, encouraging wildfires and eventually changing the local climate from rainforest to savanna. This will decrease the amount of CO2 absorbed by Amazonian plants, meaning atmospheric CO2 will be higher.

The problem is that she doesn't really know what she's talking about with regards to technology, and her blanket solution for dealing with the very real issues such as the exploitation of women and the exposure of children to adult materials is to take swooping, simplistic actions which ultimately end up being badly-written and hugely draconian- [blocking and ban things](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/29/claire-perry-overblocking-banning) in an alarmingly basic way.

What happens with new research that is peer reviewed and published is that the team will collaborate with a science communication team to produce a press release which in turn will be released by the university or institution. The press release is essentially a concise summation of their findings and caveats, an expanded abstract. Press agencies like Reuters/associated press will pick it up and outlets like the BBC will create a story, often contacting the research team and other relevant academics in the field for discussion. 

The public should feel perfectly comfortable in trusting the BBC, they are a thorough and prestigious organisation. I disagree with you primarily because, even though the sentiment is generally good, for a lot of the public reading primary esoteric subject material is not a brilliant idea. Besides the actual concepts in papers, the wider implications can't be appreciated fully and may be missed completely. That's what the purpose of science communication and press releases are for.

A big gripe of mine that you see on reddit a lot is that in scientific papers we spend a considerable portion discussing why we could be wrong, what was wrong with the investigation process, how we should have carried it out with the right resources, how the system may not be relevant in real life etc... This is the basis of scientific discourse, every implication explored. But what repeatedly and constantly happens is that people, through maliciousness or ignorance, conflate the discussion and pick and choose to create false proof that something can't be true or correct. 

I'm a microbiologist with an A a level in physics, but I wouldn't expect to (and know) that I can't fully understand, appreciate or successfully discuss a subject in physics after reading a primary research paper - because I barely even know the basics. Physics being the subject it is I imagine most undergrads would have a lot of trouble reading new papers, I know from experience that molecular bio papers often took a while for me to get my head around.

When we read papers we spend a lot of time going over it, fact checking and reading relevant references and reviews. Even then we don't see wider implications often until discussing it with other scientists. I think this goes over a lot of the public's head when they think about being able to access a research paper and it's a bit annoying that it's made light of. 

For that reason I leave subject not in my field, particularly sciences to the science communicators and news agencies/corps.

Climate change science is 30 years old and is 'proved' with models predicting the future based on current trends, something very unpredictable.

The bottom line is, it doesn't matter whether UKIP have 1,000,000 members and the conservatives have 10,000... the latter are still going to win vastly more seats. Party membership is a good measure of engagement with the party among political activists - it doesn't necessarily reflect what everyday people are going to put on their ballot paper next year. It might even have a detrimental effect - for example if you look at the ""*type*"" of activist backing UKIP that in itself can be quite off-putting to middle ground voters. To a certain extent the same can be said for both the SNP and greens. The LDs have long had a toxic image for their activists as naive sandle wearing do-gooders, which doesn't necessarily help them come election time.

This situation, where the moral brigade are banning porn genres has three causes. Firstly, it's becoming completely routine in British policing to search PCs, smartphones and online accounts and use the content to publicly prosecute. Second, we have a ""daily mail"" media culture that panders to hypochondriacs. The day that the DM gets to find out about a suspected murderer's sexual preferences is like their birthdays plus xmas. Anything scandalous will go to print, which means other rags also jump on the train, and this creates a false debate which MPs feel they need to answer for. ""Look here,"" they say ""the Guardian has intervewed a Mumsnet user, who feels very strongly about what's on the Web, people will surely be angry if we're not seen to be doing something!"" Which brings me on to problem three, which is that our current government is peopled by absolute relics, many of whom don't understand basic Internet usage, like whichever judge keeps pushing torrentz to their next proxy. 


What's actually happened here is that ""tv-like"" video websites which display porn, now have to keep to what British Classifications would allow the Film Board to display on TV or in movies. Some of these, like ""fisting"" have long been banned on TV, and now tv-like websites have to abide by the same guidelines.

no more space? what are you on? mufc is 4th and 5 pts ahead of us. s'ton is 3rd and they're 6 pts ahead. city is 2nd and they're 7 pts ahead of us. losing to mufc is not the worst thing to happen. even if we lose (if we beat sunderland and they win their next fixture) they would only be 3 games ahead of us, with southhampton to free fall this month (they'll be out of top 4), west ham won't be able to sustain the form they're in (not enough quality), swansea will drop out leaving 4th a wide open battle between arsenal, tottenham and us. and that's assuming utd can keep up the form they're in now. they are weak enough at the back and an injury to rooney away from going into a poor patch of form. rvp, falcao are always hurt now, mata isn't the player lvg wants. adnan isn't the starlet he was last year (yet), wilson is too young to carry the team and di maria is not as effective at mufc as he was at rm yet, and he may never be. they spent and spent and spent and are still only 5 pts ahead of us, maybe 8 if we lose. but losing at old trafford to mufc would be far less demoralizing than losing to basel, AT HOME, getting knocked out of the CL (the comp we worked hard to get to last year), in what could potentially be stevie's last cl game ever. basel is the absolute must win. mufc isn't. 

now i do truly believe we can go on and beat both. we have the quality, the depth and players are starting to come back into the fold like balotelli, sahko, suso, flanno, etc..plus you have sturridge *hopefully* back in january. our form from january on could be crazy good. but if we lose to basel, thats not a good step. we were expected to easily make it out of the group. we are expected to beat basel at home. we better damn make sure that happens or else things will get ugly

edit: also to add onto the table, we are no more than 3 games out of top 3 even if we lose to mufc. if we win, we're in touching distance still of being top 2. it only takes a run of a good 10 games (not winning all, but performing in all of the ones we need to) to get back in. prem still has 24 matches to be played. cl has 1 guaranteed match. there are still 72 pts to be played for in the prem. remember that, 72.

I like that you attempt to salvage your terrible attempt, but instead just dig yourself a bigger hole. 

I didn't know you were trying this, because your follow ups are based entirely upon logical fallacies.

Here's some personal highlights that I adore in this hilarious attempt of 'rational debate':

&gt; Charitable interpretation does.

This is known as an argument to moderation. 

&gt; So you're citing youself. 

Strawman.

&gt; and you got to such lengths to disabuse me

Playing victim of ones own game.

&gt; You're quite unequivocal about everyone who has read this comment chain being obviously in favour of your position. Something other than ""if you can't work it out"" seems to be required here.

Passing the burden of proof, after making accusation. 

&gt; Pedantic fuckwittery gets us nowhere. 

Quite the lousy attempt at ad hominem.

&gt; PMQs is a debate in any meaningful sense of the word.

No true scotsman.

&gt; normal people might use in a conversation

A lovely bandwagon fallacy spiced up with an attempt at ad hominem.

&gt; If it happened outside parliament in this form it's a debate.

Self admittance that out of this context, that it would be the correct word to use, however, within this context, which is the point raised, it is not a debate. 

Contextual meaning is apparently a foreign concept. But this was a rather shoddy attempt at special pleading - no one is arguing the meaning of debate, but this is not a debate. I can see though how you believe that, as your retorts have not been short of insightful into your rationale.

A socialist believes in socialism - to take care of those less fortunate than oneself, to make sure every human being is treated with dignity and respect. Usually through things like cooperative enterprises. I'm a socialist, but I'm not a communist.

Communists/communism believes in common ownership, negating the concept of ownership to one person..

Socialists believe in freedom of religion. Communists believe in abolishing all religion.

Communism believes all people are the same and that social classes should be abolished. Socialism believes in much the same, but that all people should have access to basic articles of consumption and necessity. Communism believes in the abolishing of classes, socialism believes in the diminishing of classes.

Communism believes in zero private property and instead of 'ownership' uses the term 'usership' - socialism believes in two kinds of property, personal property (like your home) and public property, like your workplace.

Communism believes in a 'collective vote' or that the states leader makes the choices for the state. Socialism lets all choices fall to the individual (education, religion, employment etc). Citizens have free and equal access to education/healthcare etc.

There are more examples for differences between the two, but I couldn't be fucked with a big theory debate at the moment - I'm going boozing in a bit. Just take this away from it: yes, socialism is an evolutionary stage of communism - but it is not what people associate with Marxism (when people hear 'marxist' they think 'communist'). Jesus is a prophet of God in the Quran, so Muslims believe in part the same thing as Christians, doesn't make them Christian.

I'm not saying stupid shit doesn't happen because it does and its a small portion of the crowd, as a few comments here have already pointed out it's mainly large amounts of people walking around looking at and talking about cars, and it's a far cry from the fast and furious movies that the police and media seem to think it is.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, if there was ever a place were we could go to hang out and talk like a late diner that didn't penalize cars for being loud or a bit showy, we'd hang out there - but they simply don't exist, so we are left to have our lifestyle/hobby/interest shut down and labelled as criminal activity.

Imagine houses cost £10, and the tax was 10% and is now %0. (It's been reduced not abolished, but it's the same principle).

You paid £10 for a house plus £1 tax. Under the old system you only had a house worth £10. You were happy to pay £11 overall for a house that you could only resell for £10.

Future buyers still have £11, but so do their rival buyers, so instead of paying £10, they will be able to pay at least £11. In fact, all else being equal they will pay even more, because instead of getting a house they can resell in future for £10, they get a house that they can resell for £11.

So now your house is worth £11 or more, a windfall to you of at least £1.

People who exchanged contracts at £10, expecting to pay £1 tax but find that by random chance they don't have to are in a very good position. They paid £10 for a house worth £11 or more and they unexpectedly have £1 sitting around.

I completely agree here, it isn't an absurd to discuss it - it does cost a hell of a lot and a cost benefit analysis is definitely a good idea.

I'm of the opinion that we aren't doing enough to prepare for (our houses are poorly insulated), counter(invest in research into solutions) or mitigate(find alternate fuel sources, reduce co2 emissions), but to entertain a pragmatic approach is always a good idea.

&gt; already pathetic industry

Which industry do you think is pathetic? I don't think industry in the UK is pathetic in terms of size, quality or exports... so I'm a bit confused as to what you mean here.

&gt; Our green efforts are pointless in the grand scheme of things because China etc dwarf our co2 emission

China's actually doing a lot better than us per capita, however this point is moot - they've committed to co2 targets just as every other country has. They're doing this by heavily investing in alternative fuel sources - something which is daily becoming a cheaper and cheaper resource to exploit. The fact that solar / tidal &amp; wave energy is more affordable than other fuel sources makes it a pretty convincing argument from both a business and environmental perspective, as does insulating our houses.",0,1417633974,null,0,false,0,cmk5k8k,t3_2o5j1w,t1_cmk5k8k,t1_cmk2x6i,null,1425699394,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To be fair, he's literally written a book which puts forward a solution called Revolution. While he may not originally have meant to do anything more than express his disenchantment with the system, he's now wringing money from it by flogging a cash-in book.

I think if anything he's damaging the cause of shaking things up, by making it seem like anyone who steps outside the norm is an overblown, self-regarding prat.

I agree. As I said in the original comment, we make mistakes/lose the ball in tight situations. 

This is especially true when we pass it backwards either Attack &gt; Midfield or Midfield &gt; Defence. 

Because we are being pressed with such energy, slack back passes are very quickly pounced upon and create a real threat. 

You can almost always see that when we are a goal or two down, nearing full time, opponents stop pressing and behave much more defensively (trying to protect their lead). 

This is why we usually end our matches in such a strong, attacking mindset.

I've heard that ""slippery slope"" is a bad argument, but in this case it has been absolutely correct, the problem we've got is that there are people on the left and right who want porn censored for different reasons, and very few media outlets are willing to show any opposition to the idea.

If you are asked to move, and refuse to move, expect the law to come into force by removing you forcibly.

his body reaction was very similar to how guys react after getting chocked out in a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, guys will put their opponents to sleep and when the ref clears them the guys still out will move about usually their arms at the elbows until they get the blood back to their heads but they are still most certainly out

They are terrified of him because his message is popular, and he backs it up with ludicrous-but-true examples like the way the government negotiates tax bills with corporations to the tune of billions while making peoples lives miserable through cuts. There is a hit campaign out on him - and IMO everything they've thrown so far has been bullshit.

1. ""He doesn't have a solution"". Well I don't expect the worlds problems to be solved by a comedian! I've used this line a few times but this criticism is like saying ""Oi, unless you've got a detailed orbital mechanics plan and engineering design to stop the asteroid, stop fucking complaining about it destroying us!"" This one was exemplified on newsnight, where Brand wanted to talk about the causes he supports and they tried to ""nail"" him on his lack of economic knowledge and graphs. Total shite.

2. Raft of articles critical of his new book, featuring the most popular smear that he was a hypocrite for earning profit from it... despite repeatedly saying, and offering to prove, that he spends it on ""social enterprises"" meaning addiction programs and donations to campaigns like the New Era Estate.

3. ""How much do pay in rent?"". What was the point of that question? Even if he is a hypocrite, is that supposed to make what he is saying untrue? Frankly, he's rich so I'd prefer he lives in one of the many existing luxury flats that no average person can afford in any area and doesn't take up an average home.

4. ""Hypocrite"" for paying rent to a landlord who doesn't pay tax. How many of us do you think are doing that? Probably half the fucking country including staff at The Sun!! I honestly can't believe how obviously shit an attack that is on the guy, you can only imagine some bigwig literally saying ""Find something on Brand and put it on page 1!"". And again, even if it's true, I thought The Sun stood UP for working class people? Shouldn't they be agreeing with him and putting the New Era Estate campaign on page 1? Hypocrites!

At the end of the day he only claims to be speaking up and campaigning, and honestly I think he has generated way more discussion about the real issues of today than any public person in Britain today. The media is obsessed because he criticises them directly.

The media are out to get him because his whole show, The Trews, is about how the media narrative is obviously manipulated by the rich owners who stand to benefit. They fear him because they see he has support. This is a Ralph Miliband moment, where the guy they are targeting is alive to defend himself... and is much more likeable than Ed Miliband.

The nuns that were running the home had nothing (material) to offer at all, so they prayed for us.

I saw a lot of photos back then how they struggled, it was unbelievable how they had to cope. One elderly nun got up at four in the morning and cut bread for 400 peoples' breakfast (350 patients, nuns, and employees) with a manually operated bread cutter.

And with every aid convoy you had to ""grease the wheels"". On one occasion, there was a shortage of toilet paper. Imagine 350 bodily and mentally handicapped people and no toilet paper! So we organized a truck full of that stuff and sent it there. The customs guy kept insisting that we could not import them (there were flowers printed on the paper, so it was a printed media from the west which was not permitted in poland back then) - It took some Deutschmarks to convince him that the flowers were no western propaganda but a message of peace and friendship to the people...

Would you rather have 1 season of CL and then a season without it, or 2 seasons of CL football?

It's better for the club to be in the CL as many seasons in a row as possible.  Realistically, we are not going to win the CL.  This means we need a top 4 finish to stay in.  If we stay in and do a bit better in it each season, we get to build up and make deeper runs as we'll have access to better players in the transfer market.  It's a process, and we can't skip a step because don't have infinite money to make players offers that they just can't refuse.  We have to do it the hard way.  If we're in a for a season, then out for a season, and making appearances inconsistently like that, then it's way harder to attract top quality players, which will most likely leave us more or less spinning in place, on the fringes of it.  This is a long term project, and I don't think going an extra round in the CL this season is worth giving up the CL for next season.

EDIT: Like I said before though, I think we can win both games, and it's not necessarily a choice.  However, this thread is based on it actually being a choice, and if it is a choice between one or the other, I like the long term success of the club more than a single mediocre run and then steps backwards (a season without the CL is a step backwards).",0,1417638483,null,0,1417638714,0,cmk89nv,t3_2o61r0,t1_cmk89nv,t1_cmk6pcg,null,1425698132,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I mean, if we look at his performances this season and in pre-season, his best moments have been as an impact sub and he gets more clear chances to shoot and score from outside the box.

Second shot: Oscar is running down the goal line and flicks it onto an open Willian inside the penalty box to the left of goal and he takes another low powered shot straight at Lloris.

They can be right, but this is the weakest of all possible defences. How can they claim any credibility? Come on, it's a shameful attitude for a media organisation to hold... Where is the ""Fit and Proper"" owner clause in all this?

&gt;I think they deserve that criticism too. I don't think they should be sued is my point -- the law is a blunt, horrible, instrument, and I don't think Brand should be using it to silence the Sun. Rather, he should be doing just as you are -- criticising them right back. Goodness, he's got a big enough soap box that it will be far more effective anyway.

I don't understand why he can't do both? They silence everyone they can, with smear campaigns. He has to fight with all available tools.

He is openly critical of the media, it's why they are after him. In the ""snide"" interview he had a go at the whole media.

false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; EDIT: I'm perplexed by the downvotes, it's a solid argument.

I think you're missing two points:

1) The absolute numbers are less interesting than the rate of growth. The Scottish Greens have doubled in size in a matter of weeks, the SNP have almost quadrupled.

That's all off the back of the referendum result, and while some things are obvious (all of those new members will vote for the party they joined) the more interesting thing is what it means for the other parties.

Many parties, particularly Labour in Scotland, rely on a solid base of volunteers to help make their case to the electorate.

The SNP now have at least nine times as many ordinary people willing to make their arguments to other voters as Scottish Labour, the Scottish Greens now have about double the Scottish Lib Dems. The Greens are probably not far off Scottish Labour itself (SLab numbers have plummeted from 17K in 2008 to somewhere under 13K in 2010, when they stopped reporting numbers).

2) The electoral choice people are making in Scotland is becoming less and less about helping to choose the UK government and more about choosing a party that pushes for Scottish interests at Westminster (I think this holds true for Jim Murphy's Scottish Labour 2.0 too).

Labour are almost certainly going to get a drubbing as a result of the referendum, the SNP are almost certainly going to benefit from that, but nobody really expects the SNP to ""outvote the English"" or force a coalition.

What they can do is either participate in a coalition (or confidence and supply) in exchange for things that matter to them, or simply demarcate Scottish politics even further from Westminster.

Many political commentators in the rest of the UK see the referendum as ""it's over, No won, so back to normal"". I think that's missing the extraordinary level of public engagement there was in politics here a couple of months ago, and that many hitherto apolitical people are now actively making choices given that independence and/or devo-max is the future they want to see in Scotland.

Say that did ""entrench the core English vote for the Conservatives"". Your argument (and Scottish Labour's!) is that this is is counter-productive, however I think many people would see that simply as affirmation of the divide they believe already exists.

Ie., if voting SNP or Green results in Scotland being negatively affected by the Conservatives then the problem is the union itself, not that they voted for a party that represents their beliefs.

&gt;Yet instead of looking at the positive publicity the report gave to the campaign in general

Page 1 of the Sun ""Russell Brand HYPOCRITE"" says it all. The media are focusing on him and making the cause a side issue, because nobody can argue with the cause. 

He showed the campaign in a mostly positive light because there is no way to show it in a negative light, they absolutely have the moral high ground here. He then did his best to put a negative spin on it. He showed his bias.

Ask the hypocrite question on another day, maybe when he is in the C4 news studio promoting his own book and it is all about him?

If you want a private life, you're accused of being aloof, if you make your private life public the press will twist anything they can into a scandal.

Each student is worth about 3K to a school. Say a Grammar school has 200 places for year one. They will say ""You can only get into this school if you take the 11+"". 

They then take all the A students who apply. Let's say there are 120 places left, they then take all the B students cos they had a family member at the school.. There are 60 places left. They will then take the C students, because little Paddy/Billy had a bad day and there's a note from his doctor to say he was stressed. There are 20 places left, they then take the D students because they live within the catchment area..

All places filled and the school gets maximum funding. At the same time though, the secondary school down the road which also had 200 spots to fill, can't fill them because parents want to send their kids to the grammar school as it has better computers, facilities etc because they get the most funding over the years as a result of using academic selection as a marketing tool to fill their places.

The best thing the Dept of Edu can do is say, Right you can use academic selection, here's a test we have prepared, but you're only allowed students who score an A or a B.. Grammar schools would fall over themselves getting rid of academic selection.

Description:

In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can't agree on the split! It's time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!

Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have the more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.

Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a ""Bang!"" or a ""Click! Click!"" card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on ""Three"" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.

Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a ""Bang!"" takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table — money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a ""Bang!"" card to your hand) — until everything has been claimed.

After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!

Description:

All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?

Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

Description:

Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:

Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card – until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.

Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.

Several big chances - Kane's header, Chadli's long range effort, lots of throughballs and dinked passes that were inches away - but that wasn't the point, really, today.

The *team* gelled. The passing was rapid and crisp, we overwhelmingly won the midfield battle (their chances came from bypassing the midfield with balls over top on the counter), we were great in movement off the ball and inventive in our chance creation. The press was excellent.

We were let down by one off day from a masterful goalkeeper and the exploitation of our 4th choice right back. Vertonghen wasn't terrific and Fazio and Lamela were poor, but everyone else to a man was superb. Kane, Bentaleb, Chadli and Eriksen were probably our best, but Mason and Lennon were also very good, and Davies can consider that a capable second choice left back performance.

As much as I fucking hate the classless fucks, Chelsea are going to finish in least worst place this year, and this was a performance that warranted a much better result.

Walker is a big miss still, and Rose - but they'll be back. This is a second good team *performance* in a week, and I for one am delighted that we are seeing fast and inventive football the like of which I had been waiting for for months under Poch.

He's visiting clubs, now that the Norwegian season is over. 

He's a 15 year old who is capped at the international level, and his father is looking out to secure the best possible deal for the kid. This involves visiting clubs, and apparently doing some training with them. 

But I actually think he might end up not signing for an English club this winter. Due to regulations on contracts. 

He's 15, he has a professional contract lasting out the 2015 season at Strømsgodset. He turns 16 later this month. He can't sign for an English club on anything but a youth contract before he's 17, whereas he can sign a contract with a Spanish club when he turns 16. I have no idea on the regulations in Holland or Germany. 

The most likely scenarios, will be for him to either transfer to a club where he can get a professional contract during this winter, or he'll serve out his current contract with Strømsgodset, and be available on a free transfer next winter. 

The former case will to some degree ensure that he will get into an environment where he can continue to develop as a player.

Besides, increasing the operating expense for industries forces them abroad to maintain global competitiveness, effectively offshoring the C02 emissions they are emitting in this country to another, while costing this country jobs and taxes. Taxes that contribute to our welfare state. 

So, while we've achieved nothing to tackle the problem, we've increased the cost of living, received fewer taxes and fewer jobs. But hey, at least our tree-hugging conscience is clear.

I thought our attitude today really stood out. One of the biggest problems in recent years has been once we concede to a big team, heads go down and performances drop, resulting in a real spanking. That may have briefly happened with the first 2 goals in quick succession. Other than that little spell I think every player was making themselves available for a pass, no one hiding, moving to find space. There really was a lot I was impressed with tonight.

Yes we lost 3-0 to a team we hate, but facing facts they are a very good team, with a very good manager. Their players might be cunts, their manager might be a massive cunt, and their fans are disgusting cunts, but they are the best team in the league, and despite conceding 3 goals I thought we played very well for a lot of the game.

Bentaleb was *outstanding* .  So glad he's back, I can't wait to watch his continued maturation this season.

Davies was also excellent.  Made good decisions on defense, provided width (except that our passes out to the left were mostly way too long).  And that boy can put in a cross.

Fazio was quite solid, he seems to be adjusting and settling now.  
Lennon was Lennon.  Played well in space, beat some people, couldn't muster anything with his final ball.  Good defensive workrate, but one key mistake led to the first goal. :(

Lamela had bright moments, made better decisions overall, but his passing, like Eriksen's was also just a little off.

&gt;The only bias I can see here are people with so much of a victim complex that they ignore a very high profile piece in support of their campaign because a small part of it questioned Brand's integrity

Well when you make up the reason people are mad, it's obvious you will draw nonsense conclusions.

People are mad that the media are so shit that in an otherwise good piece their reporter tried an absolutely embarrassing ad-hominem and make the story about someone else. How much of the C4 report was reported in the media, and how much was the exchange started with a stupid question covered?

Balance is go to speak to the developer, not attack a persons character.

At the end of the day, Russell Brand is anti-media, and the reason people who support him are mad about this incident is because it's exactly what he is talking about. The media always has an agenda, a narrative they try to force.

In his one and only PL start this season, against place, he played quite well made good forward runs, got on the end of balls, put a couple of decent crosses in, and generally played alright, all be it he defensive duties where lacking, which is why i wouldn't advocate that we start him, he does show decent quality for an impact sub however.

When he started the cup game against Swansea he looked very poor, a few wayward passes, losing the ball to easily and generaly looked slow, not a good performance at all, however the whole team performed like fucking dross that game, so i wouldn't say its a good enough reason to write off ever bringing him on ever again.

In his EL start he gave a very average performance, showed one of to flashes of potential but didn't really offer to much going forward but once again was a little suspect in his defensive responsibilities against a team, im my opinion, we clearly underestimated.

as for his sub appearances, i though he looked decent in his latest appearance against Lille, but realistically, coming on in the last 10 mins of a couple of EL games, where we have been comfortably winning/seeing out the game isn't a fair place to judge someone who's had very little first team football and is clearly a little off the pace of the game.

Realistically he need to be brought on in the 65th/70th min area so he can atleast attempt to have some impact in the game, as a diffrent option out wide, like i said, someone who will make a run in behind or down the line and offer a different pass then just knocking it back to Jags and Distin, something which at the moment, McGeady isn't doing, and if you look at the other options on the bench, the only other choice we have is to bring Eto'o on to play in behind Rom and push Ross out wide, which would be even worse than bringing McGeady on.

It irritates me to see people hold such irrational dislike of someone that they deny the fundmental good they are doing. I don't understand why people are so bitter about him helping people. How is him helping people try not to get evicted a bad thing?

I still have yet to hear you explain WHY he needs new ideas. All these guys designing cars, they keep using wheels? Fucks sake, they need some new ideas!

We dominated possession and were constantly on the cusp of creating chances. Our quality was just lacking regarding finishing and clinical through balls. That is the best team in England, top 3 in Europe. Be realistic about what we are expecting.

I figure it's more that we love us some celebrities, especially if they are saying ""shocking"" things (whether or not those things are even all that shocking). 



&gt;It irritates me to see people hold such irrational dislike of someone that they deny the fundmental good they are doing. I don't understand why people are so bitter about him helping people. How is him helping people try not to get evicted a bad thing?

I never said him helping people is a bad thing. That's fine, he can carry on. But ranting and raving about how terrible the system is, about how the politicians are corrupt, &amp;c &amp;c doesn't really help anyone. 

&gt;I still have yet to hear you explain WHY he needs new ideas. 

He doesn't. But if he has nothing new to say, I don't see why anyone finds him interesting. He says the same old shit, just with bigger words. That's fine, but don't make out like he's some sort of revolutionary thinker...

We agree on that.

You make this sound like this is some new groundbreaking realization everyone should make…  Howard has consistently had heaping amounts of criticism thrown at him from loads of Everton supporters for years. He's always been a keeper thats capable of having fantastic performances mixed with ugly mistakes/bad games every so often. 

I think everyone has always known Tim Howard was never a world class keeper, but stop with the 'he's shite' circlejerk, he's not 'shite'. Rob Green is shite. Heurelho Gomes is shite. Go and look at the stats since 2009/2010, we've basically been in the top 5 every year in the least goals conceded category (and yes obviously the back line plays a large role in that statistic, but a shite keeper wouldn't consistently be in the top 5 year after year for goals conceded). Even this year, everyone knows our backline has played appalingly inconsistent, and as you alluded to, Distin's performances have been shambolic, and Jags hasnt looked top notch in the slightest either. Do you honestly think there's that many keepers in the prem right now that would have done much better with our pedestrian defensive displays this season??

Howard brings alot of intangibles to the squad that I don't think alot of people recognize or give him credit for that plays a big part in why he's always won the confidence of the manager and the squad to be the club's #1 for years now, and is also why we've never seriously shopped for another #1 keeper.

He's not in the same class Courtois, Nueur, Casillas, etc., everyone knows that, but he's not shite.

Is that right? So let's look at a case study of one of the ""officers"" in this video.

That big, bald fella in the high-vis.

He comes into frame at around 12s in your video. Grabs a lass by her jacket, pulls her towards him and then throws her back and down to the ground. What was she doing... filming. A good 4 feet away from him. He had to take two paces to reach and grab her since she wasn't moving towards him at all. He had to go to her, to grab her and then throw her down and this is professional conduct?

Moments later, while holding what I presume to be a CS canister, starts pushing/jabbing at a male demonstrators upper torso/neck area - I counted 4 distinct pushes. What was the demonstrator doing. Nothing except trying to catch the girl who the big, bald copper had just pushed to the ground and then having the temerity to put his hands up to defend himself. Worth noting that after one shove, into a group of people, he actually steps forwards and shoves the demonstrator again because *clearly* he hadn't been pushed far enough back the first time.

Then at around 1m 10s, the same big, bald fella grabs a demonstrator from behind, and throws him to the ground by the neck without taking any precautions to make sure he doesn't clatter his head right off the deck - precautions that he's supposed to fucking take.

Seems like a bit of a cunt to me to be honest. Pulling and pushing a lass around for no reason, jabbing at a guy for trying to keep him away from him, throwing another guy to the ground with no regard for his well-being.

That isn't conduct I expect of a professional in a public office, it's the conduct of a hired goon. He should know better - from his training, if not his experience - that he should keep a cooler head and should be doing what he can to de-escalate the situation, not escalate it with unnecessary use of force.

---

Oh and that crowd wasn't particularly abusive or hostile in my opinion. They were trying to extricate themselves, defend themselves, or document what occurred.

No, not seeing it does not lead to that conclusion.

&gt;He didn't, he had his arms up to protect his head if attacked, it's a natural human instinct when you see someone being violent and there's a chance they might be violent to you as well.

Human instinct is usually fight or flight. I don't see the officer being violent to him myself. So by your definition, that's a null hypothesis.

&gt;Sorry but the victim blaming which is endemic in this thread and which you are partaking in really distressing. People get murdered because of this, because in our society police know that they can attack innocent people and useful idiots (you) will be there making their excuses without even getting paid for it.

Distressing to who? The students who see themselves as victims here?
Isn't that a bit subjective? What about the people who don't see them as victims? Are we automatically wrong enough for you to hope that my family suffer from police brutality?

I find it more distressing that certain people seem to act as if anything which goes against their worldview is inherently wrong and make passing-the-blame excuses of their own when it escalates.

Ultimately, if you choose to protest, you must be aware that it may not be taken lightly whether it is disguised as peaceful or not. If you choose to stage a sit-in, you need to be aware that people do not take lightly to it being done on private property or where it creates a hazard to those not involved (blocking fire exits and routes of escape).

People seem to think that pulling a phone out is an excuse to take on the police without consequences. It is not. Were the police really at fault here, and had they arrested several people for assaulting a security guard, it would have been far more effective for the argument to have filmed the incidents and remained at a distance.

Instead, being confrontational towards the police and screaming about injustice has ruined whatever sympathy people like myself might have toward the 'victims'. People really need to learn what a 'peaceful' protest involves.",0,1417652293,null,0,false,0,cmkg9si,t3_2o6ds6,t1_cmkg9si,t1_cmkforv,null,1425694318,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Well said man! I think the talk of sacking is absolute knee-jerk impatience. He is a strong, honest, calm leader, and I trust that he is thinking long term. He has bought in some great players, who I believe are performing very well indeed (Ulloa, Mahrez especially) to address the thin attacking options, and has tried to address the lack of experience in the side with Cambiasso (different league, but the most highly decorated Argentine will certainly add a lot of knowledge, and even confidence and pride, to the younger/inexperienced players). King Power have pledged to spend (I forgot how much exactly) millions over the next few years on the squad, developing and strengthening. I think this, and Pearsons obviously long-term focused outlook go to say to me that calls for sacking are far to premature.

That being said, we need to score and get a point at least from Villa, for the sake of the confidence and morale of the side, and fans.

I think that Chris Wood is very good and the defense needs a shake up, or a reshuffle, and Schmeichel needs to get his head back into the game.

I was gutted to see us concede two in the second half, as there was nothing but pressure and attempts on goal from us, all half (albeit fairly weak attempts and tepid pressure). Keep it up, get a fierce eye for goal in and we will out-score opponents. This will only come with confidence I think though, so the line between constructive criticism, legit worries and frustration, and shaking the foundations of team spirit and passion to win must be trodden carefully.

Please, give us your long resumé of peaceful protests and the list of things you've achieved!
Oh, thought not.

Equating protests with achievements.

&gt;Casting doubt about the protesters when there's no reason for doubt. 

Why is there no reason for doubt? We have a number of videos and witness commentary from one side but not the other. Until we get evidence from both sides of the argument, I am free to cast doubt on what is alleged, given that I, as a reasonable person, would not conduct myself with the police in the manner shown in the videos.

&gt;The police were the ones being confrontational, I literally feel like I'm in the Twilight zone, watch the video, they are repeatedly using violence against people, oh my god, what will it take.

I have watched every video I can find and end up repeating myself. The videos show the students crowding around the officers and shouting at them. There is no context as to what happened before, but we can assume that something sparked this escalation. Are you seriously alleging that the police just stormed in out of nowhere and started hitting people?

I do not know the circumstances behind why the people who were arrested were, but if that was a precursor to the footage that we do have, I'd be inclined to believe that there was some level of resistance to the arrest involved, which would have thus led to the anger from the students in the video.

The students were very clearly being confrontation and continued doing so. There were a total of maybe 6 officers there? and somehow them being surrounded, shouted at and potentially caused to apprehend violence not confrontational?

As I keep repeating, I have not seen footage of everything that happened, but I would prefer not to be called an idiot for trusting the integrity of the police until proven otherwise. You are not proving otherwise.

Recession + reduced VAT = lower tax revenues = deficit.

&gt;When does noise become a nuisance?
    English private law defines a nuisance as ""an unlawful interference with a person's use or enjoyment of land or of some right over, or in connection, with it."" The process of determining what level of noise constitutes a nuisance can be quite subjective. For instance, the level of noise, its length and timing may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether a nuisance has actually occurred.

and -

&gt;What can the police do about noise complaints?
    Noise nuisance is generally treated as an environmental health matter, to be handled by the local council. **The police can deal with a complaint if the noise amounts to a breach of the peace, or where it is associated with threatening, violent or other anti-social behaviour.** In very serious cases of anti-social behaviour, the police and local councils can work together to seek anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) against residents causing alarm, harassment and distress to others.

This comes a year to the day that the 'cops off campus' movement started after the same thing happened in London, history repeats itself and the police reveal themselves. They are not as their own ideology purports, there to protect 'us', but to protect the interests of capital and the rich. Today this means forcing through and into line those that resist the unquestionable validity of 'austerity'. This has a long history around the globe, usually austerity mediated through the IMF and backed by the army to kill those who oppose hegemony, since 2008 it's come to the UK, and here we see the results. No doubt those arrested will be given bail restrictions that ban them from protests, and then in a couple of months be not-charged, since that's what always happens, it's pure intimidation. Last year 39 people were arrested, including students no even involved in the protest, months later after restriction that prevented protesting, prevented entering university campus and prevented association in groups more than 3, the charges were predictable dropped; of course by then the law had done it's job to quell and discipline dissent.

it's students on a university. It's not private property. When entering the campus you aren't required to ask the permission of the owners. This isn't a private university but a public one. But it's good to see people think that private property is more important than freedom. If you're not allowed to protest at a university where are you? But these authoritarians think exactly that, that if they make every area of land in the UK into 'private property' then we can essentially ban protests without ever changing the law. Take central London. The City of London is private property so you're not allowed to protest. The City of Westminster is still classified as public property but in 2005 the government establish a 1mile zone from Parliament wherein protest is not allowed; so essentially by law, protest is illegal in central London. But you don't care you follow orders without question. I hope these apologists for violence know what living in such a society means. Todays Britain looks exactly the same as Hong Kong.

Being relatively satisfied with the result and performance (or even just shrugging your shoulders as though it was inevitable) is exactly the same problem our team has at the moment against top sides, and is the reason why we keep getting beat handily.

Yes, the first 15 mins were possibly our best stint of the season so far.  But instead of using this to grow in self-belief, we shrink back into our scared little selves as soon as they get a goal against us.  I knew as soon as it happened that a second was not far away, as that's about the sum total of our mental resilience against top four sides these days.  Sure, we can come from behind against a lower table side or an exhausted looking Everton, but we still can't summon the self-belief to even scrape a decent goalscoring chance against a strong team that's on top of us.

The only reason it finished 3-0 is because Chelsea played a game a few days ago with a similar starting lineup and knew they never had to try too hard to beat us.  For all our possession, it was useless.  There was such little intensity and fight, when all it would've taken was a second half goal to put them under the microscope.  Instead they were like a cat half-interestedly playing with a wounded mouse... they could've just killed us, but they didn't need to.  And let's not forget they were missing arguably the most lethal striker in the league too.

3-0 is not a result I'll ever happily except in the league, and I don't think any of us should really.  It's undeniable they're a better side than us on paper, but as the cliche goes, the game is not played on paper.

When teams such as Swansea, Schalke, Bolton, QPR and West Brom have all gone to Stamford Bridge this season and gotten a better result than us, it proves that we really can expect better than what happened there tonight.

It was fantastic - everything worked out perfectly: flight landed early, got to hotel and then out to Loftus Road with plenty of time to get a pint at the Springbok. Got into our seats in time to see warmups and make a few pregame obscene gestures to the Leicester fans sitting 30 or 40 feet away.

And we really enjoyed the game - thought it was a bit sloppy all around, but exciting nonetheless. The rhythm of the scoring - Leicester going up, then QPR matching, and on - made for a great up-and-down ride and lots of good chanting back and forth.

And I even got a few nice bear hugs from the bloke who sat next to me - at first glance he looked every inch the scary hooligan (shaved head the size of a cinder block atop a body the shape of a much larger cinder block), but he couldn't have been nicer.

It doesn't address the first source cited on the NASA page ([here](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.abstract)), the second it dismisses on methods (which I trust NASA to evaluate more) and I looked up the third by N. Oreskes. I found it far more convincing than the criticism of it, which was ""The methodology is also flawed. A study published earlier this year in Nature noted that abstracts of academic papers often contain claims that aren't substantiated in the papers."" It does not explain why or how the methodology is flawed or demonstrate any relation between the position being argued in the Nature study and the section of the essay that looked at abstracts of papers. Claims being unsubstantiated doesn't seem relevant, considering the relevant passage from the essay:

&gt;[The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.full)

&amp;nbsp;

As your first link points out some people have a huge vested interest in preventing environmentally friendly progress. The scientific community has considerably less vested interest in pulling the kind of large scale hoax that would be necessary for the current situation to have developed. And it would be a very large scale hoax; look at the statements from all the scientific associations on that page and consider that the IPCC has worldwide scientific backing and the trust of the UN.

I found an interesting passage while checking N. Oreskes' wikipedia page:

&gt;[Merchants of Doubt is a 2010 book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway. Oreskes and Conway, both American historians of science, identify some remarkable parallels between the climate change debate and earlier controversies over tobacco smoking, acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer. They argue that spreading doubt and confusion was the basic strategy of those opposing action in each case.\[3\] In particular, Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, and a few other contrarian scientists joined forces with conservative think tanks and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.\[17\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes#Merchants_of_Doubt)

&gt;[The conservative Marshall Institute has been critical of the book, but most other reviewers received it favorably. One reviewer said that Merchants of Doubt is exhaustively researched and documented and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year.\[18\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes#Merchants_of_Doubt)

I think eventually you can just apply Occam's Razor: Are all the right wing politicians and corporations - for whom it would be very convenient for global warming not to be a problem - the ones with the insight when they say it's not a problem, when they say the reports of a massive scientific consensus from so very many reputable groups are false?

The facts as I have been able to glean them -

Protest occurred.

Member of university security is alleged to have been assaulted.

Police are summoned in response to the report of the assault (as far as they know the protest is not peaceful as they are responding to an assault call).

One person is isolated, arrested and extracted.

Two others attempt to interfere with the extraction and are also arrested. (you can see one of them on the video).

Not exactly the definition I would have in mind of a peaceful protest?
