It's the last great ideological movement in architecture, grounded in post-war optimism and idealism and honesty. The idea that buildings should be machines for living in, the idea that we are shaped by our environments and that social cohesion can be cultivated through the physical arrangement of people's homes and workplaces. The idea that it's disingenuous, patronizing and elitist for a building to hide its structural elements through ornament and facade. Brutalism doesn't mean 'brutal'-ism, it means 'brut'-alism; brut is 'raw' in french. Raw concrete, honest concrete. These were buildings that served a function but other than that got out of the way for people to live their lives in the most efficient and pleasant possible way. New Urbanism might be popular at the moment, reflecting the idea that people want to be able to safely walk around their town centres, for there to be a place for everything and everything in its place. Brutalism (and its father modernism) were *all about* that. Tower block catwalks were envisioned as 'streets in the sky' where children could safely walk and play, neighbours could make chit chat over a cup of tea, and in some cases there were even tower blocks with cargo lifts so that milk floats could drive along and make deliveries!

All of this stuff is well and good, but the fact of the matter is that brutalism was bastardized from the beginning. It was cheap to make things out of concrete and call them brutalist, and councils in equal part unscrupulous and desperate churned out knock-off brutalist tower blocks left, right and centre, saving themselves money by not bothering to pay for architects who cared about the impact and context of what they were churning out. Construction quality was lax, and in the economic stagnation of the seventies maintenance was near non-existence in many cases. Most of the buildings decried as brutalist 'carbuncles' are shadows of everything the soul of brutalism is about. Brutalism dies at the hands of those who see only the ersatz, ill-maintained lumpen knock-offs which vastly outnumber the high-concept, well-designed and functional buildings the ideology stands for. For every Unité d'Habitation there are a dozen Red Road Flats. That is the problem.

On the broader point though, I think experts are useful for achieving things, but they aren't a particular good method of deciding what should be achieved. Most things in politics, as in real life, require some form of trade. You can rig an economic system to reduce inequality, for instance, but that usually impacts growth. 

A minister generally has a goal in mind and asks his civil servants what options they have to achieve it. He then reviews them and chooses the one he feels to be the best, based roughly on the priorities of the government at the time, which loosely reflects the will of the public. 

I'd be interested to hear why you think unelected experts would do better though.

s^2 = (1/N^2) Sum (x_i - x_trend)^2

x_trend = the value of x at that year using your trend line

s roughly measures the amount of fluctuation of your graphs -- as you can see those dots fluctuate over your trend line. 

This value s is roughly the amount of ""error"" your next year's prediction will have. So for example, by eye, your next year's 1st points total is roughly 87, then your prediction would be

87 +- s.

i.e. if your s is 5 points (which is what I roughly guess it is by eye), then your prediction for 1st next year is 82 to 92.

Relevant piece of legislation is the housing act 2004 which is the legal underpinning of the housing health and safety rating system. HHSRS is a set of guidelines used by professionals to asses hazards in a home environment.

If you believe that your house is unsafe, which potential mould growth is, you're well within your rights to report it to the local authority who will investigate.

The outcome of any investigation will vary between the local authority telling you that there are no hazards, that there are potential hazards which they suggest should be fixed (informal approach), or that there are hazards that **must** be fixed (formal approach)

It's the duty of the local authority to carry out legal action against the landlord. A strongly worded letter to the landlord before you approach the local authority may spur the landlord on a bit quicker and resolve the issue without relying on the council.

I'm speaking from experience in England, although as far as I am aware the above applies to Scotland as well.

I know what you mean about the whole ""just got see your derm!"" advice. Whilst I have had recent success with the antibiotics, I feel it was the standard go to treatment.

I went to my GP a lot as a teen and it was just a case of trying something, not seeing them for 3-6 months until I had taken the treatment for long enough to show/prove it wasn't working and then going back to try something else. I never got near an actual dermatologist. 

Story time, I recently had to have a telephone appointment to be allowed to have the birth control implant, the doctor actually said ""have a Google, research it and decide if it is for you, then come back to me"", end of conversation.

He had a more productive season than Draxler too imo before we signed him and while Schalke have an amazing team, they still don't seem CL ready like the Madrid game.

&gt;The __Londonderry Air__ is an [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(music\)) that originated from [County Londonderry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Londonderry) in [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) (now [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland)). It is popular among the [Irish diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora) and is very well known throughout the world. The tune is played as the victory anthem of [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) at the [Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games). ""[Danny Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boy)"" is a popular set of lyrics to the tune.

Accident waiting to happen because of the weird way the traffic merges together at that point. If someone had come around that corner doing the speed limit, and the other lane had traffic in it, it'd have been a nasty RTA.

I got to the nearest safe place to pull over, called the non-emergency line. After 12 minutes, I was told I was being transferred. They hung up on me. 

Pissed off, I went to the next roundabout, did a 180, drove back, confirmed the vehicle was still there, still no hazards, no change. Pulled to a different safe spot. 

Called 999, explained, lady sympathised and said they'd dispatch someone. It was dumb luck that there wasn't a serious accident there. With hindsight I should have just rung 999 to begin with.

Looks like he has a very good first touch and good vision, tried to create off his first touch when possible to keep the opposition defence unorganised. 

Does not seem particularly gifted defensively, and left his man once or twice leaving us exposed to accurate chipped balls, but then again I assume he would prefer a more central attacking role as opposed to the right midfield role (not even ram) that he played today.

Looks like a good addition to the side though!

[Here is TFL's FAQ on fare evasion prosecutions](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/fare-evasion-prosecution.pdf).

And a relevant snippet:

Penalty fares are only issued
in circumstances where the
passenger has been unable to
produce a ticket for the
journey being made. If the
Inspector suspects that this is
as a result of a deliberate
attempt to avoid paying the
fare, then the matter is likely
to be reported for prosecution
as opposed to dealing with it
by way of a penalty fare.

Sounds like him being prosecuted would be the normal course of events.

I couldn't find stats on rail fare evasion prosecutions ([and I'm not the only one](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/railway_fare_evasion_cases)), but there were [over 20,000 prosecutions for bus fare evasion in London in 2008](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/fare_evasion_on_london_buses) so it's not like prosecutions for fare evasion are a rare thing.

This was a spectacularly egregious example of deliberate, calculated fare evasion, for it not to be prosecuted like innumerable other more minor cases are every year would be a travesty of justice.

His touch and lack of movement has been poor, he is'nt normally this clumsy looking and static is he? I'm hoping he's just short on confidence or fitness. I know he can do a lot better than this.

So the company you worked for lacked proper management/direction and failed? 

&gt;  Essentially the scripts that they feed you rely on refined advertising tricks and tactics which is what I mean when I say ""become a professional cunt.""

That makes you a professional cunt, how exactly? 

Let me tell you about sales here. You my friend, have money. You spend that money. That money buys you stuff you WANT, as well as the necessities. The stuff you want is fair game. It's that level of 'want', which is only defined by yourself, the people you talk too, and the mentality you have... which defines that want. 

If you speak to somebody who makes you more set in your ways and gets a sale from that, so be it. That's fair game, no? If YOU as a consumer do not know what it is  you want, have some advice and get to understand your needs better and be guided into what it is you want, then you buy a product.. you're getting what you want. 

In my industry, we help people like you. We are not profressional cunts. We have a huge industry behind us creating a product, marketing it, developing and refining it as technology progresses. Then we have people like you who reap the benefits that the people like me help draw connections in between.

You're using a computer now, on the internet, on a website, typing on a keyboard, etc.. all these components are created by people developing products made by other people. Sales is just helping connect these dots.

So, as somebody who you would describe as a 'profressional cunt', for reasons only you fully understand.. I would fully advise OP to get into what I do. Because as a scouser with no qualifications but a belief in what I do, how I do it, and my abilities as a human being.. I make really good money and it's money that is easier to make through sales than any other industry.

true,EleventhHourGhost,k9,K-9,"Sorry, I wasn't clear: I meant that the ""technology"" around the regenerations is controlled by them.  That is: some Gallifreyans are selected to become Time Lords and attend the Academy*. At some point they get the ability to regenerate - it's not inherent in being a Gallifreyan. Then, assuming they abide by Time Lord rules and don't go running around interfering in the rest of the universe, they'll be on Gallifrey for their regeneration, whether it be caused by old age or a falling bookshelf.  That process will be managed and smooth and controlled, like going to a hospital and getting something routine done.

The Doctor, and the other Renegade Time Lords, however, are out on their own. While the regeneration process is biological, and put in as a safety net in the event of something bad happening, it's not easy when done without proper assistance/supervision/something.  Even so, with the Time Lords still around in the classic era, the Tardis was able to offer some sort of connection back to them and help him... but now, whatever connection was there is lost, and his regenerations have become steadily harder and more uncontrolled.

The most recent was so dramatic that it blew up a Dalek ship; one assumes that whatever ""energy"" was required to give him 12 more had to be delivered all at once, in some sort of bulk deal.  Perhaps that same energy is present when Gallifreyans become Time Lords, but they all have their iPhones plugged into the equipment and the excess energy is used to recharge them. ;-)

8 is answered in the show, Rory seeing his gravestone meant that he had to die in New York to be buried there. Amy chose Rory over the Doctor. If he had gone back and removed Amy, and Rory because she wasn't going with out him, from New York, another paradox would occur and destroy New York and possibly have other consequences.

6 is just kinda silly, we know from the show that Rory doesn't remember all of what happened. There are bits and pieces he gets now and then, but it's not all there.

I haven't spoken to him about it but I believe he was just speaking about using the formation for the first time this preseason. And he never said Sturridge played well, just that he was troublesome at some points. I think the main problem is just clarification of the information presented to put it in a better light of what he's trying to present. I definitely don't think an article like this brings down the subreddit. It's helping a LFC fan hone his amateur writing skills and has created a decent discussion. If no one sees the article he'll never get valuable this feedback. So thank you for reading and keep up the discussion. It's what makes this subreddit great

EDIT: Also, I don't see you saying that other people are ruining this subreddit by posting stupid fucking pictures of a crowd wearing red jerseys.

true,196884,null,null,"Quick thoughts :

We played a very poor Milan team, who gave us WAY too much time on the ball and is not organized in its pressing. So, we looked really good.

We play 4-3-3, with a very high press 4-5-1 without the ball (see Lucas in the holding role, but he is in the center circle a often off-ball). At least for 60 minutes, then with the conga-sub at min 60, our formation went to bits.

Some salient comments on players :

Lambert : He is *not* playing well all tournament, and is looking lost in all the games he is on for us so far. The missed penalty is telling -- he is short of confidence. Perhaps his head is not quite sorted out that he is playing for his boyhood love-team. Not a big problem, but he needs to get his head sorted out quick as he is out ""impact sub"" and he is not going to be one if he keeps feeling overawed.

Sterling : Again, our best player on the field. He is continuing his trajectory from last season (read : very steeeeeeeeep rise). People should consider dark horse bets on him to be on the shortlist for POTY.

Ibe + Suso : Both really stepping up. Ibe, in particular, is impressing me with his fearless attitude. Suso is showing that his time at Almeria has served him well -- that flick was delightful.

Can : He is going to be our ""Coutinho"" or ""Sturridge"" purchase this season. Shit, we got him for 10M?? Strong, intelligent, and technically very good. He needs to work on his decision making, and is still feeling his way around the team, but he is bedding in *fast*. I expect him to mount a challenge on Henderson's spot this season.

2. 
Montero- He's quick and he's good on the ball.  His crosses to Bony and    Gomis will be lethal.

Sigurdsson- He's capable of doing great things, if he can find consistency as a starting player he'll be amazing.  He'll also be our man for set pieces this season.

Bony-  This is an obvious inclusion.  With Gylfi and Shelvey in support, and Gomis alongside him, Wilfried could have an even better season than the last.  Question is, will he still be here?

In all likelihood, it'll be Cant-Find-Username's lineup.

true,EleventhHourGhost,k9,K-9,"I think there was a thread somewhere that tried to piece the history of the Daleks together - to explain why the Doctor seems to hardly know them at all when he first encounters them, but then they grow to be the main threat of the universe.

Obviously, the external reason is that they weren't meant to grow that much at all.  They were supposed to be one shot monsters-of-the-week in a show that focused on history and science... but they were too good, too unique. Dalekmainia hit and changed the show forever.

But in-universe, it can be supposed that it is possible that the Doctor *didn't* know them when he first encountered them, but that encounter and further encounters changed their development ^(see, this is why we have the Prime Directive, people!) as they discovered that Time Lords existed, and time travel was possible. The Daleks started working on getting that tech for themselves.  The Time Lords considered this a threat to their power, and now we're off to the races with a fully fledged **cold time war**. 

Little attacks here, little changes to the past there... suddenly a race that had a natural development has a history that seems to be made like a patchwork quilt.  Is Davros the ""creator"" of all Daleks?  Not originally, but he might have been in one timeline and not another. The Daleks discover early on that the Time Lords seem unable stomach actual genocide, even if it happens so early in a race's history that it means they never existed, and they use this knowledge to their advantage, hiding information so far back in their past, or in ways that the Time Lords don't see...

Eventually, it escalates. Sometime ^(which is a difficult concept in this conversation) around the end of the Doctor's eighth body, the war has gone from cold to hot, as outright hostilities have begun.  Battle Tardises, Time Loops, Abominations, all of this and more. During the years of the War Doctor, the Time Lords have found themselves outmatched, as they try to use everything at their power, but the Daleks have outmaneuvered them at each instance.  Their histories have become entwined, and it is impossible to alter one without affecting the other.  All that is left is The Moment - the only way to take out the Daleks is to take out themselves as well.

I think there was a paragraph or two about what this would look like from far enough away in Walking To Babylon, a Bernice Summerfield New Adventures novel, that manages to talk about a potential Time War in the Whoniverse without actually mentioning the Time Lords by name.^(Copyright issues)  For the life of me, I can't find it online - anyone got it on hand to quote it for me?

I was in Whitehall in one of the main departments and it was high-pressure, underfunded and unpleasant. In many ways I think they have it worse because the pressure is very much full-on: it was very much a ""I can't leave until my boss leaves or it'll bite me in my performance review, and he doesn't leave until 8pm"" kind of place

It used to be the case that the employment perks made up for the low salaries but actually I've never done a full-time job with as lousy conditions as the modern Service. The worst is that the people who've been in for years have their own, older T&amp;Cs - so they're cracking jokes like ""well you wouldn't join the Civil Service if you were in it for the money!"" while sitting on their 40 days' holiday and lovely pensions. Meanwhile everyone who's come in recently is on low pay, terrible holiday allowances and has almost zero chances of promotion unless they're on the Fast Stream (and even then, good luck with that)

(Here's an idea, when your 'better off in work' calculation, done when you sign off from JSA clearly demonstrates that you're NOT going to be better off in work, how about not stripping away all benefits quite so harshly so that there's some financial incentive to take a job?)

In the end the job was actually even more stressful, as it was dealing with calls from people in medical distress, and I had to leave due to panic attacks at work. 

Didn't stop them using it as proof I was fit for work, and using it to stop backdating my benefits claim.

All because I attempted to work instead of quietly sitting on welfare.

Fortunately after that my JSA advisor himself advised me to claim ESA again, and after appeals I was accepted, and advised I would be re-assessed in three months.  Three weeks later the assessment form comes thru from ATOS again.  The thought process obviously being after years of mental illness, it might just have gone away in three weeks and I needed putting thru the wringer again, in case I was magically cured, but faking it to enjoy the luxury of living on benefits.

&gt;

&gt;The __Starry Plough__ banner ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *An Camchéachta*) was originally used by the [Irish Citizen Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Citizen_Army), a socialist, Republican movement. [James Connolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Connolly), co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with [Jack White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White_(trade_unionist\)), said the significance of the banner was that a free [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) would control its own destiny from the [plough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough) to the stars.

&gt;The original Starry plough was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 [Easter Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising). The flag depicts the [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) of [Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major), known as *The Plough* in Ireland and Britain, or in the US, the *[Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper)*, one of the most prominent features of the night sky over the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere) throughout the year.

&gt;While similar to the state [flag of Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Alaska), it predates Alaska's by more than a decade.

Interesting idea, again I don't think it belongs on this list. It's just fan speculation.

""What caused the Time War?""

8th Doctor Audio Adventures have a lot of this.

""What happened after the War Doctor's time but before Rose?""

The Doctor regenerated into 9 and then basically went straight into the rose story. We see him notice his new face for the first time.

""Why does Rory let a child like the Doctor boss him around?""

That's just stupid.

Yes

Because of the reasons the episode made very clear?

Wibbly wobbly timey wimey. It's explaining science that isn't real, what do you expect?

""Is Peter Capaldi playing The Doctor in 'Fires of Pompeii?""

No. That would be stupid.

""What happened to the Reapers?""

Different paradoxes have different consequences.

2) It's a big universe.  Just because the show mentions something exists doesn't mean we'll always see it.  And as for the Time Lords not being as smart as they ought to be, the show has actually acknowledged before that they are prone to making messes of things.

3) It was already established that the Doctor didn't get seriously involved in the Time War until he was the War Doctor.  Just because Seven initiated it doesn't mean that he had to immediately go fight in it.

4) Just because the show hints at the existence of a mysterious person doesn't mean that that person needs to turn up as a character later.  We might find out who, we might not, but the writers have no obligation to tell us.  Me, I like the idea of a former companion having done it.

5) We know that Nine directly followed War because we caught a brief glimpse of Nine's face in the regeneration.  As far as the time between then and when he met Rose goes, the show has never shown us everything.

6) A typical instance of the writers overlooking things.  Stuff like that happens fairly often on Doctor Who.

7) Yes, One is the first.  This has been confirmed several times.  We are left to assume that those other faces were actually the faces of Morbius' various incarnations.

8) He didn't save them because Moffat didn't want him to.  It's annoying when they have to resort to ""Because the writers said so"" but it's what happened here.

10) Jenny is out there somewhere.  Just because she was in one episode doesn't mean she needs to be in another.  She might return at some point, or she might not.  The writers aren't obligated to choose one or the other.

11) This show likes to reuse actors.  Capaldi is just the most recent example.

12) There's no real answer for this.  Generally RTD was able to construct his paradoxes so the Reapers didn't have to show up, but Moffat seems to have forgotten about them.

13) Presumably other villains don't know how to do it since the only example of it occurred during a year that was erased from history.  Besides, having this technology might make the villains too powerful for the Doctor to defeat them so the writers are probably avoiding it.

14) Time Lords don't need to be dying to regenerate.  Romana got bored of her body so she changed it.  The reason she tested out so many bodies is because of the same reason that Ten was able to grow a new hand.  And yes, the reason the Doctor seems to have so little control over how his regenerations turn out is because of his ineptitude.

15) Self mutilation for the sake of future self preservation probably hasn't occurred to the Doctor.  That's just a guess, though.",0,1407035220,null,0,false,0,cjfe3yl,t3_2cg4a7,t1_cjfe3yl,t3_2cg4a7,null,1435040533,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,jimmithy,null,null,"1. I think we should be aiming for 10th to 8th. I think the top 7 are maybe just out of reach(but we could take points from them), but we are the more stable of the mid table teams. 

2. Siggy - Attacking midfielder who scores goals and is more reliable on set pieces.

Gomis - can't help but think someone will come in for Bony, but regardless he'll have to lead the line during the winter period (African Cup of Nations). Fortunately those fixtures should be some of our easier ones and he should get at least 8 goals.

Shelvey - he had flashes of brilliance last season but I can't help but think having someone like Ki next to him will really let him shine and this could be a breakout season for him. Bold prediction: I'll go as far as to say that the papers make references to him filling in Gerrard's vacant England spot mid season. 

3. Formation - Difficult one.

Fabianski is starting in goal.

RB: Rangel unless we get another signing.

CB: Williams

CB: Chico or Bartley/Amat

LB: Taylor

CDM: Ki and Shelvey


Things get a bit funny with the forwards, and I think it depends if we play both Bony and Gomis.


One forward:

RM: Dyer or Routledge

CAM: Siggy/Shelvey

LM: Routledge/Montero/New Signing

ST: Bony/Gomis


Two forwards:

LAM: Siggy

RAM: Montero/Routledge

CF: Bony

ST: Gomis

I don't know if you've already read that thread, but that has some pretty good lineups.  

I think Gomis would only start in a two striker formation.  I'd love to see Bony drop into the 10 spot in a one striker formation so that we could play them both in our usual 4-2-3-1, but the likelihood of that happening is slim.  He'll start a lot of matches in January and February, when Bony is playing in the African Cup of Nations, but will see fewer starts the rest of the season.  I think it'll be interesting to see how Garry utilizes our current team.  We only have two capable wide backs, and four capable centre backs.  We might be able to see a 3-2-3-2 that includes all of our star attacking players.  However, early in the season, I think we'll see Gomis coming off of the bench in the majority of our matches.",0,1407043058,null,0,false,0,cjfh24s,t3_2chank,t1_cjfh24s,t3_2chank,null,1435042128,2,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,2

The problem for pubs these days is that have priced themselves out of the game.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Okay. He's not that slow. He has a good burst but not the best top speed. Top speed doesn't mean shit when u can't control the ball, which suso certainly can. He's got great close control and a good first touch.

In the academy he was never used on the wing from what I saw. He was always more central and deeper. His best asset is his passing range and vision, which is probably only second to gerrard and maybe coutinho on the squad. It's not his fault he's been used on the right where he pretty much has never played all his career. But he's talented enough to do it and still show some hope that he can score goals.

So you're whole thing about him not being versatile is completely unfounded. He could play either wing, at cm and at cam.

He has the talent but we all know Rodgers loves pace on the wings so he might not see suso as a fit. He probably doesn't trust his physicality to play at cm either. He however has shown flashes of real strength and balance and the dude is not easily knocked off the ball. His defensive side of the game needs work, but he has ability on the offensive end you can't teach. He has shown he is willing to put in the work, he just needs polish.

I'm not sure England best suits his game but the kid is only 20 and was one of the best players on a (crappy) la liga team. Pretty sure he led la liga in assists for a while too. 

He needs to work on a few things but he needs playing time. I'd think he might gets loan again, I just hope it's to a epl or championship team.",0,1407050144,null,0,false,0,cjfj5ju,t3_2chbod,t1_cjfj5ju,t3_2chbod,null,1435043156,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

If this man is greedy enough to avoid train fares despite being in the richest 1% of the population, what other criminal activities is he up to? Do you think he's morally opposed to committing fraud or money laundering? What has he been authorizing his minions to do that we don't know about?

Fascism has common themes with both sides of the spectrum. It is very communitarian in nature, and entirely central planned, which are both policies socialists favour. However it is also hierarchical and nationlistic, which tend to be right wing traits.

&gt;Certainly all the best real world examples of eugenics programmes come from the right. It ties in quite nicely with their soft spot for theories of racial superiority. 

Check the history again. Racism and eugenics were very popular on the left in the early 20th century, winning support from people like George Bernard Shaw, founder of the New Statesman. The swing to nurture theories came after WW2, partly because of reaction to Nazism.

&gt;The biggest humanitarian disaster of the 20th century was the Second World War, started by a right winger with a eugenics program

See above for the refutation. It was called National Socialism for a reason.

""If you believe politicians are useless, you'll end up with useless
politicians.""

A stupid statement. My belief doesn't effect their usefulness or the choices they make.

""We want our politicians to look stupid, incompetent, corrupt and adulterous.""

The whole articles premise that we somehow enjoy corrupt imbeciles running the country is absurd. We obviously want respectable, capable and honest politicians who truly reflect the citizens they work for and make life better for all. Please show me that PM candidate, because i must have missed him? And even if he existed, lets not pretend he would ever get elected...

""I stopped wondering how many thousandths of a foreign CEO’s opinion my own vote was worth and felt a rush of new ideas and fresh thinking.""

So, based solely on his ""charisma"" he decided to completely ignore the futility of his vote and instead adopted a naive denial of the truth and began believing that this one conversation with nick clegg could make a difference?

""So, in an age where it’s fashionable to be utterly cynical about politicians, I think that perhaps we should start giving them the benefit of the doubt again.""

It hasn't become fashionable. It isn't simply the new ""winter collection"" of politics. It is a direct result of their actions and corruption. People are cynical and skeptical because they have been given no reason to be otherwise. Bedroom tax, tuition fees, expenses scandal, the current attempt to privatise of the NHS, GCHQ/Prism, a fucking hidden pedophile group. And *now* you want to start giving them the benefit of the doubt?

In the end, while they get to finish their political careers and eventually get hired by the corporate friends they have made, landing cushy high paid jobs and escaping all accountability of their actions, we will be left with the same cycle of lying silver spoon charlatans.

was a bit put off by the £3 cover charge but with a few drinks in me and hungry i paid it.
i was quite impressed.
the building was amazing , i was blown away by the bank vault so the £3 in was already justified and i got over it. plus the drink was cheap and we got a massive feed for a tenner
other than that there wasnt much to it , few food vans and a bar and a few different rooms and spaces to sit around in.
i spoke with a few of the people working and it seems it is their first time doing something like this and i thought their ethos and energy was all good. nice people and a nice idea.
im not really sure if it will be back though , i think there needed to be more to appeal to a wider audience , maybe some live music or something.

all in all i was happy that i went and its nice to see people try to do something different but i wouldnt be rushing back today i suppose.

also did notice a lot of bouncer types eating continually but didnt find them aggressive or anything , they were helpful in directing us about.

the idea is a good one , local food and local drink and a nice space to hang out in but they need to change a few things , laverys and diageo arent small traders! maybe ditch the cover charge and add something , maybe some local musicians.

People may say that Musacchio is small for a CB but considering Poch himself was a small CB i have the confidence that he would know what is needed to overcome size limitations and still be successful and could identify if he has those traits or not. Mussachio reads the game exceptionally well, moves well, is good with the ball at his feet and is only 23 years old if we could get him at say ~£18m i would be very happy with the signing.

After Mussachio, i would genuinely love to land Schneiderlin but at £27m it really may a case where the price tag pushes us out of the market.

It should be immediately obvious that Britain played a far more significant role in ending slavery than the US did. While the US was making slavery illegal on a state by state basis, it had been outlawed in England for centuries already. And while the US was discussing this stuff, Britain was busy paying off Portugal and Spain, enforcing the ban on slave trading and forcing everyone into anti-slavery treaties. Britain used its superpower status to end slavery while the US was still arguing and fighting themselves over it.

&gt; *The shameful tale of Diego Garcia began in 1961, when it was marked out by the US military as a crucial geopolitical base. Ignoring the fact that 2,000 people already lived there, and that the island –- a British colony since the fall of Napoleon –- had been settled in the late 18th century by French coconut planters, who shipped in African- and Indian-born labourers from Mauritius, establishing what John Pilger called “a gentle Creole nation with thriving villages, a school, a hospital, a church, a prison, a railway, docks, a copra plantation,” the Labour government of Harold Wilson conspired with the administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon to “sweep” and “sanitize” the islands (the words come from American documents that were later declassified).*

&gt; *Although many islanders traced their ancestry back five generations, a British Foreign Office official wrote in 1966 that the government’s aim was “to convert all the existing residents … into short-term, temporary residents,” so that they could be exiled to Mauritius. Having removed the “Tarzans or Men Fridays,” as another British memo described the inhabitants, the British effectively ceded control of the islands to the Americans, who established a base on Diego Garcia, which, over the years, has become known as “Camp Justice,” complete with “over 2,000 troops, anchorage for 30 warships, a nuclear dump, a satellite spy station, shopping malls, bars and a golf course.” So thoroughly were the islands cleared –- and so stealthy the procedure –- that in the 1970s the British Ministry of Defence had the effrontery to insist, “There is nothing in our files about a population and an evacuation.”*

The local buses are ""Lothian Buses"" and cost £1.50 for a single any distance on a single bus, or £3.50 for a day ticket which allows unlimited buses until about midnight, when it switches to the night bus service. You might want to look at their website and see if there are 1-week passes or something, and take a look at the various bus routes to familiarise yourself with any bus numbers you're interested in.

There is also Edinburgh Zoo, although the pandas will be hit or miss just now because their indoor enclosure is closed off while the female panda might be pregnant. If they are in their outdoor enclosure you can see them though.

true,cxsmith,null,null,"And? As I stated, I was referring to the US, and the ending of slavery *in the US*. I've not denied that Britain played a substantial role in ending transatlantic and worldwide slavery, because that would be a ridiculous thing for me to do.

In terms of the significance of slavery for the UK - and why its abolition in the US was therefore of international importance - [this is a good start:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#European_competition)

""As Britain rose in naval power and settled continental North America and some islands of the West Indies, they became the leading slave traders.[89] At one stage the trade was the monopoly of the Royal Africa Company, operating out of London. But, following the loss of the company's monopoly in 1689,[90] Bristol and Liverpool merchants became increasingly involved in the trade.[91] By the late 17th century, one out of every four ships that left Liverpool harbour was a slave trading ship.[92] Much of the wealth on which the city of Manchester, and surrounding towns, was built in the late eighteenth century, and for much of the nineteenth century, was based on the processing of slave-picked cotton and manufacture of cloth.[93] Other British cities also profited from the slave trade. Birmingham, the largest gun-producing town in Britain at the time, supplied guns to be traded for slaves.[citation needed] 75% of all sugar produced in the plantations was sent to London, and much of it was consumed in the highly lucrative coffee houses there.[92]""

[And this](http://www.mylearning.org/bitter-sweet-history---aspects-of-the--british-slave-trade-/p-1496/)

""Britain emerged as the most productive cotton manufacturing base in the world, and by the middle of the 19th century the cotton industry dominated the British economy. Hundreds of mills, many of them in Lancashire, produced huge quantities of cotton cloth to be sold at home and exported all over the world.
 
Huge supplies of raw cotton were needed to feed this lucrative market. Most of the cotton came from North American cotton plantations, where slave labour was used until the end of the American civil war in 1865.
 
Cotton was a labour-intensive crop, and at the height of the plantation system in the 1850s, nearly three-quarters of the slaves in the United States, over one-and-a-half-million were involved in cotton production. Between 1825 and 1870 raw cotton was Britain’s largest import.
 
Even though the slave trade was abolished in 1807, the products and profits of slavery were to continue for another 60 years.""

As I've now said at least twice, if people don't want to learn about American history in their own time, I couldn't really care less. However, I think it's totally inaccurate for people - and I'm not directing this statement at any specific people - to deny that some US history relates to internationally significant events. I hardly think that can be denied when you consider events in the Middle East over the last decade, or the Cold War, or the Second World War. I therefore think it would be a good idea for *some* American history to be taught in schools in order than schoolchildren have a better understanding of why and how the world came to be the way it is.

Mankind has expanded to the stars, but only through the sufferance of the Shoal, a race that has an (apparent) monopoly on FTL technology and refuses to share it with anyone else. The Shoal use moon-sized ships to transport the galaxy's residents from one star to the next, but place strict limits on which races can visit which planets. The Shoal have effectively partitioned the galaxy in accordance with their own plans.

So when a human survey team finds an ancient spaceship with an FTL drive at the bottom of the ocean of an uninhabited planet, they mount a secret mission to recover the ship without the Shoal observing them.

The novels have elements of both cyberpunk and planet-hopping adventure - check them out.

true,ChaBeezy,english,Cheshire,"&gt; And yeah. I've seen plenty in my own area and elsewhere to KNOW that no, the job market is not improving. What is happening is more people are being FORCED into extended work experience programmes, zero hour contracts and training courses. This way they get to fudge the stats and make it look like unemployment rates are going down. It's bullshit.

Sorry, but your real world advice (whilst attempting to play to the crowd on /r/uk) is complete bollocks. 


What if I told you people on zero hour contracts are typically happier than people in full time employment? [it turns out that, despite all the media bullshit about them; zero hour contracts are really great for alot of people](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25098984). I know that doesn't line up with your real world attitude so sorry to upset your misconception. 


As for your other stats about the job market not improving, they are all completely wrong. The work experience program has no effect on the rising number of employment in this country. 


If you think good real world advice to an 18 year old is move to America, I think that says all we need to know about it.

true,Popeychops,lfc99,,"You're judging this differently to me. I'm not assessing Can based on how good he is at playing Stevie's game: I'm considering his own game, and how that fits into our system. I'm sure there are things that Can doesn't have that the perfect DM for our system would, but as you said, he can learn and may acquire those in the future.

I honestly think Stevie gets a lot more credit for (1) than he deserves. While he's been a tremendous servant for the club, we have to be realistic and accept that he is one of the many weaknesses we have in defence. In particular, it's his inability to keep up with the pace for 90 minutes, which Can will obviously be able to cope with better. 

I also think Can does (2) comparably to Gerrard, as I described with his interchangeability. His youth and versatility give him the ability to join the midfield and swap positions further up the pitch: time will tell to consider how good he is going to be at that.

And (3)... Stevie's Hollywood passes are the best in the business. It would be embarrassing for a lesser player to even attempt to include that as a serious part of their game. It wouldn't be a wise thing to try to seriously include, since whenever it doesn't come off it's ""hitting in hope"".

It is only that Pep wants a different type of full back with a 3 man back line. Pierre usually played in the midfield prior to the cup final for Bayern, Bayern 2 and the Danish National team (well in the 1 cap he had for them). 

And Rummenigge casually mentioned in [an interview](http://www.fcbayern.de/en/news/news/2014/rummenigge-interview-part-1-220514.php) that Guardiola thinks that Rode can play as a full back, too. 

So it pretty much looks that both of them will compete for the same spots at Bayern. At least in my opinion. Rode did perform a bit better in the friendlies so far, but Höjbjerg is undoubtedly the bigger talent. Though that doesn't mean he will play more than Rode. Time will tell, but I think the Dane was the reason Bayern didn't try harder to get Can back.

If you end up ""picking a club"" for the reasons and terms you've outlined, you'll never really get into it.

Put it this way, I'm in the middle of America, and I wake up at 6 am to read Welsh newspapers online. That's a problem. A good problem. I freaking love Swansea City. I'm in the damn supporters trust and I barely receive info about it.

I don't care if our Swans drop down 2 leagues, I'll be watching/listening/reading. That's the way it goes. You're not in it for ""champions league"" moments only--you're in it for the shit, too. And there's shit ahead.

Swans play beautiful football (usually). We can pass all around the field to the point where we forget to score.

The club that probably fits the mold you're seeking (and the supporters, too) is Everton. Great club, great manager. Give them a look.

This info was then stored on a central Halfords database (for warranty service, and also so we could send out spam to them and get them to buy more shit).

true,mattysimp,null,null,"* I think Jovetic will be second behind Aguero this year and will start the majority of our games this year as long as he stays fit. Third striker will be dzeko then negredo as long as they all stay which is very likely.
* I personally don't think Guidetti will ever be a first team player for us so I think we might as well sell him this year.
* I think Iheanacho will get an odd cup game for us but thats about it. He looks very promising but he's not on a good enough level yet.
* Zuclini had a good preseason and I can see him getting a good few games but he won't be much of a starter.
* For new signings Fernando looks like a very good defensive mid and he will fight for a starting place with yaya and fernandinho. Lampard will be pretty much only there for training purposes and will get only a few games. Sagna will be similar but will get a few games when Zabaleta needs a rest. Willy will be the Cup keeper with a few games in the league if Hart declines. Zuclini and Iheanacho I've already talked about.
* I think Navas will be played more this year but he won't be a main starter. I think when he plays he will play well but won't be talked about much.
* Our back line will be very solid especially when Mangala goes through. Rekik also looks very promising but I don't think he will get much play time if any. I don't think Boyata will ever get to first team quality and probably should be sold as soon as we don't need the HGness of him.
* Tactics and team selection are very hard to comment on since preseason is very experimental and we'll see how we really play at the start of the season.

Can play AML, AMC, AMR. Seems to be more played as a AMC at Hoffenheim, but when played as a FWL, or ''Forward Wing Left'' in 3 games he got 2 goals. He's versatile, skillful, and a goal and assist threat. This is what I don't see from Chadli, Townsend or Lennon and why I see that front 3 fluid attacking set up with Lamela and Eriksen NEEDS that last piece of the Puzzle. Depay would work too, because he's very direct, young, and a goalscorer off the wings. Again, which Townsend, Chadli or Lennon aren't. 

Draxler would be ideal, but the brigade is out saying that move is very unlikely (Holtby made the move though, and was their number 10) so I'm still holding onto that *just*, especially as he's jewish you know...and we're Tottenham.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"You can't read too much into preseason, it's important to remind yourself of this every time the hype bandwagon gets rolling for one particular club.

United will be improved on last season (how could they not?), but I doubt they will challenge for the title, the likelihood is that they'll be fighting for a top four finish.

There are still some glaring weaknesses in that team, at centre half and centre midfield for example, they also lack a quality wide player.

Van Gaal is a top manager, but he isn't a magician.

At this stage the best they can hope to achieve is a top four finish, and they'll be outsiders to do it IMO.

If they sign a top centre half and a genuinely world class centre mid like Vidal, then they would, IMO, be favourites to finish fourth ahead of Liverpool or Arsenal.

Regardless of who they sign, they won't threaten for the title. They might flatter to deceive briefly, but they won't pose a threat to the last day.

Our main rivals in the defence of the title will be Chelsea, possibly even Arsenal depending on the impact Sanchez has and Ramsey's form and fitness. Can't see Liverpool challenging given they've lost Suarez and now have Champions League football to contend with also, haven't been too impressed by their signings either. I think Liverpool look the most vulnerable to drop out of the top four.

Ultimately though I think the title will be a two horse race between us and Chelsea.

She is taught by the same people teaching the masters &amp; I have met several people on it. Programming is not essential to all workplaces no, but a basic understanding of how exploitation techniques work is the foundation for everything higher. Usually that is best demonstrated in a lab like scenario - which requires code. Not everything (Human centered security for example) but considering on the undergrad courses anyway they don't specialise until final years it still should be getting taught. Courses like these get you into the masters, and you have already mentioned these are skills people are supposed to already have.

When I speak to someone that's taken a Network Security module (at masters level) and they don't even know the basics of TCP/IP let alone SSL it leaves you wondering what they have learnt. Being told DoS is when someone with a botnet sends millions of requests to a server, so you bring up ICMP and they are clueless...
They can tell you modern security is public-private key, hell, maybe the names of a couple of algorithms but know nothing about how they actually work.

I know a lot of people in the security field. I have worked in it (and in some ways still do).

Saying all of this on reflection I expect the sponsored courses are actually more aimed at analysts who will be sitting infront of software made by SAS and Palantir all day.
In which case I still object on the basis this should be taught quickly on the job, not through government funding of pointless courses.

And his wages aren't extremely high from what I've read, but I could be wrong. I mean, if the reason as to why we wouldn't get Draxler is based on the fact that we probably wouldn't be able to make any other moderate to big signings, I can completely agree with that.

I think after our new stadium is built (around 2018) you will see an increase in spending on bigger name players.

true,tomasnz,flair8,,"For General Podcast the two I have listened to are the Football Ramble and the Guardian weekly. The problem with both is that neither of the casts have any regulars that really care about spurs, so the reporting on the spurs side is often by people who didn't watch the games/only read the match reports/OR just don't care that much about the spurs issues so gloss over them and move on quickly. This isn't really a criticism it is just how it is for those two.

So my recommendation is pick a general one, and then pick a spurs specific one (assuming you don't have unlimited time to listen to podcasts).

Below is a BRIEF review/flavour of the 2 general ones I have tried and the 3 spurs ones that I have/do listen to regularly.

Guardian Football Weekly - hugely comprehensive, down to the point it does 2/week when there are cup games/european football, good range of presenters, all professional journalist, very good overview of european football included. Polished and Professional.

The Football Ramble - more consistent crew, so more recurring themes/jokes and also a bit less formal, interesting/funny quiz games at the front and back ends, Focus on english league and gives overview of the Championship, League 1, and League 2 (and sometimes the conference). a small flaw is that one of the crew is a Gooner so it means that spurs good news is very really brought up, or again brushed over quickly.

Spurscasts. Each of the ones below do a review of the last weekend's game and a look-a-head to the next (cup or weekend), so my summaries will be about focus/attitude/demographic/interests.

The Spurs Show with Phil Cornwell - Old school spurs fans, rotating cast of guests with Phil (used to be) as host and another guy who sometimes covers/d for Phil. because the guests can be quite traditional fans there are some interesting views you can hear that aren't often in the mainstream new media. Focus on the ideas and history of the club and what makes it spurs and what that means. each ep opens with a parody 'interview' with the manager of THFC.
DISCLAIMER: This was the first spurscast I listened to, and it is one that I no longer listen to. I stopped because I didn't have time to listen to three each week.

The Fighting Cock - these are the ""Fans"". 1 main host and then 2 super regulars and then a rotating cast of characters (5-6 total). These guys love/hate spurs and Spurs are a big part of their lives. They give a great view of what it is like to be a frontline Spurs supporter (well one part of the frontline anyway), and are involved in the 1882 movement. They have a great focus on the youth team, with Windy doing a roundup of youth teams/players every week, and they plug and go to the U21s games when they can. Fun podcast with lots of divergent opinions. 

(my Fav) Wheeler Dealer Radio - podcast american spurs site the Cartilage Free Captain. These are generally 'newish' fans of tottenham hotspur, and generally they made a decision at some point to support spurs rather than being born to a spurs dad/family. They are interested in the tactics, and the squad, and maybe sometimes take a moneyball style view. Good banter between the two main hosts and they usually have a guest from the writing staff of CFC. Michael Caley contributes to this spurscast if you are at all interested in football stats and what they might mean. 
potential issue: lots my english mates won't even try a football podcast hosted by americans

true,hellohighwater,num11,,"Okay Baz. Let's be realistic. Players don't get sold because of a lack of production, eg. because they haven't scored a set number of goals at one particular point in time.  Players get sold for mainly 1 of two reasons. Those two are business, and because the player is unhappy/unsettled and for the benefit of both parties is removed. Now, obviously within the branch of Business reasons that calculations of the player's value are important, and of course their on field performance has huge effects on their value. So scoring a lot of goals can increase value, as much as not scoring can decrease. In order to sell, you need someone to buy. If Soldado scores 10 goals by January, in my opinion there is a much higher chance that there will be a club or two, or three, that are sending at least an enquiry to Spurs asking of his availability. If he does not score, and fails to produce much more than a bloke running around on some grass somewhere north of london, then please tell me how high his value is going to be, monetarily, and how much sense it would make to sell a bloke for lets say £5m, after we have invested nearly £30m on him. That is terrible business, and Spurs would be much more likely to try other avenues, aka giving him a break from the team to perhaps work on his mental strength if that is deemed to be the problem, or other similar techniques to try to get him to the level that he demonstrated whilst at Valencia. Now if there were some magical way we could force a team to pay upwards of £17-20m on him, then by all means sell him, because in the business sense it could be easily explained as a high risk high reward investment that we didnt completely win on. Every business has those, and to be honest, £7-10m lost on a business decision in a multi million pound business is not the end of the world. Obviously there are far greater ins and outs in terms of the business of the football club, and of course i can understand why perhaps you are frustrated with Soldado (it's hard to tell based on your pathetic sentence structure), but my point is that a player does not get sold for a reasonable amount of money (for either a loss or gain) at the click of Levy's fingers. If a player cannot be sold at a reasonable price that makes sense towards the business then he wont be, unless there are other variables, such as dressing room/training ground disruption, or general unrest between the player and club/city/country.

Also assuming we did in fact sell Soldado, we would need to purchase someone to replace him, and again there is no guarantee's that the replacement would provide greater production to the club than whatever Soldado has brought. At this point its about the amount of money the club has to risk, again, to replace what was faulty, rather than perhaps spending the time to try to mend the faults, instead.


oh, and btw; in the 2012-13 season, by the end of January, Soldado had scored 16 goals for Valencia. So obviously Soldado has the ability to do something 'akin' to that. ",0,1407079966,null,0,false,0,cjfq1sp,t3_2chxaq,t1_cjfq1sp,t1_cjfp6m0,null,1435046647,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Obviously you can view ideologies as a sliding scale, but those things that you mention are socialist can also be viewed as liberal. Keynes put forward state spending on infrastructure in this country and he was ultimately a liberal, not socialist. The welfare state was put forward by Beveridge, again a prominent liberal. This is because the state becomes an enabler and allows their citizens more freedom to achieve what they want to, it is not necessarily to improve equality of outcome, but to improve equality of opportunity, a liberal cause. I prefer to view those state actions as progressive liberalism, as they can't then be mixed up with what went on in the USSR and other former socialist states.

true,gone_full_tard,null,null,"Warning!!! Loooong comment. I apologize. I can never write a two sentence comment. I also wanted try and explain my reasons or how I justify my side of this. I hope I did a good enough job but please, if you have questions or want to put in some more scenarios, by all means. I appreciate you taking the time to have a discussion about this topic. It is one that I think about all the time. Im not the typical ""l luv gunz!"" type person. As a guy, yeah they can be cool. As a father and a husband, I just want my family to live in peace and be safe. I apologize for any spelling or grammer errors. I am writing this on my cell phone while trying to get ready to go somewhere and running a little late, but I think this topic is important, to me at least. 

I think there is a huge difference in the mentality of potential victims between England and Texas (probably all of the states but we are very much more pro gun then most states). And from what I'm gathering from these conversations, the reason is there is a huge difference in the mentality of the criminals. I know that probably sounds ubsurd but if you think about it, if both cultures have a different veiwpoint about how one should live their life or how we should treat others, conduct ourselves in public, etc then the criminals would have different mindsets of what they are willing to do and not do. Now, I'm talking as a whole. America and England have a lot in common but we are very different in enough ways that sets us apart. People even comment on how I am different or my views are different then most americans, because of the influences of school when I lived there and from my mom. Btw, I'm actually half English and half American. I was born there but on an American military base. My mom is English and dad is American. I think i mentioned that at one time but can't remember. obviously England has violent criminals. I just think we have, percentage wise, way more who are willing to do even more violent crimes. 
The main reason a criminal shoot would shoot their victims is because they don't wabt to get caught and go to prison. Any victims left alive are now witnesses. I know if they murder and are caught it is a much more serious crime, but they aren't planning to get caught. Also, I hate to say it but I don't think they value human life. They almost get off on assaulting  someone or killing them. They really don't give a shit about me or you. There was a guy who bragged about shooting a woman in her face right in front of her little boy. In some gangs over here its like a badge of honor to kill. We also have to deal with the cartels from Mexico, and I don't give a shit what our lying ass government and the media they have in their pockets say, the cartels are already living and operating in the U.S. I grew up in El Paso, Texas which is a border town. It is literally on the border. You can stand in El Paso and Juarez, Mexico at the same time. Death really means nothing to them. Tgey see it as a chore. On a list is laundry, take out the trash, dust, go kill an entire family because they didnt pay us not to, sweep, mop....

And you are talking about them killing me. What about if I'm not home and it's just my wife and daughter? If they kick in the front door and have knives they would be able to do whatever they want with them and its probably over 80% chance it would be rape and assault. They originally broke in to steal some shit but now there is a pretty woman right there so... now, same scenario but in our current situation. My wife knows how to shoot. They break in weilding a knife and come towards her and my daughter. She grabs a gun, engages the laser, and they are probably hauling ass to get out. my mentality is hopefully she still shoots both of them. Why? Because now she has seen them. She can pick them out in a line up. They obviously know where we live. Who is to say they wont want to make sure no one can ever point then out in a line up or testify against them. They can follow her when she leaves the house or wait until she comes home in the evening and no one else is home. Does this happen every day? Pretty much. I know an ex boss this hapoen3d to while he was at work. His wife and daughter would normally have been home but luckily they webt to a dr appointment or something. The guys had knives and baseball bats. Did this in the middle of the day. They started stealing stuff and the neighbor came over with his gun and shot and wounded one and the police caught the other. One of them was wanted for rape.  My sister has been raped. I know several people that have gotten the shit kicked out of them for no reason. And all it takes is that one time. Why not try and protect my family as much as i possibly can within the law? To answer one of your questions, there woukd obviously be times you wouldnt be able to go grab a gun, but if they have one and are slowly scoping out the house and you are in a room they havent entered yet you have the upper hand of knowing your house and they don't know you are home. Does this make sense?

shit you have guys going around playing ""the knockout game"" where they run up on people and sucker punch them as hard as they can and try and knock them out. Do they hit guys their age and size? No. That person can get up and possibly whoop their ass. No, they go and sucker punch women or the elderly. There has been several deaths just because these punks think thats funny. When it comes to crime and the shit criminals do and are willing to do, it sucks. Trust me, I would rather have it like England. I really would. But its not England. I didn't make the rules, I dont even have a say in any of this, but I damn sure will make it a level pkaying field and give my family a chance to not be assaulted, raped, and murdered.",0,1407080315,null,0,false,0,cjfq6s1,t3_2cbdrv,t1_cjfq6s1,t1_cjet6xe,null,1435046727,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Players like that don't see the point in pre season, practice, whatever. But when they get into the game they go into a zone. Some guys are talented and cocky enough to be that way. Not saying it's right or wrong but that might explain why Balotelli would look disinterested in a friendly. Remember when Mancini took him out of a friendly because he tried to score some crazy behind the back goal a few years ago and Balotelli was like dude wtf this game doesn't matter

The issue with players like that is it can cause the disruption of your dressing room. A lot of players don't like playing with Balotelli and Iverson was always viewed as a ballhog who nobody wanted to play with. Think about how Carra or Ronnie Moran or a real old fashioned football man would react when they saw balo fucking around. That could cause problems and it's IMO part of the modern game that you have to realize there are characters like this out there.

Another player from American sports who I compare balo to is Manny Ramirez, who coincidentally was one of the Boston Red Sox' major signings after FSG bought them. A popular phrase that every /r/baseball subscriber will know is ""Manny being Manny."" One time Manny went out to play in the outfield with the new Oakley mp3 sunglasses on and he had his headphones in during the game. One time he opened a door in the green monster at Fenway Park and just left the field of play to go to the bathroom *while the game was going on.* So his teammates sometimes wanted to fight him especially when he would give up on plays and not take conditioning seriously. But everyone has to accept Manny being Manny because the man is by far the greatest hitter I have ever seen. 

So it becomes all about your evaluation of Balotelli. Is he Manny Ramirez/Allen Iverson or is he Ravel Morrison? It's a classic high risk high reward situation.

Personally, I would sign him and tell him if you score 25 goals a season we will leave you the fuck alone lol",0,1407080631,null,0,1407081992,0,cjfqbbc,t3_2ci5q1,t1_cjfqbbc,t1_cjfpqy2,null,1435046794,23,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,23

For me the biggest thing now is getting a competent, fluid attack. Especially with high pressing. I know it was v Celtic Reserves, but people WILL struggle with that constant pressure from our attacking mids. It was mistake after mistake yesterday, they couldnt get out their box or play the ball out of defence and if they hoof'd it - we had big guys back there waiting.

I look at it like this. CM, we're stacked. Worse comes to worse? Sandro, Capoue as DM's. CB's? Okay, we need to strengthen. But a HAPPY JAN, second season Chiriches, Dawson, Kaboul, Dier and that other young lad isn't terrible. Especially now we have Davies/Rose LB and Walker/Naughton/Fredericks popping up at RB. 

But LW? We have Townsend, who will never learn and is more a RW anyway cutting inside, and Chadli - who to me is just a lump. He's built like a Middleweight boxer. He's not the fluid technical piece of the puzzle. He seems like...stuck in quicksand, which isn't what you really want from a fluid, front 3 pressing hard like we did v Celtic (reserves). Now THAT was beautiful. I guess it depends what Poch wants - a direct, run at players goalscoring player there? imposslble Draxler or Depay are our best bets. Or a fluid player, like a Maxim, or Firmino. I consider Lamela more fluid than direct - he doesn't often ''beat his man'' running down the wing.

For me, I want Holtby as an AMC. Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela. Sure, it shoves Eriksen on the wing and he's not a direct inside forward (neither is Lamela) but I would rather that over Chadli. Plus, Holtby and Lamela had something starting to bloom in the Villa game way back. Holtby can [do things like this](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1823697/Defoe_1a.gif) and [this](http://i.minus.com/iIc9eoRnskwVz.gif). I feel he is wasted as some CM who just presses. He wasn't Schalkes no 10 for nothing - he's creative as fuck. And he fits Poch more as a AMC who presses intensely front the front than Eriksen, imo.

Depends what Poch is looking at. But I would argue if we're not playing Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela (which some people don't like and want Eriksen as the AMC), we need a LW over a CM and maybe even a CB (unless we get a great deal on someone more experienced/older).

I take your point, but I still reiterate what I said previously, I wouldn't read too much into that public utterance that there would be no further signings - even if we interpret Lampard's move differently.

Not looking for the last word, just trying to understand where you're coming from.

The main point I dispute is that there'll be no further moves because Soriano said as much publicly. We don't know his motives for saying so. Either way, things can change. At this stage we still don't know if Milner is going to sign a new contract. Only a couple of days ago Pellegrini contradicted Soriano and didn't rule out further transfers when asked about the squad.

Maybe it's just me - I'd love to hear other peoples opinions on how they feel Poch will set up. Doesn't mean he'll set up like his Southampton side either. We might go with 2 strong CM's and get Schneiderlin &amp; have him and Capoue just holding that line, with 3 technical/fluid/young AMC's running riot and our wing backs pushing on with Soldado making space.

Or, we might have Lamela - Eriksen and one really direct, Depay/Draxler/J Rod style player on the other wing. With a powerful CM and a box-to-box style CM. In which case we'd need a good LW to do that as Chadli nor Townsend nor Lennon can't.

Just depends how Poch wants to set up. Unless Cebellos does a Bentaleb and just ''plays as good as his opposition'' if you know what I mean - and tears the EPL up. ",0,1407082619,null,0,1407082848,0,cjfr4gq,t3_2chqtp,t1_cjfr4gq,t1_cjfr2ge,null,1435047115,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I hope this sheds some light into what we are doing, and how the £2m we have allegedly earnt through reaching the final is but a drop into the ocean in what we are actually trying to do.

true,marcojose,null,null,"Manchester is probably your best bet. The rents are the lowest for students in the UK, I'd recommend looking at the Manchester Student Homes website and Zoopla for flatshares.
It's fairly easy to get bar work in Manchester and the Northern Quarter has lots of book/record shops for you to look into. 

Manchester is very affordable and the student influence is very visible. Living in Fallowfield/Withington, you won't be able to walk 10 seconds down the street without students. Because of this there are lots of bars, spoons and kebab shops in fallowfield.

Fallowfield is also very close to the curry mile in Rusholme. London's got Brick Lane but it is absolutely nowhere near as brilliant as the Curry Mile! Despite being an Asian cuisine, curries are an essential part of British life!

Manchester has 3 large universities all close together (University of Manchester, Manchester Met, Uni of Salford) and then Bolton Uni not far off—still haven't met a Bolton student who liked it though! You've also got the Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester, Man Met and RNCM are all along the Oxford Road.

The Oxford Road is the busiest bus route in Europe, and Magic Bus operate £1 fare from anywhere along the 142 or 143 (where all the students live) routes straight into the city centre. There are lots of bars and cafes along the Oxford Road and the student presence is very evident.

Away from the Oxford Road is Manchester's Bohemian Quarter: The Norther n Quarter. It's full of quirky bars and interesting places. It's full of arty/hipster student types and is always fun.
The city centre itself is less student oriented, which can be a bonus. However the shopping and cultural facilities are amazing. The Arndale is great to find anything you need. You can also get the 250 bus to the Trafford Centre, which is a beautiful shopping centre.

There's also China Town: it's way more authentic than London's but considerably smaller. Essentially, where London's China Town caters to tourists and is very expensive, Manchester's caters to Chinese expats and the large numbers of Chinese students in Manchester. There's a couple of great karaoke bars in China Town too!

Manchester as a city is very well connected. There's trains and coaches to all corners of the country. Manchester airport is also the largest &amp; busiest airport outside of London. I've recently booked a flight to Berlin 2 weeks in advance and it cost me £59/€70. The buses within Manchester are well connected and cheap. Living in South Manchester (there's no student presence in North Manchester really) is best for transport. I pay £190 per year for my unirider bus pass and can take any stagecoach or magic bus bus throughout Greater Manchester.
I love studying in Manchester. The student population is around 100,000 students excluding Uni of Bolton. It's very affordable, very student oriented and has a big city feel without the anonymity of many other cities. Manchester is growing year on year and has a very modern feel. I think the architecture is wonderful and the provision of services is amazing. 

If you're not going to pick Manchester, pick a northern city. I'm a southerner and whenever I go back down south I am astounded how rude southerners are in comparison to northerners. Northerners are just lovely! Moreover the North is very affordable and contrary to the opinion of most southerners it's not grim. 

So yeah: have a look at Manchester!",0,1407083258,null,0,false,0,cjfrdt9,t3_2c2fxp,t1_cjfrdt9,t3_2c2fxp,null,1435047237,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

At the end of the day you paid to do your full CBT, not half a days worth of shit training.  My suggestion would be to email the head office of the school and voice your concerns, and request another day of CBT at no additional cost - and for them to do it properly this time. E.g. a full day of training, proper tuition..

I am sure you could put in a complaint if they are not willing and cause them some grief - they sound like cowboys.

Preferably, I would actually request a refund and go elsewhere.  Firstly, looking at the GetOn scheme. This will give you an extra hour of training at no extra cost to get that clutch control down prior to your CBT, and will also give you an idea of the school and quality of tuition prior to parting with any more cash.

Hartnell and Troughton are great, but the sets are very dated and the acting feels much more like a stage production than anything else, especially with Hartnell.  He also has the most dramatic character arc of all the Doctors, going from someone who is decidedly not the Doctor we know and love, but an old grumpy man who doesn't yet have the drive to help people.  Once his character arc gets to that point, he's fantastic.  Before then, at least his companions are fun.

Troughton is great the whole way through, but a huge amount of his episodes do not have video any more, as the master tapes were junked.

Concealers - NARS (house of Fraser, space NK, ASOS, etc) have a really nice concealer in lots of colours but its a bit expensive. A cheaper and similar alternative is the Collection 2000 concealer wand. Also MAC prolongwear concealer is beautiful and creamy and one tube lasts me about 6 months. ELF have a lovely concealer kit which I use every day. Blank Canvas Cosmetics have concealer kits too which are about £8/9.

Contour kits - NYX (some Next stores, NYX website) taupe blusher is my favourite contour colour but I'm very pale so it works for me. When I wear fake tan, I use theBalm's (superdrug, beauty bay.com) Bahama Mama bronzer. Sleek (boots, superdrug) have an actual kit which has a lovely highlighter in it too which isn't too expensive (£7/8) but I find the contour colour is a little bit too warm for me personally - I do use it but prefer one of the two above. What you want to look for in a contour colour is a cool toned, matte, no shimmer colour. Obviously the Anastasia Beverly Hills has a beautiful contour kit but its expensive and constantly sold out. A nice dupe for ABH palette is the Blank Canvas Cosmetics contour palette which is £8/9.

Brushes - I bought a Coastal Scents set from Amazon a year or two ago and replaced a few of them but still use some of them every day. Real Techniques (boots, amazon, superdrug, asda) have some lovely brushes - the expert face brush, blusher brush and contour brush in particular. Blank Canvas Cosmetics have lovely, high quality brushes too. They're an Irish brand and really good value and a middle price point. Brushes are an investment though. Mac and Sigma also have some lovely brush sets but they're much more expensive. For foundation, I would always recommend a beauty blender (Amazon, boots) or the Real Techniques sponge over a brush.

Basically, Blank Canvas Cosmetics is your best website to hit!

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Thing is, Draxler really is just as improbable as signing Reus would be.  

Yes we signed Holtby, but Holtby was in the final 6 months of his contract and had already signed a pre-contract to move to us.  Draxler is under contract until 2018, has never indicated that he is desperate for a move, he has a release clause of £37m, is on a team that is not short of money and is in the CL and is in his home country. For us.....signing Draxler really is on the same level as signing Reus, it *COULD* happen but is wildly, wildly unlikely.

As for the CB role it sounds by all accounts that Dawson will be sold, love the guy but he doesn't fit into the system.  Jan happy and in form will be massive for us, Vlad settled and adapted to the league will be a good fit for Poch's system. After those two we have Kaboul who has massive injury concerns and is very unlikely to last a long stretch with Dier who looks promising but lacks experience, Milos (see Dier), Zeki (see Dier) and then Capoue.  So really we have a CB rotation that is 2 deep and that goes on the assumption that Vlad's back injuries are settled.

We need a CB, Mussachio is very much a CB that can come in and be an immediate starter and he is still young, he absolutely fits how the defence needs to be run. As we have seen, if you press up top with a back line ill-suited to play a high line you get gashed, Jan/Mussachio/Vlad/Kaboul(when healthy) gives us a true rotation at CB that is suited to play the high line with Dier developing to take over next season for Kaboul.

I think we absolutely could get through the season with our current CMs, but if Poch wants Schneiderlin i really am all for us making that move regardless if it is a true ""need"" or not.

I think Holtby will be huge for us this year and i think the idea of Eriksen/Holtby/Lamela can be very functional for us with the 3 of them pressing and interchanging.

But as much as i would like us to get a LW the fact is that between Eriksen, Chadli (who will never be a star but can fill in across all the AM roles and be very serviceable) and Townsend (who came up through the ranks as a LW and then moved to RW on loan at QPR and with us under AVB) we certainly have enough coverage to get us through to January or later if need be.

I am by no means a football tactician, so I cannot offer insight tactically as to where things were wrong sadly, but here are my thoughts:

Matic was good, as he literally always is.

Hazard even off the pace is still a very good player and he needs to be on the ball as much as possible.

Drogba, whilst still clearly has a place in the team, is sadly not the player he once was.

Torres needs to just fucking leave!

Costa whilst still good, struggled a bit more with a well organised defence.

Cesc was unsurprisingly one of the best players on the pitch again, but he didn't have a lot to work with.

Salah isn't really ready for much more than a token role this year.

Well most of that is down to conflict in the middle east region, which is not a direct result of Islam (Case in point, the US brought war to the region when they invaded Iraq in 2003 which was obviously very disruptive for knowledge production). I think it's unfair to judge a country on their contribution when in the midst of a long drawn out conflict, just as you can't fairly judge the contribution of say France or Poland (Or other occupied countries) during World War II.

Stable Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE make very strong contibutions in these areas. Saudi Arabia in particular, as the most prominent member of [OPEC](http://www.opec.org/), has made significant technological advances in the area of Engineering related to Oil and Gas production, which has made a significant contribution to modern society, particularly in high oil consuming countries in the secular west.

Liverpool, I think, are still in transition. They've been adding squad depth rather than world-class quality. This will help them compete in the extra games this season, but I think they'll finish outside the top four.

Decriminalisation would not put dealers out of business. Cigarettes and alcohol are legal yet we have a smuggling and counterfeit industry of fake fags and booze. 

Tax revenue in the US is not a good figure to go on it will only be a matter of time before the US have a spell of lawsuits suing cannabis manufactures for health issues remember cigarettes were first sold with health benefits, $23.6 billion is the current highest single payout awarded for cigarette addiction. 

Putting any form of smoke into your lungs cannot be good for you so i think the UK is wise to wait a while. 

Colorado many only have a population of 5 mil its only made that much revenue as its neighboring states have not made it legal, if they do that revenue figure will drop dramatically and US taxes are more complicated than the UK to make a comparison and no doubt some people bought it then sold it on in the states that have not legalised for a profit. 

It would be better to look at how much Amsterdam makes population 800,000 to see if it is worth it as their revenue figures are more long term not just 6 months.

Making it legal means extra cost to the police as they have to find an accurate road side test, the NHS funding to find whats the acceptable level to have in your blood stream to drive and whats the impact if any if cannabis masks the early stage of an illness whilst it has been proven to ease pain what happens if it mask the illness that's causing the pain in the early stages. Drink and smoking are a form of addiction and even though they are legal we have to fund addiction treatment how much extra funding do we need to provide those who become addicted.

The cannabis would have to be grown under licence which means our love of health and safety and quality control kick in and costs the taxpayer to set.  Our farming industry take another hit farmers see that as a higher yielding cash crop (as i cant see us growing anything strong under hydroponics it will be the same weed grown in Jamica and Afghanstan in the open probably in polly prop tunnels due to UK weather) we then increase our dependency on imported food stuff's something certain political parties want to lower. 

The alcohol industry invest a huge amount of money in marketing to persuade us to drink their product do you think they wont divert funds to fight the legalisation of a product that could seriously impact their sales. 

Its too easy for people to say the war has been lost, what people forget war is fought as a series of battles and operations the law of our land would be happy to admit they have lost a few battles but will highlight its victory's as grounds to carry on the war and war is not set to a time frame they end when the government has achieved its end state or the enemy has conquered them drugs have not conquered the UK yet.",0,1407085479,null,0,false,0,cjfsbay,t3_2ci717,t1_cjfsbay,t3_2ci717,null,1435047691,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't subscribe to the argument that the drug war makes things better.

Honestly your best bet is to come here and schedule meetings with people at production companies directly.  Let them know who you are, and that you're on the hunt.

It's a very informal industry, so it's pretty hard to break in, even if you've got good experience.  Best thing is always to find out the names of people who run the company, and ask them to come have coffee with you.

Be prepared to be super flexible with your time though - people will ask you to have meetings at short notice, or will cancel at the last minute.  Frustrating, but comes with the territory.  My suggestion is find a cafe downtown that you can work out of and use it as a base to get to meetings.

Get yourself access to The Knowledge:  http://www.theknowledgeonline.com/

Nothing plastic about this, acknowledges that it was a bad game but thinks he'll do well. 

If this is how plastic fans behave, it seems a lot better than a lot of other teams' bandwagon fans behave.

edit: You edited so I'll respond to the last paragraph. There is no evidence that either of this commenters missed the game. There are an absolutely abundance of really stupid comments on facebook and you seemed to pick two that are actually somewhat decent for the particular forum. I do agree with you that there are a lot of ""plastic"" fans, but you could have posted much better ""evidence"" than what you have.

Finally, if these type of people bother you so much, why even go on the forums where plastic fans generally congregate? Stay away from Facebook (it's useless now, really) and other social media pages, stick to reddit (less plastics), F365 forum, WAGNH, and the plethora of many other great Chelsea forums.

&gt; A gang of violent criminals who left a stroke victim with a fractured skull and slashed his arms and legs as he lay bed-ridden have been branded “wicked” by a judge.
&gt;
&gt; Rodrigo Martinez and Arapeta Tangaroa were part of the masked gang which targeted the vulnerable 59-year-old victim and his 79-year-old mother as she was caring for him at their home in Leeds.
&gt;
&gt; A court heard they forced their way into the property and told the mother: “The old man upstairs is going to get it and so are you.”
&gt;
&gt; The victim was hit over the head three times with a crowbar as they demanded to know where his money and the morphine to help relieve his pain was kept.
&gt;
&gt; A knife was also used to cut his arms and legs.
&gt;
&gt; They then ransacked the property and stole televisions, mobile phones and other equipment along with morphine and other drugs from the house in the Ireland Wood area of the city.
&gt;
&gt; Judge Rodney Jameson, QC, said: “It is not usual for a judge to use the word ‘wicked’, but it is difficult to use any other.
&gt;
&gt; “It was wickedness of the most extreme kind, made all the worse because it was totally unnecessary.”
&gt;
&gt; Martinez was caught after the gang’s getaway car smashed into a wall on the Ring Road at Shadwell. He was trapped in the wreckage of the vehicle when police arrived in the early hours of January 15 this year.
&gt;
&gt; In a separate incident, Tangaroa broke a pensioner’s jaw in a random attack on Town Street, Armley, in November last year.
&gt;
&gt; Tangaroa turned violent towards the 70-year-old victim when he refused to give in to his demands to hand over cigarettes and money.
&gt;
&gt; Tangaroa was arrested in March this year after he drove dangerously through Leeds city centre while drunk in charge of a motorbike.
&gt;
&gt; He mounted pavements and drove through red light during the police pursuit.
&gt;
&gt; When officers managed to pull him off the scooter and apprehend him he told them: “I’m like Al Capone.”
&gt;
&gt; Martinez, 18, of Ramshead Approach, Seacroft was locked up for six years and nine months after pleading guilty to aggravated burglary and causing grievous bodily harm.
&gt;
&gt; Tangaroa, 26, pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary, wounding with intent, causing grievous bodily harm, dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen of blood. The court heard both men have criminal records for burglary.
&gt;
&gt; Judge Jameson adjourned Tangaroa’s sentencing to allow for further reports to consider how much of a danger he poses to the public.
&gt;
&gt; Referring to the incident the judge said: “It is entirely obvious that this was a planned aggravated burglary at the home of a vulnerable victim.
&gt;
&gt; “It was an utterly shocking attack.
&gt; “It is apparent that those who went into that house were able to take not only money, but prescription drugs that he used for his condition.
&gt; “It is difficult to imagine the mentality of those who took part in that attack.” The victim had to undergo surgery after suffering a fractured skull caused by the crowbar blows.
&gt;
&gt; He also suffered broken ribs and slash wounds to his arms and legs.
&gt;
&gt; Prosecutor John Boumphrey read a victim statement to the court on behalf of the elderly woman in which she described her terror at seeing four masked strangers force their way into her home.
&gt;
&gt; The court heard she would never forget the sight of her son covered in blood after the attack.
&gt;
&gt; She said: “It is despicable. I still have the image ingrained on my mind.”
&gt;
&gt; The woman said she suffered from pneumonia after the incident which she attributes to the ordeal as she had to run from the house in the cold to raise the alarm. She added: “Our lives have been turned upside down for the last six months.”
&gt; After the case, Det Insp Andy Welbourn, of Leeds District CID, said: “This was a shocking incident where a 79-year-old woman was confronted by masked men armed with weapons in the early hours of the morning before they went on to attack her 59-year-old son leaving him with serious injuries.
&gt;
&gt; “Tangaroa and Martinez were motivated purely by greed.
&gt;
&gt; “We hope Martinez’s significant prison sentence will provide some source of comfort to the victims.”

There's truth to that.  He had 9 goals and 2 assists in 16 starts and 5 substitute appearances.  If he doesn't mind playing that irregularly with us, he would be useful.  We have a LOT of games this season, and two of our three strikers are 29-30 years old.  Ade in particular tends to pick up niggling injuries, and if Bobby sprains an ankle or gets mauled by Charlie Fucking Adam, we could easily find ourselves down to one striker in the whole squad.

It would be nice to have four quality strikers, one of whom is fine with occasional starts and super-sub appearances.  Not for £120,000/week, and not if we're dangerously short on homegrown players (which I don't think we are).

Glasgow is about an hour on the train, very easy to get to, and Stirling is a similar distance by train (Stirling castle might be something you want to see, perhaps as an alternative to Edinburgh castle, although if you want to see both you should look into Historic Scotland passes). Glasgow has a botanic gardens too, but I'm not that familiar with it, you will probably only want to visit one of them if you're just here for a short time.

Newcastle is down south in England, I'm not very familiar with touristy stuff that way, but I think York (also in England) might be worth a visit (also reachable by train), with the Yorvik viking museum. You can get most places in the UK by train with fairly minimal change overs, www.nationalrail.co.uk will let you plan out journeys, price them up and let you order your tickets in advance (you collect them from a ticket machine on the day, but you can get cheaper fares by buying in advance).

Someone mentioned the meadows as unsafe at night, it's been improved a lot recently with proper street lighting, so you shouldn't feel unsafe there now as a couple.

Google maps has very good coverage of the UK, with public transport included. You might also be interested in the Edinburgh Whisky Experience, next to Edinburgh Castle (the castle itself if quite expensive, hence my suggestion to look at historic scotland passes)

It ignores a very rich and diverse ideology to think that liberalism=thatcherism. They then said their political persuasion and I was just thinking 'yeah, that's more liberal than anything else'. 

Karl Marx tried to apply a scientific approach to history and politics using the method of Engels. He said that throughout history there were always two conflicting parties, and out of that comes a new political ideology. So he thought that the treatment of the workers (the proletariat) during the industrial revolution by the owners and elite (the bourgeois) would lead to a revolution where the proles took power and shared out the wealth of the land between them. He saw it as inevitable the progression to socialism and then communism, but applying scientific methods to these things is a bit futile. Obviously the living standards of the poor improved with the introduction of welfare and government programs, so a revolution never took place here, even though Marx had at one point predicted we would be ripe for revolution.

Marxist theory and philosophy was what was espoused by Marx. It was then developed by others, but the reason it is called marxism is that it is based on the teachings of Marx. Marx definitely said that socialism should overthrow capitalism, and that communism is the ideal. We can see this sentiment of his quote of what a banner would say in a perfect communist state: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"".

Seriously though, the two Dave's claim that they're lifelong West Ham fans, they grew up with ""the West Ham way"", so they surely can't be happy with what is going on with their beloved football club, yet they won't do the right thing. I'm sure DG gets 1000's of tweets a day calling for BFS head however, they're too afraid to sack him in fear of having to pay the compensation fee to Allardyce.

The money they would lose from sacking Sam would be pennies compared to what they would get back from climbing up the league and progressing in cup competitions with a competent, ambitious manager in charge. A manager that would actually blood youngsters the proper way, so they actually get some confidence and progress as footballers, not throwing them all into their first competitive game to be mauled by Nottingham Forest.

We need a new manager right now, Sam Allardyce is killing us, he has absolutely no interest in moving us forward as a football club.

If you want an interesting perspective on an alternate economic structure you should read 'The Soul of Man Under Socialism' by Oscar Wilde. His ideas focus more on self realisation and the creative industries (being an author and a playwright maybe what you would expect), and he comes at it in a slightly anarchistic way. It can definitely be applied to the problem of having loads of unemployed from automation and it offers one solution (that I don't necessarily believe in, however I'm still endorsing, so it shows it is a worthy read).

Eagles (NFL) - two trips to the Super Bowl (1980, 2004) but lost both times

76ers (basketball) - three championships (1955, 1967, 1983) but have been pretty awful for over a decade

Flyers (hockey) - won twice in '74 and '75, but not since though they are a perennially solid team (though I don't really follow hockey much)

Union (MLS/soccer) - just became a team in 2010 and are pretty low in the standings at this point, though lots of fun to watch, especially being able to support a club from its inception as opposed to all the other sports listed who have a collective history of hundreds of years as franchises


We're a ridiculously passionate sports city, but just accustomed to disappointment.

He's a left-footer (something we lack) and a great left peg it is. He is best suited to playing the CAM role in which we've seen Coutinho thrive yet he can also play on the wing. Markovic in comparison (for example) is a natural winger and not someone you could see in the CAM position. 

If we sign a striker/forward like Konoplyanka then I guess I would concede Suso should go out on loan again but if we sign an out and out striker like Bony or Huntelaar then I think he should stay and be utilised. 

Say we play 4-3-3 this is probably our current (with Moreno included) likely XI to start the season.

Should we play the diamond I could see Suso playing in the 'Coutinho' position. Yet Lallana could play there also when he returns from injury. Lallana could also play on the right or the left of the diamond with Coutinho or Suso at the top. Even Sterling could play there.

I'm meandering but what i'm trying to stress is depth and versatility are both going to be key this year. I can see Suso getting a chance to play more often than you might think.

Some ISAs (new ISAs are called NISAs, they're extremely similar) have limits like this, some don't. ISAs are there as tax-free wrappers, so you don't pay tax on any interest you earn from them, but there are limits on how much you can put in them a year.

Here are the better rates available now: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-cash-isa

&gt; As for your last question, do you mean setting up a direct debit in which you have a fixed amount going from account A to account B at regular intervals? That's certainly legal, and can easily be done with online banking.

This is right, but a slight correction (slightly pedantic). You set up a ""standing order"" to send a fixed amount regularly, a ""direct debit"" is where you give another person/company to take money from your account (with a variety of legal guarantees). Doesn't really affect your point, just thought I'd add the name to make finding it easier.

It also means we don't have to clean the main sink: we can just throw the plastic bowl out when it gets skanky. Also if you dropped something back in the bowl (let it slip out of your hands),, there's less chance of it smashing on the hard surface of the bowl, especially if the bowl is suspended, as it was the way we put it in the sink.

Also when they got shitted up and you were to throw them out, like the old sponges, they instead got relegated to bathroom/kitchen/car/window cleaning duty. Or chunder bucket, if need be.

&gt;Close Encounter With a Dalek - Doctor Who - The Waters of Mars - BBC

&gt;The Tenth Doctor consoles Adelaide Brooke, telling her about her role in human history; even the Daleks don't dare tamper the fixed points. (TV: *The Waters of Mars*)

&gt;__Fixed points in time__ were moments in the space-time continuum at which events were set in stone and could never, *ever* be changed, no matter what. The Time Lords knew which points in time were ""fixed"", which the Ninth Doctor said was a maddening experience to have to go through. (TV: *The Parting of the Ways*) This was called ""the burden of the Time Lords"" by the Tenth Doctor, who was trying to explain to Donna why he couldn't prevent Mount Vesuvius from erupting or save the people of Pompeii. (TV: *The Fires of Pompeii*)
