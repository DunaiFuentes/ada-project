true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"&gt; Other peoples sexual orientation does not impact or bother me, so why would we need to teach children about LGBT when we barely cover standard sex education as it is?

Well that's the point, for once, it's not all about *you*. It's about LGBT kids who deserve an education about who they are and why they are that way. It's also benefital to straight kids so they have a better understanding of people they will eventually have to deal with in life. It's no fun going around knowing *everyone*, including your doctors and lawyers and judges and policeman have zero education on who you are, how you came to be that way, and why you are the way you are. It's no fun living life with a big **?** hovering over your head. There is no security there. 

&gt;why should LGBT be singled out for more priority over standard Sex education?

Singled out? Priority? Not seeing it. Considering I went to school under ""Section 28"" which ""singled out"" LGBT issues by censoring them completely, I think a bit of inclusion is long overdue! I don't get how you see ""included"" and think ""priority"" though.

Should they now accept Liverpoolâs lesser offer of Â£25m without an official request by the player, they would have to pay him loyalty bonuses (the irony not lost on me).

People don't reproduce because of ""obligations""... that's probably the most British account of sex I've ever heard. ""Come on darling, it's 9 o'clock on Wednesday evening and we need to do our part for England!"" I now have a vision of Lord Kitchener with his finger pointing at the British public, urging them to patriotically churn out babies. The bottom line is, people reproduce for biological reasons, and sometimes they invent ideologies and religions to justify it. I'm a Humanist and I see all ideologies and religions as products of human culture, and I judge them by their consequences. I don't consider lying to children to be beneficial to anyone, so if you want me to say that, you're pushing at an open door. There are better alternatives, and children deserve them.

&gt; In fact one might even conclude that you fear it

There are lots of reasons to be afraid of organised religion, and as a gay atheist I have more than most.

Your view is pretty incoherent; on the one hand there's no real purpose to existence and ethical standards are just arbitrary. On the other, I'm a villain for being afraid of something that is dangerous and potentially compromises the rights of children. But by whose arbitrary metric am I wrong to do so? Your own logic doesn't allow you to criticise me.

I want people to move away from it, which they're already doing. It's just a matter of time. Eventually the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) will shut out faith schools, and they will become as unthinkable as the Magdalene Asylums and debtors' prisons of yesteryear.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"Is the guy on this video OP? He seems pretty smart and well thought out. It's a really well done video, but I don't think I agree.

I think he misses some points.

My understanding as to why handguns are illegal is due to concealment and availability. He addresses that someone who's going to commit a crime requiring a concealed weapon isn't going to worry about sawing the end off a bigger one one. 

The argument ""well criminals gunna crime"" isn't a valid retort against a law. ""Sure, we can stop serial paedophiles working in schools, but if they really want, they'll find a way round it, so lets just let them all work there"". There will always be people who find away around laws, that's not an excuse to do away with them totally.

I suspect a large portion of gun crime in e.g. America, isn't well thought out. I don't imagine in a lot of cases, it's a well considered and logical thought process that leads a person to engage in gun crime. I imagine it's an impulsive or emotional response to a situation (e.g. ""I have no money, so I'll go rob a place, oops this person is getting in the way, shoot them"" or ""this person is trying to get in my home, I'll shoot them"" or ""this guy is on my turf, I'll shoot him""). That impulsive behaviour already exists in the UK - we already have violent crime - but because we have tight gun laws, and handguns aren't widely available, those impulse situations can't physically be handled with ""I'll reach for my gun (which I carry round everywhere, 'coz hey, it's hand size) and shoot someone"" like they are in the U.S.

We don't outright ban knives, because knives have a legitimate, and arguable mandatory role as a crucial part of modern life for everyone. How can we butter bread, or cut our food if we don't have knives. If we can't have any kind of knife, life for the majority of people is severely impeded. That's why we allow the minimum length we can practically get away with - a compromise. If a small minority who want handguns, don't have handguns, it means they just have to use a slightly larger weapon for their sport. That's why we allow only the length of gun we can practically get away with.

Living in a civil society is about compromise. I imagine if I could drive, I would love to be able to drive down the road at 150mph. I've got pretty fast reflexes, I think I'd be safe. I could probably pass my driving test too, so I'd be safe, right? Even if I was convinced I would be safe, I'd still accept that I have to compromise, because it wouldn't be safe for others not going that speed, or for other who do go that speed. We have to accept that if we want to do something that is going to result in an increased risk of harm to others, then, for good reason, that thing is going to be regulated or maybe even prohibited totally.

Regarding his graph, I don't subscribe to that at all. The graph only goes up to 2002, has no source on it, and is regarding murders, mentioning nothing relating to firearms. Furthermore, he says words to the effect of ""anyone logical will see these statistics, you're not logical if you don't look at these statistics"". This guy is saying ""looks, here's a shoddy old graph and a correlation, therefore, causation"". I did try and find some proper figures on murder or injuries related to firearms over time in the UK, but I couldn't find anything reliable - open to suggestions though.

He finishes saying that we're statistically far more likely to get e.g. hit by a car then killed by a handgun. Of course we are, because hand guns are illegal! If we let everyone have them, then there's a big chance the risk of death from handguns will go up. That theory has an explainable method (availability of a gun is directly related to the possibility of engaging in gun crime) not just a correlation with an outdated graph like his theory that allowing people to have handguns reduces murder. He says ""there are far more dangerous things out there"" yes, murder is far more dangerous than a punch in the face, so does that mean we should let everyone go around punching each other in the face?

It's sad the Olympic pistol team can't shoot, I think they should get exemptions maybe even, possibly by the home office or something (similar to how it's possible to get exemptions from drug laws for research purposes). I certainly don't think Olympic pistol team is a justification for anyone who can get a gun license to have a handgun. If there was an Olympic sport involving eating humans, would that be a justification to let people do it in the UK?

I don't think we should outright ban all guns, I think the current compromise works quite well. I definitely don't think we should be allowing more guns though - the last thing we want is for handguns to become a part of our culture like it is in other countries with far higher firearm related injuries.",0,1402507152,null,0,1402507501,0,ci4xghn,t3_27vpbh,t1_ci4xghn,t3_27vpbh,null,1434193632,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"We can't possibly be fully equipped for everything though, especially when it comes to war, because we never actually know what is going to work best in the next war zone in which we're fighting, because these things sort of just happen, more often than not. 

When taking part in a war in a foreign land, the non-native forces are always going to be slow starters, they are going to go in with the best kit that they have at the moment the wars start and it takes time for kit deficiencies to really come to light and even longer for new kit to be designed to counteract the threats at the time. Then the threats change and that nice bit of kit that protects you from one thing is actually less than useless against something else, because the enemy change their tactics to counteract all the good stuff we do, and in Afghanistan it's a lot easier for the Taliban to make quick changes in their relatively small groups than it is for us as an armed force. 

So yeah it starts as well as we can expect, some people don't have the right kit and we unfortunately take a hit there, then we improve and try to keep up with what the enemy is doing to try and kill us, as they try to keep changing as we try to kill or detain them. Lives are always lost due to kit issues and I can't see that ever changing in any war environment, at the start it's fucking chaos and as we learn the management of that chaos improves. 

When I was on HERRICK in 2009 my kit was okay, so was my training, in 2011 both were pretty good and last year was definitely the best on both counts. If we had 10 years to plan for a war in a specific country we'd start off so much better, but we don't and we never will do. 

So I suppose my point would be.... yes there were fatalities due to kit problems especially at the start, but that is something that has to be expected no matter how much we don't want it to happen, because that's the nature of war and at the start we give out the best of what we have (or what we think is best at the time), not the best that there is, because we didn't know we'd need it. We always learn and we are always improving, that is what shows to me that while the MOD has a lot of problems, adapting to new wars isn't actually one of them. While the death of any colleague is, to me, a tragedy, when you look at the numbers (number of people deploying, number of deaths etc, situations faced etc there will be some stats somewhere, I'm going to the pub once I've typed this bit) this country does a fucking good job at keeping safe those who it puts in harm's way. Yes we in the armed forces whinge about our kit, damn right we do, it's part of the learning process that the MOD uses to get it as right as it can be in that chaos.

However, it is extraordinary how the increasing confidence of Cristiano, together with his form I guess, takes him to a completely different level towards the end of the season. The purity of his work is immense. Strike power, insane. But his action, and athletic form is impressive. 
  
That said, suarez's goals just keep on going, and they are consistently brilliant in some other way, shape or form. And Suarez did not score one penalty during that 31 goal haul! But the Pens from Ronaldo are sublime.   

So yeah, I liked the video and I wanted to share it with my fellow people who check-in on this sub, a ridiculous amount of time, to have some amazing footage of two technical magicians at work.

Mostly I have used PHP5 with PDO, Javascript with JQuery and AJAX, scrollorama, CSS3, a bit of SASS, MySQL, PostgreSQL. Without programming in web, I have used C++ and Java. (I'm don't like .NET very much... )

What I Have already created- 
random question generator for one of my exams using Ajax. (nothing hard).
 Right now I'm creating Inventar (dunno how to translate it. For requesting stuff from school, like a laptop, e.c.) system for my school from scratch. (Request something, it shows up in callendar, you can manage how long it will be used, there is going to be something set up with mail server and send emails e.c. It's my year project)
http://codepen.io/Dawgora/pen/zbGpC - De Casteljau algorythm. Cheap way tho, I should optimize it.
flash clock http://kuponi.3area.info/clock/clock.swf
Something from a tutorial- http://kuponi.3area.info/parallax2/ (best on webkit browsers, like opera or chrome.)
plugin/algorithm, that creates numbers into words (like 1993 to One thousand Nine hundred Ninety three... But in Latvian. if someone knows Latvian, then you might understand how tedious was this work)
Out of web dev I have created prime number calculator with graphical UI, where you can input bounds from what number till what number.
Sudoku generator with graphical UI, but I took a bit of code for backtrack algorithm.

But... Something like big websites... I got none. But I have a bit of time left to change it. Okay, the project what I'm creating now is kind of big.

Main reason why I want to get out of Latvia for a year, because I just want to see how it is to live in another country. Plus, working in Latvia... Getting a good job is kind of hard... In a way.
And I'm learning in Vidzemes university of applied sciences.

Atleast what I have seen, is that even if you have worked a whole year... or two, you still have kind of low paying job.

Keeping Courtois seems like the obvious choice to keep to most people because of his youth. He can grow as a player over the next ""X"" years and such.....but with CFC that doesn't really matter, they will always be able to afford the latest and greatest plaything.

Really Mou is in a position that numerous managers around Europe would absolutely love to be in, he has the choice between two world class keepers....either one will be a suitable starter for a PL/CL title contender and either one will fetch a solid fee in a transfer.

The rest of your argument is pretty strong but this part simply isn't supported by the evidence. If this were true then the number of firearms homicides would have dropped after the 1997 ban on handguns, as it would have almost eliminated (or at least dented) the possibility of such shootings. As much as i'd like for this to be the case, it isn't. [Firearms homicides have remained at roughly the same level since before the ban (see page 11)](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn01940.pdf).

Funny enough - a few years back Sinn FÃ©in actually came up top in the Craigavon mayoral vote. That is until all the unionist parties (which obviously had a majority) got together to demand a revote.

Guns aid in committing crime, as well as make the acts more dangerous and lethal for everyone involved.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This guy's logic is way off, I don't think he's thought about what he's saying

&gt;you don't put people in prison because they might do something

yes, but that's different. Not being allowed to own a gun is fundamentally different from not being allowed to move around freely.

Nobody would like it if a stranger walked up to them and held a gun to their face, but holding a gun up to someones face isn't in itself hurting them. Nobody would like it if their neighbour built a bomb and started flipping a coin to decide if they set it off, even though that isn't in itself hurting anyone either. Preventative measures aren't some radical thing that you don't see outside gun control, they exist everywhere and where they're reasonable, they're a good thing. Nobody would like it if they were tied to a train track, even though tying someone to a train track doesn't kill them until a train runs along it. 

If you think that you have an absolute right to do anything as long as it doesn't hurt someone, you must also think that a lot of things other than personal handgun ownership should be legal. You must also think I should be allowed to flip a coin to decide whether I blow up your house, or hold you at gunpoint, or tie you to train tracks. You should have no problem with me driving at you at 100mph until I actually hit you. You should have no problem with me threatening to kill you until I actually do. It's a completely unworkable view and if this man had actually thought about it, he would realise that you have to balance potential risk with the benefits of gun ownership.

If you decide after all this that you don't have any problem with the threat of crime, feel free to move to the south pole, where nobody will infringe on anyones right to be about to commit crime. 

&gt;The issue is making sure the right people are allowed to have guns.

So how are you going to stop the wrong people from having them? are you going to station armed guards at every gun club treasury, and order 6 month psychiatric evaluations for everyone who wants a handgun license? or are you going to be a reasonable person and understand that you can never be 100% sure someone is never going to make any mistakes with security, or snap and shoot someone. 

&gt;you're allowed to use [scary rifle]

Because nobody commits crime with scary rifles. You can't conceal a gun as long as you are tall in your trousers and mug people with it, or fire it into the air a bunch of times. This isn't just conjecture, you can look at the statistics in countries with an equal entry barrier for rifle and handgun ownership like the US and see how uncommon rifle crime is compared to handgun crime, because in *practice* they are much safer weapons and much less desirable for criminals.

The UK's elected government have put in law their belief that that the risk with some weapons (IE rifles and shotguns) doesn't counterract their benefits (hunting, farming) whereas for other weapons the risk is too great. This is why you can own an air rifle without any kind of license, but not a nuclear bomb or a claymore. 

&gt;well let's apply this logic to knives

knives are deemed to be a net good: if you couldn't buy knives, you couldn't open packaging, you couldn't prepare food, you couldn't make clothes, you couldn't open boxes, you couldn't do a vast range of things. Therefore the risks of knives don't outweigh the benefits. this is hardly advanced stuff :/. The risk of someone with a machete wanting to use it maliciously is a lot larger than the risk someone with a swiss army knife wants to do the same, which is why swiss army knives aren't illegal in public and machetes are. 

Kinda tired of listening to this and I doubt anyone's going to read the wall of text anyway, so I'm done. ",1,1402517553,null,0,false,0,ci52sae,t3_27vpbh,t1_ci52sae,t3_27vpbh,null,1434196145,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; First you do get paid and have been for ages before you are sent to work.

Benefits aren't wages. Would you do your current job for Â£57 a week? It works out as roughly Â£1.42 an hour for a 40 hour week. For many jobs this wouldn't even cover cost of travel to and from work. It's barely enough to cover such extravagances such as 'heating' and 'food'.

&gt; Second its not forever.

Agreed, but it's still time spent working for no pay. It's definitely something jobseekers should consider providing it actually gives them something (i.e. a needed reference, or experience in a role they don't have experience in - no point in giving customer service experience to somebody who already has 5+ years customer service experience)

&gt; Third i work at a place that has this scheme and two showed up for one day and never came back and one has joined us as a member of staff.

A guy I know did two of these workfare schemes at the same Poundland store. There was no job at the end of it, either time. Did it help him gain employment? I don't know. All I know is Poundland got 8 weeks of free labour out of him. If he wasn't capable of doing the job, they wouldn't have brought him in, not even for free. They just didn't want to pay him.

&gt; if they really needed the money to live they would have stuck it out

Again, benefits are not wages. Workfare schemes are optional and have to have some benefit for the jobseeker.

&gt; Get off your ass and do ANY job.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;We must start regulating and licensing cycling.

Been discussed, always dismissed. I'd get used to the idea it will never happen.

When compared to cyclists, cars simply pose too much danger. They are in effect heavy machinery and need to be treated as such.

And If cars posed as little risk as cyclists I doubt they would need registration either, but unfortunately that's not the case.

In addition to that, cyclist saves the nation money in many indirect ways, the same cannot be said of cars. 

And as such, the government will never make it difficult or costly to allow the public to cycle. Also, given all the benefits and lack of negatives registration would be a costly minefield. 20million bikes nation wide. Kids wouldn't be able to cycle without registration...it's never going to happen

And licensing...well, close to 90% of adult cyclists already hold a driving license. So again, costly with little benefit.

&gt;infringements by cyclists should be recorded and ....

You know that if the police wish to fine cyclists they can. Nothing is stopping them. Happens all the time.

Small point. I believe the fine should fit the crime. A cyclist jumping a red light is many many times less dangerous than a car doing so.

&gt;cyclists shame motorists via YouTube.

That's not a reason to do anything.

&gt;make cycling an accountable activity.

I'm not sure that's workable. The reason for this is the road, like a pavement is a public place, with rules/laws that are 100s of years old. People cannot be banned from using it, unless of course they receive something like an ASBO. Even motorists are not technically banned from using the road, they are simply banned from using a car. And again, a situation where a cyclist posed the danger of a car would be a handful at best each year.

So...A costly law change to re classify the way the road works..probably wishful thinking on your part.",0,1402519872,null,0,1402527902,0,ci53zdt,t3_27vfg5,t1_ci53zdt,t1_ci51w3m,null,1434196773,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Use of force in making arrest, etc.

(1) A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.

(2) Subsection (1) above shall replace the rules of the common law on the question when force used for a purpose mentioned in the subsection is justified by that purpose.


**s24A Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984**

(1) A person other than a constable may arrest without a warrantâ

(a) anyone who is in the act of committing an indictable offence;

(b) anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing an indictable offence.

(2) Where an indictable offence has been committed, a person other than a constable may arrest without a warrantâ

(a) anyone who is guilty of the offence;

(b) anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it.

(3) But the power of summary arrest conferred by subsection (1) or (2) is exercisable only ifâ

(a) the person making the arrest has reasonable grounds for believing that for any of the reasons mentioned in subsection (4) it is necessary to arrest the person in question; and

(b) it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a constable to make it instead.

(4) The reasons are to prevent the person in questionâ

(a) causing physical injury to himself or any other person;

(b) suffering physical injury;

(c) causing loss of or damage to property; or

(d) making off before a constable can assume responsibility for him. 


**tl;dr**

S3 CLA provides for use of reasonable force in the effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders. 

S24A PACE provides 'any person' powers to arrest someone committing an indictable offence (which, in the eyes of the law, includes either-way offences) *provided* they are either in the act of committing it or you have reasonable suspicion that they are doing so *or* they are guilty of an indictable offence or you reasonably suspect that they are.

But only if one of the s24A (4) reasons exists (but any security guard will be rocking (d) like it's going  out of fashion.

**tl;dr the tl;dr** - theft, criminal damage (although low values would be tried summarily, I don't think that the courts would expect a citizen to make an instant assessment of values in the heat of the moment), ABH are all within the gift of security guards (or any civic minded citizen) to arrest for, and you're unlikely to get into trouble if you've not started putting the boot in before the old bill turn up.

true,madderadder,null,null,"I have always been a bit wary about massive (read: not travel friendly, I will probably drop it or hide it away and forget to use it) palettes from unknown origins. I personally prefer to buy from named companies. I have a variety of inexpensive palettes that I think are quite good value, mainly from Sleek, MUA, and recently Makeup Revolution. All three of those brands have at least a few palettes that are primarily neutrals, and my experience with them so far is very positive. Sleek has some really pigmented and gorgeous collections; my favourites are Oh So Special and Ultra Mattes v2 Darks. MUA's mattes are hit-and-miss, and I'd stay away from the bright palettes (pigmentation generally sucks), but their shimmers and neutrals are strong, in both palettes and as singles. I am also a fan of Makeup Revolution's single eye shadows. The swatches on their site show that not every shadow they make is equally good, so choose carefully, but I have like 10 now (mostly shimmers, also a few mattes) that are all quite nice. Both MUA and MuR have some UD Naked palette dupes. They're not as easy to work with as the real thing, but they're amazing value.

If it's MAC dupes you're after, I'd recommend Makeup Geek. I know we're on a UK sub here, but if you're okay with ordering online, then I think MUG is a great choice. Their shadows are more expensive than MUA/no-brand, but they're really, really nice, and much better priced than MAC ($6 each, instead of Â£10).

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Your ""could"", without clarification under what circumstances meant ""would"" to me as I'm not in your head and don't know what kind of plan for that to happen you have prepared. 

So your argument retreats about it only being 'bullshit' around connotations of you not understanding and not being able to comprehend.

'Could' was clearly implied with not having to be part of the EU.  You just leaped off the logic precipice and assumed what it WOULD mean.

So the fault was at your end.   

It wasn't 'bullshit', you just needed extra clarification.  Now that you have that, you accept that 'could' applies, and have admitted that the UK could do what I claimed.

The breakdown was on your part.

&gt;GMC and the rest is overreacting on that one case...

Oh, after trying to argue for the GMC as a regulatory having powers, now that you know they argue something different (for something I have been arguing), you want to argue against the GMC.

&gt;The EU didn't forbid them doing it in the past. It was GMC's - Until now, Britain has interpreted EU law as meaning that doctors who qualify in any of the 27 countries must be free to work elsewhere, without restriction.

So now you want to argue that it was all the GMCs doing when they've actually been campaigning for it.  That they were employing the rule of law too strictly.

Your 'argument' is going from weaker to weaker still.  It was already inconsistent.

&gt;Yet, the highest struck number of doctors comes from.... India. There are 25k doctors from the EU, yet none from the EU are in the ""top 5"" of struck off... with a remark of 27 cases of struck off doctors from whole Eastern Europe (of how many isn't provided and I couldn't find that data).

Because they CAN...that's the whole point!   They're actively calling into question those that they can, and they're limited to those that they can't.  They can call those on a visa under higher scrutiny.

&gt;To me this is an non-issue discussion, especially knowing that nothing stops UK in introducing further local checks, what has been done with revalidation or some induction programmes. The fact is that UK can very well increase standards if it has any doubts of qualifications in the EU, in many different ways, but somehow even current changes were done because of a single one or two examples of EU doctors being in wrong.

Yet the GMC are actively screaming that there's a risk to patients because they can't validate.  They have to take license on face value.

&gt;I don't see anything wrong with GMC trying to increase those standards throughout whole EU.

This is where your dislocated thought falls away.  You accept that there's lower standards (arguing why I raise the lowest standards of the EU28), and then disassociate from yourself that the minimum standard means taking the lower standards into account.

The GMC themselves raise the alarm that they can't be sure of EU standardisation.  That it might be putting their patients at risk.

&gt;where they can base their fear on and at the same time they fail in keeping standards with doctors with whom they have full power of control.

For the love of God...the regulatory body is saying that they don't have full power of control.     

That's why the EU Commission has launched a delegation.    

They're just saying that the Commission and the EU hasn't gone far enough, but they question certain member states even being to be able to meet extra demands.

But under their own steam, the UK and the NHS, they COULD, and hold whatever standards they seem fit.",0,1402522689,null,0,1402530484,0,ci55djx,t3_27m2id,t1_ci55djx,t1_ci4tpxg,null,1434197430,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's more or less the intention. 

One caveat's that we'll perhaps err a touch on the side of being a bit harsh for a while- there's absolutely nothing wrong with UKIP posters (Lord only knows, there are enough of them)- but charming souls pulling out the standard tiresome ""Gypsies are coming to take our jobs!"" / ""Blacks are less intelligent!"" waffle will get dealt with.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; when you add up Â£1.42 an hour do you also include the years they have been out of work and being paid before they are asked to do this.

No, because benefits are not wages. Let me lay it out for you.

A wage is a remuneration; a compensation payment for work or services performed which generates income for the business. Job Seekers Allowance is a payment designed to cover basic living expenses whilst a person is actively seeking work. You do not receive JSA for sitting on your arse all day, contrary to what you believe.

&gt; I started volunteer work the day I started JSA and I got a reference, some great friends and lots of real world experience out of it.

Good for you, seriously.

&gt; (remember people on this scheme have not worked for years)

You imply that people who have not worked for years are there through choice. You are wrong.

&gt; Do poundland pay tax yes

Completely irrelevant. Poundland are receiving the benefit of the employee without having to offer any remuneration. This is an afront to the basic economic principles of a capitalist society.

Incidentally, because of the workfare scheme, Poundland are actually paying less tax because they don't have to cover national insurance payments on their workfare workforce.

&gt; so they do pay something and remember so few business have signed up for this scheme (because of people like you) 

Well firstly, they don't pay anything to the employee, which is the point you have missed completely. As for the other point, it's fundamentally immoral to force people to work for no pay (In times gone by they called it slavery), that is why so few businesses have signed up to the scheme.

&gt; there are not enough jobs and would you rather have to start training some one from the beginning again or just hire the guy you have already trained.

There are not enough jobs indeed, but workfare isn't creating any. If anything, it's reducing the amount of jobs because potential employees have to compete with slave labour.

&gt; Lets see lay at home and do nothing or get out and work(really you don't see benefit in that)

Of course I see the benefit in work. I also see the benefit in a working economy where businesses give remuneration in exchange for the work/services that employees provide which makes their business run.

&gt; of course you wont because most people will look at burger king and say I am a qualified IT tech am not doing that.

Well firstly, the majority of fast food workers fall in the 16-21 wage bracket, because of the lower minimum wage rate. Secondly, hiring managers tend to ignore overqualified applicants who for instance have a degree.

I've been unemployed for 11 months. I have applied to well over 200 jobs (Probably closer to 300, I stopped counting months ago). I've also attended several training courses which I organised myself, and have been trying to secure relevant work experience in my area. Despite having a Mechanical Engineering degree, I have been applying for supermarket jobs, bar jobs, fast food jobs etc. I have had 17 interviews (With 2 more within the next 7 days) and ALL of them have been for Engineering positions. I can't even get an interview for a job in Mcdonalds because they see me as overqualified (Not the other way around), so for you to sit at your computer and tell people to get up off their arse and take any job they can get is absolute bullshit.

Britain is very mild in winter considering it's latitude. 
If you compare Glasgow to the Canadian ski resort of Whistler (famed for the winter Olympics in 2010), you'll get a good idea of the difference. 
Glasgow is 5degrees further north than Whistler, yet whistler is significantly cooler (Average low 6.2 in Glasgow, 1.5 in Whistler. Average high 12.9 in Glasgow 11.7 in Whistler.)

Czech Republic suffers from confidentiality, the country is much further away from the warming effects of seas, therefore much cooler in winter and generally warmer in summer. Germany shares this effect towards the Czech boarder and away from the coastal North. 

Britain is effected by the warming effect of the sea more so than most nations as a result of the Gulf stream.  

Both Austria and France have large Alpine regions. The average altitude of the Alps is what, 400m higher than the highest point in the UK? There are far more areas prone to ice over in France and Austria than there are in the UK. 
The few areas with reliable ice over in the UK are very sparsely populated. 

I highly doubt climate has much to do with ice hockey being unpopular, probably has more to do with facilities. In the UK ice skating is seen as a bit of a gimmick. To experience it, you need to travel to indoor rinks which are few and far between.
Skating isn't that popular, therefore it doesn't make economic sense to open more rinks. Without more rinks, hockey won't enjoy wide popularity.

He's just not the kind of man I can see move to Cardiff and structure his whole life around making the show. Moffat and Davies were both fiction writers and producers, that's what they do. Gatiss is also a fairly busy actor who has recently even landed a gig on Game of Thrones among others, he regularly does horror documentaries and has even directed his first short feature film last year. I think he's happy doing one episode a year. And honestly, I'm too. He doesn't strike me as a big idea man, he's at his best when he has source material and other writers to work with (see An Adventure in Space and Time and Sherlock). 

Moffat will do series 9 and maybe series 10, who knows. My best guess for his replacement would be Neil Cross. He's the idea man Gatiss isn't, he has experience working on big TV shows and although his first two outings weren't flawless, they were daring, they did something new and they were quite well-written. 

Chris Chibnaill and Toby Whithouse are kind of out of the picture at the moment because they both haven't written an episode since 2012 and (very probably) won't be returning for series 8. 

It could also be someone completely new or someone who's joining the writer's team in series 8 or 9 (Peter Harness even?)

Obviously it is difficult to separate his CL performances which were incredible, but it isn't Suarez's fault he didn't play any European competition. 

In the league Cristiano wasn't as incredible, which usually brings a flurry of angry comments but look at this video and then look at Cristiano's goal record in the last few La Liga seasons, 11/12 46 goals, 10/11 40 goals compared to this year. In particular, in December when Madrid lost ground on Barca he was poor (but kept scoring). 

To be fair he equaled Suarez this season, but then look at the goal quality and the penalties. Suarez also created more chances, had more assists, had a hugely better work rate etc. 

The gist of it is this, Ronaldo has a poor game and scores a tap in or penalty and nobody remembers the poor game. Suarez has a game where he doesn't score, plays brilliantly, and still people talk about him not scoring.

I'm tired of these arguments which seem to suggest nobody can come close to Ronaldo or Messi, but we know Suarez did.

Cyclists can jump lights with the same accuracy that pedestrians pick and choose the right moment to walk though moving traffic. It's often not so much that cars really have to avoid them, it's more cyclists avoid cars.

And given the frequency everyone claims to see cyclists jump lights there's not an awful lot of recorded incidents where where cyclists actually get killed jumping lights. That implies to me at least that the dangers are greatly exaggerated.

Cyclists are only a danger to themselves, they do not cause deaths of occupants of cars (in fact I'm yet to hear of any cyclist killing a motorist). But your comment regarding the effects on others is valid (just like pedestrians and motorists who are careless and get killed as a result)  

And finally, cyclists kill 0-2 people a year, total. Motorists kill around 50 odd people mounting the pavement and around 30 people at traffic lights and zebra crossings each year. Even taking into account the relatively small number of cyclists vs cars it still places the car many times ahead of cyclists as far as danger posed.

And if you're interested my view on red light jumping are probably pretty close to yours. For the most part I hate it and hate those who do it. That said, as a cyclist I have been put in situations where jumping a red seems a whole lot more safe and sensible than staying where I am.

Young people are notoriously liberal and such a policy would likely never work in their favour.  Hell, if the Tories could get away with putting a law in place saying that only full time employed tax paying citizens could vote I'm sure they would seriously consider it.  It would get rid of all those pesky students for one thing.

A 16 year old me would never have voted Tory.  The 30+ me on the other hand sees positive in some of their policies.  These days I can't see myself aligning to any particular party... it will always be my view based on the state of the world and my personal circumstances at the time.

But returning to the point of this.  Should 16 year old be allowed to vote?  Whilst in all honesty I probably don't trust the judgement of a 16 year old when it comes to politics, I probably don't trust your average 18/25/30/40/75 year old either as the majority of people I speak to vote without scratching the surface when it comes to party policy.  If, at 16, someone can have a full time job and pay taxes should they not be given the choice to vote for who represents them whether we agree with their views or not?

I recycled food waste while working in the catering industry for years and it's a good thing to do. Unfortunately, while they went to the trouble of delivering a small (maybe 3L) food waste bin to everyone and the supply of bags, they didn't bother to make more than about 1 food waste bin per 5 skips, so I'd need to walk a couple of minutes up a major residential street just to recycle my food waste.

Make recycling a case of it being no more than ""Do a bit of separation in the household"" and I can put up with having extra bins in my tiny kitchen, but make it so that I have to put in more leg work every time I want to recycle, or could just walk out my front door and put everything in the skip right outside?

They use proprietary interface and storage hardware - you need specialist equipment to accept the memory chip and reprogram it. You can only own or operate this equipment if you are licensed by the local authority. I imagine you would need this documentation to buy the equipment which I imagine is very expensive, also.

The meters get the speed information (meters work on distance travelled) from the vehicle's ECU, so the only way to fiddle the meter without opening it (and thus breaking the seal), would be to somehow alter the ECU so it over-reports the speed of the vehicle. That's not exactly easy.

It's a setup fine tuned over decades to protect the public from being overcharged.

And as we know full well, even secure software can be compromised - and with smartphones using common software such as Windows or Android, and using common interface such as USB, the possibility is there for someone to hack metering software to fiddle it. This is highly unlikely and requires specialist skills, but it's just as extremely unlikely as someone being able to fiddle a proper meter.

I've only been twice, but both times were great. 

First time was to the Tyrol about 12 years ago: a place called Tannheim. Small villages, mountains (I suppose you'd call it alpine, but no snow in summer, at least where I was), quite laid back. That was in the north-east of the country, near Germany and Switzerland. Actually got to visit Schloss Neuschwannstein, which is the castle (in Germany) that the Disney 'castle' is based on.

This time I was in Graz in the east of the country. Couple of hours from Vienna, quite near the border with Slovenia. Second biggest city in Austria, but only around 300,000 people. Lovely old centre, set amid rolling hills. We got an apartment 15 minutes by tram from the city centre, and virtually in the countryside, so it was super quiet (booking.com).

Depends what kind of holiday you're after, and whether you'll have a car or not (the Tyrol is accessible from Munich airport)

Also, don't be jealous of the hot weather: got on the fecking sleeper train in Graz on Tuesday night and it was so hot that within minutes I had sweat dripping off my face (nice....). Slept all night without the duvet, if you can call 5 hours sleep 'all night'

Mikel isn't good enough but he plays well when needed, Bosingwa wasn't good enough towards the end of his career  but he did his job.

The difference is, those two players were given game time, Marin never got the time he deserved. It was the same with De Bruyne, and even with De Bruyne a lot of people stated he wasn't good enough.

It also states that he has (currently) 4 series of his own of between 8-10 episodes each, called collectively the ""Eighth Doctor Adventures) and, for continuity, are set after monthly episode 103..

Directly after those comes the ""Dark Eyes"" series which is Eight-centric and has two series so far, with one planned for the end of this year and another TBA.

ask yourself this question, who else has this philosophy of late, and how successful have they been, with those players, with trophies?   
  
exempt Liverpool from this, count how many of their own youth were sold off/didnt make it till this years *title push*, also factor in how many fronts they were fighting on to even make the title push, it will be VERY different next year, mark my words.

For one, the source you provided clearly states that you can't compare data before or after 2003, but we'll ignore that for a second and look at what happens around the times of a gun law being bought in.

In 1988, the amendment to the firearms act came in which added restrictions on shotguns. In the stats you linked to show shotgun crime continued trending up for about 5 years after the law came into place, until it began to drop, eventually reaching half the level of the time the ban came into place.

Handgun law came in 1997, you'll notice handgun crime continues to go up for 5 years, before starting to trend down, currently at just a little bit over what it was when the law came into place. If the 1988 amendment is anything to go by, I hypothesise handgun crime will continue going down.

Like with any prohibition law, it takes time to come into effect, it has to filter down through the system - culture takes time to change.

More importantly, with this law in place, it's incredibly unlikely we'll ever end up with a culture like in america where so many every day people carry concealed handguns, giving the every day person the chance to kill someone or be killed with their own weapon.

Thanks for the stats though, there's some interesting looking stories in there.

The examples of Mikel and Bosingwa don't hold weight because, while they may not have been the best, with Bosingwa we really had no other RB option at the time, and with Mikel, he's always been a great rotational player in a position that needs rotation pretty often, and in select strategies/tactics he is a fantastic option.

De Bruyne is different. De Bruyne knew it was a World Cup year and couldn't not be playing first team football. He was training poorly and didn't fit Mourinho's style. Sure Oscar had shocking games, so does every footballer, but that doesn't mean you keep De Bruyne, who it should be noted WANTED to leave, just for those few instances.

No one DESERVES playing time. Ever. They earn it, and the earn it in an aspect of the game that none of us are privy to watching, so talking about what some player does or doesn't deserve is fucking nonsense.

Compare that to France that seen prosecutions into the hundreds since the 80's. 

The fact that the French were concerned that parents were coming to the UK to have FGM done on their child should be an indicator of how utterly lax the UK authorities have been on it.

I think in the long run turning a blind eye in a hope minorities wouldn't feel isolated or marginalised has had a worse effect than the french 'not tolerating bullshit' stance.

&gt; Chelsea are in talks with Valencia about the possible transfer of Chelsea prepare to offload John Obi Mikel and Ramires and have asked Real Madrid that Luka Modric be included in any proposed deal for Ramires. 

&gt; The west London club tried to sell Mikel, 27, to Galatasaray last summer, but the Nigeria midfielder did not want to move. He has three years left on his contract, but the arrival of Nemanja Matic in January and Marco van Ginkelâs recovery from a knee injury have paved the way for his departure. 

&gt; Valencia, who were purchased this week by Peter Lim, the Singaporean billionaire, are looking to bolster their defensive options and have turned to Mikel now that their pursuit of Cheikhou KouyatÃ© has been ended by the defenderâs expected move to West Ham United. The Spanish club are also looking at Nani, the Manchester United winger, who signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford in September. 

&gt; Mikel made just 11 league starts and a further 13 appearances from the substitutesâ bench last season. He cost Chelsea about Â£16 million in 2006 after Manchester United complained that they had an agreement to buy him first from Lyn Oslo. 

&gt; Real have asked about signing Ramires, who cost Chelsea about Â£20 million, but are unlikely to allow Modric to depart. 

&gt; Tomas Kalas has joined Cologne, who have been promoted back to the top flight in Germany, on loan . The defender, 21, made his debut in the 2-0 win away to Liverpool in April and started in the last match of the season. He has also made one appearance for the Czech Republic.

It isn't as easy for (most) first-generation ones, particularly ones from the more English-deprived parts of the world. Which is my whole point; some of these, take Poles or Spaniards, for example, make legitimate contributions.

I agree with much of the rest of what you're saying, except:

&gt;indian culture where rape is normal

I'm an Indian: this isn't really true. Yes, rapes happen, disproportionately, even, but I think you'll find that most every Indian is against the rape culture.

Sexism, on the other hand, that's everywhere, and is disgusting. So, yeah, it's an inferior culture that way.

And,

You could still say that this is not the direction the club wants to go, and that's perfectly fine (e.g. Real Madrid or Chelsea themselves). 

Then I'd suggest we stop wasting such enormous amounts of money on academies, youth players, international networks of teams and scouts and stick to the buying.

By now we have the potential in the academy to integrate some potentially world class players (Boga, Musonda, Chalobah,...). We can be like Bayern (a combination of both systems, still spending when needed), we only need to take the first step. 

Imagine how much this would help us out in FFP and homegrown rules (Bayern for example, is a hugely profitable organisation).

Fair enough.

But I'm afraid I still have to disagree about the East Asian bit. I'll be honest - I don't have very many facts, but lower middle class Indian society is rather similar to East Asian, regarding academics. The reason they work and study so hard is, I assure you, almost always because of parental pressure.

It isn't always 'active' pressure - there's often subtle conditioning from childhood up. ""You should become an engineer, go to grad school, study hard, etc. You don't want to be like one of the worthless whites, do you? All clever people become doctors,"" and so on, until the child eventually feels like a dog turd unless he becomes a doctor or whatnot.

It's very hard to quantify, so you'll just have to take my word for it - but being surrounded by that culture, I assure you, it's very real. Thank Christ my parents are okay.

The author wonders why young Muslims feel adrift and then goes on to attack their culture, assert the worst examples of Islam in a less developed country are universaliseable to all Muslims and openly calls them inferior. I imagine if I were a minority who was constantly vilified, insulted and suspected of terrorism I would be developing a blitz spirit of my own against the majority, a majority who had backed the killing and torture of huge numbers of my co-religionists.

Multi-culturalism is derided because it doesn't force minorities to conform to 'our culture' whatever that may be (I'm pretty sure Gove doesn't believe in the same values a Green party supporter does for instance) but the simple basis of multi-culturalism is that being unpleasant to people doesn't make them likely to see the merits of your values. Multiculturalism lets other cultures keep their own practices wrote exposed to majority values, hopefully allowing them to embrace the positive aspects of that culture. Forcing a minority of people who already feel alienated to be 'better'is a really good way to get people's backs up, to generate a Muslim Blitz spirit.

It wasn't ridiculously violent ( unless of course you include the Friday nights ) but I've definitely seen some things I'd rather not have and there's definitely the culture of ""hard lads"" are better lads which I always hated there. 

I just don't see how being able to use your fists and/or intimidation to get what you want makes you a better person and how that relates to people thinking that they're higher up the food chain. In fact I always saw it as the opposite.

The Department for Transport has long been anti metric. For years the said no change should happen until the majority of driver had a metric education.  Their costing for conversion is also frankly ludicrous. (FOI requests  show the costs of sign replacement at less than 10% of the DoT claims)

One of my good friends was raised a couple of valleys across from me, where it was a lot rougher. 

Where I lived, there was never any real violence at all, whereas at his place, there was loads. He said he had to be always on the look out when out and about, giving the wrong look or saying the wrong thing to the wrong person could easily start a fight. In my place, it was the opposite, you smiled and said hello to everyone you saw, and it was always reciprocated.

I've carried that through my life. When we were at uni together going to free parties and such, there'd always be some ""big scary looking sted'eds"" and I'd have no issues with going to chat to them. Everyone seemed to respond in a friendly way to me. My friend used to be weary of speaking to these sorts of people, because in his experience, they'd jump him.

It's kind of sad, because he's a really decent and smart guy, but dickheads in his local area have effectively made him sceptical of the entire human race by default, whereas, being raised away from violence, I have a lot of faith in even the scary looking people being decent if you treat them like a friend.

He always says one day I'll get my comeuppance, but I've never really been in a fight, and he always seems to be getting attacked on nights out.

true,CultureShipinabottle,null,null,"I can empathise completely /u/Kartfan. I was born and bred to Irish immigrant parents and grew up on pretty rough housing estates in Camden during the 70-'s and early 80's. The estate itself was surrounded by even bigger rougher housing estates. 

The sense of permanent low-grade violence was quite pervasive. It was a sort of background malevolence that being the Hardest bloke put you at the top of the tree.  Estate v Estate fighting was fairly common and as usual would only be subsumed if it became larger and then involved estates from further away.

Being smart or going against the grain wasn't even an option as it was just inconceivable to most people. This was the life they were born into and a wider world didn't exist much beyond a seaside holiday or later on a week in Spain. 

The Troubles and the culture at the time meant I was endlessly subjected to 'Thick Paddy' jokes. 

Skinheads V Teds V Punks gave way to Casuals but the threats of sudden violence in pubs or just walking to and from the shops was still there.

Eventually when I was fourteen or so I got the biggest kicking of my life from a local hard man - occasionally he'd go round people's house and beat/ slap their Dads in front of anyone to give a warning to them.

The fucker punched me so hard in the balls that I was helpless from the start, he then laughed and with his fucking basket weave shoes (it was the 80's) kicked me so hard in the mouth my two front teeth shattered and he broke his toe. the only thing I could do was roll under a nearby car to stop any more punishment.

The only good that came out of it was my absolute determination to get the fuck out of there as soon as humanely possible.

He's still around apparently, drives a cab and has calmed down.

That was twenty five years ago - I now live in a pretty big house surrounded by the glorious Chiltern hills with a beautiful wife and son having had the chance to travel round the world. I work at home, for myself and get well paid for doing so. So the old 'success is the best revenge' applies.   

But like yourself my wife who grew up in the home counties is absolutely horrified when I when tell her about it. She's runs her own counselling and therapy business so I'm a bit of a guinea-pig and she can spot behaviours I still exhibit after all these years - a certain caution if out late at night, even if it's somewhere harmless, an aptitude for spotting potential trouble etc.

But a remaining down side is a constant low grade struggle to remind myself that the world is mostly a benign place - the vast majority of people are just trying to get from A to B (without drowning in the C) and are not (consciously at least) out to lord it over everyone else through projecting their willingness to resort to violence.

I think Begbie in Trainspotting and Joe Pesci's De-Vito character in Goodfellas are brilliant and horribly accurate portrayals of the kind of people who seem to thrive in such places

true,lokkenmor,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"My biggest complaint with respect to that article is that it's promoting a one-way system of cultural exchange that implicitly permeates this idea that British culture is superior to Islamic cultures in all aspects. It fails to highlight the fact that there is some good to be found in other cultures and integrated into our own because it would improve our culture overall.

The article has obviously cherry-picked a poignant, timely and unambiguously cultural behaviour practised by a minority of Muslims to attack, e.g. Stoning, which is fair enough because no-one except hardline Muslim adherents is going to try and defend it, but it could at least have pointed out that there is good to be found in Muslim cultural norms too, e.g. the *Zakat* - one of the five pillars of Islam - which ordains that people should give 2.5% of their **savings**^1 to charity or to those in need.

Wishfully, if everyone were to give a bit of their unused savings to charity every month or so (and I appreciate it sounds a bit like a charities tax, but a well intentioned one that should be optional) or gave a bit of their time then I think it could help to address some of the issue we're facing here in the UK just now (the shameful rise in the utilisation of food banks and rates of homelessness).

This shouldn't be presented as a one-way system where ""British values"" are extolled and nothing of merit can be found elsewhere, we have cultural problems ourselves (greed, selfishness, lack of community) that need to be addressed and some of the solutions to those cultural deficits might be found in from other cultures.

That's where we diverge.  I don't think that the police can't investigate the police because they're police, but because they're compromised and corrupt right the way up (I'm speaking largely of the Met here).  The rank odor of the various cover ups still linger - Brinks Mat, Lawrence, Morgan, the supergrass fiascoes - and their record continues to speak to this very eloquently.  

The deployment of corrupt officers to investigate their colleagues goes right back to pre-CIB days, and where honest officers and those from other forces have been used they have consistently been undermined from within at the most senior levels.  Remarkably, evidence of corruption hasn't ended officers' careers, but has surprisingly often seen them promoted, at times to anti-corruption and/or undercover/intelligence units, and this seems to result from power struggles within the hierarchy of policing itself.  Factionalism and conflicting loyalties (e.g. to fellow Masons in the case of the corruption allegations raised by the report we're discussing here) are far more dangerous during secret internal investigations.

*""the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.""* - Oxford English Dictionary

I've met plenty of muslims who have no issue with our culture, who integrate fine, who understand and accept our culture. They still do their muslim things but they do it in a respectful and tolerant way. 

[There are 140 muslim schools in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom#Education), approximately 20 of which have been suspect as being unacceptable. So 15% maybe? And this plot is apparently a plot by a few leaders of the schooling district, so the actual guilty parties here is a small handful of individuals.

Implying muslim culture is ""not equal"" and therefore all muslims are inferior, because of the actions of a minority, IMO fits perfectly with the OED definition of racism.

I'm not saying the teaching in the trojan horse schools is acceptable. But there was unacceptable teaching at [76 school just between october and December 2013](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/latest-official-statistics-maintained-school-inspections-and-outcomes). There is evidence that it's possible to teach unacceptably and not be muslim. There is evidence (in the 120 other muslim schools) that the majority of muslim schools teach acceptably. Therefore, it's flawed to conclude that muslim culture or education is inherently not equal to ours.


edit: just to confirm, the issue at the heart of the trojan horse plot is that some leaders don't know how to run a school properly. It just so happens that some of these leaders were muslim. There's also a big chance that they were male, they probably wore socks and they probably had all shopped in a Tesco Express before.

A lot of the debate (which is a generous view) around this topic seems to be hampered by post-Imperial guilt: even if we thought at the time our form of life was superior it was morally reprehensible to force anyone into it, and even more so to march into a country and force a small ruling elite people into it and fundamentally screw over everyone else.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;You realize the UK taxi market alone is around $15bn/year in revenue and employes around 300,000 people ?

But Uber have their business model at charging 5% commission.  So comparing gross revenue to it is a little bit miss leading.

I think the reason their valuation has been so high, is that with Google interactions they plan to make things pretty much automated, not just the whole driverless cars thing, but it knows where you are, where you are going and that data is very valuable too.

The fact still exists that as a factor of potential Gross Revenue, it's a very, very high valuation, people are expecting Uber to significantly increase the number of trips made.

However, myself I'm siding with the cabbies on this one, the government mandates they do a lot of expensive (even if pointless for me!) things like disabled ramps, in exchange for this they are allowed to pick people up off the street, and bill on a meter.  Billing on a meter is important because it takes all risk out of being a driver, you can give an estimate, but it's the meter that ensures they will never loose money.  Minicabs have to take on that risk, provide a flat fee, so that the user knows upfront what it will cost.

All Uber need to do, is charge flat rate for the route in London and they are fine.  They don't want to do this because it means they have risk in their prices, so they or their drivers have to either eat the losses, or charge more.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I take your point about Zakat, although there are two things to consider that moderate it slightly.  

All the Abrahamic religions have a charitable ethic, so this isn't, as its occasionally claimed to be some kind of USP for Islam.

These charitable principles came about before the advent of modern state fiscal systems, welfare states, redistributive taxation - etc.  Theologically, you could either view them as an additional obligation of the religious on top of that normal in society.  Or you could say that they are merely an obsolete relic of a time when charity or social justice wasn't dealt with by secular society (indeed, before there was a secular society).

( Or am I wrong?  Maybe Zakat is on top of tax)

I have to say, as a socialist, I have an increasing amount of sympathy with the Right on these kind of issues.  Maybe we have swung too far in the direction of ""political correctness"".  The article raised some good examples of where cultural relativism harms individual rights.  And in a sense, all across the political spectrum, this is recognised in theory.  The problem is that most of the political spectrum is avoiding the whole issue for reasons of expediency - which means its becoming the preserve of racists and xenophobes.

And the whole debate is marked by signs of this; stupid, dog-whistle cliches; harking back to the Empire; ""if you don't like it here, why don't you just go home"" etc.

I think a definite start to detoxifying the issues would be eschew all talk of ""British"" values and get back to talking about secular, humanist ones.  Unfortunately that isn't what politicians want.  They *do* want dog-whistle politics, fomented controversies about a tiny minority of prototype Muslim schools, and fear and suspicion of terrorism, for all the usual reasons.

true,Jestar342,null,null,"Whilst my parents bought a decent house in a decent-ish part of town, due to the schools I went to I ""grew up"" on some rough estates in London (UK). 

Quickly you learn to keep your eyes down and your mouth shut, lest someone put a foot or fist into it. Plenty of scraps in school. When I hit adolescence things were getting worse. I got involved in some of the rougher groups, hooliganism was still going quite strong in football, though it was being cracked down upon by the police and one could argue that because it was becoming covert, it got nasty. Weapons were making more and more appearances. As the scraps got less frequent, they typically had more emphasis put on them by the rival groups, so nutters would tool up to make sure they had an advantage. I've seen people get cut. ""Chelsea smiles"" and the like.

I had ""friends"" in C18 and the NF. I kept those groups at an arms reach and somehow, despite plenty of peer pressure to partake, I always knew it wasn't right so kept out. 

I didn't enjoy any of that, but thought it was the done thing so repressed my feelings and stuck with it.

It wasn't until I was in my early twenties that I had my eyes opened to the rest of the world outside of this hate filled hell, after I started working and met other people. I quickly left it and everyone I knew from it behind.

I was a bouncer at various pubs and clubs from 17 years of age. This is before licensing. I didn't like it much, but I've always taken pride in my work. I am fortunate to be able to say I didn't throw a single punch during my 5 year career as a bouncer. Received quite a few, but nothing more than a slight bruise. Yes, I've picked people up and physically thrown them out, but I only did so when all reason failed and they were a threat to other patrons and/or colleagues or myself.

My parents would hit me if I misbehaved. The only thing it ever taught me is to try harder not to get caught again, and that hitting someone when they annoyed you was ok. I, regrettably, used this logic on my sister a lot in my early years. 

I grew up very, very angrily. I've had a number of very regrettable confrontations in my past. I've had the ever loving crap kicked out of me on a number of occasions, as well as I have given others a kicking.

I think the only thing that stopped me from getting involved in a lot of the nasty stuff was my own arrogance and snobbery that I was better than that, because that's what it was. It wasn't knowledge. I had nothing that could prove I was better than these people, I had no reason to believe I was better, other than just *knowing* I was better. The others had similar backgrounds to me. Ok, they were in council flats and I wasn't, but my family was just as broke and dysfunctional as theirs, and culturally you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between my upbringing and any of theirs. So who the fuck was I to think I was better, eh? This personal conflict of am I better or not was constantly on my mind, but I would always persist with the arrogance that I do know better than this and this isn't the only way to live.

The anxiety suffered in that kind of environment, knowing that trouble was a heartbeat away, meant there was a lot of substance abuse. I've lost two friends to drugs, and just about everyone is alcoholic. My own arrogance kept me away from this too. I'm above putting that shit in my system. But.. what the fuck do I know? Who the fuck am I to say that? The conflict continued, but I never did anything stronger than a bit of puff.

Wow. This post is a rambling brain dump of mess. Sorry about that. It has dug up some pretty horrible things that I must have buried and I'm feeling a bit emotional about it all now.

Which again, you either completely missed, or just refuse to answer it.

As for the Indian culture thing, it might be a wilful ignorance. I don't know enough about it, so for that I apologise, I can only go with what I know. But the part I have mentioned, can you categorically deny it exists?

As for how our society was the same way back when. Yes it was, but then it was way back when. We've moved on, so why should we allow those way back when values to exist in our society nowadays. If you want to come to the UK, then you should be prepared to accept the British values. 

I left the UK because I can commute for my job and my girlfriend who is Swedish cannot. So it made sense for me to move there. Which has a slightly different culture to the UK. So I'm now on the government provided course (SFI - Swedish for Immigrants) to learn both the language and the culture. And I can add the best part of the UK culture to that, which has been mentioned a few times in my dealings with the Swedish people, namely, my politeness and manners. I'm not going there expecting them to just assuage to everything British.

Also, where have I lambasted the best things about being British? Allowing immigrants to come in and ride roughshod over our culture and traditions is one of the best things. I don't think so. And most people would probably agree with me, in fact I think they do, as we're seeing immigration and such like getting discussed more and more.

But sorry, I forgot, we must accept the sexism and fgm and the stoning and the honour killings because accepting everything about other cultures is the best way to go about things......

edit: BTW, was it not recently that a Sikh man stabbed his daughter-in-law in the eyes in front of her children, thinking she'd had an affair with a Pakistani man? And all that had happened was she'd been the victim of prank calls. Sorry, but that's not something that happens in British culture. That's a relic from abroad, which is what I want to get rid of.

I started to work as a (2009ish)PR for an alternative nightclub and i've seen people fighting in the street, and one memorable night i was right in front of someone as they a glass bottle smashed over their head, and i've seen giant groups of people spoiling for a fight.    

Theres used to be an undercurrent of violence in Glasgow city centre, and some nights its like you can physically feel it. Not to long ago my fiancÃ©e was mugged when she got off the bus just round the corner from our old flat. A wee while ago someone was stabbed round the corner of our new flat.

Any institution, religious or otherwise, needs to be open to criticism. The alternative is that the human beings that run that organisation should be treated as infallible and unaccountable. However, the phrasing of this article is off and just reactionary drivel. It's phrased like only Islam is the problem, other faith schools are fine.

true,widgetas,null,null,"On the subject of prayer in school assemblies (or otherwise) and hymns being mandatory (i.e. collective worship legislation), folks will often say that the child doesn't have to take part, or that the parents can opt the child out. Of course it's not that simple and when it comes to singing hymns or ""everyone bow your heads"", it's not hard to conclude what might happen to a child who chooses not to sing etc. in the moment. 

Certainly I can remember children being told off in assembly for not singing: primarily it will likely be seen as a refusal to join in/standing up to authority. I was always afraid that I would be told off for not bowing my head when the assembly teacher asked everyone too so they could pray. Thankfully I wasn't, but the whole idea of it pisses me off more and more when I think about it. The fundamental presumption that children should be instilled with one or any religious teaching by a state funded school... grr.

As it stands children can't 'opt themselves out' of assembly etc. legally until they're 16. There's a significant double standard going on there: children are deemed capable of calling themselves *insert religion here* at a young age, but can't decide they are *not* a religion and don't want any part of it until they are of a particular age.

As the ensuing corruption investigations widened, the obscene publications squad was replaced in its entirety with a new group of officers drawn from the uniformed branch, and in all over 20 detectives were dismissed or required to resign.

But I can tell you that it took several weeks for Google to update its map so that a major road (where 6 months of bridge repairs were in progress) near me was removed from its list of possible routes.  And when a road like the A57 Snake Pass is closed, Google will still try to send you across it - until someone notices it's shut, and updates accordingly.  That all takes time.

And I know, most/all religions have a charitable angle to them but none is so prescriptive (to my knowledge) as Islam is. I know the priest, when I was growing up, said you should give to charity and to those less fortunate and offer help when you can but I seldom see people actually doing it on a day-to-day basis.

It's not a perfect example, it's just something I used to highlight the idea that we're not perfect and maybe we could learn a thing or to from other cultures. Like more freely giving donations to charity, rather than needing to be prompted to given them. Not sitting on pile of wealth (if you have them) and using them for some good instead of being greedy.

I know the *Zakat* is solicited by the fact it's required to be a good Muslim but I'd like to see the dogma taken out of it, the idea of voluntary charitable giving becoming a norm in our society and people actually following through with it.

For the rest of it I agree. Get rid of the ""British"" hyperbole and bring it back to simply being decent human beings (keeping it secular). PC has gone too far an needs to be reigned in and people need to be able to call a spade a spade without being shouted down and racist or intolerant.

What constitutes a mere passing phase in American history, in a small segment of the economy, constitutes for that individual the bulk of his life. This is the fundamental tension between a nation and an individual. Nations operate on a different clock than individuals. Under most circumstances, where the individuals affected are few and disorganized, the nation grinds down the individual. In those cases where the individual understands that his children might make a significant leap forward, the individual might acquiesce. But when the affected individuals form a substantial bloc, and when even the doubling of an economy might not make a significant difference in the happiness of children, they might well resist.

The important point here is to focus on the clock, on the different scales of time and how they change things.""

The black cabs are arguing that the legislation as written prohibits any device for charging based on measuring distance and time and not just ones that could cause someone to confuse a blackcab and minicab.

No-one has challenged other methods of charging by time/distance (map, lookup tables, watch) and it's been generally accepted that they're allowed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_classification) yes, people who share a common religion can be described as a race.

The criticism (or implying inferiority) of an entire race of, based on the actions of a minority within that race aligns pretty closely with the OED definition of race. Do you agree? If not, why?

&gt; Does this also apply to Christians, Jews and atheists? 

Yes. Why wouldn't it?

&gt; surely the criticisms of non-believers in the Quran would make the Quran (and anyone who believes it) racist...

Yes, I think if a Muslim person were to say ""I'm better than you because you're christian and therefore inferior"" then yes. The person is saying that because I fall in a certain group of people, I must hold a certain characteristic which makes me inferior.

I have no issues with people voicing their criticisms of a religion if they can back it up with evidence, and they make sure their criticism is only applied to the people it's relevant to.  

This article though, clearly implies that Islam is inferior, and therefore, so are all it's followers. However, what the author really means is that they don't like that subset of people who don't integrate into society, and don't run school's properly. None of the muslims I know fit into that subset, but they've all been deemed inferior by the article's author, by association. Do you think that is right?

To make up for this lack of knowledge though, Google Maps can actually find the fastest route given **current** tracking conditions. This is something cab drivers can do if they communicate, but only along common routes.

Well wow, here I thought it was solely based off skin colour.

&gt;The criticism (or implying inferiority) of an entire race of, based on the actions of a minority within that race aligns pretty closely with the OED definition of race. Do you agree? If not, why?

Sure

&gt;Yes. Why wouldn't it?

Because double standards

&gt;This article though, clearly implies that Islam is inferior, and therefore, so are all it's followers. However, what the author really means is that they don't like that subset of people who don't integrate into society, and don't run school's properly. None of the muslims I know fit into that subset, but they've all been deemed inferior by the article's author, by association. Do you think that is right?

Yes in the fact that Islam is an inferior set of laws, values and practices when compared to British laws, values and practices. However, this doesn't translate to all Muslims, nor do I think the author implies this. If Muslims follow the laws or values that are in conflict with British laws and values they're morally inferior if Muslims don't then they're not. The fact that the 'majority' of Muslims don't follow all of Islam's laws and practices to the letter doesn't make Islam any less barbaric or any less inferior as a value system. 

So while it may be a 'minority' of the Muslim run schools and teachers teaching a extreme form of Islam. The more 'moderate' ones are still teaching an inferior value system to presumably thousands of students each year - a percentage of whom will follow the laws and values which are in conflict with British laws and values - which would otherwise be avoided if they were instead taught a superior one.

I mean, it's not quite an English Parliament, but it's close. England almost always gets its way. I seriously doubt the politics of an English Parliament would really be any different from that of Westminster. Then again, different procedures and a fairer voting system might result in something genuinely different.

&gt; I'm sure if it was a good thing they'd vote for it but most here don't like the idea of more MPs on the payroll, more forms of governance and the hassle that comes along with it.

I'm not saying those players are not talented but they probably cost more than they should have. In addition English clubs would prefer to avoid selling to teams in their own division for competitive reasons. During Levy's tenure we have focused on buying young players (Bale, Eriksen, Walker) from other leagues that we hope to develop or somewhat unknown players that performed well in other leagues (Modric, Berbatov). This system has been pretty successful and I think that it will continue to be successful. It keeps us competitive while we develop the business side of the club (new stadium, training facility) to put us on the same playing field financially as some of the wealthier clubs in the league.

Religious people, who have been brought up to view morality as a set of instructions handed down from god, sometimes find it quite hard to understand how atheists view morality.

To an atheist, the religious view seems quite odd. How can something as fundamental as morality be reduced to simply obedience? If something is morally wrong then it's wrong - you shouldn't have to be told it's wrong, and a command from a higher being doesn't change wrong into right or vice versa.

So I'm guessing the parents chose to send their kids to ACE schools unlike the Trojan Horse school families.

I've never heard of this kind of school before and was surprised no mention of the established CofE and Catholic schools that exist throughout the UK. [Looking at ACE listed schools online](http://www.christian-education.org/schools/choosing-a-school/uk-schools/) this seems like a real minority contrasted against the number of CofE/Catholic faith schools out there. Also the CofE/Catholic schools are registered state schools just like the Trojan Horse schools in question. Its actually interesting that Jonny Scaramanga finished his GCSE's at a Methodist school.

I'm glad I never went to a Fundamentalist school as a child but to conflate these ACE schools with the Trojan Horse schools is a misnomer. The 'infiltration' and 'state school' aspect being the key differences I think. I don't think for any period it was pleasant growing up in an ACE environment but I don't think going to school when they used cane's in equally rigid environments was pleasant either. Yes they should be more closely monitored but they aren't teaching that various ethnic or racial groups are prostitutes.

Madrid played 4-4-2 as opposed to a three man central midfield and there was a lot of pressure on Alonso and Modric in the centre because Bayern had numerical advantage and could create overloads. Modric's performances in those games were fantastic, he was incredibly disciplined and covered vast swathes of the pitch in defence, whilst also starting numerous fast counter-attacks with quick balls forward, which is probably the main weakness in Ramires' game, and one of the main features of Mourinho's teaams. His work rate is definitely one of the main features of his game, [he covered more ground for Madrid in the champs league last year than any other player](http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2014/statistics/round=2000479/players/index.html#order=3desc).

I agree. As someone else has said, gun crime is a symptom of other issues. However, I have no issues with measures being put in place to reduce symptoms whilst we tackle causes.

Do you have any evidence for this?

And could you also explain how the British Empire was specifically authoritarian and not the other two countries you mentioned? 

In addition to this, I never denied that Churchill was anti-communist, the tensions that led to the Cold War were present long before Churchill got into power.

Do drug dealers ask for ID? (the girl who supplied the drugs in this case was only 17 at the time) It's honestly easier to get your hands on illegal drugs as an under-18 than it is to buy alcohol or cigarettes. Again this is a result of our current drugs policies.

Legalising drugs would not legalise drug dealers, moreover I find it unlikely that dealers would be able to remain competitive with a legalised regulated market. In such an environment we could restrict drugs from those under a certain age, in our current environment we are almost powerless to control the market!

Regardless of everything I've just said above, young people in general have always experimented and pushed boundaries. They will continue to do so and our educational policies need to step up. They should not be so focused on the ""dangers"" of drugs and instead should promote the measures that are required in order to use drugs in a safe as possible manner, while also explaining the potential negative consequences in as concise and reasonable fashion as possible.",0,1402585100,null,0,false,0,ci5p8bl,t3_27yk10,t1_ci5p8bl,t1_ci5oyl1,null,1434206915,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29
true,free2bejc,null,null,"Thanks that makes sense. A lot of the old Eastern Block countries have had a rather large emphasis on learning English or another foreign language. Still not sure how that corresponds with others though. French students are still taught English etc. Maybe there's simply less of a desire or parental pressure on learning it. 

Also you may be interested to know that on equally anecdotal evidence. The Germans learn British English and American English separately or at least one after another. Certainly they tend to know there's a difference which is good.
