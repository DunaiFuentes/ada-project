true,Brian,null,null,"That potential isn't currently actual, since most of that electricity is still being generated from fossil fuels (mostly coal and gas).

And even when using electrical heating, the LED bulbs *still* have the potential to be better, since you can do stuff like heat water at low electricity tarrifs (ie overnight, if drawing from the mains, or during the day if you've your own solar panels whenever they're running an excess) when that power would otherwise be wasted.  Even assuming you always want heat at the same time as light, it's not neccessarily the case that you'll want to *generate* the heat at the same time as light, but incandescents link the two inextricably.  

&gt;So, on paper, a person in Scotland using incandescent bulbs with gas heating is actually MORE ""green"" than someone with CFLs in the same home because a small portion of their heating is being met by renewable electrical sources and reducing their CO2 output.

How is that true?  It's not like the CFLs are actually *losing* you power here - all the inefficiencies are still being lost to heat, just like incandescent, it's just that there is less inefficiency, so you're using less power to get the light without the heat.  Putting that unused power into an electric heater (that you've stupidly mounted on the roof for some reason) would be doing the *exact same* as what the incandescent would be doing - no better and no worse (save that you can now choose to get the heat without the light, or the light without the heat).  It's no worse even in the worst case, and has the potential to be better (in the current power generation environment) by using something other than an electric heater to avoid the huge conversion inefficiencies that currently involves, as well as generating that heat where less will be lost.

&gt;ps gas also has ""transmission losses"",

Nowhere near the electricity inefficiencies as currently generated.  When it's done in a plant, you're turning the fuel into heat, then very inefficiently (~40% IIRC) turning that heat into electricity, which you then transmit to the home (incurring further transmission losses - around 8% in the UK according to [this](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.LOSS.ZS)) just to turn it back into heat.  By contrast, gas leakage rates seem to be around 0.5% of total usage (going by [this](http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/methaneuk/chapter07.pdf), after which you're turning it into heat with essentially 100% efficiency (or inefficiency, depending how you look at it).",0,1408662208,null,0,false,0,cjwynds,t3_2e66n6,t1_cjwynds,t1_cjwk6xd,null,1435369071,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The more interesting question I suppose is why this happens.  The angry response is to claim greed in the seller, the rational response looks into taxes and economies of scale.  But it's often the same companies (like Apple) selling into both markets, they're not going to give away free-money in the US by underselling themselves; neither are they going to turn away extra profit that might be had by disproportionately increased sales for small price decreases in the UK.

&gt; As social beings we have certain responsibilities if we want to survive. This includes firstly reproduction, and secondly parents showing a level of care/altruism towards their offspring

The species' need to continue does not mean that every single member in it must reproduce. In fact, there are ethical reasons for individuals to choose not to reproduce and that that might be better for society as a whole. Another viable option to perpetuate (some of) your own genes is to help a family member raise their kids.

That aside, though, this smacks of [naturalistic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy).


&gt;If you find early on that one multicellular cluster would be outperformed by another with greater potential to create the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people

What if an individual can only produce a kid with DS? Not every woman can just abort one fetus and cook up another one. Since DS correlates (imperfectly) with age, sometimes a woman's only choice is to have a kid with DS. The family I knew had tried to have kids for years. The woman got pregnant at 45 with twins. One kid had DS and the other didn't. Selective reduction in a high-risk pregnancy (given her age) was off the table. Was her choice not to abort still immoral?


&gt;the particular human being a drain on society with nothing to contribute.

Because this is your assertion, I will counter with mine and just say that I strongly disagree that ""many"" people with Down Syndrome contribute ""nothing"" to society. Besides, putting a family member into care is increasingly expensive and increasingly reserved for the socially elite. I don't think this is a significant portion of DS folks anymore but can't find stats on it. In my experience taking care of persons with DS in the US and Venezuela, living at home was the norm.

To get more abstract, though, what authority can claim that an individual person contributes nothing to society?


&gt;The main downside to his immutable logic is that it completely disregards the very real emotions attached to the imagined potential people have for their unborn multicellular clusters.

Here's my main point: The main downside to his ~~immutable logic~~ assertion he is saying that the decision that HE would make is the *only moral decision for anyone to make in that situation*. That anyone who has knowingly birthed a kid with Down Syndrome has acted immorally. Based on his later tweets, presumably this is because people without Down Syndrome always contribute more to society than people who have DS. This is poor logic, as someone later down the thread points out with their ~~Godwin~~ example of Hitler—he arguably contributed negatively to society and very well would have done less damage if he'd been born with DS.

Down Syndrome is a very complex disorder. A person can carry an extra chromosome in all of their cells or only part. And the portion of extra chromosome varies widely, as does the extent of the damage. That people with DS always contribute less and that people who do not have DS always contribute more is bullshit. So to say that abortion is THE ONLY moral choice is untenable.


&gt; In my opinion Dawkins should get the fuck off twitter.

If he can't resist commenting on topics that are outside his areas of expertise, then I completely agree with you. His logic error is unfortunately common among people who are intellectually gifted in certain areas—that his brilliance in certain topics extends to all.

&gt; Let Liverpool take him, they can replace one insane assbag with another. I'd be more inclined to let Arsene pick out a class, non-big-name hidden gem than go for the obvious choice household name who also happens to be an assbag. Also if we're talking big name bargain buys, Reus is the one to go for, and also not an assbag.

Balotelli came to City at a time in his life when he was still a boy, he had suffered years of abuse and racism in his native Italy, and we supported him unconditionally - in spite of all the growing pains.

He really appreciated it.

His comments on leaving City to join AC Milan:

&gt;""For sure I will remember my brilliant team-mates, the manager and all the supporters. They are the best, they were great with me and I will always have a very special place in my heart for City, it’s a great club with a great future,” he declared.  “I thank them for all of their support of me. Maybe one day we will see each other again."" 

And:

&gt; “I will always be interested in Manchester City and their fortunes.  I really hope that City can win the league again this year and beat United. I think there are great players at the Club and a great manager too. The club will be very successful in the future and that makes me happy.”

Mata is the nearest thing to an exception, although his tendancy to appear on the highlights reel but be anonymous for large parts of the game is too big an issue to avoid.

Lukaku is simply too complacent and lazy, he thinks he has made it already, when he is no more than a squad striker at best. He needs to put more effort in if he is to live up to his potential.

De Bruyne was simply not as good as the others we have in his position, surplus to requirements, no regrets.

Luiz was a good squad defender, but never the first name on the team sheet. Not a long term replacement for Terry, Matic covers the holding role better. No regrets.

Sturridge currently would make a good 2nd choice striker, but he is simply not good enough currently to spearhead a title winning team, despite his vast improvement since his lacklustre days with us and City.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Islam is a religion of over 1 billion followers...

It's like asking a group of moderate Christians to act against a form of the Westboro Baptist Church that had a military presence almost 1 million strong. It's not easy.

The truth is that the average British Muslim on the street can do pretty much fuck all about ISIS, no matter how strongly they oppose it. They're here, they're not in Iraq and if they *did* fly over to the Middle East to fight against it they'd probably just be killed. What good would that do anyone? Here in the UK, actual Muslims have no more power to stop this than non-Muslims. Unfortunately, they do have the ability to add to ISIS' forces if they become extremists who buy into the whole ""let's have a caliphate!"" thing. This is a problem in our country since it was an actual British citizen who beheaded James Foley... this cannot be denied. This *is* a real problem in our country. But it's not a problem caused by Muslims as a group. It's a problem caused by a smaller group of extremists *within* the Muslim group.

Muslims are not some huge monolithic borg-minded force. They're a billion invidiuals with their own thoughts and opinions. This ISIS bullshit isn't supported by every Muslim on the planet - it's in fact supported by a very vocal, very dangerous minority. 

Personally I would actually support military action against ISIS. Yes, it means more troops in Iraq. It means troops in Syria. It means more bullshit in the Middle East. But ISIS have been committing *genocide* and if there's any good reason to go to war, that's it. Especially since Britain seems to be directly affected by it with our own citizens choosing to join their side... 

If it's a Jihad they want, maybe we should fucking give them one. Provided we can avoid civilian casualties... that's the real problem. We probably can't. That's what makes this so difficult...

I genuinely don't buy that it's just market fluctuations or cultural purchasing habits.... well certainly not on a macro scale. As far as I'm concerned its mostly market segmentation (aka DVD regions aka extract as much money from each customer as possible).  I'd need to see more to be convinced of a different argument.  
Market segmentation is a perfectly acceptable game to play but the issue is always that you risk pissing the customers off if its too obvious.  

&gt; But it's often the same companies (like Apple) selling into both markets

and market segmentation doesn't make that a confusing scenario at all.

One of the main reasons stated for these reforms was to stop grade inflation. However, these statistics suggest the only ones who've had their grades fall are those already at the bottom, who sit on the boundary between passing and failing. Surely this suggests these reforms have failed? Is making those who are already at the bottom fail harder a way to increase standards?

If you make exams more difficult, you don't increase standards. Those who normally get the top grades will study harder, whereas those who aren't as academically minded won't be able to keep up, and will fall by the wayside more often. If they really want to reform education, they need to look at how to help these people, not throw more into the syllabus and pat themselves on the back. One idea is adding more vocational courses, but that doesn't fit the narrative of making education more academic and like it used to be. 

I also think the changes to the English course are absolutely ludicrous. I can understand, to an extent, wanting to change the way coursework is done. However, they seem to have a completely warped view of what coursework is. My English coursework, for example, included modules where I had to stand in front of the class and give a presentation. Another module was listening to a speech (I think by Martin Luther King Jr, perhaps Barack Obama), and analysing the techniques used. How is removing these and substituting them with a longer written exam better?  You're removing core components of English (the subject) to fit this warped ideology that longer exams and more old fashioned teaching methods are better, which is quite frankly ludicrous. 

I watched [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents#t-682132) interesting TED talk the other day, by James Flynn, about why our IQ is higher now than it was in the past. One of the main reasons, he suggested, is that we are better at understanding hypothetical situations now than we could in the past, where people could only take things at face value. By pushing exams to be more and more about cramming in lots of facts, rather than having variety and actual thinking questions, they are going against the progress that has led to us becoming more and more intelligent over the last century. It seems ridiculous that Gove, someone who pushed the idea of Academies and teacher and local people taking control of education, has gone completely against the views of the vast majority of teachers and people in the country by pushing through these draconian education reforms.",0,1408665726,null,0,false,0,cjx0a6p,t3_2e7h8y,t1_cjx0a6p,t3_2e7h8y,null,1435369959,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Equally they're not all young - Soldado &amp; Paulinho were 28 and 25, I believe that it's easier for younger players to adapt quickly to the prem as they are haven't had the time to become used to a certain other style.

The difference is we have a mixture of both.  We have prem experience and non-prem experience. Those who do have proven they can fit in a solid passing, pressing, attacking system in this league. The non-prem guys are young (Can, Markovic, Moreno, Manquillo) and have more time and less pressure on them to adapt so they will be given chances. They have also proven they can play in a similar system to ours, it's just a different league. 

It's not really about whether they were known. It's just about whether they can adapt. Lamela and Soldado were great players and they flopped in the prem. I would expect one of our signings to flop, that's just what the odds are. But given that the Southampton boys and Mario have excelled in the prem already I don't see it being them.

Russian - A* (I'm a native)


I'm a bit disappointed. In the end, it all came down to how much effort was put in right before the exams. It's not some measure of ""how smart you are"" or anything, as I know some people who were predicted high and are intelligent/successful overall as people simply didn't revise nor put in the effort... although most ""smart"" people do know of the value of education at this age. I used to put in a lot of effort into school in earlier years, but as the time went on, my motivation dwindled, and I think that by the end, I just pissed about. Seriously, I spent around 6 months doing nothing in my IT lessons. Got a merit, it's alright I guess. Pissed about in the last 2 months of English. Only revised for 2 days for maths. There you have it.


They're not bad results and I won't have any trouble getting into college to do my desired options (Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Physics), but damn I should've revised for a week or two right before the exams just so I could have more to show at the end of it. I also should've read the instructions on the paper - because I fucked up my geography paper - I got an A*, B, and a U. It averaged out to a B in the end, but I answered the questions that I shouldn't have had, as you had to only answer one from each section, and well, I tried to answer them all.

And lots more very small numbers at the low end.

I am going to suspect that average in this context means median or mode, not mean, as they are much less susceptible to outliers.

Which country the minimum wage is lower in is entirely irrelevant to the discussion.

I don't care how Islam in the UK or elsewhere is structured, Islam is causing problems and all UK Muslims are going to have to take a clear stand against fascism.  The fact that there's no Islamic pope doesn't mean that individual Muslims are absolved of a moral duty to speak out about what's happening in their mosques and in their communities.

true,Melberger,null,null,"Initially he was.

Mancini was always a very hard taskmaster, but he made allowances for Balotelli that he didn't for other players. This created a resentment among some players.

However, I think he grew on most of the players after a while. There's no conceit with Mario, he's just himself. And I think everyone realised that while he can often be temperamental and immature, his heart is in the right place.

By the time he left, everyone among the playing staff (to my knowledge) loved him. Even Milner talked about missing him once he'd left, words to the effect of like having a little brother around and now he missed him once he was gone.

But by the time he was preparing to leave City Mancini had been coming down hard on him for any minor discrepancies, he'd totally done a U-turn on the softly approach with Mario. Balotelli was disappointing in many performances, and Mancini knew he couldn't continue to baby him as it would undermine him in the dressing room further.

Mancini grew so frustrated with him that he'd actually be too hard on Balotelli, and i actually think their relationship deteriotated so much that there was a palpable resentment between the two.

Balotelli used to even call Mancini 'papa', but by the time he left it had considerably soured due to Balotellli's exasperation at feeling nothing he did was adequate, and Mancini's frustration at feeling let down.

He really needed a change of scene, as their relationship had broken down.

Worth remembering though, that during that period Mancini was losing the respect of all his squad and he was increasingly alienating all of them with his aloof dictatorial managerial style. 

But back on Balo, I think he's matured since then. He's described his time at City as a valuable learning curve and a positive experience for him to grow up.

He's still Mario though. Which means expect to tear your hair out a lot at how such a talented player can often look so ordinary.",0,1408680161,null,0,false,0,cjx6iir,t3_2e6cje,t1_cjx6iir,t1_cjx4qsr,null,1435446274,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

---

&gt;

&gt;__Royal warrants of appointment__ have been issued for centuries to those who supply goods or services to a royal court or certain royal personages. The warrant enables the supplier to advertise the fact that they supply to the royal family, so lending prestige to the supplier. In the United Kingdom, grants are currently made by the three most senior members of the [British Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family) to companies or tradesmen who supply goods and services to individuals in the family.

&gt;Suppliers continue to charge for their goods and services – a warrant does not imply that they provide goods and services free of charge. The warrant is typically advertised on company hoardings, letter-heads and products by displaying the [coat of arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms) or the [heraldic badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldic_badge) of the royal personage as appropriate. Underneath the coat of arms will usually appear the phrase ""*By Appointment to...*"" followed by the title and name of the royal customer, and then what goods are provided. No other details of what is supplied may be given.

Hey hey! New L6th here, firstly, subscribe to /r/gcse.
Secondly, this is the year to actually take shit seriously, I used to completely mess around in class up to Year 10, but got my shit together for Y11, and seriously. It will make a stressful year easier.
Also, organisation is key, write homework down AND DO IT. Hand it in on time, take GOOD and DETAILED notes in class, or trust me, you will be kicking yourself come March/April time.
I would say at the end of every week just go over the notes you have taken for that week. Not proper full on revision, just so the material stays fresh in your mind.
Come exam time, start to take things slow. You don't want to start a mad frenzy of revision come January and then be completely burned out in May/June. Your goal is for your abilities to peak come exam time. I recommend just starting with like an hour a day of revision in March, and start to pick things up come Easter time.
Also make sure you have all your notes with you, when beginning revision. Its a massive pain in the arse to have to photocopy notes during that high stress period in easter/summer.
USE SPECIFICATIONS! Find the exact board and course that you are doing and print off the specification! It is a long checklist of everything that could possibly appear on exams. AQA, Edexcel and OCR etc have these on their website. Use the spec to check you have covered the shit you need to know, and don't waste time learning stuff you don't.
DON'T PANIC! It is a high stress period, but have breaks. Seriously. Don't overwork yourself otherwise your performance will start to drop. Then again, don't fall into the trap of saying you did 3 hours revision, whilst in reality, you just stared at a wall.
Be ACTIVE! - Exercise is good, do some. But also, be active in your revision! Don't just read textbooks hoping stuff will go in, do something to help you retain information! Write notes that are condensed. Write flashcards! Anything!
Get a good nights sleep before the exam, don't cram the night before. This helps. Really.
Finally, GCSE's aren't the be all end all of exams. They don't matter TOO much. Your A-Levels are much more important. (This is what i'm telling myself in the run up to results day ;) ) BUT THEY STILL MATTER
So take them seriously, don't shit yourself and be prepared dude, that's all the advice I can give you.
Good Luck!

I wrote here about my assessment of him as a player in response to another Liverpool fan in the MCFC sub:

http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/2e4wwv/liverpool_fan_here_thoughts_on_mario_balotelli/cjw647y

One thing I'm really interested to see is how the wider media and fleet street treat Mario once he's a Liverpool player.

In his time at City they slaughtered him, every single week. Every two bit pundit was having a pop, and papers like the Daily Mail tried to create damaging stories about him wherever possible.

They set the agenda, the narrative was that  Balotelli was essentially a bad egg and let's milk him for what he's worth and laugh at his expense. They continued that narrative until the very day he left.

I think the way he was treated by the British press was a total disgrace.

That narrative became so mainstream that it even influenced referees, Balotelli's reputation went before him and he was regularly punished for things most players would get away with.

A good example off the top of my head would actually be against Liverpool at Anfield 2 or 3 years ago. He jumped for a high ball with (IIRC) Skrtel, and Sktrel feigned injury and held his face like he'd been caught by an arm or elbow, and the referee gave him a second yellow for a challenge that wasn't even a foul and sent him off.

I'm really interested to see if he gets the same treatment at Liverpool, you're a club which is essentially part of the establishment and gets much more favourable treatment from the British media and press.

Should be interesting to see how he gets on from every perspective.",0,1408683808,null,0,1408684046,0,cjx7uz2,t3_2e6cje,t1_cjx7uz2,t1_cjx73c6,null,1435373403,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

In Angles Take Manhattan, Rory saw himself die in that hotel room. He created a paradox by jumping off the building and dying twice in one night, in one place. Everything reset; no harm, no foul.

true,skwinter,lfc68,,"I hate to be a downer, but the only real difference you've highlighted is that we've been bringing people in without losing any, which is still similar to the Houllier days. I wouldn't say we've brought in world class talent, though I think the players we've brought in do improve us as a squad. You may have been getting at this, but what I think stands out this year is that we've been buying players that address specific problems, not just replacing players on their way out. Also as others have pointed out Rafa's problems were hugely affected by ownership issues. Also while I didn't watch as much in those days, when we came second in 2001/02 I believe the main problem was other teams strengthening, which isn't really covered here. I think Chelsea has strengthened significantly, City haven't done too much, but I think they've done well getting Mangala, and Arsenal looks like they've improved as well, though really they would have been really good last year as well had it not been for Walcott and Ramsey's injuries.

Don't get me wrong, I'm hopeful for this season as well, but I think we should temper our expectations. I know most people are saying they'd be happy with top four but I think a lot of people are silently expecting a title challenge, which I'm not sure is in the cards. I just really wanna see us get on the the knockout round of the Champions League.

Some of the more legitimate issues with Balotelli is his conduct on the pitch and on the training ground. Whatever he does outside is not actually that awful - he doesn't screw his mate's/brother's wife, or is he a focus of a major gambling probe. The media have labeled him crazy, and the public love the stories.

His issue is commitment. Suarez did crazy shit on the field, but he was driven by a desire to succeed. Mario lacked that appetite, and in the past have been known to *give-up* on the field and let frustrations take over.

It is an instruction to the property owner from the court to allow the recipient of the Order in. If they refuse, entry cannot be forced. In that case the property owner would be in contempt of court though.
They are actually quite hard to get (I have been involved in getting some myself). The evidential burden is relatively high, and m court application is made ex parte (ie without notice to the property owner) so the solicitors applying to court are required to give ""full and frank disclosure"" - ie point out any weaknesses in their case. They must also bring an independent supervising solicitor when they enforce the order to monitor and check it is being carried out correctly, and they later write a report. 
Finally the purpose of a search Order is expressly not as a ""fishing expedition"" - merely to protect evidence where there is a real risk it would be destroyed or hidden if the owner of the evidence had prior warning. 
EDIT: Re your point about confidentiality, the Daily Mail article is (unsurprisingly) not clear. The search took place 6 months ago, relating to something a bit different.

Dawson has been one of the most integral pieces in turning us from a no-hope mid-table side to perennial top-four chasers.  This turnaround was largely built on the back of his partnerships with King (they were so good together!) and Woodgate, and whilst they fell away due to injury and age, Dawson was the rock by which Bassong and early Kaboul weren't complete disasters.  He has fought his way back into the side on numerous occasions, having lost his starting place at the beginning of so many seasons because managers think he's slow or not cultured enough and as we've cast our eyes to other, more technical options, yet always ends up bursting his way back into the team on the back of determined, whole-hearted and generally high-quality performances.

It's strange to me that fans of other teams tend to have a higher opinion of Dawson then a lot of Spurs fans (especially newer fans).

Bale was 21 when he tore Inter apart. And his huge growth came about because of a position change, something that won't be effecting Townsend any time soon. Players like that just don't count, because it's not a factor that is going to effect Townsend - like needing to settle, position change, or coming off a long injury (like Lamela/Soldado). They've *proven* they have end product, Soldado's 16 goals in 23/24 CL games and 100 in 200 for Valencia, Lamela at Roma - Townsend at...QPR, maybe was good? 

For me it just proves my point - I cannot think of anyone, and if I REALLY make a leap - there's a half dozen players *maybe*. Is it likely Townsend is in that MASSIVE group of wingers who have hit their ceilings and lack end product, or those super rare occasions a player drastically improves at 23/24? Is he a 10/15m gamble that is worth keeping just as a impact player, or should we upgrade? If we had the cash to keep him AND upgrade - keep him.

So few questions: Who do you think was the honourable woman of the title? Throughout the series I kept switching between Atika and Nessa but by the end I think it's clearly Nessa. She spent her life trying to make up for her father's work even though it clearly wasn't good enough for anyone else. And what do you think the point of the last scene was? That Nessa is a prisoner but by looking up at the sun there is hope? I'm not sure whether I liked that final scene. And it was the Israelis who killed Monica right? It seemed very Mossad-like but then again didn't Walsh talk with the American about cleaning up?

The epitome of selfish. Forcing his way out is the reason other people hate their players that left. That is the reason we should hate him too. We actually did need him and he didn't care. Everyone else it's sort of a mutual decision. Sort of.

Obviously, you are perfectly free to think that a broader education is pointless.

It is certainly true that knowing a lot about very little is sufficient to survive in a society based on a very advanced division of labour.

However, knowing something about a lot of different things, even totally unrelated to your career, is also rewarding.

Some of this knowledge is hard to acquire and A-levels are for most people the last realistic chance of doing so.

In the first part of the article, I try to demystify the process (no genius required, common practice abroad, etc.).

In the second part, I propose a few reasons why it might be a good idea.

Now, don't get me wrong - what you're doing is commendable, thinking ahead etc. however with interest rates so low at the moment, the small amount you'll be able to save won't bring much, if any, return. Looking to pay into a pension when you're earning what most people would consider a non liveable salary is not a sensible move. 

Realistically, in the coming 3-5 years your wages will increase and you'll look to want to move out of your parents place and into rented, or maybe stay put for slightly longer and go straight into buying a place. Either way, you'll need cash. 

A regular savings account, or a good current account with % on the balance is probably best. However with your low salary you won't qualify for the best offers that require a certain amount to go in each month.

Now is a good time to educate yourself. Learn about budgeting, read the papers, understand interest rates, aprs, pensions etc. that way, when you're flying solo and on a regular salary, you'll be ready to begin.

true,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,"&gt;That's all I am saying.

Why did your first effort take so many words then?

Number of A levels taken has very little to do with the breadth of your education. Squeezing your ambitions to A level syllabuses narrows your focus and can *prevent* you pursuing areas of raw intellectual interest.

A level syllabuses in many subjects are extremely noddy and do not represent the kind of intellectual breadth I would encourage an engaged student to pursue. 

As an analogy let's think about musical instruments. If you can play the piano and an orchestral instrument, say the clarinet, well enough to pass grade 8, my advice would be to master *all* the music on the syllabus, to explore composers not on the list at all, to learn about historical performance issues, to read biographies of the composers, to write your own arrangements and so on. That is real breadth and depth. Spending the time, instead, learning to play the oboe rudimentarily is not. 

Of course, I'm not arguing that learning the oboe in this situation is outright bad but it is clearly not the best choice. 

&gt;Obviously, you are perfectly free to think that a broader education is pointless.

This is silly. No one is arguing this. 

&gt;However, knowing something about a lot of different things, even totally unrelated to your career, is also rewarding.

This is also silly. No one is arguing it isn't. 

&gt;If you disagree, advice yours kids to stick with the customary 3 or 4 subjects.

You seem unable to imagine that a broad education is possible without a badge to prove it. This is your hypocrisy. You are, through encouraging your daughter and others to take more A levels, actually supporting the pernicious and damaging misconception that education is only worthwhile if it has a grade on it.

If you're earning £111 a week, how much are you saving?

My advice would be to set up a budget and work out how much you have saved every month after all your expenses. You can use a software program like You Need A Budget or if not, just use a a simple spreadsheet.

Learning to manage your budget and limiting your overspend is one of the toughest to do, especially when you're 17.  If you can learn to do that, you'll have a great foundation to build upon and by the time you reach your mid-20's - early 30s, you'll already be way ahead of a lot of people similar to your age.

Maybe, you could open up a high interest savings account, although with your current earnings, it'll be difficult to find a decent rate.

But I would definitely open up a NISA account and deposit some money into it every month if you're able to.

Boiling down the whole story to a girl who could never get out of her fathers shadow however much she tried was achingly beautiful. 

It is by some kind of miracle Hugo Blick humanised the presence of mainly Palestinian villains by showing their pure agony in a never-ending war in Nessa's scene with Atika.

Also, Jesus Christ Stephen Rea was absolutely brilliant, I've never seen him play someone so human, usually his characters are so cold.

I interpreted the final scene as this: after all this time trying for some semblance of peace in the Middle East, Nessa realised that by surviving the attack she prevented that from happening. The final look in her eyes, in the hospital and as she closes her them to the the fighting in Gaza showed only defeat...

I thought the Honourable Woman was Nessa, striving to never be compromised, not realising that she has been compromised since the day she was born.

1) Many Muslims don't believe in the Adam centered creation myth any more, there is huge debate in Modern Islam about the creation of man, with many accepting evolution as true (something like 30 of Pakistanis accepted biological evolution) 

2) Adam wasn't a stone age man, the creation myth transcends stone age by ignoring the early stages of man entirely. So calling it stone age is theologically flawed because it doesn't accepted pre-historical human life. Adam wasn't stone age, he was the first age. 

3) Again historically speaking it doesn't matter because Islam wasn't founded by Adam, despite what some believe. It was founded in 630 AD and bares many of the hallmarks of religions founded around that time. It's theology was clearly influenced by Christianity, which again isn't a stone age religion right? So how can a religion that's basically half a rip off Christianity be stone age?

4) Islam has no resemblance to Paleolithic religions, which, from what we know, were probably pan-theistic or poly-theistic. It has no similarities to stone age religions. Being a strict and centralized monotheistic religion. Go and find me an actual stone age religion which has those characteristics. 

In conclusions, you're theological argument fails to take in the debate and shift in views among modern Muslims from a completely literal interpretations of the creation myth, also you're understanding of the creation myth is flawed, because it doesn't describe the early human eras as stone age, they had no knowledge of the stone age, so ascribing currant historical knowledge onto people who had no access to this knowledge and a criticism of them is unfair. Finally Islam was not founded the stone age and bares no similarities to actual stone age believes, it is decidedly a medieval religion in its historical narrative and theological belief system.

The general recommendation is to make sure your pension contributions (including your cash, the tax relief and employer contribution, and any genuine retirement savings) add up to half your age as a percentage of your gross income from when you first start.

e.g. a forward looking 21 year old earning 18k should aim to pay 10.5% into his pension for the rest of his life, initially £160 per month. Most people are scared of putting away that much for retirement (rather than e.g. a house deposit) hence the slow start to auto-enrollment. Even auto-enrollment is aiming for 8% eventually so it's better than nothing, but you still have to actively invest in your pension if you want to be comfortable.

delays are painful - the above 21 year old reaching 30 with a salary of say 25k would still be paying 10.5% (£220/mth).

I have stayed in [Ullswater](http://www.ullswater.co.uk/) which is in the North of the Lake District.

Donegal Is 30mins drive from the uk, its maybe not one of the first places anyone thinks of, but then again it actually is 30mins drive from the uk.. not in some far off african country that is 'over there'.. its now possibly 'over here'.

&gt;In 1967, a medical researcher, Ethan Sims, carried out an experiment at Vermont state prison in the US. He recruited inmates to eat as much as they could to gain 25% of their body weight, in return for early release from prison.

&gt;Some of the volunteers could not reach the target however hard they tried, even though they were eating 10,000 calories a day. Sims's conclusion was that for some, obesity is nearly impossible. 

It doesn't define what ""some"" means, however... [if it is this study here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC292021/pdf/jcinvest00194-0053.pdf), then ""some"" means only one of the 7 inmates could put on 25% body weight. So not so much ""some"", as ""almost all"".

It's the killing that is the provocation, not the collusion.

There are around 4million registered voters, if we can expect a 75-80% turnout? (85%?)

If it's a 75% turnout then Yes would 'only' need another 500,001 people to vote yes to carry the referendum.

If it's true that it has been checked against the electoral roll, that is an absolutely amazing amount of info on voting patterns and intentions across the country and would suggest the YES campaign have a very very good idea of where, literally exactly, the votes are there be won and can focus their ground campaign accordingly. It is such a large amount that it probably can be used for demographic analysis too to help shape the 'media war' campaign strategy too.

I doubt there have been many such large scale electoral campaigns where such detailed supporter information has been held.

Just for some more info, there are around [2.4million 'households' in Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/news2012/number-of-households.html) with 38% of these being 'single occupancy'.

This means around 910,000 people are living alone: all of these people will be of voting age (given its now 16). Therefore there are around 3million people eligible to vote and living in the remaining 1.49 million households, which makes sense (just about 2 voters per household).

A load of unarmed coppers chasing someone armed with a handgun probably wouldn't end all that well, and that would obviously be unacceptable.

Who are these letters written for?

The first letter would be acceptable if it referred to what ACTION the tenant would take if the landlord did not comply. Disrespect must be answered; respect is earned.

The second letter: ""If you have already contacted your landlord requesting the registration details and have received no reply""
-then your landlord thinks you're a joke and not worth worrying about. Do you want to degrade yourself by simpering, pleading, begging, asking permission? Why bother?

The letter helps the sender live vicariously through the achievement of the tenants who sued and won. As if merely thinking about someone else winning were the same as winning. Then they can go back to being idle and self satisfied. If I received the second letter I would now know that the tenant has no balls. This will be figuratively true even if not literally true. I'd bet money that this person enjoys complaining yet takes no action. The manure base of the loser mindset.

Does Shelter know their audience well? Shelter improves your self esteem by making you feel empowered without the risk of demanding what is yours without apology or explanation. If you're reading it, it's for you.

A man of action quietly notes the landlord's oversight, will politely point it out once, and will then decide whether to commit to action at a time of his choosing. Hit hard or don't hit at all.

The insidious problem with the letters is not the content. It is the lack of content. The usual complaint of “my landlord isn't being fair” should be replaced with the question, “What am I DOING about it?” The answer is, nothing. There is no call to action, no commitment to take action, and therefore no consequences at all.

There is a fun blog called ""Bold and Determined: The Website for Winners"" The author has no time for do-nothings and complainers, once observing that if this was the intended audience the site would be called ""Timid and unsure: the website for mediocres""

The armed forces have a systematic approach to dealing with these issues, but private citizens have no training or clue about what they are doing and have no followup to monitor them whether they stay abroad or come back home. In the worst case you get former ISIS fighters coming back to the UK, or traumatised Peshmerga fighters for example. Both are hazerdous in modern civil society and steps should be taken to ensure the safety of the public.

Search orders really shouldn't be used as a ""fishing expedition"", and if this one was, you might see some arguments before the court to that extent. And if the applicant or his lawyers leaked information they found, that could get them into a lot of trouble. Unless there was a specific duty on them to report anything relevant to the FA.

The numbers don't look that good when compared to Suarez, but then again, who's numbers do? Apart from that, he played for a worse team that wasn't at all as forward going. Now, I'm not saying that Liverpools style will get him 25 goals, but maybe a few more than this.

I hope we will still start with Sturridge and if he fails to make an impact, we can have a Balotelli on the bench. Or start with both. Or start with Sturridge on the bench. I'm fine either way.

- Military, they will have to procure new equipment or buy it from the UKAF. UKAF will no longer support them without some kind of treaty.

- National debt, how will the work that out? Whitehall is threatening not to share the £ unless they share the debt too.

- Industry, where is all Scotland's treasurey income going to come from? There is no industrial heartland, surely services would have to be quite thin on the ground without taking on massive national debt. Scotland has some of the worst if not the worst poverty and unemployment in the UK - without the rest (i.e. London) to prop it up what will happen?

- EU membership, won't they have to apply and won't that take years? The trade agreements that they will lose might cost their economy even more.

I mean, surely it will be like starting from worse than scratch (debt) without any real economic powerhouses to fuel the growth of an independent infrastructure and economy. My worry is that it will turn into a 2nd world country.

Honestly I think he has the potential to be better than Suarez, but he doesn't have the right mentality at the moment.

As much as Suarez had some eventful on field antics, they were mainly out of a desire to win. He was tremendously hard working and would fight until the very end. Balotelli however doesn't seem to have that mentality.

Some hedge funds in the USA decided they'd risk buying the rights to collect the debts, in the form of bonds. And now Argentina isn't doing so well again and they are trying to get the hedge funds to swap the bonds for ones issued in Argentina that aren't worth as much, meaning they don't have to pay back as much. 

What's making this worse is that some investors who bought other bonds and have accepted the new lesser valued ones are still due interest, and Argentina was trying to pay the interest before paying the main debt owed to the hedge funds. The courts said some time ago that they wouldn't allow that, but Argentina thought they found a loophole, which the courts have now closed.

Argentina was deliberately trying to circumvent the ruling of the court, and it's only the Judge's good graces that mean the entire country wasn't held in contempt. ",0,1408710322,null,0,false,0,cjxe1wj,t3_2e8ehp,t1_cjxe1wj,t1_cjx8kt1,null,1427411909,4,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,4

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt; Military, they will have to procure new equipment or buy it from the UKAF. UKAF will no longer support them without some kind of treaty.

Scotland would be entitled to some military assets when everything gets divvied up. About 8-9%, proportionately. 

&gt;National debt, how will the work that out? Whitehall is threatening not to share the £ unless they share the debt too.

Again, for all the bluster coming from both sides, it's the most likely case that Scotland would assume a proportionate share of the UK's debt. I'm of the opinion that Westminster's current refusal to enter a currency union would probably disappear during negotiations if there's a Yes vote, but not having a currency union wouldn't be the end of the world.

&gt;Industry, where is all Scotland's treasurey income going to come from? There is no industrial heartland, surely services would have to be quite thin on the ground without taking on massive national debt. Scotland has some of the worst if not the worst poverty and unemployment in the UK - without the rest (i.e. London) to prop it up what will happen?

Scotland's GDP is higher than any other area of the UK bar London and the south east. We'll be fine.

&gt;EU membership, won't they have to apply and won't that take years? The trade agreements that they will lose might cost their economy even more.

No definitive answers here, because to get those the UK government would have to talk to the EU on Scotland's behalf, and they currently refuse to do so. Juncker recently said that Scotland would likely be fast-tracked into membership since, as part of the UK, our laws and regulations are already EU-compliant, which is the thing that usually takes the longest time to sort out when applying for membership.",0,1408710853,null,0,false,0,cjxe7fr,t3_2e9lis,t1_cjxe7fr,t1_cjxdypi,null,1427411837,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,Obamanator91,cnty-scotland,Greeny Type,"&gt; 500k is a huge number to close. 

Not everyone voting Yes will have signed this. By the same token not all who have signed this will be voting Yes, but by validating it against the electoral roll I would imagine that the accuracy would be within about 5-10%. 

I think it also shows that Yes clearly has a large number of people engaged with the debate: people either have to have sought this 'declaration' out or it has been push on them by a canvasser (I have been very involved in the debate and I haven't really seen or heard of it before) . So it does show that many on the Yes side are very active. 

I would imagine that this combined with SNP and other Yes Scotland groups canvassing that Yes Scotland have a very good idea what the likely voting intentions are in most areas with a reasonably good level of accuracy. I can't find it just now, but I am sure I remember reading in 2011 about how the SNP had some form of voter intentions database; they had a good idea of the political make-up of the populace then, it must be *way* more detailed now.  

&gt;The things moving polls in the SNP's directions are gaffs south of the boarder that make part X of the government/country look 'anti-scotish'.

That's pretty debatable, the movement in the polls as often been inconsistent and contradictory, to try and claim that there is any one reason for peoples changing voting intention is incredibly simplistic. Also the economic argument has been very much 'he said - she said' so you would think that it would mostly come down to who people trust the most. 

If Panelbase is correct then Yes is within a midges bawhair of victory. Some if not all of the pollsters are, by the very fact they are so spread, wrong. 
The SNP didn't have a 'gamechanger' in 2011 and the polls swung by 30% over the space of a couple months then; the complacency I have seen form many in No camp, particularly thinking that Yes needs a 'gamechanger' is perhaps a little foolish, but hey, never interrupt your opponent when they are making a mistake ;)

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Unless they can shift the narrative entirely away from this, it'll be 45%~ Yes, 55%~ something No +/- 3%.

I just said this on the /r/ukpolitics version of this thread as well, but the polling that is showing 57/43 for No is suggesting a ridiculously high turnout.  83% said they were 10/10 to vote (only 6% said they were 0-4/10).  The last time they had a vote in 1979 there was a turnout of 64%.  The last general election had a turnout of 65%, the last Holyrood election had a turnout of 50%, the AV referendum had a turnout of 42%.

If the turnout is actually 85%+ then I'll be very, very impressed.  In all likelihood it is going to 60 - 70%, which means the polling data could be way off (because they have no way of weighting it beyond likelihood to turnout, they've just assumed a high turnout).  The question the pollsters are probably asking themselves is where that 25% loss is going to come from.  If it is even, then they'll have the predictions right.  If it comes from either side then they could be way off.

true,arvwsox,lfc99,,"Players don't get paid directly. They get paid much like how consultants do in the UK. For example; Mario sets up a company called ""Balotelli Co."" or  whatever, then Mario would list himself as an asset in Balotelli Co. and hire himself out to LFC. What LFC do is pay Balotelli Co. a fee in order to use their asset (110k per week in this case). Now that money belongs to Balotelli Co. NOT Mario, to get money out of the company, Mario will pay himself the basic rate of 9k per annum which is tax free, more money is taken out of the business as dividends to the owner, the owner of course is Mario! Doing it this way, Balotelli co will only pay Corporate tax of 21% (https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates). but the limitation of this is that a certain percentage of the money received from LFC to Balotelli Co. must remain in the business (I think 40% maybe less) in order to carrying on trading and avoid the massive 45% tax if he was to get paid directly.

This is what a lot of consultants do at my company and I'm sure this is how football players operate.

Edit: as to why most people don't do it; you will need an accountant to work out how much you can get paid with paying the least about of tax; it is a ball ache to maintain and balance the books, for this reason, accountants are expensive. Also, its only ever worth it if you're earning well over 100k pa. and most people won't want to work as a consultant.

The hourly requirement for full ATP is soon to be 1500 hours.  Given the cheapest things cost about £100 per hour, this is expensive.  Realistically you can start earning money to cover the hours after you've spent over £40k.   You might be able to work as an instructor in a club or school near by, you will earn fuck all money, but you are building hours.

Then you can start getting your ratings.  Many airlines will not bother interviewing you if you haven't demonstrated proficiency in a simulator, so that's a few more k just gone.

What with the cost of uni now, the interest on the loans, I'd imagine it's about £100k of debt for people starting now.  Unless you are able to get funded.

Then the fun thing, you will not earn the higher amounts unless you take long haul routes, deal with awful shift patterns that leave you isolated from friends and family.  Think of the stereotype of the pilot at the hilton bar, there is a glimmer of truth in it.

But what's really awesome is now the planes you don't do anything.  So many pilots I know are getting upset that all they do is key into the mfd, then that's it.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;Not everyone voting Yes will have signed this. By the same token not all who have signed this will be voting Yes, but by validating it against the electoral roll I would imagine that the accuracy would be within about 5-10%.
I think it also shows that Yes clearly has a large number of people engaged with the debate: people either have to have sought this 'declaration' out or it has been push on them by a canvasser (I have been very involved in the debate and I haven't really seen or heard of it before) . So it does show that many on the Yes side are very active.
I would imagine that this combined with SNP and other Yes Scotland groups canvassing that Yes Scotland have a very good idea what the likely voting intentions are in most areas with a reasonably good level of accuracy. I can't find it just now, but I am sure I remember reading in 2011 about how the SNP had some form of voter intentions database; they had a good idea of the political make-up of the populace then, it must be way more detailed now.

The yes side has been extremely active for years. However like I said though, the problem is not one of awareness, in which manpower can be a huge boon. It's a problem of arguments. which the SNP has no new material to bring to the table. 



&gt;That's pretty debatable, the movement in the polls as often been inconsistent and contradictory, to try and claim that there is any one reason for peoples changing voting intention is incredibly simplistic. Also the economic argument has been very much 'he said - she said' so you would think that it would mostly come down to who people trust the most.

That's just how polls are. The only ones with any descent level of accuracy are exit polls. It's only the trends of the polls that are particularly interesting really. 

Namely, its never been above 48% for yes, ever. It's fair to infer then that its a minority view. If it was even close to parity, you'd seen them dancing about the mid point far more often. 

&gt;Panelbase is correct then Yes is within a midges bawhair of victory. 

4% is not insignificant.

If polls were consistently showing it that be another matter. 

Remember Obama's 'landslides' were 52% and 51.7% respectively. 

It's the best card the SNP has in the pack at the moment 'we are so close'. But again, thats 'to the choir material' because even under the most optimistic projections, thats not the case. 

&gt;The SNP didn't have a 'gamechanger' in 2011 and the polls swung by 30% over the space of a couple months then;

SNP had MASSIVE dissatisfaction with Labour in a &lt;50% turn out election partisan advantage, protest votes got them into power and not on a landslide. A plebiscite is a different kettle of fish. 

&gt;the complacency I have seen form many in No camp, particularly thinking that Yes needs a 'gamechanger' is perhaps a little foolish, but hey, never interrupt your opponent when they are making a mistake ;)


Again, thats actually not an unfair presumption given the gap that needs to be closed, espeically with undecided. Most of whom normally just don't vote. It's not 12% or so percent to be snapped up by either side. 

You need new material for undecideds or the other side to make a colossal fuck up, like a scandal. ",0,1408712516,null,0,1408712960,0,cjxeqph,t3_2e9lis,t1_cjxeqph,t1_cjxegez,null,1427411525,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

It would be trying to sell it that caused him problems.  I don't know if filming it has anything to do with anything, but it probably counts as an aggravating factor.

The trouble with these stories is that they're always regurgitated press-releases, which are carefully worded to make it sound like doing anything other than buying expensive tickets from your local cinema-chain is go-straight-to-jail illegal.  The reality is that it's specific things that are illegal - infringing copyright for gain has been illegal for donkey's years.  Otherwise you'd need to make a case for ""conspiracy to defraud"".

UPDATE - This comment was intended as a rebuttal to the claim ""Surely he's been jailed for illegally distributing it, rather than filming it"", it's not a comment on the morality of file sharing!

As far as my layman's understanding goes: filming a copyrighted performance with the intent to distribute, is a specific criminal offence, with a criminal penalty.  Offering copyright infringing copies for sale is also a specific criminal offence, with a criminal penalty.  Distribution on it's own falls into a gap in the law, the law states that this is infringement, but attaches no specific criminal penalty - unless I'm wrong, in which case a citation for the benefit of the education of everyone would be appreciated.

This has very little to do with how people voted, because the electorate don't get to decide how the all-party groups are formed, they only decide who goes to the Assembly, so this isn't something that can be blamed on the electorate (besides ""stop voting for pro-life twats""), because considering they excluded 22% of the Assembly for this, they could very well exclude 50% even if there was a gender balance.",0,1408713491,null,0,false,0,cjxf2va,t3_2e8zea,t1_cjxf2va,t1_cjxdxq8,null,1427411368,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Why not cross wrists?  Well if you have a car without powerstearing, and you hit something hard, the wheel will flick, you've got 1000kg+ of metal, fuel and meat bags, resulting in a massive amount of force going through that wheel.  It will flick so hard you will struggle to hold it.  I once lost control driving a mk2 golf at about 40mph along an uphill bend on a sand track, after finding some stone or something with the left wheel, briefly becoming airborne, detatching something from the roof rack further added to my control issues.  If I hadn't been cornering at 10 and 2 style, I would likely not have been able to regan control, and possibly broken my wrists.  Given our location (Mauritania) and the fact I'd just broken a 40L hopper of water, this would have been problematic.  Instead it just messed up the tracking, and my passenger started moaning at me.

Because our ISPs don't have the power. When you can move from one to any other of maybe 30 ISPs within a week, none of them are compelled to be really shit because they'll see a mass exodus. If anything, it's got better - BT and co used to do usage caps and horrific traffic shaping, now they are moving away from that.

On the specific issue of Netflix, both BT and Virgin (as the UK equivalents of Verizon/AT&amp;T and Comcast) are Open Connect partners, meaning that they are happy to do free peering with Netflix and to host its servers on their networks. Hell, I think Virgin even gives you a Netflix subscription if you sign up to their TV service. Further back, they've peered with other content providers for years, for example the BBC who peers with everyone for free. 

The US ISPs can get away with what they do because, as you say, there is limited choice (and this won't be fixed by the blessed St. Google). Comcast merging with TWC doesn't really change this - although it might mean that Comcast would have even more leverage over content companies like Netflix, it doesn't reduce choice for the consumer, as no one can currently choose from Comcast or TWC unless they move house.

While I would be in favour of all-women shortlists in most industries, I would definitely not be in this one. The fact they were on an all-women shortlist will be used against them the moment they rebel against their party it will be used to bully and push them around, unless we can guarantee that the one that wins has iron will then I think it could be counter productive.  

What we need are stronger individuals (male or female) that can rebel against the whip.

**Sidenote:** This year I'll go back 20 seasons for results and gifs. I've managed (thanks to a couple of links posted in this sub) to get the few missing Season Reviews I needed. 

I made the gifs as I watched them, and thanks to a couple of formatting tricks, I can put out 20 seasons twice as fast as I did do 5 last year. 

That'll cover the early Roman Era (since I usually went back 5 seasons last year) as well as the Ranieri, Vialli, Gullit and late Hoddle days. 

Obviously the video quality declines so the older goals are smaller to cover-up the lack of pixels. 

The goal quality doesn't, thought. From Hasselbaink and Gudjohnsen to Zola, Flo and Vialli, there are a lot of wonders in there. Enjoy !

I feel like, for a while now, we've started slowly and ended much stronger.

This only if the buying club are willing to sanction the purchase before the player has completed a medical, the contract between the player and club details the terms of employment only, the club will have already paid for the right to field him as their player. Transfers are immensely complex and it may also depends on a myriad of other factors which are seldom mentioned in the popular press, such as whether the player which has been registered is insured to play for the team. 

I should imagine the FA would be lenient on such a matter because of the ramifications of having a new international star playing against his former club following a big money move, they have to ensure that the Premier League is continually strengthening it's international appeal.

You're clearly trolling, but do you understand how all-party groups work? When I decide to vote for someone based on their economic stance, their work in my area, or whatever else they campaign on, I first of all don't necessarily know all their ethical beliefs, and I secondly don't get a choice of what groups that person sits on within the Assembly. I might vote for pro-choice people whose economic outlooks I agree with, but if they then decide to form an all-party lobbying group to improve the rights for space aliens, I don't get to unelect them, nor did I know they were going to do that when I voted for them.

These 10 people were democratically elected, yes, but there's no evidence to even suggest they had 50% women supporters - those 10 people could have been elected with no women voting for them at all, so they cannot be assumed to have been elected to represent women's issues if we don't know if any women even voted for them. There are, however, women in the Assembly who would be able to sit on an all-party group like this, who have been *equally democratically elected*, and could take up a proportionate amount as they do in the Assembly (e.g. 2 women out of the 10 members of the group), and therefore serve to both represent actual women on a group discussing women's issues, and also make it representative of how many women Northern Ireland elected to the Assembly on the whole.

Though, Welbeck works his ass off every time he is on the pitch. He is constantly running and working.  I have never seen or heard anything but praise from United (or England for that matter) supporters on how hard he works and how he is a ""head down and get on with it"" type of player. Kid is an athletic grinder....which is genuinely an odd thing to stumble across.

I think in Poch's high press system he would fit really well, he would have no issue starting the press from the top and would constantly be running we wouldn't see him jogging or walking back. 

He really could be the type of player that shines in Poch's system just like Jay Rodriguez did....good athlete who is an unfinished product but has a huge work ethic.

Would be a really interesting signing depending on the price.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Human beings search for meaning and purpose. They tend to choose jobs based on what it is that they want to do, what they want to achieve, what they are searching for.

For most people that is money to provide a good standard of living. However, for the skill set and time investment of becoming an MP you can get a far better paid job in the private sector or as a lobbyist with better hours and less travel.

Others want to do good. They tend to end up working for charities, doing social work or just giving lots of money to charity. This tends to be a far more effective way of doing good than going into politics.p

Others want a legacy. Again, a business, having children, writing books, all almost entirely more effective.

So; why do people become politicians?

They want power. Control. They want to set the laws, they want to allocate the funding. They want to set your education policies, economic policies. In short; they want to be seen to do stuff. They want to be more important than you. They want to be better.

This does not account for all of them, there are a number of backbenchers there because they made misjudgements on the above. But they are the ones with no ambition who never make anything of themselves. They hide in their select committees doing as much good as they can.

So, why is it mostly men who crave this power? Well, we encourage it. Young, rich people with no need of money but who want prestige and to be noticed are enthused by the idea. It's how they are going to get the girls, how they can be useful. It's something to do. You end up getting lots of poor people coming to ask you for help. They get a safe space where they can be sexist, racist, have fun, get drunk and inflate their own egos. Who wouldn't want that?

true,Obamanator91,cnty-scotland,Greeny Type,"&gt;It's a problem of arguments

Given that the coverage of the referendum has been incredibly one sided in favor of No, that the way a large part of the No strategy seems to have been  centered around trying to keep people from entering the debate(scary cybernats, no chance of winning so why bother, etc.) and given  that there is a [evidence](http://www.panelbase.com/media/polls/F5673tables10.pdf) to suggest those who have sought out information are much more likely to be Yes, I think that it may be as much the fact that people either haven't heard, or haven't researched the arguments as much as the problem is with them themselves. (Correlation != always Causation I know but it is noteworthy)  

&gt;Namely, its never been above 48% for yes, ever. 

Well that's just not [true](http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/uploads/files/independence-poll-august-2011_1315215048.pdf), aye it's from 2011 but historically Yes has been in the lead at some points in time. 

&gt;It's only the trends of the polls that are particularly interesting really. 

Yup, and even those have been very strange different pollsters showing different trends, swings in opposite directions, polls intermittently showing a massive gender disparity while at the same time others showing a small one. You Gov putting Labout VI ahead for Holyrood and the rest having 10-15 point SNP leads. 

The only trends I can discern was that Yes made big gains over the winter and spring, and then has probably stalled since about June/July. 

&gt;4% is not insignificant.

If this were a standard Tory/Labour election where a 4% can be the difference between a defeat and a 'landslide' I would agree.
But it's not, since the rise of the SNP in 2007 the Scottish electorate have shown an impressive ability to change their minds on issues very quickly. 

Labour dissatisfaction clearly was an issue in 2011, but I haven't seen any evidence for there being a massive turnout disparity for SNP voters in 2011.

&gt;protest votes got them into power and not on a landslide.

Well by any normal standard of a UK election getting 44%/45% of the vote when your nearest rival gets 31/26% is a landslide.

Or rather, she's had time to make her mind up. 

It's particularly relevant to the independence referendum because of the comparatively large number of people who have been ""on the fence"" or only tacitly voting in one direction when compared against other votes. Given that the status quo hasn't changed, and it is widely accepted that Alex Salmond has failed to make a convincing case for independence beyond ambitious promises, it seems reasonable that many of those ""on the fencers"" are coming down in favour of no. Infact I suspect they are coming down in roughly equal number on either side.

It's also worth pointing out, to all the people who see 500,001 more votes as being definitive, that a referendum where say 48% vote yes, and 47% vote no is likely to be subject to further challenge... In such an event it seems plausible (despite what has been said) that the likely outcome would be a plan to put a negotiated settlement to the Scottish people and then re-run the vote. That negotiated settlement could take two formats - one might be a devo max vs independence referrendum. The other option would be a re-run of the first referrendum, only this time with the knowledge of what the negotiated settlement would include. i.e. Scots would go to the poll knowing precisely what currency they would be using, whether or not they would have EU membership, how much of the oil would actually be theirs and whether or not Trident would still be on the Clyde.

Wow.

Welbeck isn't bad at all, you're being very unfair to him with your comments. When he was played last season he put in a decent amount of goals. He's a better option than Torres is at the moment, plus he's homegrown. He nearly always turns up in big games - for instance Man Utd vs Real Madrid last year where he was the best player on the pitch. 

He's got an excellent workrate, he'd work well under our system and he'd be a great impact sub. He'd likely thrive under Mourinho and I'm struggling to see how your post has reached the top of this thread.

See that right there is a huge misconception. I'll give it to you that he was amazing for that game, and he was without a doubt Utd's best player. But to say he turns up in big games is a lie.

So for example, the Scots could take a proportion of UK equiptment... but what would they do with something like the [AS90](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-90)... it's a self propelled artillery gun. Most of the infrastructure to maintain them, train new crews to use them and store them is located in the Royal Artillery bases at Colchester and Tidworth in southern England. Furthermore, on their own they are pretty useless - they are designed to operate as part of a larger fast moving mechanized infantry force with tanks and armored personnel carriers, with air cover provided by the Army air corps. Just having a proportionate piece of the puzzle won't build an effective army. Why would the Scots even want something like this? What are they going to do with something that was built to stop the Russians pouring into the German countryside?

You could then say why don't the Scots just cherry-pick what equipment might be useful to them. For example, they might find the Royal Navys [River Class patrol vessels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River-class_patrol_vessel) more useful than something like a cruiser/destroyer sized ship like the [Type 45 class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_45_destroyer). But that won't really work, because again the infrastructure for those sort of ships isn't necessarily based in Scotland. Similarly, the rUK might want to hang onto them to. 

You can't just split up an army into an 8% share. It doesn't work. Do 8% of military personnel even want to be part of a Scottish Defence Force? What would be in it for them?... they'd be going from a battle hardened army that's hardly been outside of a war for nearly 200 years... to join what would basically be a jumped up coastguard/disaster relief PR machine. It also doesn't take account of the fact that in order to have an effective military you need the right mix of skills at the right levels. It's no use having a piece of kit like the [Merlin Helicopter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_helicopter) unless you can also guarantee you've got Merlin engineers, pilots, weapons specialists etc. to keep them running. It's likely there are important pieces of defense kit for which there are NO Scottish personnel who might take up that role. 

There is very little support for an independent Scotland within the forces, and that is going to make recruitment and retention very difficult. My guess is the Scots would basically be starting out with the most basic and barbones force as the majority would want to remain in the British army where they have better career prospects. Besides that, the army is vociferously patriotic and in general, as a ""type"" of person, forces personnel don't favor independence.

They aren't quoting chapter and verse to justify their position, they are merely condemning an inhuman act for it's inhumanity. I'm grateful for that wherever it comes from and I'm not going to try and devalue it and claim it's meaningless or that it's not reflective of most Muslims.

But I still can't see where my downvotes are coming from?  There are specific laws concerning illegal recording of performances, and offering infringing work for sale.  Both of which the accused in this particular case has admitted to.  But simply transmitting an infringing work from A to B has no criminal penalty as far as I can see.

Hence my original reply.

The only way simple not-for-profit distribution would be ""go-to-jail"" illegal would be if it was ""to prejudicially affect the owner of the copyright"".  Of course copyright owners will claim that every infringing copy affects them, and they might have a point if the distribution went far enough, but that would have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

The biggest penalty, and it's still quite a big penalty, for not-for-profit copyright infringement is forfeiture of both the infringing item and the equipment used to make it.",0,1408719406,null,0,false,0,cjxhlma,t3_2e9p0v,t1_cjxhlma,t1_cjxg07z,null,1427410191,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The other problem the Scots have is that only 1 Scottish company actually extracts oil, and even then only about 2% of the total extracted each month. So they will only have the benefit of direct taxation. The large London and globally registered businesses that actually make the majority of the profit will continue to do so but those profits will largely bypass Scotland.

It's also possible that in 10 years time North Sea Oil could be competing with British and European shale gas exports, which might actually work out cheaper to extract than the increasingly hard to find north sea oil. That will be even more precarious if they are still reliant on a UK controlled pound sterling currency, since the UK can effectively use the currency to optimise conditions for its own shale gas industry while hampering north sea oil exports for its competitors in Scotland and Norway.",0,1408719551,null,0,false,0,cjxho3k,t3_2e9lis,t1_cjxho3k,t1_cjxe3j2,null,1427410160,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

His World Cup was a joke? Did you even watch the games? His performances weren't 'a joke', neither was his attitude 'a joke', nor was his work ethic 'a joke'. He looked lively against Italy, made their defenders make quite a few mistakes, and also put in a shift defensively. None of the England players can claim that they came out having had a WC to be proud of, so you can't single him out for that.

&gt; Not to talk about the countless UCL matches they could have done without him.

Again, this isn't true. He's often noted as a 'big game player' which is why he starts so consistently at both a club level and international level. 

&gt; and not preform against top teams. 

As mentioned, not true. He'd make an excellent choice backup striker behind Costa, though United wouldn't sell him to us.

true,AzureSkyy,NG,nigeria,"1) Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge both had solid World Cups and can be proud of their efforts. Again, all you're talking about is his work ethic. That means nothing if you can't get assists or goals or even make a notable effort to build up play. If work ethic means that much to the game, David Luiz would still be with us. 

2) Give me 5 other UCL games outside the Real v Utd where he was a key factor. If you do, i'll shut up and you're right this entire time. If not, then you're kinda in a awkward position if you can't give me 5 games where he was considered the best (or one of the best to be fair) man in that game like the Real vs Utd game.

3) Just cus you start for your team doesn't mean you're doing something right. Outside of welbeck there are no other reasonable options. Both club and country. It's not like he is keeping players on the bench (like what Dave did to Ashley). At UTD he isn't beating Rooney and RVP for a ST spot so where they put em? On the wing. Look who he has to beat for a spot.  Nani, Kagawa, Young, and Valencia. That's not something to highlight. Same thing at country level. He lost his ST spot to Daniel, and he isn't getting CF/CAM spot from Rooney, so where they put him?  The wing. Once some English wingers step up their game, it's easy to say he is going to lose that spot too.


Do you not see he is starting by default? There are no better options. Eto'o had the same experince with us last year. Obviously he doesn't get the job done, but if not him who else can do it?

The people who seem to be backing independence right now as I have seen it when I've been to Scotland are either a) desperate with little to lose or b) nationalistic ""Scotland till I die"" types.

The voice that is missing are the 50% of people sat in the middle. The teachers, the nurses, the professionals. The people who aren't rich but live comfortably middle class lives. Its unusual because in English politics those people tend to dominate the debate as the important ""centre ground"" voters. But in Scotland they seem terrified to let their voice be heard for fear of being typecast as unpatriotic.

I'm not saying there aren't good reasons for voting for independence. If Scots really feel they are so different in their cultural identity then that alone is probably reason enough. Personally the differences strike me as Christians and Catholics... a lot of fuss about a few details, but broadly on the same page with the same aspirations. Economic control is an interesting idea, if Scots want to build a *different* sort of economy, one based on oil and low margin exports then perhaps that too warrants a vote for independence. But they shouldn't go into it thinking they will be wealthier people for it, because they won't, at least not in our lifetimes. The benefits of that economic reconfiguration may make themselves felt in 50 years time, but the short term effect will be a contraction as businesses flee south, borrowing costs rise and money has to be spent to develop the infrastructure to support that kind of economy. As much as people bemoan a perceived ""lack of exports"" in the UK, I for one am glad we've moved away from the 1970s low margin production. Our future (in the UK anyway) lies in high margin low volume exports of products like advanced computer components, satellites, jet engines etc. If the Scots want to try and compete with the Chinese to see who can screw bolts into cheap plastic toys faster then good luck to them - may they enjoy the lifestyle that brings.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Eastern European countries being against Scottish EU membership? I don't really understand your train of though there. Can you expand it a little bit?

I don't think the Spanish issue is as big as stated. Quite often their position on Kosovo is brought up as a parallel to Scotland but time and time again their politicians refute this.
 
Foreign Minister Garcia-Margallo:

&gt; ""If the two parts of the United Kingdom are in agreement that [Scottish independence] is in accord with their constitutional arrangement, written or unwritten, Spain would have nothing to say, we would simply maintain that it does not affect us."" 

He also admitted that the Spanish attitude towards Kosovo because it was unilateral succession; that is what they want to discourage in their own separatist regions. So if Scotland becomes independent in a civilised way in which the UK agree to then it's unlikely their position would be special.

There is one main question here:
Does it interest anyone to prevent Scotland from joining/remaining/staying (whatever wording you want) in Europe?

Scotland exiting would mean 5 million EU citizens (citizenship cannot be removed and is granted via UK citizenship anyway) in a non-member state and hurting a few industries/fields (fisheries, universities, renewable energy partnerships, life science research etc).

Although the EU wouldn't be that hurt by such a small region being frozen out it seems a bit inconvenient to go through. Once their is a mandate there then usually you find that action happens.

German reunification was often seen as a big hazard by the European Common Market and their were countless warnings on how long the process would take and how Germany would not be fully integrated and compliant but once the political mandate was there then things moved on relatively quickly.

The UK is also a pretty big allie to have on your side in this sort of case as well and it's in their interests for a smooth transaction.

You can never say things with 100% certainty (as pre-negotiation isn't really possible when people are playing politics) but I'm not overly worried about European membership.",0,1408722700,null,0,false,0,cjxj98b,t3_2e9nof,t1_cjxj98b,t1_cjxft89,null,1427409350,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Luiz's work habits didn't fit the position he played, always trying to get forward and score as a CB.

This sub doesn't give him half the credit he deserves, sure he plays with ferocity, but if that was anyone else, we would be praising them for their will to fight.

They are certainly **NOT** patrol ships like the small River class. If Scotland votes for independence it's likely the Type 26 will be built in Portsmouth. 

Besides that, the fact something is built in one place doesn't mean it will be based there. For example, the new carriers Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth were assembled in Scotland, but they will be based from Portsmouth. The point is the main Scottish naval base at Faslane is, unsurprisingly, built to primarily house submarines and not a large number of surface ships. If they want to start basing ships like the Type 23, Type 26 or Type 45 out of Faslane then they'll be needing to expand its surface ship handling facilities. It also won't help them that the armaments depots are mostly based as Porstmouth and Devonport in Plymouth. 

Similarly the AS90 was built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness, but they're are based (along with most of the UKs heavy armor) in the South of England... because after 2 world wars and a cold war with Russia that's how things evolved, to keep armor in the south in case it needed to to be deployed onto the continent at short notice. 

In reality, the Scots will need to build up their own defense force from a small barebones force of UK throwaways and a small contingent of Scottish personnel with an eclectic skill mix. In 25-30 years time they might be able to reconfigure that force into something more like the RoI's forces, with a cheaply equipped predominantly territorial force.

I hope this has helped explain why 8% of an army/navy, does not make an army/navy. It makes 8% of an army/navy. There is no point having a frigate, when the facilities to install the missiles onto the frigate belong to another country. The Scots will **need** to operate some sort of mixed force in the short-mid term, and then in the long term will probably be looking to procure less ambitious equipment like small coastguard sized patrol vessels to suit whatever their domestic and international military ambitions are. It is an unattractive prospect for forces personnel, because you don't join the army to run around hills in Scotland or patrol a dwindling number of fishing ships in the arse end of the North Sea...

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Is there still uncertainty over being forced to adopt the Euro? Last I checked all recent accessions have had no option but to join the currency union.
&gt;
&gt;If that is the case I would say forcibly adopting a currency still deep into crisis is a pretty strong argument against. I havent heard anything about it in a while though.

Well to join the Euro you must be compliant with the [Eurozone Convergence Criteria](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/who_can_join/).

If you can't be bothered going though the page then here are the five points:

&gt;1. Price stability – the country’s Consumer Price Inflation (HICP) rate must not be more than 1.5% above the rate of the three best performing Eurozone member states.
&gt;
&gt;2. Sound public finances – the government’s deficit must not be higher than 3% of GDP.
&gt;
&gt;3. Sustainable public finances – the government’s debt must not be higher than 60% of GDP.
&gt;
&gt;4. Durability of convergence – the country’s long-term interest rate must not be more than 2% above the rate of the three best performing Eurozone member states in terms of price stability.
&gt;
&gt;5. Exchange rate stability – the country’s existing currency must have been part of ERM II (Exchange Rate Mechanism II) for at least 2 years without severe tensions.

Assuming that the debt is acquired like planned (approximately 8-10% of the UK depending on what assets are received) then 1,2,3 and 5 are instantly ruined.

So basically even if Scotland wanted to join the Euro it wouldn't be possible for quite some time.

The question becomes; would Scotland be forced to adopt the Euro eventually?

I don't think so.

It's quite a strange that the EU words the Euro requirement as:

&gt;All Member States of the European Union, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, are required to adopt the euro and join the euro area. To do this they must meet certain conditions known as 'convergence criteria'.

So can you intentionally not meet the convergence criteria and not join the Euro? Yes.

Assuming Scotland continues to use the Pound by either shadowing or setting up a matching currency then requirement number 5 is not going to be met for quite a long time unless the UK Government change their views pretty fast.

Sweden refuse to join ERM II as they view the conditions as voluntary and their position is that the EU cannot force them to adopt the whole convergence criteria so in effect cannot be forced into the Euro. This hasn't been challenged and they are not being penalised so in effect have an unofficial 'opt out' ",0,1408723649,null,0,false,0,cjxjqm4,t3_2e9nof,t1_cjxjqm4,t1_cjxj0ao,null,1427409125,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Shwinizzle,1986,Super Frank,"So I've doing some thinking about Oscar. He confuses all of us. He is by no means a classical #10 like Mata or Ozil. His assist tallies speak for that. However he definitely gives us aspects of play that the other two cannot, hence the reason Mata was transferred in favor of Oscar. 

If you look at Oscar's [passing](http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755304/player-stats/61262/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor) from the Burnley game you clearly see how deep he plays. This attribute is exaggerated when you compare him to [Mata](http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/43670/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor) and [Coutinho](http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755306/player-stats/84583/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor) (which I know this sub is loathe to do). This difference may be a consequence of our 4-2-3-1 turning into an effective 4-3-3 as the match goes on, but I believe this change is only possible because of Oscar's personal attributes.

I've come to the conclusion that he is a box to box #10. I don't know if this term has ever been used before, but I like it so I'm sticking with it. His ability to retain the ball and carry it long distances while also being able to play a decent final ball makes him invaluable for us.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;I'm much less likely to die from a cricket bat attack, mind.

In terms of actual crimes committed, blunt objects like cricket bats sit only behind knives in terms of weapons used. Legally held firearms barely register at all. The point of illustrating bats is to point out that they pose an actual threat to you and I many times obove what a legally held firearm poses. That's not to suggest relaxing firearms certificate laws is the suggestion, but further tightening firearms laws will bring no real benefit to anybody. It will not reduce crime. It will not reduce shootings. It will not do anything. Indeed, the last two major occasions the law was tightened up (full-bore semi auto rifles and then pistols being banned), the inquires that preceded them stated very clearly that a ban would do no good whatsoever. The ban that followed was bluster and vote-winning. It was as useful as banning violent video games would be.

&gt;The present system appears to be working very well, I see no benefit to changing it.

The present system of *licensing* works very well. There is literally no reason whatsoever to keep pistols or semi-auto rifles banned. It benefits nobody and is a vote winner.

&gt;If a few minority sports suffer because I, or others, are being irrational then so be it.

Why are you so content with holding a position you recognise is irrational and is a triumph of vote-winning over the evidence?

Alcohol related violence is interesting actually, as there's some evidence that it's at least in part psychological, as people will also get violent when drinking placebo alcohol.  Might also be some cultural cues as to how people *think* a drunk should behave.  We certainly don't fully understand the relationship yet.  However someone who's drunk and violent is, arguably, less dangerous than someone who's sober and violent in some ways (I'd rather fight a drunk any day!).  My main argument would be that a gun is a *tool* which can be used to kill much more easily than fists or blunt instruments.  If I want to kill someone, the first thing I do isn't neck 7 pints.  As far as I'm aware alcohol itself has never been a murder weapon.

As for it killing the users, well, that's a choice we make.

In terms of force it's used like the incapacitant spray, it's the same level. So it's coming out when someone is not backing down. Nobody in the UK has died as a result of being taser'd without extenuating circumstances like being covered in petrol or holding a shotgun to their throat.

It's vastly hated and people like Sophie Kahn pipe up every time it's used like vultures and amnesty international who I have great respect for don't half talk some shit when it comes to taser, making it out to be the same level of force as lethal firearms just because it's classed as a firearm.

 The bottom line is when it's used it's to prevent violence. Without it people will be punched, kicked and hit with batons instead which can easily kill someone. When you take away a low level use of force like the taser what else is left?

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"EDIT: Some comes across perhaps a little aggressive, but it's aimed at the failing, blame targeting system, not you, Moxria, hope it's not taken that way!

First things first, targets of a certain number of jobs applied for , or a certain amount of activity, are just way too high, and results in many people just applying for stuff they can't do just to tick a box that says 'applied for job'.

Sure, it's only wasting unemployed people's time, where's the harm?
If you don't care about that, how about the employer who now has to sift thru hundreds of applications when a few years ago he might have got ten or so, all targeted to the job specifically and actively wanting that position.

I don't have many answers, but sanctions aren't it, it's very hard to maintain an effective jobsearch when you're sat in a cold flat in the dark with no food, because your gas and electric's been cut off and you have no money.  Over a million in a year across 2.5 million jobseekers also shows it's nowhere near the 'last resort' that they claim.

One thing I would do, is fire all the work provider companies sucking billions from the taxpayer, and take maybe 10% of that budget and offer grants to community centres and the like that already help jobseekers, and were doing it for free because they actually give a fuck about people and aren't just buggering people about for a fat check.  If my local place where I volunteer had a bit more cash we could expand, be open more hours etc.  

I've been told myself we're about a hundred times more useful than the Jobcentre in aiding people in their jobsearch and how to deal with the hoops to jump thru in benefit claiming.

Here's some more, open up the information about what's available to claim to assist people back into work.  Make it easier to claim assistance with returning to work, as so many people get a job, come off JSA, and then find out they've got to exist on nothing for six weeks or more until the first monthly pay.  This invariably forces some into the hands of Wonga and the like, as they prey on the desperate, and you don't get much more desperate than someone who's just got a job and is looking back hoping never to have to return to the jobcentre.

Lastly, make moving into and out of work less of an absolute clusterfuck.  I've seen it myself, people take a temporary job for a few weeks, because they want to work, then find out that they're going to be battling both the council and the DWP to get their money sorted out for months afterwards.  When the next job comes along that'll give them a couple of weeks' pay, they're not so enthusiastic, especially as what's earned is torn away with glee by the benefits system, and never takes into account the costs of working, such as travel.",0,1408724982,null,0,1408725298,0,cjxkfe5,t3_2dh0f2,t1_cjxkfe5,t1_cjswhgt,null,1427408803,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The point is that a legally held firearm will almost never pose a threat to you, yet there were 162 murders with blunt instruments in 2011/2012. To put it simply: legally held firearms are basically no threat to you nor I.

&gt;Is there any valid reason to rescind the ban on pistols?

Target or practical shooting is a legitimate sport that was attended by nearly half a million people before the ban.

&gt;but I can't say that it's a risk I feel all that compelled to take.

My point is that there is basically no risk. As you said, the licensing system works very well indeed so allowing pistol shooting does *not* increase the danger.

&gt;Climate change is different, because ignoring the evidence there incurs a risk of significant damage. What's the worst you can say about the current gun system, that I'm maybe not that much less likely to get shot and sport shooters have a hard time?

What I'm pointing out is that you seem perfectly OK for politicians to base laws on what will win them the most votes by playing on people's lack of knowledge, regardless of whether that position is totally contrary to the evidence. What about a politician banning violent computer games because they're trying to win votes from the panicked Daily Mail crowd?

So??? All the leading pharmaceutical industries are European or American.

High tec consumer goods yes, but not mining or resources sector.

&gt;And as for proper high tech? The Chinese, Japanese and India space programs beg to differ.

All the stuff Australia love to buy


&gt;We just do it at a higher quality and charge the premium. Most countries will buy the local stuff when it's all they can afford, but when they get some money, they all want the perceived luxury value of our products.

Correct, you first points make little sense but I am with you on this, which is the reason why I think that UK trade does not have to worry about rising fuel costs as much a some lower cost industries.

I don't really care you've never been unemployed, that wasn't the point - the point of a social safety net is so your employer can't shaft you and you always have the option of walking away from a job without starving. It means you can take risks with your career too, which you will also have benefitted from (depending on what career you're in). Now you're senior (I assume) that won't be so much of a problem for you, but you benefitted greatly from the rights negotiated for you by the government when you started out, whether you were consciously aware of it or not. Same with the NHS I suppose, although to a lesser extent (certainly public health initiatives have benefitted you directly).

But actually, I don't think we're that much at odds - if you want to leave if the government raises taxes I WANT you to leave and not bring down the rest of us.

&gt;What a great start to the season by Swansea, who barely got a mention in the build-up to their game against Manchester United but came away with a 2-1 win.  
What the Welsh side did was to play with pace in wide areas when they went forward and, particularly against the 3-5-2 formation that United used in the first half, it was very successful.  
Gylfi Sigurdsson's goal saw Swansea win at Old Trafford for the first time in the league  
Burnley's fans were tremendous on Monday and I am sure they will be like that in every game.  
But the problem was on the pitch. I know it was against Chelsea, but the Clarets looked short in all areas and could not create enough opportunities.  
Burnley are not under any false illusions about how hard this season will be, and they are probably banking on beating the teams who are likely to be around them in the table at home.  
This game will give us a better indication of how their first season back in the top-flight will go, but I cannot see them getting any joy at the Liberty Stadium.

Not much in terms of content really. Must be a pretty easy job.

Its the product of that Egyptian guy that went to the States in the early 20th century, didn't like what he saw, went back to Egypt, joined the Muslim brotherhood, wrote some bollocks, got arrested by Nasser, got tortured severely (which fucked up his thinking even more.... he apparently wanted to flood the Nile delta and kill thousands of innocents), wrote even more bollocks and then just when you thought it couldn't get worse, Nasser executes him and makes him a martyr.

And I didn't say Moffat pulled Deus Ex Machina endings either, I said they contradicted what you'd seen up to that point (e.g. a Time Lord regeneration nuking Daleks in orbit - I mean, seriously, if a regeneration could kill Daleks, the Time War would have been pretty fucking decisive!)

&gt;or romance with companion

What about the '96 movie? As far as I can remember (which is goes back to the first Jon Pertwee episode ""Spearhead from Space"") the movie was the first time the Doctor kissed a companion. It seems like you're trying to strawman me ;-)

&gt;I think Moffat at his worst is still better than Davies at his best.

Uh huh. ""The Black Spot"" is better than ""Doomsday"". Oh, I have a bridge for sale if you're interested ;-)

&gt;Also previous season characters weren't ignored by Moffat.... Kind of ridiculous to expect to see them so soon after 10 regenerated

11 has already regenerated and we still haven't seen Jenny. But Moffat's reign has brought us the Doctor complaining about how miserable his life is (""The Rings of Akhaten""), a lame western (""A Town Called Mercy""), low budget on-set chases (""Journey to the Centre of the Tardis""), and Springer-style domestic issues (anything with Amy and Rory).

I'm looking forward to the end of Moffat's reign. He was a better as a comedy writer (e.g. ""Coupling"") than scifi or drama.",0,1408727139,null,0,false,0,cjxljse,t3_2e439f,t1_cjxljse,t1_cjw80yg,null,1427408280,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Like I said, his minutes throughout the season would of relied on Diego Costa failing to make an impact and being CONSITENTLY off-form.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; being free of the EU would allow the UK to pursue trade deals with new markets much faster,

So you want to turn our back on our existing trade deals, in the hope of winning others?

I frequently hear from UKIPpers that ""once we leave the EU, we'll negotiate a trade deal on better terms"" but I fail to see how we'd achieve anything different or better than what we have already.

French people and Germans are not going to be ok, for example, with us badging fizzy kent wine as ""champagne"" and trying to undercut them. How would you feel if you were a farmer, and Polish farmers were passing off lower-quality pork, pretending it was the same as your best cuts of ham and bacon? It is the EU that defines how regional products like cheddar cheese and stilton get this kind of protection (like a brand or trademark). 

If we were to scrap the minimum wage and employers were to work us 50 hours a week, we'd be more competitive and be able to undercut France and Germany - why should they allow that? Why should they allow us to compete with them ""on equal terms"", if we're not going to play fair?

If I buy a paraglider or a yacht, it has been CE tested to ensure it has safe handling and righting characteristics. I assume that cars and motorcycles undergo similar safety certification. This kind of safety testing has to be done for the benefit of all of us - how do you plan to replace it? This testing has to be paid for, to keep us safe - do you think that every country should have a different test? And don't tell me that manufacturers should pay for it - they already do, it's just that the EU administers it, and there's an ongoing cost to improving safety regulation and certifying new kinds of devices.

There are reasons for everything that is ""imposed on us"" by the EU - we've agreed to it because it's for our benefit as much as it's for Italy's and Greece's. 

There is plenty wrong with the EU, just as there is plenty wrong with our government, and all others. The solution is not to throw our hands in the air and turn our backs on it - the solution is to reform the EU and fix its problems. Scrapping the EU would not reduce bureaucracy, but only increase our own.

As to the credibility of UKIP, this week they have promised to [cut taxes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28876122) and [increase NHS spending](http://www.ukip.org/ukip_backs_daily_express_crusade_against_rip_off_hospital_parking_charges), with no realistic proposals of how to fund that.

UKIP regularly talk of ""slashing the overseas aid budget"", and that undermines their credibility, too, because it shows they don't understand the big picture - not only is aid a drop in the ocean, but it's money well spent, because it buys us global influence. How do you say to someone, ""yes, we want a trade deal with you, and we want you to stop taxing our imports"" at the same time as taking away the medical or military assistance you've been giving them for years? Not to mention that aid money is already always tied to British exports - it's frequently a sly way to subsidise jobs for British workers.

Simple solutions are always appealing, but we live in an insanely complex world, and that's why simple solutions won't work. It's really easy to say ""oh, we'll just do this, it's common sense"" when you're campaigning for an election, but these are promises which will never have to be put to the test.",0,1408728075,null,0,false,0,cjxm1bl,t3_2e9gvo,t1_cjxm1bl,t1_cjxfa3w,null,1427408052,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Production began on 19 January in Wales.[2][26] The special was the first Doctor Who episode to be filmed in high-definition television resolution.[31] The move to HD had previously been resisted for two major reasons: when the show was revived in 2005, high-definition television had not been adopted by an adequate portion of the audience to be financially viable; and special effects were considerably more expensive to create in high-definition than in standard-definition. ""Planet of the Dead"" was used as a switch to HD because of the show's reduced schedule in 2009 and because the filming crew had become experienced with the equipment while they were filming Torchwood.[8]

I absolutely *hate* it. 

It's not a good Dalek story. The Daleks have no effect on the plot. *Davros* does have an effect on the plot, his Reality Bomb has an effect on the plot, but the Daleks could equally be any menace. The Dalek Supreme has what is, IMO, the ugliest design, and is dispatched within nanoseconds. The Daleks themselves explode in uncountable quantities making it hard to actually *care* if one thousand, or two million Daleks blow up. The Daleks are taken out with the silliest dance routine. 

Davros is *FRAKKING* fantastic in his scenes. Believe me, I... I... I actually give this episode most of it's credit for Davros alone. Julian Bleach is Davros in my mind, just as Ian McDiarmad is Emperor Palpatine. He just has the performance down to a T...

The problem, IMO, are the *Companions*. The episode itself isn't a bad companion reunion episode, in the vein of School Reunion. The problem is, in School Reunion, the Krillitane's were only half of the focus, and you could have the sillier aspects because, hey, it's Antony Stewart Frakking Head. Here, you have a very *dark* story that's frequented with ""Oh, it's you"", ""Watch it, nakkedalienboy"" and the whole ""companions run into each other"" schtick.

It's an interesting Dalek story we've seen before (Daleks take over the Earth), combined with an AWESOME Davros story (Davros wants to destroy reality itself) which sort of harkens back to Genesis' virus speech, and a semi-decent companion reunion story, all put into a blender, squished, pulped, juiced, and squeezed together to make a story with overall interesting ideas, but a poor presentation for most of them IMO.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;So you want to turn our back on our existing trade deals, in the hope of winning others?

An EU in stagnation would not be the business of cutting off outside trade, on the contrary they would be desperately seeking it out due to the slow growth of their own markets. Also leaving the EU would not necessitate cutting trade ties.  


&gt;I frequently hear from UKIPpers that ""once we leave the EU, we'll negotiate a trade deal on better terms"" but I fail to see how we'd achieve anything different or better than what we have already.

The big factor would be speed! We could negotiate trade deals faster, perhaps not on as favourable terms but faster.


&gt;It is the EU that defines how regional products like cheddar cheese and stilton get this kind of protection (like a brand or trademark).

No, it is one which enforces quality and standards, I do not believe that it is the EU which makes products global brands. A larger domestic market helps, but that is there regardless, see coke, pepsi and many others.


&gt;If we were to scrap the minimum wage and employers were to work us 50 hours a week, we'd be more competitive and be able to undercut France and Germany - why should they allow that? Why should they allow us to compete with them ""on equal terms"", if we're not going to play fair?
If I buy a paraglider or a yacht, it has been CE tested to ensure it has safe handling and righting characteristics. I assume that cars and motorcycles undergo similar safety certification. This kind of safety testing has to be done for the benefit of all of us - how do you plan to replace it? This testing has to be paid for, to keep us safe - do you think that every country should have a different test? And don't tell me that manufacturers should pay for it - they already do, it's just that the EU administers it, and there's an ongoing cost to improving safety regulation and certifying new kinds of devices.
There are reasons for everything that is ""imposed on us"" by the EU - we've agreed to it because it's for our benefit as much as it's for Italy's and Greece's.

I am focusing on a scenario where the EU is stagnant, these issues persist regardless of the situation  



&gt;the solution is to reform the EU and fix its problems. Scrapping the EU would not reduce bureaucracy, but only increase our own.

I agree and at present that is what I will be voting for, however *""Scrapping the EU would not reduce bureaucracy""* What? Yes it would it every possible way, you would only have 1 nation not 28. This is sort of my point, if the EU does stagnate it lacks the speed to act and the speed to organise new trade deals and packages to support it. An independent UK would not, it may have many other hurdles but *bureaucracy* would be reduced.

&gt;UKIP regularly talk of ""slashing the overseas aid budget"", and that undermines their credibility, too, because it shows they don't understand the big picture

I think when they talk about cutting aid they are fully aware of it diplomatic uses, but perhaps see the money better spent elsewhere to gain that influence. 


I think you have a rather negative view of UKIP, just like the EU they have some good points and some bad, to dismiss them off hand is I think to be ignorant or highly informed.

He says that in support of siding with Assad, but if anything I think it shows the obvious problems. Whatever the advantages in fighting Nazi Germany, the choice to ally with Stalin condemned half of Europe to decades of oppresion amongst other bad outcomes. Nazi Germany wasn't uniquely evil at the time (history favours the victorious and all that).

Just like the story about arming the Kurds against IS, I think we need to consider whether anything in the Middle East can be solved by increasing the amount of weapons available, increasing the amount of violence or increasing the amount of outside meddling.

&gt;v, to glomp

&gt;NOT sexual, it is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a hug.

&gt;A glomp is often preadatory and lies somewhere in the grey area between a caring embrace, and a flying leap to tackle someone.

&gt;The term is used extesively in [anime](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=anime) culture, as well as online in text form (anime because many anime characters do this often, and online because it is short and descriptive).

Of course it's an emotional subject. We're talking about tools designed for killing. Emotion does not make an argument redundant.

&gt;fear

Yes, people are rightly afraid of people with guns. Most people will be no more dangerous holding a gun than without one. Many however, will be significantly more dangerous with a gun than without one.

&gt;ignorance

What ignorance? We look to the USA, where they accept self-defence as a reason for owning a firearm, and they have a ridiculously high murder rate compared to the rest of the first world.

You might argue that guns are not the problem, which is fine, but it would be asinine to claim they play no part.

What I always find most interesting is that between the UK and USA, figures for assaults, robberies, rapes and crime in general are not wildly different. It's difficult to get accurate figures, but in general, the disparity between crimes is nowhere near the same as the homicide rate.

It seems pretty logical that the country with more lethal weapons also has a higher rate of lethality when it comes to committing crime.",0,1408731697,null,0,false,0,cjxnxmd,t3_2e9jkb,t1_cjxnxmd,t1_cjxjp7w,null,1427407168,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; No, it is one which enforces quality and standards, I do not believe that it is the EU which makes products global brands. 

You appear to misunderstood completely.

You're a farmer, how do you sell your cheddar cheese if chinese ""cheddar"" smeg cheese is undercutting you? How do you sell lincolnshire pork sausages if polish farmers are free to sell fake ""lincolnshire sausages""?

How do you enforce these regional brand names, if foreign farmers are selling fake lincolnshire pork and cheddar in another country?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_protected_food_name_scheme
* https://www.gov.uk/protected-food-names-guidance-for-producers

How do you enforce regional product protection, if you scrap the EU?

&gt; What? Yes it would it every possible way, you would only have 1 nation not 28. 

How is it reducing bureaucracy to have to negotiate with 28 other countries, instead of just meeting a single, commonly agreed standard? 

Do you wish to negotiate with 28 different countries, ""ok, we'll accept that it should not be legal to sell 'champagne' if its grapes were not grown in the valley of the River Marne, if you'll agree that in France Stilton cheese sold must come from Melton Mobray""?

What happens when we make such an agreement with France, but then we're unable to agree the same set of protected food names with other countries? We then have an exclusive deal to sell Stilton cheese in France, but in Poland and Germany all kinds of fake sausages can be passed off as Lincolnshire ones?

What are you going to tell British farmers and dairymen, when you withdraw from the EU and their accredited status is now worthless? Now their products are worth less, because withdrawing from the EU has lost them their regionally-protected designation.

How can famers and supermarkets keep up with the rules if you're trying to negotiate with 28 different countries? When Tesco finds a new supplier of cornish pasties, which are cheaper, how do you expect them to deal with being able to sell them only in half of Europe, but not in the UK or other countries in which we've made trade agreements, because these are imitation cornish pasties, not made in cornwall. Does that sound efficient to you?

&gt; I think you have a rather negative view of UKIP,

Because they can't answer these kinds of questions.

Just like you're full of pretty words like ""agile"", and conversely ""stagnate"", UKIP are full of fancy ideas that could never actually work.

You have ignored most of the questions and issues I put to you in my previous response, because you don't have the answers. People want to scrap the EU because they ""don't like it"", but their dislike is basically prejudice, born of newspaper scaremongering. They don't have a better solution. 

&gt; I think when UKIP talk about cutting aid they are fully aware of it diplomatic uses, but perhaps see the money better spent elsewhere to gain that influence.

You're basically saying here that the party you're advocating for are fucking stupid. No-one else in politics, not in recent decades, thinks the same thing. Aid is discretionary spending, and for that reason it's very efficient - our PM and ministers get to spend it where they wish, and haggle for a deal. Aid is widely recognised to be far, FAR cheaper than wars, trade blockades or acrimony.

true,TheRabbiKop3,lfc99,,"A team’s first year back in the Champions League can be a major struggle.  This is because it stretches teams so thin with the addition of so much traveling and added games, not to mention the intensity of those games.  Gerrard will struggle to play every game at the ripe old age of 34 and the youth and energy brought in will prove important coming down the stretch.
The first and never changing factor and reason Liverpool will succeed in the Champions League is Anfield.  European nights are famous at Anfield and it has proven an impenetrable fortress in the past to the world’s finest players and teams.  Liverpool fans are famous for their support of the team at home and the excitement is unbearable.   Last year Liverpool regained their fear factor at Anfield only losing two matches to an impressive Southampton and Chelsea.  Their form at home was remarkable and played some of the most exciting football in the world as a result.  It was fast, explosive, and would start the second the whistle blew.  The ‘This is Anfield’ sign every away player must go under before entering the pitch is an intimidating reminder of what the dismantling the Reds have done to some of the best teams in the world in the past.  The intimate stadium will provide a lot of pressure even on the coolest of heads.  The Anfield factor will be huge in the Champions League and the amount of goals scored there, if the same scoring record is maintained from last year, could bring a massive boost in goal differential on aggregate.  The goal this year is to seal up the defense and the fans will do their part, ere is no denying that.
Sealing up the defense is important especially when it comes down to aggregate and away goals.  The transfer market is the first place that can provide an immediate impact to the defense.  Dejan Lovren was the first defender brought in from Southampton for 20 million pounds.  This could end up being the most important signing of the summer if all pans out appropriately.  The 25 year old is brought in to marshall the defense, bring organization and discipline to a unit that lacked just that last year.  He is also a great defender and anticipatory predator always finding the ball first.  If the defense can get around his leadership, then this unit can become a tighter ship and less goals allowed as a result.  Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo are two young Spanish fullbacks brought into the team this summer as well the past two weeks.  Alberto Moreno is 22 and is considered ready to start every game and solidify the left back spot for his own hopefully for years to come.  Pace and Spanish flair are two things he adds to offense as an outside back.  Speed is also why he is a good defender, as he had to compete against the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Gareth Bale last year and did fairly well.  As long as Lovren and Gerrard can manage his positioning and decision on when to go forward he can help plug up all those crosses that came from the opponent’s right hand side last year.  On the right hand side comes in twenty year old Javier Manquillo who will be fighting for a first team place and has already started the first game of the season there.  Manquillo is a great athlete and is a much bigger presence then Moreno not afraid to go hard into a tackle with anyone.  His tracking is also something that needs to be worked on, a common issue with young attacking outside backs.  These three transfers are massive to immediately bulk up the defense with two and possibly three starters.  If not only to inject their own quality to the team, they also give extra motivation to those they are potentially taking a starting spot from.  The likes of Glen Johnson and John Flanagan at right back as well as Sakho or Skrtel in the central defense have a lot to think about going forward as they are all at risk to lose playing time if they don’t step up.  This also intensifies training sessions which improves the team as a whole on a daily basis.
Tactically speaking Liverpool also have a few advantages which can help them in the Champions League.  The idea of high pressure is something some teams may not see at least not to the extent Liverpool do it to.  It is near impossible to prepare for the pace of Sterling, Sturridge, Coutinho, Henderson, Markovic, and Lallana especially when it comes to how they close the ball down.  The ultimate goal of closing the ball down high up the field is to force a quick turnover which can quickly turn into a goal with one or two passes.  The alternative to that is a clearance giving at least a 50/50 ball and an opportunity to win possession back.   High pressure up the field under Brendan Rodgers was displayed to perfection last season at times, but required more consistency.  Bringing in more depth, along with the experience of working with it for two years now will create more of a steadiness in success of high pressure from game to game.  Along with this high pressure comes the use of Liverpool’s speed.  There are only a few teams in the world with equal to or better (Real Madrid only) speed up top as Liverpool with Sturridge and Sterling leading the line.  Both are constant menaces with the ball at their feet always creating opportunities by running behind defense or beating a man one on one with speed alone.  Adding The quick feet of Lallana and the blistering pace of Markovic to the offense adds depth to that speed.  
The depth that Liverpool added this summer will prove to be the X factor in competing and succeeding in the Champions League.  Going back to Gerrard not being able to play every game, the transfer of Emre Can will be crucial as giving Gerrard the rest he needs to compete in important games as well as contributing himself and maybe becoming a starter over Joe Allen and Lucas.  Can has impressed all preseason and is a highly rated 20 year old German, his addition creating a good rotation in the middle of the park.  The only thing missing from Liverpool is true depth at the Striker position since the departure of Suarez, but Rodgers has admitted to itching to fix this issue this before the window shuts August 31st.  
Given the youth of the squad and the length of time since the last champions league game was played at Anfield, realistically succeeding in the champions this year is not winning it.  I think Liverpool will succeed if they make it out of the group stages which I believe is a goal of theirs.  I also believe they will make a run to the quarter-finals if they play to their upmost abilities.  Doing well in the Champions League takes place on the world stage and will only attract more top talent in the future, as well as provide more capital to support that talent coming in.",0,1408732614,null,0,false,0,cjxoezg,t3_2easqv,t1_cjxoezg,t3_2easqv,null,1427406923,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

true,paulbalaji,lfc99,,"&gt;A team’s first year back in the Champions League can be a major struggle.  This is because it stretches teams so thin with the addition of so much traveling and added games, not to mention the intensity of those games.  Gerrard will struggle to play every game at the ripe old age of 34 and the youth and energy brought in will prove important coming down the stretch.

&gt;The first and never changing factor and reason Liverpool will succeed in the Champions League is Anfield.  European nights are famous at Anfield and it has proven an impenetrable fortress in the past to the world’s finest players and teams.  Liverpool fans are famous for their support of the team at home and the excitement is unbearable.

&gt;Last year Liverpool regained their fear factor at Anfield only losing two matches to an impressive Southampton and Chelsea.  Their form at home was remarkable and played some of the most exciting football in the world as a result.  It was fast, explosive, and would start the second the whistle blew.  

&gt;The ‘This is Anfield’ sign every away player must go under before entering the pitch is an intimidating reminder of what the dismantling the Reds have done to some of the best teams in the world in the past.  The intimate stadium will provide a lot of pressure even on the coolest of heads.  The Anfield factor will be huge in the Champions League and the amount of goals scored there, if the same scoring record is maintained from last year, could bring a massive boost in goal differential on aggregate.  The goal this year is to seal up the defense and the fans will do their part, ere is no denying that.


&gt;Sealing up the defense is important especially when it comes down to aggregate and away goals.  The transfer market is the first place that can provide an immediate impact to the defense.  Dejan Lovren was the first defender brought in from Southampton for 20 million pounds.  This could end up being the most important signing of the summer if all pans out appropriately.  The 25 year old is brought in to marshall the defense, bring organization and discipline to a unit that lacked just that last year.  He is also a great defender and anticipatory predator always finding the ball first.  If the defense can get around his leadership, then this unit can become a tighter ship and less goals allowed as a result.  

&gt;Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo are two young Spanish fullbacks brought into the team this summer as well the past two weeks.  Alberto Moreno is 22 and is considered ready to start every game and solidify the left back spot for his own hopefully for years to come.  Pace and Spanish flair are two things he adds to offense as an outside back.  Speed is also why he is a good defender, as he had to compete against the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Gareth Bale last year and did fairly well.  

&gt;As long as Lovren and Gerrard can manage his positioning and decision on when to go forward he can help plug up all those crosses that came from the opponent’s right hand side last year.  On the right hand side comes in twenty year old Javier Manquillo who will be fighting for a first team place and has already started the first game of the season there.  Manquillo is a great athlete and is a much bigger presence then Moreno not afraid to go hard into a tackle with anyone.  His tracking is also something that needs to be worked on, a common issue with young attacking outside backs.  

&gt;These three transfers are massive to immediately bulk up the defense with two and possibly three starters.  If not only to inject their own quality to the team, they also give extra motivation to those they are potentially taking a starting spot from.  The likes of Glen Johnson and John Flanagan at right back as well as Sakho or Skrtel in the central defense have a lot to think about going forward as they are all at risk to lose playing time if they don’t step up.  This also intensifies training sessions which improves the team as a whole on a daily basis.

&gt;Tactically speaking Liverpool also have a few advantages which can help them in the Champions League.  The idea of high pressure is something some teams may not see at least not to the extent Liverpool do it to.  It is near impossible to prepare for the pace of Sterling, Sturridge, Coutinho, Henderson, Markovic, and Lallana especially when it comes to how they close the ball down.  The ultimate goal of closing the ball down high up the field is to force a quick turnover which can quickly turn into a goal with one or two passes.  The alternative to that is a clearance giving at least a 50/50 ball and an opportunity to win possession back.   

&gt;High pressure up the field under Brendan Rodgers was displayed to perfection last season at times, but required more consistency.  Bringing in more depth, along with the experience of working with it for two years now will create more of a steadiness in success of high pressure from game to game.  Along with this high pressure comes the use of Liverpool’s speed.  There are only a few teams in the world with equal to or better (Real Madrid only) speed up top as Liverpool with Sturridge and Sterling leading the line.  Both are constant menaces with the ball at their feet always creating opportunities by running behind defense or beating a man one on one with speed alone.  

&gt;Adding The quick feet of Lallana and the blistering pace of Markovic to the offense adds depth to that speed.  
The depth that Liverpool added this summer will prove to be the X factor in competing and succeeding in the Champions League.  Going back to Gerrard not being able to play every game, the transfer of Emre Can will be crucial as giving Gerrard the rest he needs to compete in important games as well as contributing himself and maybe becoming a starter over Joe Allen and Lucas.  Can has impressed all preseason and is a highly rated 20 year old German, his addition creating a good rotation in the middle of the park.  

&gt;The only thing missing from Liverpool is true depth at the Striker position since the departure of Suarez, but Rodgers has admitted to itching to fix this issue this before the window shuts August 31st.  

&gt;Given the youth of the squad and the length of time since the last champions league game was played at Anfield, realistically succeeding in the champions this year is not winning it.  I think Liverpool will succeed if they make it out of the group stages which I believe is a goal of theirs.  

&gt;I also believe they will make a run to the quarter-finals if they play to their upmost abilities.  Doing well in the Champions League takes place on the world stage and will only attract more top talent in the future, as well as provide more capital to support that talent coming in.

/wavey out of focus 

I went to London for the first time to see some friends who would take me to the clubs I had read about and took plenty of supplies to fund my visit, ironically (from the side bar of the article) being a regular at many DIY soundsystem parties I wasn't really dressed for the gardening club in covent garden, still whirly gig was promised so rode it out despite sticking out like a sore thumb.

At whirly gig I was speaking to my new best friends and was told about the demo, now to me the criminal justice bill was all about stopping me partying so obviously I was up for it the free party and possibility of being able to rid of some my supplies played no part.

Next morning, me and my mates who I came down to crash with are stood on embankment a couple of hours early because remembering conversations and the like where muddled.

So the march is in progress, tender from the night before and plastered in stickers while chanting kill the bill, offloading some supplies on the way. We end up at Hyde park, got a nice spot overlooking the stage of speakers. Pocket full of cash, smoking my supplies in the sun is feeling nice.

Tony Ben makes a comment that is pro 'us' we cheer, everyone cheers. Two women come over to me asking for a swap of my supplies for some acid. Deal done.

We laugh that we have been done because I was palmed with 3 tabs of corrugated cardboard. Still we deduce the gamble of swallowing cardboard against the promised land is negligible so my friend drops one and I chew the rest.

Next thing is, it's dark and I'm dancing in front of a soundsystem that is built on a bike frame and some bloke is dancing in front of me with a massive cardboard spanner giving me the turns.

The helicopter that is telling us to disperse or force will be used is staying in the air because the spotlight is the plinth that it's rotating round.

Look around, nope no one I recognise, wander over to the crowed and see the police front line rushing protesters while some protesters are stood on top of telephone boxes lobbing stuff into the police.

Nope my head doesn't need this, follow pavement through Hyde park while flicking V's at the balancing helicopter telling me to disperse. 

Try to falg a taxi at the other end of Hyde park with a bunch of others and realise no one is stopping, we rip off any stickers and I somehow manage to get back to my friends with a new found best friend.

My friend had been home for hours, we all enjoyed a couple of sniffs and hot sweet tea.

Just another night.

Went home to my mums and I found out not only was I somehow subscribed to the socialist worker, but I was on the front page

&gt;Yes, I got that bit already.. Costa is also at Chelsea and so is Fabregas? Your point? They can't start for us if they came from another team? 

&gt;&gt; yes and he could come in and start just like them. But they didn't have anyone in front of them in their positions that earned their spot to start. Did I say players that came from other teams can't start? 


&gt;really now
&gt;&gt;yes really. So why does he lose out on his spot just because we bought another player? That player has to take it. He will get time to show it's his. 
Luis is a wonderful player. One of the best LB but he doesn't get a starting spot without competing. Like everyone else. Our back 4 is a 4 you can rely on. Our striker was not. Our other midfield player was not. Our defense and LB last year were great.  This is why Luis has a little bit more of a challenge to making the starting line up.

true,RedEdMilliband,null,null,"Doing the most you can do for Islam is what many Muslims are trained to do from birth. It compels you to being extreme to gain points for a higher place in heaven. Pray 5 times a day, every day. Do your ritualistic chanting. Do your fasting at Ramadan, and then the additional fasts throughout the year. Dress like Mohammed or his wives did. Grow your beard. Use a miswak to brush your teeth. Become a Hafiz (memorise the Quran). Wipe your arse with the correct hand whilst eating with the other. Don't eat all the prohibited foods. Don't sin in any of the many ways the Koran says you can sin. 

The list just goes on and on. The sense of shame someone who truly believes must feel for not bothering with any of this for so many years must be overwhelming. The need to want to do more among the already seriously devout must be all encompassing. But what does the Koran say trumps all of this behaviour? All of this behaving as Mohammed did from dawn until dusk? That's right - being a martyr. 

The koran is very very clear on this - there is nothing better than dying to spread or protect Islam (Jihad). So those Muslims who have that shame that want to atone, those Muslims who are devout and want to do more, and those people who converted and genuinely regret not being born a Muslim, would love nothing more than dying in pursuit of jihad. There is a widespread belief and acceptance that heaven has many levels, with prophets, the most righteous and martyrs right at the top. Martyrdom is a first class ticket from being right at the bottom of the many levels to the top.

I included Balotelli in my squad, but I had to leave out Borini, Assaidi, and Coates, because there isn't any room for them in the squad. With this in mind, I expect us to sell a few players without replacing them.

The squad I came up with was:

Club Grown | Association Grown | Others | U21s | Left Out
---|---|---|---|---|---
Gerrard | Jones | Enrique | Loads of players + | Borini
 Empty spot | Johnson | Toure | Suso | Coates
 Empty spot | Lambert | Agger | Sterling | Assaidi
 Empty spot | Henderson | Lovren | Flanagan |

 | | Mignolet | |
 | | Can | |
 | | Skrtel | |
 | | Markovic | |
 | | Balotelli | |


We have to have four club grown players in our 25 man list (Club Grown + Association Grown + Others), or we have to leave empty spaces. Currently, we need three more club grown players. My list works because I have only registered 22 players.

Note that the U21s could be placed in Club Grown, but it doesn't actually make a difference. The players I've left out still won't fit. Also, the Others column has a few players that are under 21.

Where this argument falls apart is that we aren't talking about a good quality download. Stuff filmed in a cinema is probably the shittiest quality imaginable.

Natwest don't roll up all the charges into a single monthly payment. If you exceed your overdraft you'll get charged 21 days after. They'll give you a minimum of 14 days notice of this.

If it's constantly putting you over, you'll be getting charged every week. You must have gone over your overdraft at least once to trigger it and haven't read the charge notice.

Spend less or arrange a small overdraft. In 3 weeks (21 days) you'll stop getting charged. 

This isn't complex, it's not a conspiracy theory or a web of lies and deceit. If you consistently go over your overdraft then you'll consistently get charged. This is explained in plain English on the website.

There probably are banks with lower charges but what's happening to you doesn't need a genius to explain it.

Why would the UK leave any of these agreements? Many nations I suspect follow the EU standard and in return are protected, why would the UK be any different? 


&gt;How is it reducing bureaucracy to have to negotiate with 28 other countries, instead of just meeting a single, commonly agreed standard?

*commonly agreed standard* more people that have to agree on something the longer it takes


&gt;What are you going to tell British farmers and dairymen, when you withdraw from the EU and their accredited status is now worthless? Now their products are worth less, because withdrawing from the EU has lost them their regionally-protected designation.

Has this happened to any of the other nations not in the EU but in Europe? I don't see why leaving the EU would negate all of these, surely could still adhere to a common EU standards on food? 

&gt;How can famers and supermarkets keep up with the rules if you're trying to negotiate with 28 different countries?

Thought the point of the EU was that we would only deal with one? 

&gt;Does that sound efficient to you?

Granted it does not, but lets put an alternate spin on this Asia's economy is now $18 Trillion, South america'a $ 3 Trillion. The UK is not going to be grow rich selling them cheese or bread, geography will dictate that, our intrest in them and indeed their interest in us is in our big industries, education ,pharmaceuticals, Financial services, business services, Cars, aerospace. If Europe stagnates, food exports aren't going to save them, no, if the price to pay for trading in big industry with the rest of the world is loss of control a say over potato waffles I think it is gamble the UK should think about. 

&gt;Because they can't answer these kinds of questions.

Are you sure they don't, admittedly I have only recently started to really look into them, but I find it strange to think they have to been covered.

&gt;People want to scrap the EU because they ""don't like it"", but their dislike is basically prejudice, born of newspaper scaremongering. They don't have a better solution.

Some people might be, mine, well I like to consider myself informed and open minded enough to look at such issues objectively.

&gt;You're basically saying here that the party you're advocating

*advocating* Please see the title, I posing a question, not making a claim or statement of support

&gt;Aid is discretionary spending, and for that reason it's very efficient - our PM and ministers get to spend it where they wish, and haggle for a deal. Aid is widely recognised to be far, FAR cheaper than wars, trade blockades or acrimony.

I agree with you entirely, however painting their approach as stupid denies any possible merits a discussion may hold. 

Anyway, I think we have got quite far removed from what I wanted to discuss, namely *Does the potential stagnation of Europe lend more credence to UKIP?*

Because it's great to be in a position where your own people, and the rest of the world has confidence in your ability to back your words with action. It gives us political and diplomatic clout that people actually take seriously. When Norway lodges a complaint about another nations behavior it is a joke. It is a pointless exercise that is ridiculed. People ridicule countries like Norway when they try to pitch their views on the international stage. Because they cannot back those views with action. Not just aggressive actions, but actions generally. Whether that is securing your digital space from cyber attacks or preventing home grown terrorists like the IRA or Al Qaeda to launching a full blow expeditionary mission overseas. When other nations or parties act in a manner which is against our interest, they can be confident that there will be a reprisal against them which they won't like. Whether its effective economic sanctions or a full blown military incursion.

Nobody needs an army, until they **NEED** an army. 

I can see how little Johnny McTartan up in Aberdeen might see all this as a distant and abstract threat, which isn't going to affect an independent Scotland because they are a small and peaceful nation. Who would want to act against their interests? But sometimes the real world is not so simple. Sometimes threats come from unusual directions and for unusual reasons. Ultimately Argentina invaded the Falkland islands not out of some grudge against the British, but to distract their own people from their domestic economic problems. Similarly, the Chinese don't launch cyber attacks out of some fanatical hatred of the west, but as part of their own expansionist technological and economic ambitions.

I think Scots might actually find it rather a reversal to be in a position where they voice their strong opinions on international matters, and the international community brushes those views aside as insignificant.

They were straight up told that this guy was a suicide bomber and was going to detonate the device on the train, they fully believed they had no choice but to shoot him in the head with no warning otherwise that bomb would go off.

There was no evidence at all to justify what they did, it was almost like a tragic game of Chinese whispers, shit information being passed on from MI5, to Police, to Police Gold commanders, to counter terrorism experts, to special branch, to firearms tactics advisors, to the firearms supervisor on the ground then finally to the armed police.

I would contact the seller direct, since your contract is with them and if it's the estate agent's error then the seller may apply pressure to them to make it right. If that doesn't work I'd probably see Citizen's Advice - it sounds like you'd have a reasonable case and a letter threatening small claims court might be enough on its own. 

The fact that the agent recommends changing the locks is immaterial, since:

* even if you do want to change the lock, doing so with the existing keys is an easy job to do yourself, but to open the locked door without the keys will require a locksmith or something more invasive, and

* it's none of their bloody business anyway.

Depends on what your skin likes really and how much time you have. I've used a combo AHA/BHA cream gel, and separate toner style exfoliators. I try to do the wait for 30 minutes each, but if I'm rushed then I only wait 10 minutes each.

BHA: Neutrogena Stress Lotion, I forget it's name but it's green.

AHA: Eucerin 2% Lactic Acid toner. 

I've used nip+fab glycolic pads and loved them.
