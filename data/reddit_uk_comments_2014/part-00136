If he can show that he's capable in the PL then it's maybe worth giving him a shot with the first team.

&gt;Explain to me why you think it is ok for protesters to hurl this kind of abuse at ordinary citizens of this country. I understand why you might do it to the actual politicians in the party

One rule for one type of citizen and a different one for another (politicians) then?  They're protesting; that means they're going to protest.  Personally I wish everyone could get by without speaking to each other like that; but like I said, when you peddle politics of exclusion and nationalism like UKIP do, you're going to upset people.  UKIP makes the front pages everyday by upsetting people, that's how they get their coverage.  That's why people probably think it's reasonable to give their supporters grief. 

&gt; it is everyone's democratic right to hear these things. 

And everyone's democratic right to protest at these meetings.  It goes both ways or no way. 

&gt;Attack the policies, attack the politicians, but don't attack the citizens of this country

It's not like they're searching these citizens out in their homes; these people are going to political rallies where they know there's going to be heated opposition.  They know what they're getting into.  They're showing their political affiliation in public, just like the UAF are.

&gt;If your supporters are being assaulted in this way, being scared away from coming to your meetings of course you are going to try to stop them

And if anyone tried to stop Farage speaking his mind on immigrants because it was offensive or someone felt verbally ""assaulted,"" he'd be the first up on his high horse about freedom of speech.  Again, it's got to work both ways, or scrap free speech altogether.

We had a good few chances last night, and with more luck one or two of them might have hit the mark. I think it'd be nice if we can match them blow for blow, similar to the Burnley home game. That said, who knows what effect the big game pressure will have on them? Maybe they'll be too nervous to go in all guns blazing. The same can be said for us I suppose.

If they stick with 4-5-1, the big question is who helps Barton cover the defenders? Gary O'Neil? Karl Henry? Of course you also have to say a few prayers that Joey himself maintains his cool. If ever there's a time for him not to go pop, this is it.

There's a few Derby fans that have invaded WATRB for discussion - one of them said that he doesn't have the greatest faith in the teams fullbacks. That being the case, I think Traoré and Hoilett could be useful in unlocking their flanks. I'd worry that they'd have too few targets other than Austin though...unless you abandon the lone striker gig and send on Zamora too.

I'd definitely go with Yun...as soon as he came on we immediately had an outlet down the left that neither Hill or BAE offer. I'd seen video of that tricky footwork he employs when taking on a man, but yesterday we got to see it live. If their fullbacks are indeed a weak link then presumably this works in favour of including Yun. I guess you just have to accept the buyer beware label in terms of the same expectations of his defensive play.

I'm not Redknapp's biggest fan, but I will trust him to mix the right selection and tactics for the day. I'm certainly not expecting an easy win. All I ask is that we don't get embarrassed and the players give a good account of themselves. Can't really ask for more than that.

I'm not overly interested in the street art side of graffiti (as seen in /r/graffiti), but more into true /r/bombing style tagging and also what I call vernacular graffiti, that is graffiti without any articstic intentions at all. 

Northern Ireland is, over course, a heavily politicised space and vernacular graffiti is one of the major ways in which territory is marked. It is a handy gauge of the political and social temperature within Norn Iron in general or in a particular enclave- this is particularly notable when there are threats put up about a local resident accused of being a ""tout"" or a paedophile, everybody knows where they stand then.

Take Carvalho, as an example.  We've looked at the player in the not too distant past so somehow that gets twisted into he's signing tomorrow or we're in the lead or whatever nonsense.   Being interested in a player does not mean we're signing them.  Until a proper bid is made (like with Lallana) there is no chance of them signing with us.  Even when the bid is made (like with Lallana) it still needs to be accepted before anything else can happen and even then the deal can still fall apart (Konoplyanka).

Most of the rumors I've seen are indeed people we seemingly have an interest in, but only a few of those will go past interest to talking to the players agent and agreeing broad terms, of those only a few will go to an official bid, of those only a few will be agreed, and of those only a few will actually sign.",0,1400005604,null,0,false,0,chh0z1s,t3_25gmi4,t1_chh0z1s,t3_25gmi4,null,1433780005,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Lets look at what is actually stated in the article: 

&gt;Janice Atkinson, Ukip’s South East chair, said party leader Nigel Farage was “very concerned for the safety of candidates” due to appear at a public meeting

So there is the concern over the safety of the people coming to the meeting. Is that unfair? 

&gt;“We are asking police to act under the Public Order Act. If we are having pensioners turning up and being called racist Nazi sluts, little old ladies who themselves or their parents probably fought in the war – that’s a hate crime, it’s inciting the public to violence.”

Id too would be very upset to see an old lady being attacked by a protester, wouldn't you?


&gt;Ms Atkinson said the party was expecting “a rabble of about 100 – but it could be more – from Hope Not Hate, Unite Against Fascism and a new group linked to [Green Party leader] Natalie Bennett called Movement Against Xenophobia.

it is well known that Unite Against Fascism is basically the ELD of the left. A bunch of thugs out for a fight. I too would be very concerned about the safety of the people going to the meeting if UAF was going to be there.

Farage himself was physically attacked by Hope Not Hate

***My school's titles were much weirder:***

Head of Drama and Music: Playwright &amp; Mæstro, the Master Fludgate.

Head of MFL: Master/Mistress Letters, Madam Ludlow. (Always reffered to as Mistress Letters. Never Madam Ludlow)

Head of Mathematics: The Hellenic, Madam Woodcock. 

Head of Science: The Learned, Master Bush. 

Head of ICT: Master of Computation, Master Johns

Head of Games (Sport, PE): Drillmaster/Drillmistress, Madam Willies. (She got laughed at a lot. Didn't help she was always referred to as 'Drillo Willies')

School nurse: Matron D'Francesco

Head of punishment: Proctor D'Francesco

School librarian: Bookkeeper-General, Technician Mallon

Science Lab tech: Engineer-General, Technician Mallon

Tuck-shop seller: Confectioner-General, Ms Franks

Head Groundsman: Gamekeeper-General, Mr C. Davids.

Head Driver: Carriagemaster-General, Mr F. Davids. (We had our own private school-busses)

School priest: Rector, the Padre Lyons.

School Bursar: just 'Bursar'. There was an old rule that you could never say the Bursar's name, on pain of being ""put on Jobs"" (Punishment). Even the faculty never broke this rule to my knowledge.

Head of the boarders: High Master of Board, Master Johns

Head boy and girl: Lord &amp; Lady [Student's name]. (No, seriously, *Lord &amp; Lady*.)

Head Prefect: High Stick, Mister/Miss [Student's name]. (Used to be called Fagmaster-in-Chief until this became *extremely* un-pc in the 80s. Just reffered to as 'High Stick', or 'Stickers' if you were their friend.)

Deputy Head Prefects: the two Slippers (Used to be called 2nd Fagmasters)

Ordinary prefects: Sticks 

My favourite, the Head of History: ***Master of Tomes***, the Master Dr O'Connor. (I hate this man. Massively.)

You can protest against policies, you can protest against parties or events. That is fine.

Standing in the street and shouting fascist at every person who walks into a public meeting is not a protest. It is intimidation. Unless you are protesting against the ability for people to make up their own minds.

 Tell me where else this type of protest takes place? Where it is the people who support the policy, and not the policy itself who are attacked.

That's not what assault is.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"We do have a wider choice, but in that wider choice i still rank FdB and Pochettino as pretty close to the top. Both have strengths and weaknesses but i genuinely like what both could offer.

Outside of those two...

I don't want Rafa, not because he isn't proven (because he has the full CV that we would all love to have) but because he has a history of falling out with owners and boards over his spending. Which just spells disaster with us.  Add into the fact that he is an arrogant asshole and i feel like appointing Rafa would be an exceptionally short term solution.

I am not a fan of Mancini or Capello (who we have been rumored with) because their style of football tends to be a bit conservative for my tastes.

I would love Tuchel who has done fantastic work for Mainz on a shoestring budget, just announced he is leaving Mainz but i think he still ends up in Germany somewhere and i can't see Levy/Baldini making a move for him anyways.

I personally like Luciano Spalletti and the style of football he plays, thing he would be a huge, HUGE longshot but he has had success in multiple leagues and really had Totti playing spectacular football under him at Roma. Think he could really do some interesting things with Eriksen and Lamela.

Murat Yakin is a solid manager on the rise, having seen his teams in the European competitions he can certainly manage against the big boys, is very tactically adept and still plays attractive football. He is 39 and is already on his 5th managerial appointment as he has done well at each stop that a bigger team has come in for him.

Roger Schmidt is going to get a look by someone at some point, he has had that Salzburg team banging in goals and punching above their weight class for a couple seasons now.

As for a true darkhorse that i know we won't make a move for....Sean Dyche from Burnley, they play a nice style of football, he is tactically adept, and he gets performance from players on small budget. Got Burnley 2nd in the Championship behind Leicester for a fraction of the cost. Add in how he has gotten Danny Ings playing this season and he would be an interesting option.  We would NEVER consider him but in a season or so i think someone will be making a move for him.....In truth, Sherwood should look how Dyche approached his management progression and follow suit.

A workers co-operative is a system by which the shares are held in trust. The trust operates on the say so of the workers.

The main principle that effectively made this type of system illegal is Thatcher gave all the stakeholders in such institutions the right to dissolve the institution on a simple majority vote. That is why all the building societies collapsed into banks. It was explicitly made trivial to do so. There were a number of other assaults on mutual societies like the Thatcher government claiming that the state owned the TSBs which they then privatised.

The 4th year is still structured learning with lectures and tutorials, although there are more opportunities for independent research and presentation of ideas. The standard course is in fact the 4 year undergraduate masters course, so you basically decide by just after the start of third year whether you want to finish early.

The personal statement is certainly more important at universities which don't have an opportunity to interview or set an assessment, although Warwick is notable for giving out the same extremely high offer to basically every applicant as far as I know (and they are very good).

Not many places; but most parties don't peddle the politics that UKIP do. You'll find exactly this kind of protest at BNP or EDL events, because they support policies that segregate the population and apportion blame in various ways; that pisses people off.

&gt;If you knew what UAF is really like, or hope not hate for that matter you wouldn't bring them up

I bring them up because that's the group in question as per the article.

Well, that's your opinion, and as you said earlier, all opinions are equally valid, so you have to accept that lots of people think the opposite to you here.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;UAF etc have nothing to do with the discussion nor any actual assaults,

They are mentioned in the article as being some of the people who are going to protest. Their members have been arrested for attacking people before, as a result of them being there, there is a great amount of fear that people going to the meeting will be attacked by them. They have done it in the past, is it unreasonable to think they might do it again? Ad is it unreasonable to ask the police to be there to arrest them in case they do? how on earth is mentioning that trying to derail the discussion? 

&gt;I have shown you the quotation, they want people arrested for calling them Fascists.

&gt;“call our supporters fascists, hurl other abuse or any physical assault” to be arrested.

The police can only arrest them if they commit a crime. Calling someone a fascist on its own is not a crime, but as i have tried to explain it can be part of a crime. The article mentions the law the protesters could be arrested under, its the Public Order Act 1986. You'll need to read though it yourself but basically there are several main ways you can be in breach of this act. Riot,Violent disorder,Affray,Fear or provocation of violence, Intentional harassment, alarm or distress or Harassment, alarm or distress. 

No one is calling for people to be arrested just because they shouted the word fascist, but if their actions break any of the laws in this act then they should be arrested. If UAF or hope not hate are going to be there, there is a good chance they will be breaking at least one of these laws, as there are a large number of violent thugs in those organisations and the people attending the meeting have a right to be defended from them.

&gt;Just yesterday a man was visited by police for creating a modified anti UKIP poster that linked UKIP sources to verify the claims made on the poster.

Azpi and Coleman have also had that explosive growth this season. Wilshere was far ahead of Shaw when he was 18, yet when he is mature a player who was avarage before this season has benched him. Ramsey if not worldclass for his performance this season, is that much closer to it than Wilshere. Both have been injured so the comparison should not be that extreme.

I just think the guy is being set to fail, so much expectation before he had shown anything exept that he is better than other young fullbacks.

But walking up to someone in the street, as part of a large mob, and shouting and screaming in their face would put them in a position where they feel they might be physically attacked. That IS assault.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""You lot"" is a pretty useless term for such a diverse group of people as all the supporters of a large football club. Your comment might describe some of us, but it does the discussion no favour to overgeneralize like that. In my personal opinion, there are two primary reasons for why the defensive side of Spurs' game has been sorely lacking, and none of those have anything to do with a manager who's not defensively minded enough. The first reason is the squad: there is obviously not enough defensive quality there, as evidenced by the number of personal blunders and poor decisions leading to conceded goals throughout the season.  The second reason is the team's mentality (or, rather, the lack thereof). This was a problem under both Sherwood, who didn't have a tactically apt bone in his body, and AVB, who was nothing if not defensive in his tactical approach. This is evidenced both in the way Spurs would concede far too many early goals, and in the way they collapsed completely in games under both managers.

As to your question, I can obviously only speak for myself. I want a manager with an offensive mind, one who likes to play good, entertaining attacking football. Not at the expense of too much defensive integrity, obviously (this year's Liverpool are the best indication of why that's a bad idea), but the main objective of any game should not be to avoid conceding at any cost. Of course, the Liverpool supporters I have spoken to might have exaggerated how defensive Benitez really is, but after a year and a half of AVB's planlessly-banging-your-head-against-the-wall attacking while conceding as little as possible, I would rather see them err on the side of incaution and hire someone who's slightly too offensive, than sit through another potentially meaninglessly boring season of passing back and forth.",0,1400008079,null,0,false,0,chh26zw,t3_25fuui,t1_chh26zw,t1_chgvyxe,null,1433780580,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;That IS assault. 

I don't think the police agree with you.  They haven't been arresting UAF protesters *en masse* for assault.  UKIP are just asking them to.

&gt;Most sensible people have gotten past the idea that UKIP is anything like those organisations, 

No, I don't think that's the view of most sensible people.  Most sensible people have UKIP pegged somewhere to the less radical / lunatic side of the BNP.  They might not be brothers, but they're cousins - or at least they attract supporters from the same groups.

&gt;What racist policies do UKIP have exactly?

It's not a question of policy, Farage isn't stupid enough to pull a Nick Griffin. However, whenever he's interviewed -  economy not doing well?  Blame it on Europe / immigrants.  Unemployed?  Blame it on Europe / immigrants.  Business costs too high?  Blame it on Europe / immigrants.  Problems with the NHS? Blame it on Europe / immigrants.  These are the kind of things that annoy people, section off a group of the population and blame everything on them.  

Personally I think it's incorrect to call UKIP supporters fascist, but the things Farage and other UKIPers say out loud sail pretty close to parts of Fascist ideology sometimes.  Pride in national identity, a xenophobic outlook etc...

&gt;then you should understand why a police presence is entirely justified. 

Sure, people in crowds are stupid and the police should be there to make sure all goes smoothly.  That's not the same as asking the police to silence the nasty man / woman who's calling you a fascist by arresting them.",0,1400008928,null,0,false,0,chh2m30,t3_25fya8,t1_chh2m30,t1_chh24s7,null,1433780778,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,SvalbardBear,cnty-scotland,Exiled Scot,"I find these videos really depressing.  Not because of the content - though I disagree entirely with the BNP's core values and policies - but because it is such an obvious exploitation of children for political capital. 

These children might have come to their conclusions on society on their own.  Equally as likely, however, is that they are the sons and daughters of BNP members who have raised them with these beliefs and encouraged them to be as vocal as possible about them, or that they come from home environments where their parents just don't care, and they have been radicalised to the point where they've worked out that they can get positive regard within their community by doing something like this.  

And now, however they came to this point, they are the poster children of a political party that is demonised throughout the United Kingdom.  Think about the consequences that these kids are going to face from this point on.  The police, armed forces and other public sector jobs are forever closed to them.  So, too, will certain private sector jobs that have no desire to employ individuals from an extreme political party.  Aside from that, they're likely to be shunned by others who see this that find their views unappetising.  They might think that they're doing the right thing by standing up for their beliefs and country, but I would be surprised if they had seriously thought through the various consequences that they are likely to come into contact with.

""So what?"" you might ask, ""They shouldn't be working in these environments with these views and society has every right to tell them how unpaletable their political ideology is."" and I would agree with that view.  I agree that card-carrying members of the BNP should be barred from public sector jobs due to the extreme views they hold and the liklihood that they will be unable to treat the public equally and without predjudice.  I also agree with having the right to disagree with people who publically state their views.  But remember that these are children.  How many of us held strong/radical views when we were teenagers?  Part of growing up is holding very strong opinions about something and feeling that nothing else is ever going to be as important and that you have to get involved somehow.  Learning to see things from the other side and dealing with arguments in the round is part of the formative process of learning and forming your own opinons and ideology.  How many of us exited our teens with fully formed political opinions?  I didn't.

I hope that these individuals move on and leave their association with the BNP behind.  I worry, however, that their participation in these activities will leave a lasting stain on their lives.

These children have been exploited by those around them, the BNP most of all.  I have nothing but sympathy for them. 

Edit: TL;DR - The BNP Youth have been exploited and the consequences of this video will follow them for the rest of their lives.  This makes me sad.

Edit2: Realised I said I don't agree with card-carrying members of the BNP being banned from public sector jobs when I do.  Whoops.  Should proof-read my posts better.",0,1400010106,null,0,1400013015,0,chh37ce,t3_25g9l0,t1_chh37ce,t3_25g9l0,null,1433781056,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,QPRCHOC,null,null,"Honestly, the thing that worries me the most is our financial situation. I was all for spending at least two seasons in the Championship at the start of the season; I thought it was what was needed to repair the damage inflicted by Hughes. The thing is, all the signs point to Harry trying to get us up at the first attempt. We've invested quite heavily in loan signings, a lot of our players are getting on, and I feel like there's just been this underlying sense of desperation at the club to get us up at the first attempt. I don't think it was easy convincing TF to make the signings we've done this season. If we have the ability do deal with at least another season in the championship, then I'd feel a lot more comfortable with the possibility of cup-final defeat. Obviously I'd like to see us go up, but I never expected us to be challenging for promotion this season.

I can't help but feel Redknapp will leave Yun out yet again, but hey, who knows better than the manager what's best for the team? I think what is absolutely vital though, is that Hoilett turns up. He can score goals and change the game, but all too often his selfishness has let him and the team down. All we want is for players like him and Morrison to show up and give it their all and we have a big chance.

I'm not too concerned with Austin being our only target. He can do nothing all game and score a goal or two, like he did against Wigan last night. Which is why we need the players in behind him on their game. It's just a shame that it's very rare we have our front three all working in sync, taking last night as an example, I thought Krancjar petered out as the game wore on, while Hoilett wasted a lot of chances before winning the penalty.

Avoiding the early goal has to be top priority. You could just feel the dread in the stadium when Perch scored on Monday night, and considering we're a low-scoring side we have *got* to shut them out for as long as possible, perhaps hang on for 0-0 at HT.

As you say, I'd be happy to go out having made a good game of it, but I just worry whether a second season in the Championship is part of the plan. I have this conspiracy theory that getting promoted via the play-offs has been our plan all along to get that prize-money in the final, and we've only been appearing to play poorly in the second half of the season ;)",0,1400010321,null,0,false,0,chh3b7w,t3_25fwn3,t1_chh3b7w,t1_chh0uy5,null,1433781106,2,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,2

&gt;No, I don't think that's the view of most sensible people. 

UKIP are on form to gain the most seats in the Euro parliament elections. They have massive support from the public. Eventually people who oppose UKIP's right to exist will have to admit that they just aren't really that interested in democracy, and would rather their views take precedent. 

&gt;section off a group of the population and blame everything on them.

No immigrants would have to leave the UK under UKIP plans, and more immigrants from around the world, not just the EU would be able to come under a points based system. No one is being blamed apart from the current government and the one that preceded it.

You might not have any, but is it really fascist to have pride in the country you come from. The entire world is guilt of being fascist in that case. 

&gt;That's not the same as asking the police to silence the nasty man / woman who's calling you a fascist by arresting them.

That is not what is being asked. If you read the article it says that they want them to be arrested if they break the Public order act 1986, which might include calling people fascist in an alarming, distressing or intimidating way.

true,kylotan,null,null,"I've lived here for about 18 years now, renting throughout, so I've had a lot of experience with the various agencies. Sadly there is not a single one I can recommend; they are all pretty much parasites who make it their job to do as little for you as possible while taking your cash. With students often now living in more expensive accommodation there is less of a division between student lets and professional lets, which in turn means agencies don't really have to fight to keep you even if you're a good tenant. All you can do is make sure you get everything in writing and are as belligerent about repairs and other things as you need to be. And nag them about your deposit as soon as you move out - many are flaunting the law regarding how long they hold onto it and are hoping you don't know your rights well enough.

If I had to talk about specific agencies I might avoid John German (they like to spring the ""surprise! 5 other people at your flat viewing"" trick), Robin Thomson (they took my fees and then refused to have anything else to do with the letting), and Spencer Birch (gave me an inventory with broken stuff hidden from it, and only made a token effort to fix anything). Hodgson Elkington are very professional and do things by the book but are mostly just commercial so don't expect much help if you need it. City Lettings were okay, Martin and Co were okay. Relatively speaking. Had a few private lets too, which were a mixed bag.

Deposit is almost always either 1 month's rent or 1 month + £100. Then you'll have something between £50 and £150 of fees on top of that, usually for trivial reference checking and for printing out an inventory that they will probably ask you to sign before you even see the place. Plus they'll want 1 month's rent in advance, though most will let you wait until the start of the rental period before paying that (though not all).

Can't help on the pet-friendly front unfortunately.

For example Bob Crow was quite anti-EU as he thought it made the lives of ordinary working class Brits much harder by forcing down wages.

The renationalising of the railways or the protection of key industries is hardly something thats only considered the way forward by the BNP. Plenty of people in Labour want the same thing.

So, even though I find the BNP on the whole quite loathsome and most of what they believe in utterly idiotic I do think its wrong to dismiss the concerns of a lot of their supporters.",0,1400010851,null,0,false,0,chh3l14,t3_25g9l0,t1_chh3l14,t1_chgw9bz,null,1433781239,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This happened all the way through primary and secondary school.

If a female teacher got married we were informed and taught to change the title of ""Miss"" to ""Ms"" or ""Mrs"" according to her preference.

To me the title shows deference to their position! As a child I wouldn't even call my friends parents by their first name unless told to. It was always ""Mr/Miss/Ms/Mrs [Last Name]"" out of respect, unless you were specifically told to address them otherwise.

Just wouldn't be allowed jobs or benefits though.  So while the policies don't explicitly call for their removal, that would be the *de facto* state of things.

Chauvinistic expression of national identity, along with xenophobia are present in Fascist ideology.  There's not really a way round that.

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,"Yes, Scottish heritage on one side and dutch on the other. A relatively unusual Scottish Clan name plus lots of family traditions made it easy for my grandpa to trace when he got bored of being retired.  

Interestingly (although I don't know if they're still spouting this policy) I could potentially end up nation-less under the BNP. They had a big thing about taking away British passports from people who weren't ethnically British (i.e. weren't born here) a couple of years ago. I've had a British passport since I was born (Through my dad who was born in Inverness) and never actually got a South African passport and my South African citizenship was revoked when I turned 18 (because I was living in a foreign country as a citizen of that country and didn't specifically say I didn't want to lose it). 

Racist people are definitely nicer to me until they find it out (I work in a care home and the elder generation are either inherently more racist or just don't care about hiding it anymore). 

EDIT: I removed the story about one of my residents because I became a bit worried about patient confidentiality. Everything was anonymised and probably fine but I can't be too careful. 


EDIT: I was curious and did a bit of research and it turns out since I received my British citizenship before I was 18 I am still a South African citizen as it was my parents decision to take on dual nationality. It also means that my sister and I have been entering South Africa illegally because as South African citizens, we have to enter on our South African passports (which we don't have). It also means that any children I have would also be South African citizens by descent through their South African parent (i.e. me) even if they are born here.

I can tell you what it's not: Benefit's They're Real. Oh my god I was so angry, such a pile of crap (and £10 for a sample size). I can't ever remember a time when a brand new mascara has looked so disgusting that I've considered taking it off immediately and re-doing my whole face. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th attempts - all the same. However, their Bad Gal mascara is pretty good, I used it for quite a few years.

The best high street mascara I've found is [this](http://www.boots.com/en/LOreal-Paris-False-Lash-Flutter-Mascara_1305566/) in midnight black. Sadly it starts to clump within 5-6 weeks but before it does it's amazing. 

I was bitching about mascaras to a friend at work and she claims to have some v. expensive samples for me to try (I can't remember the brand but I'm highly allergic to their skincare). If they're any good I'll let you know. Sometimes with the number of inadequate high street ones you end up throwing in the bin it can be a bit of a false economy and at this point I'm willing to try almost anything! I've had panda shadows most of the week where I've been stropping about expensive mascara failure and using a cheap one (which, as a mascara - £2 MUA - is far superior).

You linked me a video in which you claimed he flat out denied ""the website"" in which he never, and you now refer to the 2010 manifesto he disowned. Why did you not just link that to start with?

Farage was not in charge of the party when it was written. He became leader 5 November 2010, the day David Cameron became Prime Minster and after the manifesto was written. The party has changed substantially over the past 18-24 months and he was right to dismiss it, as it was god awful. In all honestly it's refreshing to see a politician come forward and say ""we fucked up, let's go back to the drawing board.""

You have somehow come to the conclusion that him dismissing the 2010 manifesto (one he never wrote) is the same as dismissing the ones he was heavily involved with this year.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You realise in one comment you say that UKIP aren't anything to do with the BNP, then backup the idea that UAF members should be arrested by linking to an article about a far-right march? 

In which 58 UAF members were arrested. You said that UAF members wern't being arrested en masse. I think this story proves otherwise. 

&gt;the article even says there was physical violence, it wasn't just a few people calling other people fascist.

There was some violence, there was some throwing and there was some name calling. Just as in the story posted:

&gt;call our supporters fascists, hurl other abuse or any physical assault

These are the things that there were concerns over, they are all things that UAF has been guilty of in the past, so isn't it reasonable to expect a police presence?

&gt;Just wouldn't be allowed jobs or benefits though.

Where is your source for that?

&gt;Chauvinistic expression of national identity, along with xenophobia are present in Fascist ideology

They are also present to some degree in every other social system in the world. You ight as well say breathing is a part of fascist ideology.

&gt;Talk about open to interpretation. Who decides if someone uses the word fascist in an intimidating way? 

The police. That's the whole point. That's why they are being asked to attend. The UKIP  organisers aren't pulling this out of the air, they are asking that a specific piece of legislation be enforced, as it should be during any protest by any organisation. The Public order act 1986. Look it up, and you will understand how calling someone a fascist in some contexts could be breaking that law.

But it isn't irrelevant and that's one of the points. Personal and shared responsibilities should kick in long before a person has reached an extreme point. Yes, there will be exceptions but by and large someone becomes homeless as a consequence of events. They don't generally start off that way. 

For a lot of lifes bad decisions education, medical help or some other intervention could prevent a lot of bad from happening. This is where society fails, not at the end when it is forced to pick up the peices. 

&gt; Why are they any more responsibility than the state?

I'm no apologist for the actions of the IRA, but, in my view, the British government setting up and using covert outfits like the MRF to fight the war, when they already had a heavy army presence, is not justifiable.

This isn't even a debate about your policies, it's a simple set of questions about what your leader says on air and what your party puts out in print/online. You can't even give anyone a straight answer on that.  

Listen up. The video is your leader denying the content of the UKIP website. It's not a photoshop, it's not a edit, it's him. I questioned whether you actually have policies. Farage spends most of the interview rowing back on previous policies and not replacing them with anything - all the while denying the currency of your own website.

It doesn't matter if Farage wrote a manifesto or not. Or whether he was leader at the time or not. What matters is that the information is current on the website - and yet Farage denied it. Twice.

As a public organisation the communications on your website should reflect the policy that you organisation adheres to. It's your own damn website and basic common sense , which you lot like to bang on about, suggests that it should reflect what your leader says just because that's what professional and competent organisations do. 

We have your leader on video denying that it does. The same goes for your election literature where it should demonstrate some corporate cohesion with the message and policies. Farage also denies the content of that. 

So what is going on? Do you have policies? Or do you make them up as you go along? Is it that had to edit the website and make sure your documentation scans? 

Or is that you're moving so quickly to reposition that your infrastructure can't keep up?

I tried one of theirs the time before last, it was okay - can't remember which one. Also, their packaging is so awful. I really don't want neon green in my makeup bag.

They did? Idk. I unsubbed from /r/MakeupAddiction a month or so ago because they are genuinely (mainly) a real bunch of bitches on there and I got sick of the cattery. I got on quite well with my GOSH brow kit, but I could never quite find a brush that was good enough to do the tails accurately enough. Generally whatever they package with it is never good as I'm sure you know. Oh, also, the wax was too waxy, if that makes any sense. I've been multitasking brushes and got fed up with it in the end. Liner brushes for brows, brow brushes for lipstick. Just give me the perfect thing that I need pls, lol.

_mix of CAPS, italic, Exclamations!!! and 4-5 different text colours leaps out and screams amateur design._

Pretty self-explanatory really - you'll never see typography like this in professional stuff.  Although in a weird way, since it smells so ""damnit jim, i'm a washing-machine salesman, not a web designer"", there is a perverse kind of authenticity leant to the site.  But I'd still probably look to rationalise it a bit.  

How?  

Well, now I look closer I see the pink is your link colour.  That's fine but having the inline red as well ('most of our machines come with manufacturers warranty') muddles thing.  I'd say that could be simply bold.

Really though it's hard to 'solve' the text without reworking that whole area, essentially I'd be looking to use layout to replace the 'distinguishing a from b' purpose that the colours etc are currently serving.

It's what we'd call Information Architecture - and happily offer to help you determine your IA from a series of stakeholder workshops for a mere £6000.  :P

Basically, take each type of content or info you want to present users, forget about the details of it and just imagine a series of boxes labelled 'mission statement/about us', 'latest news', 'deal of the week', or whatever else.  IA is which boxes are on which page, which boxes are bigger than other boxes, which boxes are on the left, or right, at the top, or lower down.   These are wireframes.

_Following the stakeholder workshops, we will be happy to mock up wireframes for up to 4 key page types, with up to 2 iterations of feedback, for a mere £3000._

_Naturally you will want confidence that your wireframes have been validated against your primary audiences, so we can offer a full range of user testing, focus groups, eye tracking testing, etc, for a mere £6000._

_Once the wireframes are signed off we can polish them into full PSD designs, again with 2 iterations of client review built-in, for a mere £5000._

_Then it's just the £5000 project management overhead, and then VAT on all the above, and we'll be ready to start thinking about actually building your website and creating the content to fill it!  Don't worry, we have an experienced range of system architects, agile developers, QA teams and copywriters available at excellent rates.  And did we mention your social media presence yet?_

So, anyway, looking at your homepage your first thing is ""20 years experience..."", which is a sort of mission statement/about us summary, which is a classic thing to put first / up front.  But it seems like a quote from your dad, and like I said before, you've got no photos up here - I would think about having a picture of your dad, or his physical shop if he has one - might add a sense of trustworthiness, solidity, this isn't some faceless fly-by-night internet thing, you know.  Then style the quote more obviously like a quote.

Next you've got two links to different categories of stock.  OK... a 'Sale now on' link and 'Latest new stock' link both seem pretty reasonable things to have up top, but the current formatting could probably be better in making them stand out.  At first glance I didn't realise they were links at all.  Maybe make them more bullet pointy or buttony (we'd probably turn to jargon like CTA (call to action) for this sort of thing, and the basic rule with CTAs is make them really fucking obvious and buttony)

Next thing down you have the box about the delivery.  Now I know fuck all about the white goods retail market of Gloucestershire, so if this is absolutely critical USP for your dad feel free to ignore me, but it doesn't necessarily seem like this is _really_ the 3rd most important piece of info to present on the homepage, taking up quite so much above-the-fold real estate?  

It seems like it might be more relevant to present to someone later in their journey, once they've shown some indication of maybe buying, to tip the scales.  At this early stage of my interaction with your company, ""All appliances are tested for operation and performance quality"" personally seems like a better thing to be selling me on (after all, who wants a cheap delivery of a broken product), but the relative 'importance' of this claim in IA terms, is far, far less, as this is lost within a paragraph while the other thing gets caps and colours and !!!

Again, I don't really know what things _are_ most important in making a sale or promoting your business, but basically the idea is for you + your dad to think really brutally about (1) what a user at any given stage in their journey really wants to know and (2) what _you_ want them to know, ranked by importance, and present those things accordingly.  

Also small technical point, if you must have CAPS LIKE THIS it's better practice to have the html in normal case and then css _text-transform:uppercase;_ it.

Next - you have some text but tbh by this point I (the hypothetical joe bloggs visitor) has already got bored and my eyes probably skim over this completely as I scroll down looking for pictures of washing machines and shit.

In this text - 

&gt;  For more information on the types of appliance we sell (__click here__) 

Don't do this.  Google takes the words in the link as describing what the target page is about, so now google thinks your page is all about 'click here' and relevant to people searching 'click here'.  

&gt; Read more about the __types of appliance__ we sell

Now google thinks that page is about types of appliance, which is better (because that _is_ what it is about!).  Although probably still not as good as it could be, given that prospective customers search on 'washing machine', not 'types of appliance'.

The contact us stuff could be pulled out into a clearly marked 'Contact us' block...

Fuck I'm hungry.  Dinner time now.  I didn't get off the homepage, but I guess I've rambled enough already lol


Edit: ok, put all that together, and you might end up with a wireframe something like this:

Farage denied that the local manifesto contains anything about inheritance tax, which he is right about.

Only grammar schools and a brief reference to potholes and upgrading public transport are mentioned in the local manifesto. Andrew Neil was most likely reading from UKIP's ""issues"" webpage that I linked earlier which highlights their Westminster admirations, not their local manifesto.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;There was violence. It's not the same situation.

The meeting hasn't happened yet. You cannot say violence wont happen. The organisers were concerned about calling people fascist , throwing things AND violence.

&gt;Farage. What's the point in campaigning along the ""immigrants have stolen your job"" line if you're not going to give said job back to a British worker?

If you really think that if UKIP was to come to power they would strip all immigrants of their jobs you really aren't in much of a position to be arguing about what UKIP's policies or ideologies are, because you are way off. 

&gt;Fascism isn't a social system. It's a political ideology.

A social system exists between any two or more people. Fascism cannot exist outside of a social system. What I am saying is that there are very few places in the world, whatever their political ideologies may be, that do not have a sense of national pride or some concern about outsiders. 

Can you name any? 

&gt; They're not being asked to attend, they're being asked to arrest people.

As i have already said, they are being asked to arrest anyone who breaks an existing law, namely the Public Order act 1986. There is nothing authoritarian about that. 

Several violent protest groups have said they are going to protest a democratic meeting, and UKIP is taking the precaution of asking the police to be there in case they decide to get violent. 

When the UKIP organiser said she was concerned about members being called fascist, what do you imagine in your head? A  group of calm people standing in a small group expressing their dissent calmly? 

This is UAF we are talking about, try to imagine a mob of young men pushing their way towards you, many with their faces covered. Trying desperately to get passed the police and the barricades surrounding them, chanting fascist and pointing at you. Would you be scared to be in that situation? would you feel intimidated? Might you decide it was safer if you just went home?

 If you can understand that, can you understand why calling someone a fascist might be a crime?

Object:  Sentient life form (for ease of use for other species later)
Variables:  

Longevity (mmm but how do you track any one units life over time travel that isn't actually happening?  Maybe too complicated outside of event characters)

Procreation rate

Class (Soldier, Peasant, Leader)

Tech level (year / X, I'd probably start with only a few of these)

Weaponry (Class + Tech level)

HP (Class based amount + Tech level)

Faction (Determine if hostile or not, probably have set faction zones which may be maleable over time, possibly some could be destroyed or created over time) 


Then the city size would be directly based on the calculation of procreation rate - longevity over time. 

City variables:

Location seed (a number that could sort of be whatever but would be set after the original randomization so that buildings don't jump all over the damn place as you go back and forth through time, then use some kind of math to semi-randomly distribute them)

City building:

I think I might have it!  Every time you time travel it goes through a loop like this


New building Lastbuilding;

New building Firstbuilding = create building at Locationseed + Factionstart;

for i = 1 to (factionpopulation / 4 *or some shit*)

{

     for each building

     {

           Decay += 1;

           If Decay &gt; Decaytime

           {

                  Destroy building

           }

     }



New building Nextbuilding = create building at Lastbuilding + dispersal;  (dispersal could be tricky and require its own loop with some ifs and shit because it can't be random or the city will jump all over, but it can't just be all one long ass line.  probably have to screw with shit at the time and experiment)


Lastbuilding = Nextbuilding;

Saying that someone should look after themselves, and not rely on the state as a first resort is not the same as saying the state shouldn't help those in need.  It's this old thing of switching from one extreme to another.  Just because someone says that some people are relying on the state too much it doesn't mean the state shouldn't look after anyone.  This binary style of thinking is what prevents people from discussing things in a meaningful way.  

I'm not a Tory, far from it, I just hate this kind of senseless deliberate demonising of anything anyone says that doesn't happen to make the correct proclamations, and fit in with a narrow band of what everyone expects to hear.  Saying that people have a duty to look after themselves is such an obvious thing to say, but you and others here turn it into ""If government doesn't support homeless people then who should it help?"".  It's just an over simplistic way of looking at things, and it doesn't help because it's not based on anything real.  All local authorities have a legal duty to help homeless people, this hasn't changed.

Ross Barkley spent last season at Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds so idk what you're on about him being given a backup role at Everton last year.

Even if the club cleared out Ba and Eto'o we'd still have two (or three if you count Diego Costa) strikers to rotate between. So where does Bamford get his playtime? I'm not a manager, but other than league cup and FA Cup games it doesn't seem like he'd be getting consistent starts in the league. And again, he could be training every day with the first team but no league starts is shitty for development.

The whole argument in this thread for Bamford to get more play time is just preaching to the choir. Most people on this subreddit feel the youth team doesn't get enough chances in the starting eleven. A year ago it was the same conversation but it was Lukaku. 

He'll get loaned again, maybe he'll be brought into the fold for 2015-16 when Torres' contract is on its last year.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;The meeting hasn't happened yet. You cannot say violence wont happen. The organisers were concerned about calling people fascist , throwing things AND violence.

Presumably they're going on past meetings though, otherwise, why worry about it?  No-one's been arrested for violence at any previous meetings, so why expect it now?  

&gt; If you really think that if UKIP was to come to power they would strip all immigrants of their jobs you really aren't in much of a position to be arguing about what UKIP's policies or ideologies are, because you are way off. 

This is interesting.  So just what would UKIP do about all those jobs being taken by foreign workers?  If they're not planning to get them back for British workers, their campaign is seriously misleading. 

&gt;A social system exists between any two or more people. Fascism cannot exist outside of a social system. What I am saying is that there are very few places in the world, whatever their political ideologies may be, that do not have a sense of national pride or some concern about outsiders.

&gt;Can you name any? 

This is a silly question because you're making a determined effort to conflate political ideologies and populations.  No there aren't many places in the world where this isn't an issue, that's because everywhere in the world there are liberal and not so liberal people.  That is, populations are not all of the same political ideology, so you cannot say *regardless of political ideology*.  It doesn't make sense.

&gt;This is UAF we are talking about, try to imagine a mob of young men pushing their way towards you, many with their faces covered. Trying desperately to get passed the police and the barricades surrounding them, chanting fascist and pointing at you. Would you be scared to be in that situation? would you feel intimidated? Might you decide it was safer if you just went home?

Emotive hyperbole much?  These aren't big bad wolves against innocent little Red Riding-Hoods.  Everyone knows what they're in for when they attend a nationalist / right-wing rally. If these people aren't aware that UKIP is unpopular with a good portion of the electorate, a wake up call is needed.  Frankly I'm happy that people are there on both sides to argue the point.  

Violence is one thing.  You're never going to convince me that calling a UKIP supporter a fascist is anything other than a bit misguided. ",0,1400016535,null,0,false,0,chh6hne,t3_25fya8,t1_chh6hne,t1_chh5r76,null,1433782672,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We're both 25, just find a sport or activity you enjoy and it's probably some kind of club already.

The computing building, electrical engineering building (where you will undoubtedly have some lectures) and the library that caters for science students is a 10 minute walk from Lime St, 5 if you're fit. Up a steep-ass hill.

If you want to learn a language a lot of free classes or groups are available; loads of political and activist, computers, books, movies etc.
 As long as you're not a complete shut in or social outcast you will find groups of friends (and probably even if you are). If you join a club and don't like it, join something else. Don't buy any kind of membership card until you've been for a few weeks, some sports clubs especially try to get you to sign up for an AU card because some of the money goes towards their budget. It doesn't matter if you join a club late, people are willing to catch you up. 

The uni bar and that whole section of buildings are being renovated, there's something small open near-by but it's not really worth it when there are nice pubs on campus and the font is a bar that's a 5minute walk from the computer labs, some clubs meet here, others use free university lecture halls or rooms. Maybe the renovations will be complete when you get here. 

Most sports clubs drink a lot, have a weekly night out and have a big AU night once a month, everyone dresses up and gets very drunk. Not recommended if you want to keep it professional.

Yes. The mainstream parties have done a very, very poor job of providing people who have these concerns with a sensible response. The political establishment, at UK level, is living in a echo–chamber quite well insulated from the general population.

However I thought about something somewhat similar some time ago. It is absolutely possible to try to guess what a person will do. You can start the game off with some kind of tutorial filled with a fucktard of triggers. Based on what the player did in this level you can start manipulating levels and more importantly, estimating what the player would do so you'll eventually let them ""meet"" and play a bit together.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"I am not a fan of Yakin. He's the manager of the far and away best club in Switzerland. They have the best players and have the biggest budget to work with. Despite having the best players and the biggest budget, his Basel side has drawn 15 times in the shitty Super League and they are only 4 points ahead of Grasshoppers. 15 times! 15! Last season they lost 6 times and drew 9 times and only won the league by 3 points! When you're the clear favorite in the league and you have the biggest budget, you should dominate. Forgive me, but 15 draws against shitty opposition who have budgets that are a factor of 10 less than you doesn't exactly inspire me with confidence in the man. Sure, he has had some success in the CL against some quality sides. When I talk to most people about Yakin, their only knowledge of the man is of those few CL games and nothing more. 

That all being said about Yakin, it also makes me wonder how much you actually know about Tuchel. How often have you seen his Mainz sides play? What do you like about his approach to the game and what do you think he can contribute to Spurs? Don't get me wrong, I too think that Tuchel could be an interesting managerial option for Spurs. He is incredibly well regarded in Germany and has been refereed to as the ""next Klopp"" from whom he learned a great deal when working under him. He plays a nice flowing modern brand of football and does so with a club with nominal resources at best. Tuchel is an incredibly intense manager and at times lets his emotions get the best of him ala Klopp and Sherwood. He drills his teams and preps them well with Plan A, but at times has been criticized for not having a Plan B and for succumbing to it and his emotions during a match. Something that a good many of you calling for a set best XI won't like; he's a big fan of rotation. I personally like him and wouldn't mind seeing him manage us, but I don't think he'll even get a look in. I think Levy likes his managers to have a bit more flash about them or at least have some Prem experience. I can't see him making a move for a German wunderkind manager. Not this time.

Though many don't like Mancini, I wouldn't mind him. He's incredibly tactically adept. He has Prem experience. I think he would drill our boys into shape and actually put out a balanced Spurs side which is something we haven't seen all season.

this was a discussion i started with the thought in mind that it makes poor business sense to have a high earner sat on our bench, and thus i'd rather offload all 3 of our current strikers.

i did perhaps deliberately make the discussion a bit more provocative by suggesting we use Bamford as our third: it realistically probably isn't an option, but i'd do it any day (personally) over paying stupid money for a glorified bench warmer.

While I admire his willingness to take on players, I don't like his decisions on when and where to do so. He rarely if ever takes on players near the opposition's box (where his abilities on the ball should shine), but instead is more than willing to attempt to do so in the middle third and during our transition play when the wiser decision would be to let the ball do the work and pass it. I also don't like his inability to stay fit. His injuries issues seem to be of the recurring variety and that's never a good sign. I just don't know if his style is suited for the fast attacking and quick passing style that I believe Spurs want to have. I think it may be best to move him on for a significant fee and keep Paulinho who has shown flashes of what he could be for Spurs.

I also don't think Jackson Martinez is the forward that many think he is. At times he can be exceedingly frustrating and incredibly wasteful in front of goal.

Yet in Simeone's system the average players are consistently put in a situation to succeed and as a result play with more confidence and belief...in short, Simeone has taken average players and made them good.  

In contrast you have Sherwood (or Hughton or Steve Kean or whoever you want to use as an example, Sherwood is just the one most familiar to people on this sub) who has had terrific performances from Ade and Eriksen (Eriksen i think would be outstanding regardless of manager and but Ade's play deserves some note) to his credit but players like Jan, Paulinho, Dembele, Capoue, Sandro, Soldado (not all Tim's fault) all play at much lower levels than they have previously.

&gt;__Arthur's Seat__ is the main peak of the group of hills in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) which form most of [Holyrood Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyrood_Park), described by [Robert Louis Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson) as ""a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design"".  It is situated in the centre of the city of [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), about a mile to the east of [Edinburgh Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle). The hill itself rises above the city to a height of 250.5 m (822 ft), provides excellent panoramic views of the city, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for [hillwalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillwalking). Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch. At a spur of the hill, [Salisbury Crags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Crags) has historically been a [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty, due to hazards rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a free permit is required.

&gt;

&gt;In his 2006 book *Blood of the Isles* (published in the United States and Canada as *Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland*), Sykes examines British genetic ""clans"". He presents evidence from mitochondrial DNA, inherited by both sexes from their mothers, and the [Y chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome), inherited by men from their fathers, for the following points:

&gt;


&gt;* The genetic makeup of [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) and [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) is overwhelmingly what it has been since the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) period and to a very considerable extent since the [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic) period, especially in the female line, i.e. those people, who in time would become identified as British Celts (culturally speaking), but who (genetically speaking) should more properly be called [Cro-Magnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnon) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]. In continental Europe, this same Cro-Magnon genetic legacy gave rise to the [Basques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basques). But ""Basque"" and ""Celt"" are cultural designations, not genetic ones [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

&gt;


&gt;* The contribution of the [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts) of [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe) to the genetic makeup of Britain and Ireland was minimal; most of the genetic contribution to the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles) of those we think of as Celtic, came from western continental Europe, I.E. the [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic) seaboard.

&gt;


&gt;* The [Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) were not a separate people: the genetic makeup of the formerly Pictish areas of [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) shows no significant differences from the general profile of the rest of Britain. The two ""Pictland"" regions are Tayside and Grampian.

&gt;


&gt;* The [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) are supposed, by some, to have made a substantial contribution to the genetic makeup of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), but in Sykes's opinion it was under 20 percent of the total, even in [Southern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England).

&gt;


&gt;* The [Vikings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings) (Danes and Norwegians) also made a substantial contribution, which is concentrated in central, northern and eastern England - the territories of the ancient [Danelaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw). There is a very heavy Viking contribution in the [Orkney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney) and [Shetland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Islands), in the vicinity of 40 percent. Women as well as men contributed substantially in all these areas, showing that the Vikings engaged in large-scale settlement.

&gt;


&gt;* The [Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans) contribution was extremely small, on the order of 2 percent.

&gt;


&gt;* There are only sparse traces of the [Roman occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain), almost all in Southern England.

&gt;


&gt;* In spite of all these later contributions, the genetic makeup of the British Isles remains overwhelmingly what it was in the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic): a mixture of the first [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic) inhabitants with [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) settlers who came by sea from [Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_peninsula) and ultimately from the eastern [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean).

&gt;


&gt;* There is a difference between the genetic histories of men and women in Britain and Ireland. The [matrilineages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineage) show a mixture of original Mesolithic inhabitants and later Neolithic arrivals from [Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia), whereas the [patrilineages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineage) are much more strongly correlated with Iberia. This suggests (though Sykes does not emphasize this point) replacement of much of the original male population by new arrivals with a more powerful social organization.

&gt;


&gt;* There is evidence for a ""[Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_from_Genghis_Khan) effect"", whereby some male lineages in ancient times were much more successful than others in leaving large numbers of descendants; e.g. [Niall of the Nine Hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_of_the_Nine_Hostages) in 4th and 5th century Ireland and [Somerled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerled) in 12th century Scotland.

&gt;Some quotations from the book follow. (Note that Sykes uses the terms ""[Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts)"" and ""[Picts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts)"" to designate the [pre-Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Britain) inhabitants of the Isles who spoke Celtic and does not mean the people known as Celts in [central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe).)

I don't know, I've seen it go both ways, and you can't protect people from getting a tongue lashing by a jerk on the Internet. Sometimes I'm that jerk, though I try hard not to be, and sometimes I'm on the other end. It's just a part of interacting with other humans.

If it becomes a personal attack then it's a different story. Ironically, the person whose opinion you're defending had this to say when someone merely expressed their opinion on this topic:

&gt;You, the OP, and anyone who up-voted either of your comments, need to take the liverbirds down from next to your names and go and support Chelsea.

Is this acceptable to you?

&gt;But I doubt anyone would knowingly post a link to a Sun article.

Trolls? United fans who happen to be pricks?

If someone is not educated about the history of Hillsborough why can't we as a community carry that torch, while still respecting the opinions of others unless they are hateful or harmful in some way? ""I don't condone censorship of any form"" is neither of those things.

Hillsborough is very close to the hearts of Liverpool fans and even more so for someone like Teddy who has been directly impacted, but it is not the only tragedy or injustice happening in the world and it doesn't give license to some kind of trump card.

Why does it have to be London? I want to go to Glyndebourne. And the opera in Milan. Although I don't really like Milan. But they do opera best.

Uh huh. Someone in the sub said 'she must've fallen out with the wardrobe department.' Personally I hope they're playing down her character for a huge, fantastic comeback in S4, and then come the pretty dresses.

What you're doing is putting policy in that's national and giving the impression that it's local in the literature - and Farage has denied this. 

Now why you do this is obvious, most people aren't aware of the limits of the Local Government Act and the multiple agencies involved in the decision making, and you're not the only ones as all the major parties do it. 

But this is what the transcript says:

&gt;AN: In local election campaigning you say you would restore cuts to policing, double prison places, restore cuts to front line NHS, spend more on roads, how much would that cost?

&gt;NF: You are obviously reading different documents to me.

Here's the *local election manifesto*

On policing - 

&gt;We need more police on the streets, cracking down on crime and
anti-social behaviour (page 4)

&gt;... should overhaul the system to make sentences meaningful,
rehabilitate offenders, deport foreign criminals, free up the police from excessive form-filling and tackle nuisance neighbours and anti-social behaviour. (Page 8)

&gt;Keep real police officers on the beat and stop the
scrapping of front-line police jobs. 

Can't do most of this. Sentencing is judicial discretion with parliamentary oversight or act of parliament. Councils can't do this. Why is this in your local election literature? 

Also on Police numbers and budget allocation, it's the local crime commissioner, the council and the Dep of Justice / Home Office that do this in conjunction at various levels. The council doesn't really get to do this on its own. Again why is this in your literature? 

I mean I could go on about amount of inter -agency co-operation and national government intervention that would be involved in all the above policies but I'd be here for a very long time. Suffice to say - these aren't wholly issues that a council can do much about. 

Farage denied these things existed in this literature - but it's there.

On the NHS:

&gt;Oppose health tourism and cuts to front-line doctors, surgeons, dentists and nurses, but reduce the number of managers and executives. (page 10)

You can't do most of that at local level. Councils don't control immigration. Councils can't influence the new GP Consortia on their own or PCTs in that way, they can only advise or the Dep. of Health steps in.  You don't control immigration at council level, and any attempt to circumvent UK laws to do this is illegal. 

Then there's all this on page 11:

Can't do this at council level : 

&gt; Leave the EU and save £55 million every day

or this: 

&gt; Drop the EU Landfill Directive to cut refuse disposal costs

or this:

&gt; Control immigration to ease the burden on local services

or this:

&gt; Close unnecessary central government departments and quangos

Or this:

&gt; End wasteful EU and UK subsidies to ‘renewable energy scams’,
such as wind turbines and solar farms

Or this:

&gt; Require all visitors to show adequate health insurance at the point
of entry into the UK

These might be possible locally - but only in LEA schools, not Free Schools or Academias , and you'd have to get new structures for the D.of. E to be able to enact this anyway  - which means UK parliamentary laws: 

&gt;Make it easier for schools to sack bad teachers

&gt; Reduce bureaucracy in the education system

You can't do this , only with council assets:

&gt; Sell unused state-owned property and assets

The following you can't do unless the UK parliament say you can in conjuction with EU case law on the directive in question:

&gt; Oppose EU directives adding artificial and detrimental costs

Sounds very complicated to do but it would be rad as hell!

But yeah you're right, if the timeline can be altered by the player then hard coded events would be circumvented almost immediately, the first time you fuck shit up.  They would absolutely have to be generated organically through some sort of algorithm or something.

Maybe just have a set of bad guys with variables like:

date range they can appear

play time range they can appear (if you have been playing for over an hour and end up somewhere in 2010-2050 AD then trigger cyberman invasion.  This may not even be necessary but I'm not sure you want the player to get this in his first 2 minutes of play time if he goes to the wrong time)

faction hostility (if they don't hate all normal factions)

then if the event is triggered it's just like shit gotta save these people!

I'm thinking if any invading force succeeds though it should probably be game over because I don't even want to think about the mechanics behind nesting that shit (daleks attack after cybermen rule the world etc.)

Also probably no time travel allowed during an invasion, but maybe you could still Tardis around the map if you like.

Then you start to learn something.  One, if your torturer had the information they thought you had, they wouldn't be torturing you for it.  They'd be *punishing* you for it, which is entirely different.   This is powerful knowledge, knowing for a fact that they don't know what you know.  You can play dumb.  You can feed them completely erroneous information or claim you don't know anything at all.  It doesn't matter, because they have no way of verifying the truth.   The second thing you learn is that revealing information never works out in your favor.  If you tell them what you know, they may continue beating on you anyway.   They might do it for sport, but they'll probably do it because they want to know *what else* you know.  Even if they stop for now, they'll come back soon until they're positive they've tortured out all the information you know.  Worse, you'll likely be punished for what you've revealed, if not by your torturer, then by the associates of the people you ratted out.  

In that world, you lie.  Then you lie some more.  And you keep right on lying until they realize you're completely unreliable and believe you know nothing.  Your torture will be the same either way.

Now of course you could bring up events like the cyberman invasion. However if you plan on doing an ""open world"" game you have to either create an invasion or something else which just jumps towards the player while disabling him to travel away. 

Alright so you got your cyberman, dalek and whatever invasion over with. You have a couple of other story points covered and a player playing.

You need an event at every single point in time. You need different areas and you have to prevent the same things from happening over and over.

Basically you have to create a linear story, break it up in segments and force the player into them by trigger. At this point the completely generated population with ""story"" jobs, etc. becomes obsolete because you just need differently looking people in your story segment and when the player goes back there you need the same people. So you just need a seed based people generator. Everything else doesn't matter gameplay wise and is just a little (very complex and difficult to create) gimmick...  isn't it?

What I wanna say is: A puzzle/action game (somewhat similar to what already exists) could be a lot cooler. Where you let your companion decide where to go who's scripted and walk along the created path while having neat little timelord features and possibly some more complex timejumps within the same level and more freedom to explore and investigate like that. 

Like you get into a village. You can't figure out what the fuck's going on. You go into the future and ofc they don't say exactly what happened but you get some kind of hint what happened. Now you can go back and try that solution. Ofc the further you go into the future the more random and inaccurate your hint gets while people in the near future have no idea what was going on there and will tell you complete bullshit... stuff like that :)",0,1400021198,null,0,1400021442,0,chh8n48,t3_25h9ov,t1_chh8n48,t1_chh8eqy,null,1433783685,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;I don't have confidence in the entirety of the sub to appropriately respond to someone who unknowingly posted a link to The Sun.

But that's not your responsibility. You are not responsible for other peoples' actions or for what content they post on this subreddit. Moderators aren't either, unless it becomes a personal attack or is off topic/spam. Other forums exist with different values, but that's how reddit works.

&gt;No one can win, so we may as well ban them.

I agree, except for your conclusion. Banning has its own implications, in that it sets a precedent which can be used to ban other sources in the future. There are many content providers which don't deserve an audience or a voice, but on reddit the power to decide which do and which don't is bestowed upon each individual user, and should not be filtered by the moderator team.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I would say that freedom of speech does not have to mean the completely unfettered legal right to say whatever you want, whenever you want, regardless of the circumstances or consequences.

Well that's the basis of the concept though. That's what it means.

&gt;You're essentially defining away pretty much all reasonable positions.

In your judgement perhaps, but the result of that is that you're declaring freedom of speech to be an unreasonable position, and that's something that most of the population of the UK would support you on.

&gt;Most people support a version of free speech

There are no versions of the free speech.

You can either say anything, or you can say the things you're allowed to say. Does China or Saudia Arabia have free speech? No. Why not? Because they have things they are allowed to say, and things they are not allowed to say. Does the UK have freedom of speech? No. Why not? Because we have things we are allowed to say and things we are not allowed to say. The only difference between us and China is that the Chinese have a slightly larger set of things that they are not allowed to say than us. Our difference is purely by degree, not by quality.

What those things are is not decided by us, we do not have the freedom to decide what to express. Instead we are left with a group of things which can be said and a group of things which can't be said by the powers that be. This is not freedom. This is being permitted to say what they have deemed you be allowed to say.

&gt;Most people support a version of free speech that comes very close to what you're talking about, with the ability to express yourself protected by law.

That's plainly nonsense though. Most people support hate speech legislation, slander, libel, incitement legislation. A single one of those negates freedom of speech.

&gt;To say that they don't want or like freedom of speech is disingenuous.

Not in the slightest, it's totally accurate. Most people are raised to *believe* that freedom of speech is a good thing, and that we have it. When faced with the prospect that in fact they might not actually like it, your average person, as you're doing here, tries to redefine freedom of speech into the thing they *do* like, because not liking freedom of speech seems a bit evil.

What I'm saying is: Fine, if you don't want freedom of expression then you don't support free speech. I disagree with you, but I can accept that you don't.

&gt; They don't want or like complete freedom of speech, but they do want and like almost complete freedom of speech.

So they want a larger toolbox of things that the government allows them to say, right. That's not freedom of speech. They favour few restrictions on their speech, certainly, but they don't support freedom of speech because if they did they'd oppose all restrictions on what they can say in principle.

The concept of freedom of speech necessitates that no other man or woman can decide what you do or do not get to say. You are free to express whatever you desire to. We do not have that, most people do not want it, and hence most people oppose the concept of freedom of speech, inspite of any lip service paid to it.",0,1400022597,null,0,false,0,chh98wt,t3_25fya8,t1_chh98wt,t1_chh73i6,null,1433783971,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; News reaches us that the campaign of violence and intimidation against UKIP has been stepped up a notch. UKIP's London MEP Gerard Batten and his wife were woken at 3:30am this morning by a loud noise in their house. On getting up and investigating they could see nothing and assuming their cat had knocked something over they went back to bed. 45 minutes later, they were woken again by a loud bang followed by the sounds of breaking glass. There was no mistaking the cause this time, as on coming downstairs to investigate they discovered a house brick in the middle of their living room and their living room window smashed. Police are investigating and reviewing local CCTV footage. 

Obviously a politically motivated attack.

Anecdotally UKIP's prospective voters are wilfully deaf and blind to criticism of their chosen champion. They don't want to listen to what opponents have to say, or debate points of policy, or think too hard about what the consequences of their vote may be. They just want out of the EU by any means because they're scared and angry and see nobody else to whom they may turn with this issue.

Negative media coverage of UKIP also gives the party and its supporters something to crow about, too, as it's seen as nothing but the most desperate smear campaign and ad-hominem attacks that the ""Westminster political elite"" can chuck out. It comes across as a weakness, reinforcing the perceived strength of UKIP in the face of adversity and causing a swell of bulldog spirit, of plucky Britain vs the Eurocrats.

true,UNSKIALz,cnty-ni,Northern Ireland,"My opinion is an odd one, and it might sound crazy, but here it is. I believe a Federal Europe is an inevitability. It's the only way Europe can continue to compete on an increasingly competitive world stage. What we've seen, in my eyes, has been gradually declining European powers since the 20th Century. There will be periods of spikes in power, mainly economically, but at some point Europe will resemble a group of 'City States' compared to the rising powers of the future. Whether this will happen in 100, 200, or 1000 years I don't know, but that's the future we face and I feel that we will be too weak individually to fight for our interests globally. To ensure our collective interests aren't infringed upon, we need to pool our resources.

Now we look at the European Union. An admirable project initially, but it quickly grew into a beaurocratic mess. Not without it's benefits mind you, but a mess nonetheless. It's core leaders right now are undeniably federalists, but the people won't have it and that's the problem. We have Van Rumpoy, Borroso and co. trying to tie everyone down together, but then we have the peoples of Europe themselves not willing to co-operate. In this sense we are having nations being tied down against their own interests and nothing good can come of that. 

There are three reasons I am voting U.K.I.P:

1) I want to shake up the leaders of the E.U. into making the organisation a good thing for the people. Right now, there is a sizeable euroskeptic opinion throughout Europe and that's the fault of Europe's leaders. We need new people in the European Parliament to shake things up for the better.

2) Similar to the first point, only this is an alternative scenario where the pressure my and others' votes for pro-national groups will cause the E.U. to crumble in some way or another. It will come down so a more positive organisation can take it's place. People will welcome it, and so a very slow process to federalisation / integration won't be denounced as much if, for every step of the way, the people benefit.

3) I don't even know if the U.K. should be in a theoretical 'European Federation'. There's a whole commonwealth out there, in particular Canada and Australia, of whom we feel culturally closer to. But then say I do want the U.K. as part of the 'European Dream' as Farage puts it. What the U.K. needs to do now is leave. I believe if it re-engages with the global community, we're going to see a stronger United Kingdom. The U.K. leaving will prompt the E.U. to change. Alot. This will hopefully be to prevent others from leaving, and as such things will get better and Europe will also be stronger. When there comes a point that both the U.K. and Europe are in stronger positions than they were before, then perhaps they can join back together. Again, this might be in 100, 200 or 1000 years. And also again, I'm still not sure of my stance of the U.K. taking part in such a thing.

He put in a request to leave because he wanted to be a success. I didn't begrudge him that at all. Same goes for Lallana. He deserves to be a better club. You want to talk about loyalty, he stayed with them when they were down in League 1 despite being miles ahead of any player in that league. And then throughout the Championship, despite again having the quality to play for plenty of premier league clubs.

There's no such thing as loyalty in football really. If a player doesn't put in a request, they'll just run their contract down, which is worse for everyone.

Let these guys play.  Kalas has looked awesome.  

The PL is a different beast than the championship or otherwise.  Being on Chelsea (or another one of the big clubs) is a different beast then playing for someone like Crystal Palace.  

In my opinion, we are potentially losing out huge by not seeing what these guys can do.  Look at Liverpool for instance:  Sterling, Flannigan, even Henderson-  These types of players are never going to come out of nowhere at Chelsea, because they aren't allowed to play ever. 

I mean liverpool has the opposite problem in that they can never seem to buy someone useful, but there's a happy medium, and Chelsea is missing that happy medium.

true,UNSKIALz,cnty-ni,Northern Ireland,"Like I said, I used to support this view but sadly I don't anymore. Albeit, this has mainly been due to the economic crash crippling the Republic as a whole compared to the United Kingdom, but maybe my view will change when things get better for the R.O.I. 

There are of course going to be problems with the border areas receiving little investment due to the whole partition thing, but there's a whole pros and cons argument to both sides and you brought up one of the cons. For example, a large reason I like being in the U.K. is that I feel the nation has more clout on the world stage. We look at the Republic and, well internationally, it's treated as 'Just another one of those bail-out European countries'. Not culturally of course, but when it comes to serious diplomatic negotiations. Rather, the U.K. is on the U.N. security council. That's a pretty important position held by a precious few.

Sadly I'll have to disagree with England treating us as a backwater. I have the unique perspective of having visited England a few times, and visiting the Republic regularly. Believe me when I say I'd rather be treated as a 'backwater' by England than be treated at all by the Republic's government. Alot of areas down south are just run down. You look at what *should* be popular holiday resorts like Bundoran in Donegal, and what you have instead are rows and rows of unfinished houses and street lights which don't work. Albeit things are better in the East, but the argument still stands that there's alot of work to be done for the West of the country.

I think alot of what fuels nationalism is the idea that the U.K. is a big oppressor against the Irish people. Hell, it used to be. The famine was inexcusable and, among other terrible acts, was easily solvable but was instead ignored and as a result **destroyed** relations between mainland Britain and Ireland. But look at today. We're both island nations. We both have to fend for ourselves. There are countless family links within the isles. Diplomatically the U.K. and Ireland are great friends now and there's no reason to pull the 'Opression' card. I feel that until there are massive calls for a referendum, we should keep with how things are lest we want a Unionist separatist movement within a United Ireland starting a second round of the troubles :(",0,1400027070,null,0,false,0,chhb6tl,t3_25gx6c,t1_chhb6tl,t1_chh7l3r,null,1433784898,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Utter bullshit. Ethnic minorities are more likely to identify as British than White Britons [Link](http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2014/05/06/uk-ethnic-minorities-more-likely-to-identify-as-british-than-white-people). The reason why black people in America mostly live in their own neighbourhoods is due historical and economic reasons; not cultural ones. During the jim crow era, blacks were purposely segregated into their own communities and areas, which only strengthened the divide between whites and black, these areas tended to be incredibly poor and run down. When the civil rights act was enacted, blacks didn't suddenly become affluent and well off; they were still economically restricted to the poor areas which they were assigned to. saying that black people have their own separate culture to the rest of America, is just so laughably ignorant; I really can't take you seriously. Saying that non-whites can't assimilate into a white society is factually and demonstrably false, I'm a 3rd generation black Briton and I fully Identify with British culture and customs and in no way see my self as an outsider; pretty much all the people I know from an ethnic minority background are the same.

Most people are so detached from reality about what actually happens away from their quite lives that they really have no clue / idea what actually happens in the real world. Today as a society we have become very good at hiding things like this.

Part of the problem is that only a certain amount of the population actually can think for themselves. Lots of people like to think they can but they actually just follow the mainstream opinions. Mostly of which are published in newspapers / media that they read / watch etc...

So most people since they have read about it treat the information provided to them as fact. This then becomes the norm and everyone thinks in a positive manner that banning guns will work.

For the government and the people this then becomes to solution because its the easy solution (to take away guns). Of course we don't really want to be actually dealing with the difficult problem like why 25% of people under the age of 25 are unemployed and are not in education (most of which are actually unemployable and probably always will be). This is a source of the majority of growing crime in the UK. After all these people need to eat / live and have something to do and will find a way to get by in their poverty stricken life by any means necessary.

Often the symptoms are simple to see. Often the solution are much more complex and difficult to fix. But people want and expect simple solutions. To these problems.

Soldado, that's no surprise, given that Costa chose Spain and Torres always plays better on the national team.

There are a few things you could try, first off I'd suggest getting a good router, something like http://www.fritzbox.eu/en/products/FRITZBox_7490/index.php as the FritzBoxes have good diagnostic tools (see [my current read-out](https://imgur.com/e37gQNQ)). That will give you some idea of how bad the line quality is, but you can also adjust the performance/safety margins a bit. Mine is set to max performance which increases the speed as well as the risk that it'll disconnect and have to spend 30 seconds reconnecting.

Secondly, I want to plug the ISP I use. They're called Andrews and Arnold and let you configure a lot of the same things the FritzBox does at their end. They also have great monitoring and technical support. They do a money-back guarantee if they can't fix a fault with your line http://www.aa.net.uk/broadband-trial.html - assuming it's not a limit of the tech, that is. If it is just a factor of where you are, they can do some magic like installing a second line and binding them together, which would double your performance at about 24 quid/month. I doubt that's worth it to you, the feature is marketed at people who are getting 60m and want yet more.

Finally, there are a few simple things you could try:

 * I know the engineers ruled out the home wiring, but meh, double check? If you have an NTE5 master socket, try removing the faceplate and plugging your router into the internal test socket. That will disconnect all the wiring you're responsible for from your phone system. If you see a speed increase there, chances are it's the fault of your wiring or something connected to your system.
 * I doubt you see much wifi interference, but still, every little helps. Try using a 5Ghz signal only for your wifi, there'll be instructions for your particular modem online if it can manage that.
 * In the same vein, any P2P programmes (skype, torrents, spotify) can be a real detriment at that line speed, try to only have them open when needed
 * Ask your neighbours what they get. If they are getting significantly higher rates than you there may be an issue between your house and the cabinet, which is certainly for the ISP to fix",0,1400030743,null,0,false,0,chhcv8b,t3_25gu44,t1_chhcv8b,t3_25gu44,null,1433785677,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

No, the Moment interacted with the Doctor but in the form of Bad Wolf.

&gt;As the War Doctor starts to regenerate (presumably into Nine, though it isn't shown explicitly)

There's no ""presumably"" about it; we see him begin to change into Ninth.

&gt;One of the first things the Ninth Doctor does upon entering the Tylers' apartment is look in a mirror and examine himself, making the comment ""The Ears could use a little work"", as if that is the first time he's seen that face in the mirror.

It probably was.

true,jjones217,num23,,"AVB had a hugely successful year at Porto. Literally 1 year and 20 days. 

Frank de Boer has been in charge at Ajax for FOUR years, winning four titles in that time frame. He also managed their youth squad for 3+ years  before that (and 2 years in between as Netherlands manager). 

With de Boer it's fair to say that, by and large, he was actually responsible for most of the players on his squad - either by youth development or by bringing them in himself.

AVB could never say the same. He was a somewhat mediocre manager at Academica, and took over a squad at Porto that had won the title thrice in the four years prior and had fired their manager for finishing third. He inherited a very good squad.

TL;DR - your comparison is completely unfair and de Boer has way more bona fides than did Andre Villas-Boas",0,1400031235,null,0,false,0,chhd3j1,t3_25gjpr,t1_chhd3j1,t3_25gjpr,null,1433785851,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Meet up with characters old and new, take companions with you (and leave them behind), and choose your own adventure through time and space.

Going on adventures entails lots of running (so, platforming), talking your way out of sticky situations (I like the time-sensitive dialogue of Walking Dead compared to ME here), Pointing your sonic screwdriver at things, stealth, and general non-violence.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Using only last season and u21 and reserves I would say they have a decent chance. Much of it is outside of their control though. Focusing on that, if we look at the club you can see why their chance isn't proportional to their abillity. Had Flanagan gotten loan and Robinson stayed the future would have looked different for both of them. Had Ibe and Sterling exchanged birthdays we would have been watching Ibe starting. 

The above is just assumption, that the same injuries and lack of quality would have existed. The other part is their abillity, which in Robinsons case was superior to Flanagan. 

Why has there been such inconsistencies then from youth football to first team if we ignore external forces (club, injuries)? Using Sterling as example once more, the player he was first half and second half of the season are completely different and it had nothing to do with injuries. He said in an interview that he started doubting himself and trusted others with the ball more than himself. Convincing him that he has the abillity and is at times better option than SAS must have taken some doing, and we know what happened after. 

I can point to Downing or Aly, but you get the idea, lack of confidence makes players far worse than they actually are. So what does this have to do with Robinson and Wisdoms future? There are two typs of players, the ones with huge confidence and the ones who have to have their confidence built. Sterling and Flanagan reached  their respective bottom, there was not much else to lose, so without external pressure they started to play to their potential. Unless Robinson and Wisdom have gained confidence they did not have, I'm afraid BR will have a lot of work to do to rotate youth players while building their confidence.

Let's not forget there are players who are confident in their national side and not their clubs and vice versa. Coming from championships to Liverpool is less of a shock than reserves to first team, but they will have to be integrated again and hopefully at least one of them will show the quality to be involved with the first team.

Robinson should be around due to our lack of options on left, but if Derby are willing we should send Wisdom out on loan, he will unfortunely not be getting many chances at CB and he should improve on his contribition going forward. In a season he might become a solid defensive fullback that offers something in attack which we need. Don't think we will sell any u21, either loan or run out of contract. What's the point of selling if they have potential to improve and it's for free.

true,tackslock,null,null,"Goalkeepers - Ikeme is a decent goalkeeper, no problems with him.  Aaron McCarey started a few games for us an should provide adequate cover.

Defense - We have had big problems with our defense for years now.  I know that we did well in League One but Championship players are often of a caliber that could play in the premiership too and they could rip us apart.  Danny Batth is become a great prospect but he needs to up his game considerably if we want straight promotions and starting next to an experienced Stearman (who has tidied up his game a lot and if he signs a new contract) will be good.  I still believe we need some cover at the back in case of injuries/suspensions.  Will Scott Golbourne be able to get forward as much against some better wingers?  Sam Ricketts will be good enough and we have good cover for those positions with Matt Doherty and Kevin Foley.

Midfield - With McDonald pulling the strings, I can see him having a tougher time in the Championship but I think he has the quality to impose himself like he has been.  I do think that our younger players like Jack Price and Lee Evans will be a bit out of their depth against some of the better clubs, errors they made against lower opposition will be punished harsher than before.  Our wingers will do fine and Michael Jacobs I can see having another good season.

Strikers - I don't believe Leon Clarke will be able to cut it, he was playing well for Coventry but did nothing much for us.  Dicko will most likely be our main striker but he wasn't overly effective when he was on loan with us in the Championship before.  He seems to have integrated into the squad more and Jackett seems to be using him more effectively so we'll have to see there.

I said this in a thread previously, we do have a lot of players out on loan that could go right back into the squad as pretty much new signings.  Tongo Doumbia, Razak Boukari, Björn Sigurðarson, Kevin Doyle, Stephen Ward and Georg Margreitter all ready to come back and are good enough for the championship (leaving out Roger Johnson for obvious reasons).  Even Jamie O'Hara could feature as he seems to have paid his debt for being a bellend.  Those players didn't work so well with the previous 2 managers and it's down to Kenny whether or not he wants to work them back into our squad or just cut them loose.",0,1400035724,null,0,false,0,chhf71i,t3_25gogx,t1_chhf71i,t3_25gogx,null,1433786839,2,false,WWFC,t5_2sa1w,2

Does Schurrle start for Germany? rarely. Did many clubs want him aside from us? Not really. Do we need him? Absolutely. How about Salah? He plays for Egypt. He came from bloody Basel. And he is damn quality. Do we need him? Yup. 

Now lets apply this to Luiz. Does Luiz start for Brazil? Yes. Do other clubs want him? Yes.  Do we need him? Well, when he is on form he is a decent enough player. But we have more reliable defenders. Now that we have Matic, we have a better DM and can afford a new playmaker who plays in that role naturally.

No, Brazil is not known for their defensive fortitude. They are known for flair and attacking players.  Who also have quick tempers, ego, and poor discipline.  Case an point Marcelo.

Surely you are joking. 

Boateng, Hummels, Lahm, Metersacker, Pique, Ramos, Alba, Arbeloa, De Sciglio, Chiellini, Barzagli, Pepe, Coentrao, Kompany just to start are far better defenders than anything you suggested.

I think Eto'o is the closest we've had to a proper striker this season, although he has had his moments. I think his pace fits our style pretty well, and maybe that's what our current countering play-style really needs, instead of trying to fill a massive Drogba-esque hole. I really liked Eto'o's cunning with nicking goals against snoozing goalkeepers too! 

Torres has been putting in some decent performances this season, but as a striker, he isn't performing the role well anymore. 
However, I feel the way that Torres' play-style has changed the past few years would favour a wider role, perhaps like a Totti-style position, in my opinion one of Torres' better skills is his ability to hold up play outside the box.

Ba, recently, has been working relatively well as a mid game substitution, and (along with Schürrle!) offers the closest we've had to a plan B this season. He doesn't work nearly as well when he starts though (Norwich game for instance).

If I had to pick one to stay I'd probably go for Ba, he would be good to keep around as a decent sub striker, as he seems to be pretty good at impacting the game off the bench, but hopefully we won't have to fall back onto a Plan B next season because we'll be smashing every other team to bits!",0,1400038191,null,0,1400038411,0,chhg9eg,t3_25eqfr,t1_chhg9eg,t3_25eqfr,null,1433787341,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

If his contract were over, it's over and they can do as they please- that's what we signed up for and that's what they signed up for.  There is no exception in his contract that says when they leave on a free they won't go to a rival.

Their defensive record would disagree with you. Having David Luiz, Dante, Thiago Silva, Filipe Luis, Miranda, Marcelo, etc.. available to you is among the top in defensive quality in the world.

Have you ever browsed through the new submissions? It doesn't matter if the post doesn't achieve buoyancy, it still appears in the new submissions. Also, we shouldn't have to downvote a shit source in the first place- it shouldn't even be there. A couple ""worthwhile"" presenters, which I doubt either of us can name, on a website doesn't make it credible. 

Finally, I argue this; It's clutter. There are already weekly threads stickied to serve as an area for discussing rumours. You have already conceded that these websites are mostly unbased stories acting as clickbait. That means they are *rumours*. That means they don't belong as a separate post, but in the thread which is dedicated to it. For that reason alone, they should be banned. 

If you want to sift through the horseshit that these websites spew, you're more than welcome to go to their sites and read the articles yourselves.

Amplifying what PixelSplitter asked - through the Bush ""enhanced interrogation"" era, a number of experienced interrogators went on record that torture was **absolutely unreliable.** The logic is essentially this: pick a random person, shove a fork in their knee, and tell them ""If you say [x], I will stop hurting you."" 

Which see: The Inquisition, and modern US incarceration of demonstrably innocent persons based on their confessions. 

Now the counter argument is that torture isn't about conviction, but about eliciting information. The problem here is your ticking bomb scenario - so you've got Achmed the Terrorist and you're pouring hot oil over his genitals and telling him to give you the location of the bomb that is going to go off in 24 hours. 

Fine - he gives you an address in Los Angeles. 

Now what? You stop torturing him and go look. No bomb there. Now - is it that Achmed is the terrorist and he lied, or did we accidentally pick up Achmed the limo driver? 

Experienced interrogators have stated over and over that successful interrogation isn't about fear, it's about building rapport. It's about getting the suspect to give you bits of information without realizing it, while you are building up a relationship of trust so that hopefully he will give you what you need. 

IIRC, the guy that wrote the book on interrogation stated that many times he was called in after some ""enhanced interrogation"" failed to produce results, and by just sitting and talking to the guy, he got the info.

Hah. So instead of using logic to actually create a respectable argument you choose to belittle instead (and off of false accusations no less.)? It not only shows your insecure character, but your lack of an understand on the fundamentals of both football and ability to create discussion. The fact that the only way you could back-up your attack on Marcelo is by saying he is ""shit"" is a great summation of your ability to judge players.

Please do me a favor and don't continue this embarrassing facade you call an argument. Until you want to actually want to make any real points instead of just saying ""I'm not even going to bother to continue telling you how wrong you are for the rest."" you are just wasting my time.

It's implied here and I think used more in other multi doctor specials that the Doctor only remembers the most recent incarnation.

It's very possible that the Doctor would remember Bad Wolf and Rose Tyler from the moment, leading to his obsession with her.

The memory sync also means that one of his last memories before regenerating would also have been standing before the moment, ready to press the big red button.

However, remember just because torture can often be unreliable doesn't make it moot for discussion, lots of intelligence sources are unreliable. That is the nature of intelligence gathering. Furthermore, the argument that ""torture is ineffective"" is based on what occurs *most of the time, but that won't dissuade certain politicians and officials from trying to add it to their arsenal for ""only when it is absolutely necessary, and we KNOW he knows and we have a source that can confirm what he says"" etc. 

We need a better argument against torture, because even if it doesn't work most of the time, it could work. It is just like the Ticking Bomb Scenarios, although they are unlikely and unrealistic and wouldn't occur most of the time, they could happen, and so we need a contingency argument to prevent torture being institutionalised because of them.  

That is why discussing how it could be legalised is essential because we find the flaws in the idea now, assisting us in arguing against it when the Cheneys of the world bring it up.

And most of the other matches as well. No one is doubting his talent. Paulinho IMO never looked that good. Opinions can differ obviously, but he was a bit of a letdown for me all season given the hype. There's no doubt that Pauli is better given freedom going forward, but both AVB and TS were playing a Pauli-Dembele midfield, which was a shambles. 

Vertonghen OBVIOUSLY cared where he was played. He was clearly upset playing LB given his comments to the media, and when TS came in playing Vert on the left basically stopped. Vert always has the sourpuss face when playing LB. 

Finally, the Ade point, what is fair. He didn't do much the last few matches, scoring wise. But he was always a threat. I thought it was weird that Soldado was benched right after he finally scored. But given the trajectory of their two seasons, Ade was always far more of a danger. I actually see Kane and Ade as more of the same style of player - hold the ball up or knock it down for a partner - which makes me excited for Kane-Soldado possibilities in the future. 

Ultimately I'm not trying to argue for a Sherwood future. His comments to the media ultimately turned me off to him.

Moffat has made things *worse* rather than better.

River was interesting. Then she was the best TARDIS pilot in the universe, could travel in time without it anyway, knew everything that was going to happen and would just offer snide comments and shout ""spoilers"" a lot. Plus, she *had* to be his wife, because, she's that damned special.

Amy didn't just create herself. She actually remembered an entire universe back into existence, though I'm still convinced she did nothing special and the Doctor lied despite not actually having any reason to lie.

Incidentally, am I the only one who thinks ""the Doctor lies"" has become a gimmick so cheap that the ""sonic screwdriver means magic wand"" gag is looking good in comparison?

Clara was *literally* born to ""save the Doctor"" which is nice and all, but, well, um, really? We need *another* magic companion?

I will never understand people who moan that RTD didn't explain every last detail and that his plots were over-blown, and then praise Moffat for being unable to end a season without blowing up the universe.

&gt; Don't get me wrong there are great episodes in matt smith's dr who, but it just doesn't feel right

The stand-alone episodes weren't all bad. Some of the ""plot"" episodes were great set-up for the inevitable ""it's a paradox, the universe exploded but got reset"" finale.

He then goes back and kicks it again before casually walking off, the Liverpool Echo reported.

Will Carey from the backpackers' hostel said the cat, called Catters, has been a favourite with visitors since 2008.

He said: “He’s our resident cat. Thankfully he’s fine after the incident - just a bit traumatised.”

General manager Paul Mercer said: “Before this he would have no problems coming up to people and sitting on their lap, he’s a very friendly cat. But now he's very wary.""

Staff at the hostel are appealing for anyone who recognises the man to come forward.

Mr Mercer said the man was not staying at the hostel but instead walked in from the street late last Saturday evening.
He said: “I think he had come in and asked to use the toilet. Staff at the time saw it happen, they were gutted and very angry.""
The hostel is now appealing for anyone who recognises the man to come forward.

Paul added: “It’s disgraceful that someone can do this to an animal. Catters has been here a long time. We feed him and the guests feed him, he’s part of the furniture.

“The residents love him, they like to see him walking about. He even has his own little house out the back that we’ve built for him.”",0,1400052982,null,0,false,0,chhky6a,t3_25is6s,t1_chhky6a,t3_25is6s,null,1433789618,4,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,4

true,NuttyFanboy,silence,Silence,"Just to nitpick a bit: While the Borg and the Cybermen undoubtedly share similar traits, and the former were likely inspired by the latter, there are differences beyond the minimal change in the tagline.

- while the assimilation/upgrading and plain assimilation process of the Cybermen and Borg are similar, I always felt the motives behind it were different. The Cybermen do it to further their numbers and simply upgrade for upgradings sake; The Borg assimilate because they believe it will bring them closer to perfection. *Your technological and biological capabilities will be added to our own* - that is what the Borg boil down to, in my eyes.  
The Cybermen seek to make everyone conform to their standards, create a uniform universe.  
The Borg seek perfection. That the universe will look very uniform and conforming to their standards is just a coincidence.  
 
* The Borg are a Hive mind, with [as established later on] a queen. While the Cybermen do have a sort of leader that they appoint amongst themselves (by, unsurprisingly, upgrading a Cyberman), they're not a true collective mind like the Borg. Many individual minds, stripped of their emotion to prevent them of the horror they're experiencing.  
Individuals assimilated by the Borg are not stripped of their individuality - the personalities are just trapped and suppressed. Your body becomes a prison while you bang on the insides in a futile attempt to make yourself heard.

Ultimately, both the Borg and Cybermen represent a similar idea and fear: That the accelerating technological evolution we're going through these days will strip us of our humanity altogether, making us mindless, conformist drones, individual thought scoffed upon. That they end up with similar traits is rather unsurprising in this light.


Also, the Borg first appeared in *Q, Who*, which aired in May 1989 - with the Seventh Doctors run ending late that same year.  In that respect, they were probably inspired by them (or a similar idea in Perry Rhodan I think), but they didn't appear in the gap of No-Who ;)

2- I read this sub by new posts almost exclusively. It takes me about 10 extra seconds a day to sort through all the drivel (some of which is wildly popular). Every Redditor acts like their time is so goddam valuable, even while having arguments on reddit. 

3- I am actually in favour of all rumours going to one place. As far as I know, the mods do not agree and the rumour threads we have are done independently. Likewise, twitter rumours, which I consider to be even worse than the other sources discussed, will be posted all the time. They will be told to post in the rumour thread.  As the transfer window heats up, you will see how well that works.

4- I'm all for majority consensus, but a submission with 81 upvotes, discussing something in the abstract, is hardly a consensus on a sub this size.

&gt;UKIP didn't need to ask the police to arrest anyone who rained blows down on people visiting a political rally...That's already illegal and they'd do that anyway.

They were organising a public meeting an they asked the police to attend and arrest anyone who breaks the public order act 1986. 

&gt;Beyond the headline they requested the police arrest people for verbal abuse, for uttering words they didn't want to hear. 

I will try one more time: IF IT BREAKS THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986!!!

If they call people fascist in a way that in intimidating, or intended to cause fear, alarm or distress. Then they are breaking this law and should be arrested. 

It says it right there in the article:

&gt;“We are asking police to act under the Public Order Act. If we are having pensioners turning up and being called racist Nazi sluts, little old ladies who themselves or their parents probably fought in the war – that’s a hate crime, it’s inciting the public to violence.”

Do you think these people should not be arrested just because they are protesting UKIP?

Gatwick's expansion directly impacts fewer people, so while I think Heathrow should be bigger, if Gatwick wants to build a new runway too, it should be allowed. They both serve different markets at the moment that should be allowed to grow. 

There's a tendency at Heathrow for flights beyond Europe to largely places that used to be part of the empire. British Airways flies to five Indian cities, with more than one flight per day, then add on Jet Airways, Air India and Virgin Atlantic who all fly there daily, and these add another two cities. Yet Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu are the only Chinese cities with direct British Airways links, and Chengdu is a fairly recent addition (plus a flight to Guangzhou on another airline). The fact there as these links to ex-colonies aren't bad, and obviously they're selling tickets because otherwise they wouldn't fly planes. There's a lot of cultural links. But economically, we don't actually trade as much as we probably could with India. So if Heathrow had more space it could open to further and newer destinations, improving business links elsewhere but also provide leisure options.

I do live in London, but in the north, so while I do get aircraft noise it isn't a huge deal, while also having the benefit of knowing Heathrow is less than £2 away and will only take about an hour. I actually quite like being up really early on a Saturday morning and you see the planes arriving from North America in holding patterns over Barnet.



Gatwick does actually have two runways at present. Just they're too close together to use both, so one is used as a taxiway.

If I had to choose just one though, I'd say Heathrow. There's enough slack in Luton and Stansted (and increasingly Southend) to take on point-to-point flights. Luton isn't even half full, and Stansted only just over half. Whereas for long-haul and connecting traffic, it seems Heathrow is best suited.",0,1400056287,null,0,1400059731,0,chhlk1v,t3_25isct,t1_chhlk1v,t3_25isct,null,1433789905,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10

What's funnier is that it isn't even a case of very small probability. The probability just doesn't exist (well, technically it does but it's so small it's not even relevant).

This has been the case for the past few decades and basically what it means is that the economy becomes a zero-sum game - because they are taking more of the pie than the pie is growing, so therefore the old neo-liberal arguments that the rising tide of economic growth lifts all ships no longer holds water.

It's a major issue but it is the case even in more egalitarian countries - some have put it down to unprecedented technological progress like Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in the Second Machine Age. Whilst others believe it is an inherent problem of capitalism that was left unresolved due to the freak events of WWII as discussed by Pitterky in Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

So it is a global problem that goes far beyond just the Tories and to be honest perhaps the most amusing thing is that Labour seem to imply that their economic doctrine (which is almost indistinguishable to the Tories fundamentally) would solve the problem.

The data can be found here [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/may-2014/table-a01.xls]

The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on JSA, so sanctions will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey. There are unemployed who are not entitled to JSA (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, or those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are arguably people on JSA who are not unemployed (i.e. fraudsters). The two are not the same.

The figures are calculated by the Office of National Statistics. They are independent. The government does not interfere with the calculation of the figures, or set the way in which they are calculated. Though knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly. It may create targets which are not in the best interest of the public. The way the numbers are calculated is based on internationally agreed conventions.

Zero-hour contracts are not measured. However there is some measure of “underemployment” in that those who are in part time work but wish to be in full time work are recorded. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent is also measured.

The rate of unemployment is a an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce, not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed. They do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However, those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately, so you may recast the figures should you wish.

The figures are seasonally adjusted, so there is no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate. The numbers should be understood as approximate, and best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

OK, they could have used different description but it is very small in meaning (when compared with their usual stuff).

&gt;Implying they were attempting to cover up the ""intimidation"" whereas their actions are more consistent with trying to defuse the situation, plus they made it clear that it was up to him what he chose to do.

You are going too far. The police did tell him not to publish about the visit. I read original post by the guy.

&gt;Translation: ""Everyone agreed UKIP trying to force this guy to keep quiet was wrong""

The ""heavy handed"" is again possibly too strong but isn't strong enough. After all it was indeed heave handed as who the hell sends police to a person's home, because they reposted a political poster? And yes, some civil rights campaigners condemned it, as well as politicians. I'm not sure if it was all spectrum of politicians though.

I have to go to work in twenty minutes so rather than try to re-type it, I'll just say this.

Nigel Farage went to a public school, took a job as a city trader (which he still has, albeit with a different company) openly insulted Prince Charles during a speech at the European Parliament in which the Prince called for Europe to lead the world on renewable fuels and other pro-climate initiatives, spent much of his time in the European Parliament wasting people's time and accusing the French of corruption, and then refusing the apologise on the occasions that the Frenchmen in particular were found innocent, was caught out in the expenses scandal in 2009, had Conservative philosophies since his once again public school education, and was part of the Conservative party until the early nineties. This man is a posh boy fuck just like Cameron who were it not for Europe would still be in the Conservative party. Read the man's wikipedia page and don't act like he's a fucking saint.

The fact that you want to insult me rather then try to actually defend Farage says a lot more about you than it does about me. It also says a lot about Farage. If you want me to stop being a dick then cut this high horse bullshit out and show me some reason to actually like this man, and don't bother including a picture of him grinning at me, I might throw up.

I didn't accuse you of hate, I accused Farage of hate. Despite your wank-fantasy, you are not Farage. At least I hope you're not because if you are then boy oh boy did you come to the wrong neighborhood motherfucker.

I re-iterate what I have said all along. This man is terrible at making decisions having recently assigned an MEP that was publicly known to be a bigot, he is a terrible person having personally profited from a political position he was meant to have used to try to help people, which he instead used to simply try to waste people's time in a beaurecracy (pissing in an ocean of piss right there.) And overall has proven himself generally incapable of keeping up with statistics (Such as quoting that up to 24 million Romanians and Bulgarians could come to England when that was the population of both countries put together) or facts (such as his absolute refusal to acknowledge that his party is full of racists despite the fact that they're freely revealing such opinions on freely accessable publicly viewable online communities.)

This is a man who tried to have someone arrested for tweeting an accurate but negative tweet about UKIP.

This is a man who was in favour of Alternative Vote because quote ""first past the post is a nightmare for UKIP.""

This is a man who has had to tout minorities around like a butcher hanging pig carcasses in his window while advocating that their kith and kin in Europe shouldn't be allowed to enter the country.

This man doesn't give a shit about you, he doesn't want influence, he wants power, and he will fuck this country up in ways that would make modern day political commentators faint.

true,notDvoiduRlooKin4,null,null,"I disagree. He is 26, no CL experience, limited experience in the top flight - and no where near as good as people are pretending that he is. Everyone is just circle jerking around southampton at the moment. While ""8th"" looks nice, it also ignores that they were 8 points behind 7th, and 13 points behind 6th. Despite their jump in the table from last season, they only scored 5 more goals this time around. That is without mentioning how much both United and Spurs underachieved this year as well.

Now let's look at ""foreign talent"".

Oscar - 20-32m (no idea, what the actual amount was)

* played in the youth brazil teams and already made appearances for the brazil national squad before signing for chelsea

* incredible player for his age, I'm not sure how much you have watched of him, but other than recent form, he is creative, hard working and has a ridiculous shot. 

Eriksen - 13.5m

* 21 at the time of his transfer, one of the hottest prospects around

* in the previous season, 10 goals and 17 assists in the league, 1 goal + 4 assists in the CL. In the season before that, 7 goals and 19 assists in the league

* plenty of experience with the NT before his transfer

I mean you can look at plenty of others like Silva and stuff, but there is either a massive difference in age or talent. And while what he is worth to southmapton is one thing, we can just as easily pick up two players for that price that are either just as good and much younger, or poach someone like greizmann, Konoplyanka, Gaitan, Shaqiri, Volland - I don't know about the current position of these players (if they want to leave/stay, w/e), and there are still others that I know even less about like Farfan around. But all these players are better or are just as good as Lallana but younger, and most of them will be ~20m max, maybe 25m. 

We have options available to us, and unlike other clubs that can pay an extreme premium for bench/rotation players, us spending 25-30m on a 26 year old outfield player that isn't a nailed on starter is madness, and I don't think that any other top club in England will be after him because they already have extensive depth in AM/Winger positions, and I don't believe that there will be any foreign interest in him either, especially at that price.",1,1400060947,null,0,false,0,chhmb9z,t3_25hou0,t1_chhmb9z,t1_chhkom2,null,1433790283,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

That's because most people who know anything about AstraZeneca and about pharma will know that they actually make most of their money from **risk reduction** or **symptom improvement** medicines for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. Their cancer medicines like Tamoxifen are now mostly off-patent, and have fairly marginal impacts even under optimal conditions.

In a nutshell, these companies like to make out to end consumers like us that they are seconds away from releasing new life saving cancer treatments... In reality though, most of their research is focused on developing more risk reduction medicines for diseases that are common like Diabetes. The reason is, selling a single life-saving drug for a rare type of cancer is expensive to develop and manufacture and tends to only be viable for very small numbers of people outside the top few cancers (lung, breast and bowel). On the other hand, the NHS will happily buy billions of pounds worth of drugs for diabetics because it is common and because it costs the NHS a lot of money to treat their end-stage complications, so economically it makes sense.

The data can be found here http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/may-2014/table-a01.xls.

The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on JSA, so sanctions will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey. There are unemployed who are not entitled to JSA (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, or those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are arguably people on JSA who are not unemployed (i.e. fraudsters). The two are not the same.

The figures are calculated by the Office of National Statistics. They are independent. The government does not interfere with the calculation of the figures, or set the way in which they are calculated. Though knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly. It may create targets which are not in the best interest of the public. The way the numbers are calculated is based on internationally agreed conventions.

Zero-hour contracts are not measured. However there is some measure of “underemployment” in that those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work are recorded. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent is also measured. 

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce, not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed. They do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However, those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately, so you may recast the figures should you wish.

The figures are seasonally adjusted, so there is no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a substantial margin of error. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

* It's taken out of your gross salary before Tax, so it's worth 25% more in your pension than in your pocket.
* It's only 1% of your gross salary, so you'd only get £11.67pm extra in your pocket if you opted out.
* **Your employer also contributes an extra 1% on top of your gross salary**, so that's a free pay-rise.
* In total it's worth £29.17pm in your pension, that's 150% more in the pension than your pocket.
* As /u/IxionS3 says, compound interest works in your favour for your pension, giving you an estimated retirement of [£113k](http://news.fool.co.uk//school/calculators/calc1.asp?mode=one&amp;monthly=116.67&amp;year=35&amp;lump=2055&amp;rate=4&amp;submit=calculate) in today's money assuming you're 30 years old ([£185k](http://news.fool.co.uk//school/calculators/calc1.asp?mode=one&amp;monthly=116.67&amp;year=45&amp;lump=2055&amp;rate=4&amp;submit=calculate) if 20) and never get a pay rise, only £32k (£41k) of which is money you paid in.

Essentially pension is the best value ""salary sacrifice"" scheme, which is basically the only way to reduce your tax paid.

&gt;In 1951–52 *CD Mestalla*, the reserve team of [Valencia CF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF), won the [Segunda División](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Divisi%C3%B3n) promotion play-off but were denied promotion because their senior team was already in the [Primera División](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga). The following season [CD España Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona_B), the reserve team of [FC Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona), also finished as runners-up in the same play-off but were similarly denied. However after winning another promotion play-off in 1956 CD España Industrial, separated from FC Barcelona and were renamed [CD Condal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Condal). The club were now able to be promoted to the Primera División. However they survived only one season and were relegated in 1957. In 1968 the club rejoined the FC Barcelona family as the reserve team and eventually evolved into [FC Barcelona B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona_B).

But they couldn't stop me from doing so, as I had Freedom of Speech. Incredulously, I said, ""...but you must realise how this looks!"" One shrugged, the other looked embarrassed.

I'm confused. It says **the straight answer was no** but **they couldn't stop me from doing so**. So have the police actually said ""no"" or they didn't say anything or what exactly? It still looks to me they have said NO.

&gt;The police were confirming that no crime had been committed so they could close the case and keep their tick boxes looking good for their statistics.

The police WENT TO A GUY'S home. When I was reporting to the police that some children were throwing bricks at my vehicle and onto window (and broke it) of someone's house next to it, the police didn't even come even though they would they will. When I called them back I was told to ""not waste police's time"". There was no follow up of anybody to any of my claims regarding occurring vandalism on the street. It WAS heavy handed as the police should investigate it from a computer, not go to a guy's home.

A: ""No, as it might appear prejudicial in light of the upcoming election, however we cannot stop you from doing so.""

The police tend to focus on issues that are easiest for them rather than most important to the people they are paid to protect. This isn't news to anyone, sadly.

You clearly know little about policing. Investigating from a computer may sound nice but it isn't how things work in reality, not least of all as they cannot confirm a persons identity over a computer.

&gt; You are wrong - Peter Burkinshaw, secretary of Ukip’s Cambridge branch, said: ‘I don’t understand why the police would go round.

Read again what you just typed. Your prejudice is blinding you to the fact that this statement is *critical of the police questioning Michael Apperton on UKIP's behalf*. 

&gt; The act forbids the publishing of false statements about candidates ahead of polls, and bans people from impersonating a candidate. The complaint came from a Ukip councillor.

It means you go out to eat a little more often, so there's more demand for wait staff and kitchen staff, and you pop down the pub an extra night a week so there's more demand for bar staff and beer distribrution staff.

true,JL_muserwolves,null,null,"I think we need... anywhere between four and six signings, and it's critical they're all (with the exception of maybe one) at least challenging for a starting spot instead of being cover from the get-go. Morgan has already come out and said that it's unlikely for most of the relegated holdovers to have a way back into the club's starting squad, so going off of that...

**1. Full back:** On the right, I personally don't think Doherty's ready for the Championship yet and would prefer us to send him out on loan back to League One, and between his being a holdover from the disaster year and his sharp decline, I don't trust Foley at this point. It's a bit of a shame, but there it is. On the left, the fact that our first-choice RB is our second-choice LB and we now have no cover past him means that we absolutely do need at least a signing there. Ideally, we would be able to find a full-back who can play on both sides but is primarily a left-back, to both challenge Golbourne for the starting spot on the left as well as ensure adequate defensive quality in depth on both sides.

**2. Central defender:** Stearman and Batth should be a good partnership for this level, but Batth needs to step up his game a bit and after that we have... what, Ebanks-Landell and Hause? Another quality CB wouldn't hurt at all, as I don't think either of the latter are ready for the next level. Ebanks-Landell has shown flashes, but he's not there yet overall, and we can't rely on the starting pairing to stay fit for all 46 matches. You couldn't do it for any pairing, it's unreasonable.

**3. Central midfielder:** Obviously K-Mac is quality and will have no problems with the step up to this level or potentially even higher. Dangerous Dave is also a known quantity here and might find himself starting if he can keep his form and stay healthy (he does have a history of losing both), but I like him more behind the striker and Jacobs is better than him there. Past that, it's down to Price and Evans, and as good as the Shrewsbury Pirlo is on his day, both are still young and mistakes are going to be found out and punished quicker and more severely in the Championship. I'd like to see Evans loaned back out to League One along with Doherty, and then we should be looking at signing a quality playmaker to play in the center, starting alongside McDonald, with Price and Edwards as options. I think a rotational role at this level getting some games is right for Jack, I can't wait for him to develop further.

**4. Winger:** Zeli's not ready for the Championship and I would hope he goes out to a League One side as with Doherty and Evans, Bancessi is an absolute unknown quantity who didn't get any games this last season and is even less likely to do so here and is probably going on loan as well, and that leaves us with Sako, Jacobs, Henry and little else (Edwards behind Jacobs in the pecking order in that #10 role, but that's it) to play the ""3"" in our 4-2-3-1. Undoubtedly, we need at least another quality body, and as we're at our best with Jacobs behind the striker instead of covering wide like he has done, so we should be looking at another high-quality traditional wing player to ensure we shift him out wide as little as possible and keep up everyone's fitness levels. That trio will be crucial, always has been to our best performances. A left-footed winger might be a better option if Sako hasn't kicked his habit of going off the boil.

**5. Striker:** I have zero faith in Leon Clarke and I know I'm not alone, and he's undoubtedly gone at the end of his contract. Obviously, Dicko is class, but we can't get through the season with a misfiring lug of a League One striker as second choice. Assuming Doyle leaves for good instead of coming back to not score goals, we're gonna need another striker for this level without question. I've heard suggestions of signing two strikers, but personally I want to see Sigurdarson get another chance, as I don't think he's lumped in with the O'Hara/Johnson/general tosser crowd and he's been rather good for Molde. I think he just never really had the chance to settle here and could still be a good player for us. Either way, we're gonna need at least one newcomer.

**6. Veteran goalkeeper:** Optional, and I wouldn't want to go replacing Ikeme as he's been one of our stars. But I think, much like the rest of the above mentioned youngsters, another season in League One would do McCarey a lot of good and I don't have too much confidence in him if, heaven forbid, Ikeme goes down injured. This is a young squad that could do with another experienced head in the dressing room, and I think in goal is a place where we could use a quality backup who's been around the block.

I do have faith in KJ and KT to identify and make good signings, whoever they bring in, but that's my assessment of what we might need if we want to challenge at the top again. As it stands, I'd fully expect lower-midtable from the current squad, because on paper I think we're superior to about six or seven teams here, but that won't be good enough for long. We are ambitious, and we are hungry.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"Have people judged ***her*** on her dress though, really? Perhaps her fashion sense, but not her quality as a comedian, surely – apart from obvious trolls of course?

My own feeling about the dress – assuming it's the one pictured in the article – is that it's exactly the sort of hideous, floral, curtain-like, number my old mum likes to wear. Do I love her any the less for having such terrible taste? No, of course not. My siblings and I just use it as another thing to poke fun at her about.

And I have to say it's a bit rich for a comedian who thrives on making derogatory comments about other people in the public eye, to whinge about it when it happens to her. Those who live by the sword and what-have-you…

Of course there is a broad question about why women seem to garner more comments, good or bad, about what they're wearing than men do. Well you could blame it on sexism, hypocrisy, double-standards and so-on, but I think it's really more prosaic than that: men's clothing is generally a lot less adventurous, flamboyant, colourful – call it what you will – than women's, so it's simply not interesting enough to warrant comment. Oh and in my experience it's other women who are the most vociferous and critical of fellow women's attire, so that's another nail in the 'sexism' coffin. Another is the fact that when men in the public eye *do* dare to dress a bit more flamboyantly – think Jonathan Ross, Alan Carr, that Llewellyn Bowen chap, etc. – they too get lots of attention for it… and they love it!

Maths fail? 75%, not 90%.

It's also interesting that the ONS Quarterly Statistics appear to have been published early. Their website states that the next edition was due on 22nd May, the previous set having been published on the 27th February.
Is this latest Report being advanced for the European Elections and does that reflect any 'management' of the statistics given that in April the ONS admitted huge errors in their past calculations?

It is good that unemployment has fallen - but if wages are stagnating and the cost of living is rising then that is a problem - and one that effects a large number of working people rather than just the unemployed who were a minority (although unemployment is an awful problem for those affected).

Similarly working out how legitimate the self-employment in is hard - are they prosperous entrepreneurs or desperate unemployed people being pushed into self-employment to get any work at all?

##In the Back

###It's the tax dodging, stupid

THE proposed takeover of British drugs company AstraZeneca by US giant Pfizer graphically illustrates how George Osborne's conversion of Britain into a corporate tax haven distorts industry worldwide and threatens domestic jobs and business.

The plan is for Pfizer to use the takeover to ""re-domicile"" its head office. This means little more than setting up a brass plate company in the UK at the top of the organisation which will magically enable a firm turning over more than $50bn a year to cut its tax bill from around 27 percent at present to about 20 percent. Since the combined group will continue to make most of its money in the US, where tax rates are around 35 percent, and international tax rules ostensibly work on the principle that profits are taxed where they're earned, the monumental scale of the tax dodging is clear. Analysts put the tax ""saving"" from the merger at more than £800m a year.

Laws introduced by the chancellor two years ago allow a UK-controlled multinational to shift profits into tax havens like Ireland and the Netherlands without being taxed. They can then get them back to shareholders tax-free via a UK holding company, whereas if the company had been an American one, the US taxman would have taxed them. As our special report Tax, Lies and Videotape revealed last year in Eye 1349, Osborne's laws are being exploited to ensure that companies drastically reduce or eliminate tax bills. Tax advisers, including a KPMG director, told the Eye's undercover ""tax consultant"" that the rules could be used in a merger to ""wipe out"" his client's UK tax bill.

Along with British jobs, the takeover will thus threaten AstraZeneca's existing corporate tax payments, which appear to be around £50m a year, though the company refuses to divulge them. Speaking to Wall Street analysts about the deal, Pfizer chief executive Ian Read cited the new offshore rules and tax incentives for holding patents in the UK as generating the lower tax bill. Asked whether he would have launched the takeover bid if the tax manoeuvre weren't possible, he replied: ""I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals."" Translation: ""no""; this deal depends on Tax Haven UK.

The government and the accountants who helped devise the new rules are desperate to present the wave of takeovers to come, from which they will make fortunes, as something other than tax dodging on a global scale. KPMG, which seconded a senior employee to the Treasury team drawing up the new laws, reckons it is working on re-domiciling plans for 100 multinationals, with the other Big Four accountants reporting similar interest. Its tax boss Jane McCormick told the Telegraph last week that since companies from various sectors were looking to set up UK holding companies, it ""feels to us that the economy is rebalancing"".

What it is actually tilting the economy towards, as the Eye pointed out when the tax changes were proposed in 2010, is a dependence on tax dodging. Business secretary Vmce Cable's claim to parliament that ""we see the future of the UK as a knowledge economy, not as a tax haven"" was as empty as his promises on Royal Mail.

This mega-deal could be the one that finally makes others twig that, far from simply tweaking the tax system to make it more ""competitive"" as Osborne and his tax minister David Gauke repeatedly parrot, the coalition has undermined not just Britain's tax system but everyone else's too. Uncle Sam for one will not be happy.",0,1400067562,null,0,false,0,chhni33,t3_25j3cx,t1_chhni33,t3_25j3cx,null,1433790822,8,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,8

Yeah, your view makes more sense. In any case, they indeed said NO. There wasn't a ""We would prefer you not posting about this..."" etc.

&gt;You clearly know little about policing. Investigating from a computer may sound nice but it isn't how things work in reality, not least of all as they cannot confirm a persons identity over a computer

To me, total waste of police time. They could have checked what the post is about and actually read it (there is good chance they didn't). The *I had to explain to one of the officers what Twitter was and how it worked* just gives you a clear message here.

&gt;Read again what you just typed. Your prejudice is blinding you to the fact that this statement is critical of the police questioning Michael Apperton on UKIP's behalf.

Done by UKIP! As in UKIP is wondering why police would go to the guy's house in the first instance as in ""UKIP says it's ridiculous that such situation has arisen at all"" - meaning they defend themselves, hence the other side view.

&gt;Which explains why police gave the advice they did about not publishing online about their visit

Dude, not about their visit but about the whole investigation of possible crime. Police came to investigate if there was a crime of impersonation etc.

&gt;But it doesn't give a quote

Nothing new with the DM but it's not relevant in the anti-UKIP DM's approach as this could probably be taken from the official police rules of what the possible crime could have been.

&gt;and indicates the complainant is anonymous - further reinforcing the anti-UKIP tone of the whole article.

And as of yet nobody knows who he or she was. How could the DM print the name if they nor other don't have it?

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"I know what you said, I just disagree with it. There are occasional examples of torture working - the French used torture to achieve notable results in Algeria for example, however horrific it was. The Bush Administration is a terrible example to use, far too much politics, false accusations and covering up from everyone involved. The case studies where the governments were more honest about it make clearer examples. 

Your argument is simply not that applicable to the level we are discussing. Essentially whether or not torture is an effective tool to use. If we were discussing whether or not to use torture, then your argument is very appropriate. 

However I'm concerned with whether or not torture should be legally institutionalised. This is about whether torture should be in the toolbox at all. Now simply because it isn't effective most of the time isn't enough of a reason to not have it in the toolbox. It may be an option that is rarely if ever selected, but it can still be available if needed. 

There are enough example of history of torture working to show that it can work. Therefore there will be people in power who will seriously consider whether or not to add torture to the toolbox, as evidenced by the Bush Administration if you will. The idea of having all options possible is very appealing to some, regardless of which option is ultimately picked. Your argument is no longer sufficient at this point, we need an argument against institutionalising it to ensure we can convince governments not to add it to the toolbox as an option.

  
 1. Can it work? 

 2. Can it be morally justified? 

 3. Can it be legally institutionalised?  

When a person in power has answered yes to the first two questions, as many have done, such as the Bush Administration, we need to form an effective argument against the third question. You might disagree with them answering yes to the first or second question, but that makes no difference when they've made their mind up. That is why we need to seriously discuss it, and make sure we have an effective argument against that last question.

emigration =/= immigration. Here's the conclusion and why the foreign born numbers were used:-

&gt;*Britain has experienced many relatively small episodes of immigration over the centuries. For nearly a thousand years migration was on a very small scale compared to the size of the population. In the decades between the Second World War and the late 1990s, foreign immigration grew steadily at a relatively modest rate before declining in the late 1960s and becoming fairly stable between 1971 and 1981. The massive increase in the level of migration since the late 1990s is utterly unprecedented in the country’s history, dwarfing the scale of anything that went before.*",0,1400070920,null,0,false,0,chhobnk,t3_25j2va,t1_chhobnk,t1_chho2bw,null,1433791210,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Use MoneySavingExpert's guide on credit cards and credit card checker to deduce her likelihood of being accepted for a card.

He's not likely to get much better and his value is most likely only going to decrease from here. Yeah, he's not a risky gamble, but he's not a promising gamble either.

true,Scary_The_Clown,null,null,"&gt; There are occasional examples of torture working

There are also occasional examples that picking up a random person on the street and interrogating them for a crime gets you a conviction. I'm sure that using ""people who didn't tie their shoes"" to screen for Polio also works on occasion. 

This is the point - the fact that it has produced results in a minority of cases does not validate the method. The first word in ""reliable intelligence"" is critical. As I said - if torturing one hundred people gets results out of one guy, it's not ""hey, we have a 1% success rate"" - the problem is the small number of actual intel vs. the sea of absolutely worthless intel, *and not knowing which is which.* 

If torturing 100 people to find Osama Bin Laden's location got you 99 blank stares and one person who gives up an address, you might have a valid point. But you're going to get something like 90 different addresses all over the planet. You might still say ""Hey, ninety is better than nothing"" but consider - what if you had only tortured twenty-five of those people? Now you have 25 random addresses. Is the real one in there? 

And while you're waterboarding all these people, an experienced interrogator sits down with one guy, talks to him for a few hours, and gets the result, with corroborating evidence and a background story that explains why it's valid. 

This isn't ""torture is often unreliable"" or ""torture doesn't always work."" It's TORTURE DOES NOT PRODUCE ***RELIABLE*** INTELLIGENCE. PERIOD.

Anyone who tries to get past step one here is not working to determine the best methods of obtaining intelligence - they are looking for an excuse to torture people. ",1,1400071810,null,0,false,0,chhokmo,t3_25fkym,t1_chhokmo,t1_chho5a4,null,1433791333,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I can assure you of this quite easily and quickly...

&gt;The problem is you want to have an argument about two things you seem to know nothing about. One is Islam and the other is the role of the public intellectual.

...where exactly have I argued about ""the role of the public intellectual""?  You keep trying to derail the discussion with this.  You accused me of ignoring it even though it's irrelevant and now you claim *I* am the one who wants to debate that.  Yet you claim you don't think your reading (comprehension) is the issue just one sentence earlier.  I think you're very confused.  

&gt;But at no point have I said that Islam is X

Why do you think I keep on asking you?  Do you see all those question marks (? - this symbol)?  I am trying to get you to answer this question.  **I even typed it in bold font to make it harder for you to keep missing.**

&gt;what I have said is that Hitchens's understanding of Islam is flawed because of it's lack of nuance and complexity.

Here is exactly what I took exception to: ""inability to separate hadith from Quran"".  That's why I quoted that part.  It's the thing we're actually debating here.  You can attempt to derail that, but will find yourself unsuccessful.

&gt;But that's exactly what Hitchens does. South Asian Islam , sufi, shia , Hanafi, Zaidi and all the other flavours of Islam are treated exactly the same.

I don't know how you can claim to not have an issue with English comprehension.  My point was that Hitchens was criticising something that most muslims actually believe, regardless of your views.  There are minorities like sufis who believe different things.  But, that crucially doesn't invalidate a criticism made about most muslims.  

You are again attempting to derail this by bringing up some other discussion about Hitchens not talking about the differences between a wider span of muslim groups.  

&gt;Let's take the role of women in Islam...

No let's not derail the discussion with some more irrelevant historical discussion.  It doesn't matter to this discussion what people think of some religious historical figure.

Just as if most christians believed in creationism, it wouldn't matter how they viewed Jesus's mother or how those views differed or were similar.  This is nothing but a diversion, because I am not arguing about these things.  My point is simple and I have made it many times.

If you want to have some other discussion with someone else about the intricacies of shia muslim beliefs, go right ahead and discuss this with someone else.  If you want to debate me, then debate my points, not some irrelevant information you happened across elsewhere.

&gt;This world doesn't really exist in Hitchen's interrogation of Islam. He seems to be unaware of the great sufi mystical traditions, in both Africa and Asia that underpin LIVED understanding of what Islam is. Which is where you claim b) that ..Whereas, for many what most muslims actually believe is exactly what Hitchens is criticising...

Sufi islam is seen as an unusual and minority interpretation of islam!  Many muslims actually view them as heretics.  What part of ""most muslims"" do you not understand.  The term ""most"" is very clear.  I suggest you look it up.

&gt;But are they? Does Hitchen's interpretation have anything to do with the great Ashura procession in Tehran?

This doesn't follow at all!  I argued that Hitchens was valid when not separating the hadiths from the quran.  What has that got to do with one particular festival celebrated by a minority branch of Islam?  Are you completely losing it?

&gt;&gt;Criticism of the works of Marx is going to be different to that for a religion.

Maybe you should also read the part that became immediately afterwards too: ""Criticism of the works of Marx is going to be different to that for a religion.  **Because, here, Marx is given one single definition, whereas with religion, it can have multiple definitions.**""  I even enbolded it so you wouldn't miss it.  I suppose you did so intentionally.

&gt;But it's only going to be criticism if I can identify what Marx is and form a framework valid enough to form criticism. This is the same PROCESS as criticising anything else. One needs a frame of reference. A structure where claims can be tested.

What you need before any debate is to clear up definitions.  That's debating 101.  No testing of claims can even begin if the definitions are different.  You keep refusing to do this.  You keep refusing to acknowledge that this entire misinterpretation of yours lay with you not understanding or acknowledging a definition which I kept explaining in extremely simple terms to you.  

That fact that you try so hard to divert the discussion shows that you were wrong about Hitchens when it came to you saying ""inability to separate hadith from Quran"".  You have failed numerous times to point out a valid counter argument without resorting to misrepresentation or outright changing the discussion and muddying the debate with irrelevant diversions.

A group of European powers decided that the indigenous people weren't advanced or stable enough to self govern, and took control after promising independence to them. Then, after 28 years of British rule the majority of territory was given to a religious minority who hadn't governed the land for around 2000 years.

&gt;however it doesn't make sense to judge history by today's moral standards. 

Nor does it make sense to ignore things that were considered morally wrong at the time, or pretend that just because something happened in the past, it's no longer criminal. The land Israel sits on currently was promised to the Arabs, then secretly split between European powers instead. If you can tell me what I'm misunderstanding, please do.

no, I think the birth residents rose up expecting independence and ended up being a territory of the UK instead.

I thought we couldn't apply today's moral standards? if taking control of the British protectorate under the pretense of helping a popular revolution then denying the independence you promised isn't wrong, then how is going to war to protect your financial interests?

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"My point, if you had bothered to actually read what I said instead of blowing up like that, was that that type of money no longer **guarantees** you a quality, world class player. Ten, maybe fifteen years ago, you spend £20m+ on a player and its an investment that 9 times out of ten pays off. Hence my point, £20m is the new £10m in that there is still a bit of risk associated with the investment partly due to inflation and partly due to other factors.

Now, why would I bring up successful big money purchases when my specific point was that these days spending such sums of money doesn't necessarily mean you are getting the finished product or someone who can fit into your team? It's not called cherry picking, it's called looking at what's in front of you and making a broad analysis of it. Of course some have worked out, but I'm trying to highlight how paying so much money doesnt always bring success, and with an increasing regularity too.

I have no idea why you have taken umbridge with my point, it is pretty much a given that transfer prices are rising, unless you have evidence to suggest otherwise?

&gt; Paying £20m for Lallana is as much as we paid for Sturridge and Coutinho combined, and if you factor in age I would say they're both individually better players than he is

You've outdone yourself with this one. Is it surprising to you that someone who has just come off the back of an excellent season costs more than an underperforming striker who is in is last chance saloon and a talented but somewhat stagnated attacking-midfielder, both of whom are relatively young and not important to their teams? 

I also like how you accuse me of 'cherry-picking' (I wasnt, I was bringing up recent examples to prove a point) and then go and cherry pick yourself! Why have you chosen Coutinho and Sturridge to compare with Lallana? How about we go with another english player we signed off the back of a good season? Lets go with Downing. How much did he cost? £20m. I think I know who I would prefer to have for that money.

So, going by the overall jist of your comment, I get the feeling that instead of perusing ready made finished articles, players who will almost certainly improve our team, you want us to gamble on underperforming young players who may or may not work out?

[Ten Green Bottles](http://www.tengreenbottles.com/) is also nice, if a bit upmarket - might be a bit too fancy if you're not actually dating yet.

Anther option could be dinner? There's a cheap and cheerful Italian place called [Si Signore](http://sisignore.co.uk/) fairly close to the Office Bar which does decent food and has a BYOB policy, so you could grab a pizza and a couple of beers each.

I don't have the time and you don't have knowledge to think about what ""muslims think"" that's why I gave you all those examples. The lived experience of what ""islam"" is to a given sample of Muslims is so different that an attempt to classify it is going to be fraught to begin. 

But if you do try to classify it, then a public intellectual and a critic your responsibility is to understand the frameworks you're applying. It is important to be able to classify out and categorise the phenomena you're about to talk about. 

&gt;My point was that Hitchens was criticising something that most muslims actually believe, regardless of your views.

That's the point, that Hitchens doesn't know what Islam is, in order to understand what Muslims believe. His function as a critic is undermined, he becomes a polemicist. 

&gt; ""Criticism of the works of Marx is going to be different to that for a religion. Because, here, Marx is given one single definition, whereas with religion, it can have multiple definitions.""

No you half-wit, Marx has many definitions depending on the interpretive framework of the critic. Marx isn't a person it's a cultural artefact and philosophical position.  What do they teach at universities these days, don't you lot actually read philosophy? That was basic undergrad back in my day, heck it's basic undergrad for my students these days. Makes sense why you don't understand the role of the critic if you don't understand that.

I really ought to stop talking to a Hitchens acolyte who says idiotic things likes this:

&gt;Sufi islam is seen as an unusual and minority interpretation of islam!

I have better things to do than discuss these things with someone who obviously doesn't have the knowledge or the intellectual training to bother with.

This is easier said than done, of course, but I would applaud the efforts to not pay an inflated price in this deal.

The biggest clubs in the world get fair prices for the players they buy because they are huge clubs and the players agitate for a move.

He is very young, and with his involvement in the national squad recently; he must have a good amount of potential, definitely a prospect for the future.

Ba would be great to have up front, push Carroll to work harder for his first team place as well as Cole. Unfortunately, Ba's wages are way too high, unless he is willing to take a massive pay cut for first team football. What we have on our side is that he has experienced being at the club and he had a great run at the club before relegation.

Snodgrass I think would be the best buy. Somewhat consistent winger, and lets be honest; he can't be much worse than Jarvis. Also an accomplished freekick taker which would be nice having Nobes, Downing and him standing over the ball. I also believe his teammate Redmond would be a good buy. Young English winger who when against us, played phenomenally linking up with Hooper. So, I think there are a couple of possible transfer targets at Norwich. 

As for Colback, well has been a consistent, strong full back in the prem as well ascontributing in the offense for Sunderland.

In short, we go to a GP or a doctor to find a cure for a problem. Hell, we wouldn't go to a doctor if it's something we could treat ourselves.

Certainly in the Southern areas of Wales, moreso in the South East, you're more likely to find someone being told to ""fuck right off"" if they start with the ""This is Wales, I will speak Welsh"" act rather than vice versa - but of course spoken Welsh is massively more common in the North where this incident is believed to have taken place.

I've been on the business end of it myself - the first time I went to a pub in Chepstow , it was a rather pleasant place. However, the moment the landlords clocked my accent, the whole atmosphere changed, it was almost as if I was some faraway stranger wandering in with a faraway accent and causing a scene. My personal view was that these are modern times, Chepstow is probably becoming more of a Bristol commuter town and the proximity to the border probably meant that Welsh people may have been less common. I didn't see the need to do anything out of courtesy though, or consider ""where the fuck can you"" use the accent?

It already is, if you think the NHS is having trouble getting enough doctors here for example, you can't even begin to imagine how bad it is in Romania (and possibly across East Europe).

But this is just something that will have to sort itself out as time goes by (as the economies of different regions stop being so far apart, migration will slow down or perhaps even revert).

Life in Romania isn't bad now if you've got the income, barring some services that are lacking (health &amp; education, police &amp; firec etc, not quite on the level of the UK obviously, but not nearly as far apart as some might think either), but it can be difficult getting that income (depending on your skill set and willingness to relocate within the country).
Things are getting better though, and at the end of the day you have to consider that Romania is a place that has roughly the same size as the UK, 1/3rd the population and very beautiful landscapes (and as a direct result of the low population =&gt; cheap land for sale ;) )

If instead of crying for a second ""Berlin wall"" as a solution to immigration, people would be more willing to give it time and possibly even consider learning a different language and moving themselves, they might find that Europe has plenty of opportunity for employment and cheap and beautiful places to live.

And before someone accuses me of being a hypocrite for ""coming over here and telling us to move out of our country"", I came to the UK because I was curious how life here was (more than because of the money), and I haven't made up my mind yet on whether I'll stay for good, or go back to Romania or even try out some other place in Europe next.

In my mind, that's the most amazing thing about the EU that (some? many?) Brits seems to not realise, that the whole continent (well the parts covered by the EU anyway), are just as easy to move to and get a job and live as if they were your own country.

This is exactly what I mean.  What is the point of the good man who does nothing whilst reckless fascists make a clean sweep?  Claiming a distanced and smug superiority from your comfortable hole in the shire whilst the world burns does nothing for anyone - and ultimately leads to the demise of your morally superior perspective.

I can agree with ~~everything you said~~ the cooking analogy, but this doesn't pull the rug out from the idea that having principle without power is an exercise in futility.  

I feel it's probably necessary to mention that having power does not mean having *all* the power.  If you have *no* power, you can't *do* anything.  If you are *powerless*, you won't even be able to feed yourself.  power is a totally necessary facet of existing.

Yes, it does.  Like I said, I knew this was where your issue lies.  I called it exactly.

&gt;What's at issue is the interpretation and the position of Hitchens as public intellectual.

That was never what was debated by me.  It's solely the first sentence which is relevant, not the blatant derailing you're desperate to initiate because you're evidently a sore loser as well as being poor at comprehending simple English.  Argue with **me** and **my** points, not some imaginary points you created out of thin air.

&gt;I don't have the time and you don't have knowledge to think about what ""muslims think"" that's why I gave you all those examples.

There are numerous surveys out there that give insight into what muslims think.  I'd wager it takes a lot less effort than your insistence that every single minute detail about the minority shia muslims is absolutely essential to say anything at all.

&gt;That's the point, that Hitchens doesn't know what Islam is

That's very presumptuous for someone who flat out denies that an entire definition of islam is valid at all.

&gt;No you half-wit, Marx has many definitions depending on the interpretive framework of the critic. Marx isn't a person it's a cultural artefact and philosophical position.

Wow, just wow.  Marx isn't a person?  Are you this retarded?  (Karl) *Marx* **was** a person you fucking idiot!  *Marxism* is a worldview and method of societal analysis.  And the ""works of Marx"" are the ""works of Marx"".  Do you have brain damage?

&gt;What do they teach at universities these days,

Evidently a lot more than they ever taught you.  Perhaps you got senile with old age.

&gt;I really ought to stop talking to a Hitchens acolyte who says idiotic things likes this:

Yes, retard, you're an idiot who lost a simple debate because he couldn't understand simple English even though he studied philosophy at university, but I'm an ""acolyte"".  That's the only explanation.  You have a pathetic and feeble ego.

I'm not saying speaking the Welsh language is ""overly patriotic"" at all. I am merely stating that expecting everyone in a public service - be they doctors, nurses, firefighters, librarians - to learn Welsh is just not a workable solution. Being more specific to this example, considering that a great deal of our medical staff are brought in from overseas where English would be their second language, asking them to speak Welsh when their current skills are perfectly appropriate seems overly demanding.

To take this one step further, I would certainly debate whether I'd be ""up in arms"" about whether a doctor and a nurse were conversing in the native language. So long as I was kept updated in due course and that my care was of a higher standard, I wouldn't be all that bothered if they were tapping away in morse code between themselves.

Similarly, I'm no doctor but I very much doubt a reasonable person - doctor or no - would really care whether their patients are speaking between themselves in Welsh - crack on! So long as it doesn't affect the way the doctor is doing their job then there's no real reason to kick up a fuss, which is one of the key things which makes me think this article is a little suspect.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"Problematic list because it focusses entirely on Lallana's creation and not the other factors that have made him Rodgers' top pick. I should preface this by saying that I'm not in love with the idea of signing Lallana for £20m+, that I'm a total Firmino fanboy and that I think Shaqiri is a player we would be trying hard for if we had any sense (and I'd probably have strong feelings about Konoplyanka too if I'd seen more of him than just a few youtube clips and the odd Europa/Ukraine game) - the point is that they're not direct comparisons. 

As QQQ has already mentioned in the top post, Lallana is a proven leader (not to say the others aren't) and someone Rodgers has seen first-hand enough to know he can trust in that role. But he's also a player who can play in central midfield, as one of the sides in a diamond, etc. in addition to wide or behind a striker - Firmino and Konoplyanka would only really fit in the more forward roles, and Shaqiri might be able to play centrally a la Coutinho, but would still need time to adjust to that role and wouldn't be the most reliable defensively in that role, whereas a Lallana-Henderson duo seems like a great balance of workrate, versatility and attacking-defending adaptability. In a situation like this season where we lost Henderson, Lallana would be a more comfortable fit in his stead than any of the 3 listed, or anyone else we have. In a fluid system, it's important to emphasise the importance versatility and comfort in multiple roles can have - something I always point out about Sterling is that he has the ability to do whatever needs to be done in any are of the pitch he ends up in, and Lallana has something of that too. The 3 players listed could prove to be able to do the same, especially since 2 of them are 4 years younger than Adam, but they *haven't* yet. When even someone as good on the ball as Sakho has trouble dealing with the speed and aggression with which he's closed down in the Premier League, it's a reminder that knowing exactly what you're getting right away is sometimes worth paying for.

And that's basically it, Brendan wants Lallana because he knows he can do exactly what he wants him to in a variety of situations, whereas the players listed are likely to succeed in specific roles, but probably aren't players the manager is ready to entrust with as much responsibility as he is Adam Lallana. After several decent players bought by the committee didn't really work for Rodgers, it seems that Lallana is someone he's specifically demanding. Like I said, wouldn't necessarily be my choice, but Rodgers has earned the right to demand him. 

Me, I say sign them all, but that's the kind of thing I just say. ",0,1400078461,null,0,1400078880,0,chhqz1d,t3_25j4z0,t1_chhqz1d,t3_25j4z0,null,1433792458,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

For the next few years, winning the league and losing in europe are pretty much what to expect if you're a Celtic fan. 

The club could bring in someone 50% better or 50% worse, and the end result would be the same.  No manager is going to give that guarantee of a cup win, or treble, or significant further progress in europe. 

Whether his replacement was John Hughes or Pep Guardiola, I don't think it would make one iota of difference at the end of next season.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Except I don't recall many fans at the time claiming that Downing was good value, or Carroll for that matter. Most people felt we'd overpaid before we had the benefit of hindsight. And I was cherry-picking, that was part of my point, that actually by picking certain examples out of the overall pool you can make completely different judgements. A list of players says nothing when not given as a proportion of the overall talent.

I agree that £20m for a player has no guarantee, but usually that's regarding youthful signings and for a solid and established 26 year old it usually should. And I don't disagree (to be honest I kind of misunderstood the point you were making a bit) about £20m being a new gambly figure, but I feel that we need to be far more cautious because we can't afford to make the sort of mistakes that City and Chelsea can on expensive flops.

If we're going to gamble £20m+ on a player who might turn out to be crap, I'd rather we weren't going with Lallana, because as much as he'll probably be OK, I think at 26 he's pretty much guaranteed that he won't ever be a superstar. I'd much rather go for someone like Shaw, pay more money and with more risk that they don't fulfil potential or have injury problems, but at least have the chance of him potentially becoming one of the best right-backs in the world. Lallana is good, but I don't think he'll ever be good enough to be guaranteed a first team place in the same way that players like Suarez, Gerrard and Sturridge currrently are.

That would have required moving the M4 junction, plus Harmondsworth, Sipson and Harlington. That has now apparently been scrapped in favour of one to the west of the field over the M25, which would require the removal and tunnelling of the M25 for a stretch, which is frankly practically infeasible without disruption. Besides, there's less space over the M25 than there was to the north of the airfield because of the lakes and reservoirs to the west.

It's all practically moot anyway, because the skies over the South-East of England are pretty much full up now anyway - it's the busiest airspace in Europe and almost the busiest in the world above London and the Home Counties.

Adding one more runway would relieve some of the congestion on the ground, but it would massively increase the amount of congestion in the air, and would make the work of the air traffic controllers an awful lot harder.

true,retrominge,lfc68,,"&gt; Lucas has had years at it now and still can't do it as well

?

You're wrong. Lucas is a better defensive player than Gerrard. By a country mile. Gerrard has the spot currently (and should) because he offers SO MUCH MORE than defense, which is pretty much all Lucas offers. 

&gt; On the other hand, Lucas is just not as good. On the ball that is obvious. Defensively, he is reckless for me. Clumsy challenges at bad times, and he's been playing this position for years now.

I could not disagree more. Pre-injury he was SUBLIME. Best in his position in the league. His closest rival as a defensive mid was Sandro. 

I agree that Gerrard plays the position better, but his defence is not up to par with Lucas'. 

Like I said in another comment, it's a difficult conundrum. For the record, I'm a long time fan of Lucas. I don't know if other's don't see the work he puts in on the pitch but it often seemed like he was being overlooked by fans, even when he had fantastic games.

I tend to agree with you about Lallana though. I think for a team like Man City of Chelsea who can afford to spend as much as they like that he'd be a great signing. For us, unless we actually have around £60-£70m to spend, I think £25m would be too big a chunk of our budget. He does have the talent though, I think you're underselling him a bit by saying he'd be okay. He would be a fantastic player for us imo, and seeing as he doesn't rely on pace or strength he could play well in to his 30's at a relatively similar level. My main issue would be that we are strengthening out strongest part of the team before our weakest, but as long as that gets adequately addressed then I'd love to have Lallana to provide competition or an option off the bench.

You've gone from saying ""Lucas isn't as good a defender as Gerrard"" to ""yeah but defending is easier than attacking"". I agree that Gerrard is the better attacker. I agree that he should be starting in that spot. 

What I want other Liverpool fans to see is how GOOD Lucas is. He's dismissed too often. 

And to be clear, I don't think Gerrard plays the position better. I think he plays it different and it affects the team in a different way. Gerrard is far from a liability when defending, but he has made more mistakes than I'd've liked this season. 

edit: you're not gonna like the last bit of that post. I'm gonna give more reasoning. Quite a few times this season, there's been goals conceded and people have said ""oh, why's Johnson/Flanagan let him past so easily?"". The player in question has gotten past Gerrard too easily.

To Mrs Marx and his mate Engel. To you and everyone else he's a construct. You have no perception of him as a reality other than one that's mediated through your own context or that of people who write about Marx.

You need to let go of the childish simplicity of the dominant rational model dear boy, it leaves you in first gear when it comes to philosophy.

&gt;That was never what was debated by me. 

But that was the debate by me. If you moved away from it you are the one diverging from the purpose. You derailed it. I stuck to the terms.  I set the terms. 

You don't get to complain about derailing anything - in your parlance debate 101.

&gt;There are numerous surveys out there that give insight into what muslims think. 

Which are meaningless without a complex and nuanced understanding of the context in which they are taken. You can ask a Egyptian about ""Secularism"" and it means something wildly different to someone from the US. Context, my child, context. 

&gt; a lot less effort than your insistence that every single minute detail

That's why have thousands of researchers and millions in think tank money spent on this, because obviously it's so easy. 

&gt;That's very presumptuous for someone who flat out denies that an entire definition of islam is valid at all.

A definition has to have an underlying framework. Definitions are categorisation and to get to categorisation you have to have the things that make up that category understood. The issue with Hitchens is that he had a limited framework which rendered his interpretation meaningless. 

&gt;but I'm an ""acolyte""

You entered this debate to defend Hitchens..and try to prove that what he said about Islam was valid. My response was it isn't.  You then said that he knew more than ""muslims"" .. and my response simply that it doesn't matter. He's in a different category because he's a public intellectual. 

I mean I can do this all year long. , doesn't bother me. You don't seem incapable of understanding that we're actually talking about two different things. You want to talk about ""Islam"".. I'm talking about the validity of Hitchens as a notable critic.

&gt;
    Titles should not contain spoilers.
    If a post clearly labels which episode it's about (e.g. ""Spoilers for The Girl Who Waited""), you can expect that there will be spoilers about that episode in that post.
    Use of the spoiler tag is not necessary for discussion of that episode or before. Discussion of future episodes should be tagged.
    If a post does not clearly identify which episode it's discussing (e.g. ""DAE think that... [spoilers]""), then all spoilers should be tagged.
    Untagged spoilers for an episode are permitted in the comments section of that episode's discussion threads. Comments that contain spoilers before the episode has aired should be spoiler tagged.
    Anything within the ""Next On"" segment with an episode is to be considered a spoiler for the episode/series it is showing and should be treated as a spoiler until 48 hours after said episode airs.
    Discussion of any episode that is within 48 hours of air or any future episode to any degree beyond pure speculation is a spoiler

There is no longer a party, that in anyway shape or form, represents the working class and the down and outs.

Let's define that as when the other team has the ball, not just tackling. I don't agree that he is that much better, but it's debatable. Let's assume you're right. 

Here is the problem. In the system Rodgers plays, regardless of formation, that defensive midfield position is so much more than defending. It's arguably the most vital position. It's the link from the defenders to the rest of the team. When teams defend up the field against us, which happens often, that player needs to be rock solid on the ball. How many times did we see Allen this year lose possession in his own half due to pressure? Lucas would be no better. 

The way Rodgers plays, you need a guy that's very comfortable on the ball in that spot. Not to create (that's the bonus Gerrard brings), but rather to retain possession in areas we can't lose the ball. That's the biggest reason I don't like Lucas in that spot.

I disagree that the defensive midfield position is so important. When Lucas was playing there and Gerrard was further up the pitch, Gerrard still provided that link - from a different position. 

Don't bring Allen into it man, he's about 60% the defensive mid Lucas is (that said, he's much better going forwards). Lucas can pass the ball. He doesn't get the chance very often, because of the way we play. He tackles, then either passes backwards or sideways because passing isn't his job. He's passed well whilst under pressure numerous times though.

true,canyoufeelme,null,null,"&gt; Oh, it will happen eventually, trust me. Try holding hands with someone of the same sex down the street or kissing in a public place (just like straight people incessantly do) if you're feeling especially daring. Looks of astonishment and often disgust are commonplace. Verbal abuse is hardly rare - my then-partner and I were told that we were disgusting and deserved to be shot by a group of utter strangers once, and this was in Bath, not exactly a rough or fundamentalist area. That's one example of verbal abuse amongst many.

I'm gay and I say all the time the best thing you can do to advance gay rights at the moment is hold hands! Kiss! Cuddle! Anything like that in public. 

You know why people still stare and shout abuse? Because they never fucking see it, we censor ourselves through fear. It's a catch 22 - if people saw it more it wouldn't be so unusual and so we wouldn't have to fear anything because it wouldn't be so shocking, it would be a daily occurrence. 

The more people who hold hands or cuddle or anything like that the better because otherwise we become totally invisible and mistaken for brothers or friends instead of what we are and the sensitization continues. 

So I always say I know it's scary but don't let the fear win, hold hands in a busy street or cuddle in a public place even if it's just for a few minutes, because by doing so you are normalizing us and making us more visible and ultimately chipping away at the rock towards a time nobody has to worry again.  

If you want to live in a society in which you don't have to fear holding hands in public then you better put in the slack to CHANGE it, you don't get to turn around in 30 years when this is a reality and act as if you helped make it happen, you have to take the risks, put your neck on the chopping block and put the work in.

We want to go somewhere where if someone catches us holding hands or sitting slightly closer to each other at a restaurant that we're not going to be stared down or have whispers made about. Obviously living in Brighton makes it a bit harder as it's so chill here - but still, we're not exactly camp or attention-y gay stereotype.

Libertarianism is something I identify strongly with (for example NIgel Farage believes drugs should be legalised as it's no business what a man does to his own body and prohibition is incredibly harmful. [Take Mexico which has seen more death than Afghanistan and Iraq.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/03/mexico-drug-war-killing-fields) )  

You're correct, a large majority of UKip policies I disagree with. And the fact they don't support gay marriage etc. goes deeply at the grain against me. 

How will it change politics in a positive way? 

Well we don't really have democracy. We basically have consequence democracy with a kind of near hit or miss depending on whether a politician is running another term, whether he continues as a career politican etc.. Politicians need to fear being booted out and they need to fear the rise of insane fringe groups. For example if I were a labour/lib dem MP I like to imagine they're having emergency meetings as to why UKip are gaining popularity. 

I think the tories have dealt a blow to the UK not seen since Thatcher aided by the lib dems. I think labour despite Brown's economic genius were still largely wrong on what my moral compass allowed - illegal wars, torturing inmates, assisting the americans in illegal rendition programs. 

The positive outcome I expect is much similar to the rise of the BNP vote a few years back which shook up ""safe seats"" for labs or con. It made them readdress what they're doing. 

I'll further add my prediction as to how it'll affect the UK positively - UKip get a fair portion of the vote but not a majority. Labour/conservatives and lib dem get their act together and start being more representative of their constituents and UKIP lose their seats come election after next.

&gt;You don't get to complain about derailing anything - in your parlance debate 101.

So, you admit to derailing the debate.  You lost and couldn't handle it so you thought you'd switch the focus.

&gt;Which are meaningless without a complex and nuanced understanding of the context in which they are taken. 

That really depends on the topic.  Maybe if they were being asked about deep meaningful and complex questions, you'd have a point.  But not if it's simpler stuff.  You know, like the things that fly completely above your head.

&gt;You can ask a Egyptian about ""Secularism"" and it means something wildly different to someone from the US. Context, my child, context.

Nothing in this debate is even remotely as complicated as a concept like secularism.  Nothing.  You kept misunderstanding simple English sentences and then you got upset and started derailing the discussion to somewhere else in a pathetic attempt to massage your bruised ego.

&gt;That's why have thousands of researchers and millions in think tank money spent on this, because obviously it's so easy.

Yes, retard, because only thousands of researchers and millions of pounds can produce surveys.  Rolleyes.

&gt;A definition has to have an underlying framework. 

And again with the semantics.  Defining Islam as the religion practised by actual muslims is entirely legitimate.  It is accepted by most people and particularly those Hitchens communicates with, **which is the entire fucking purpose of language**!  I note you have not bothered at all to actually post a definition you view as valid.  You even distort the definition of ""Marx"".  You are entirely insincere.

&gt;You entered this debate to defend Hitchens.

No, I did not.  This is a blatant misrepresentation of what I've done and a pathetic strawman you've created.  I've watched you beating him, not me, over and over.  Perhaps you can dig up the corpse of Hitchens and beat that with a shovel, if you're so taken to attacking him.  Your obsession with him makes it impossible for anyone to have any debate over any topic even remotely connected with anything ever said by Hitchens.  You're like some crazed, obssesive ex-girlfriend.  

I'll say it in simple terms, you can disagree with something someone says without taking a ""side"".  If Hitler said the capital of Germany is Berlin and you disagreed, agreeing with him doesn't make me a nazi or a defender of Hitler.  You really are loathsomely dishonest as well as pathetic.  Someone beat you in a debate, boo hoo.  Get over it.

&gt;doesn't bother me. 

Hahahaaha.  Doesn't bother you?  Really?  I'd say it fucking burns you!  I'd say it makes you seeth with rage and wanna run home to your mummy and cry about how the big bad internet man said you were wrong.  

&gt;You don't seem incapable of understanding that we're actually talking about two different things. You want to talk about ""Islam"".. I'm talking about the validity of Hitchens as a notable critic.

Yes, I've called you out on this for quite a while now.  The debate is over.  I won.  But wow, if I realised how butt-hurt you'd get over being wrong about one small thing, I probably wouldn't have bothered.

I went for about 6 months contacting manufacturers over here and needless to say it was horrible. A good number wouldn't return any of my emails and when they did it was after a few. I rang up dozens and would either get shot down after one call or after a 2 or 3. At the end of a couple of months I then got 2 firms who were willing to make them for me however when I got the final quotes it was no where near the price I could manage to afford. The premise of the company was to offer really nice looking watch with quality but at a lower price so everyone could enjoy rocking a good looking time piece and with the quotes this was definitely not going to be achieved. I then had to go overseas. I designed the watch face and found a reasonable priced manufacturer which was still higher than I liked. I get the watch face and straps separate and again tried to source the NATO straps over here and it was a similar story. Again I found some manufacturers that could make them but again they were far too expensive added to the faces costing more than I hoped again it would mean I couldn't offer an affordable price. I then found a slightly cheaper manufacturer on the mainland. However with everything else the business now has, I made sure they were local. All of the packaging is local as well as the tools etc.

Getting us out of Europe is the one thing that half the electorate agree on, and it's UKIP's little vote-magnet.

UKIP will probably have to commit to more policies by the general election, but at present they can avoid doing so and this suits them fine - their voters can project upon them any principles they wish, and UKIP candidates can promise anything without contradiction from their own manifesto.

Past getting out of Europe, kippers are a total hodge-podge of beliefs - in [one recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/23vlrk/turns_out_the_builder_on_the_ukip_posters_is_an/) I saw one kipper claim that in a post-EU Britain immigration would be allowed on a ""points system"" (i.e. Pakistani doctors and Filipino nurses would presumably be allowed), another said it was ""obvious"" that unemployed Irish people would be able to come over here looking for work because they're ""culturally British"" (i.e. white and first-language English).

These positions are in total contradiction, but both people are being allowed to believe that UKIP will meet their expectations (because it's ""obvious"" and ""common sense"" - terms which are UKIP hallmarks) by the party, because UKIP want as many people to vote for them as possible. 

If you vote for a UKIP MEP at the coming election, then he promises not to participate in the greater European democracy.

I don't really like talking about a ""wasted vote"", but I find it hard to avoid the term here - a UKIP MEP will vote against British interests in the EU parliament as a matter of principle (or abstain - my sketchy understanding is that they decide this on an ad-hoc basis).",0,1400083219,null,0,false,0,chht4sk,t3_25jbnp,t1_chht4sk,t3_25jbnp,null,1433793558,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
