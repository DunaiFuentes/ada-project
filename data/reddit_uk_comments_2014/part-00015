The most recent introduction to the collection of parts to the solution was the Hurt Doctor and saving Gallifrey, but that means that the entire solution was in place and ready from the moment the problem was introduced.

Deus Ex Machina means that the solution was not set up. It means that something NEW came out of nowhere to save the day. Every single part of this solution was set up well in advance. WELL in advance. Extra Regen cycle is from decades ago. Regeneration Energy being powerful and dangerous is from pre-Matt. Crack in the world allows access out of the world, so the Time Council could reach the Doctor. Silence must Fall is because the universe would try to stop the Council returning. The Hurt Doctor is where all the introductions actually happened: The problem is created because an extra doctor happened, Gallifrey is saved, and the Time Council is put in the Doctor's debt, so that they would be willing to reward him with the regenerations.

That star player reliance mentality carried on to Tottenham, over reliance on Bale last season, last minute goals, etc. Shame that Yakin would have even more pressure to succeed- sure, AVB had something to prove after getting sacked by Chelsea, but Yakin's contract with Basel runs out next year, and he'll be a hot commodity. It'll be a huge jump for sure. After all, Basel dominates the Swiss League since he's arrived. I suppose that's the one risk, his lack of preparation for a role like Tottenham, a club that's punched above its weight recently and are making consistent CL spot threats. The situation with Yakin coming in would be pretty different from AVB's 2013-2014 tenure. The club bought about 10-12 players (off the top of my head, feel free to correct me), and now we have a vague idea of who are starters and who have yet to find form. With that said, Yakin would be inheriting a settled team, with hopefully a dressing rom leader. His job, unlike AVB or Sherwood's, would be to use the ""Vague XI"" to its full strength rather than putting players out of position , experimenting week to week with players like in AVN's system. Without all the pressure of mounting a top 4 challenge, Yakin's job would be a matter of consistency and man management. Unfortunately for him, to dare is to do. I'd be very excited if we got LvG, Bielsa (he's the true dark horse in thus) or Yakin. Very good thing that the focus is more on mangers who resemble our playing style rather than the talk of Capello, favoring practicality over style. LvG would be a mix of both, but if we're going to threaten in the PL with no oil money, then we need an up and coming manager who Lwvy won't fire when he can't deliver in the first season.

That's why I said it makes no sense.

I'll humour your other points, too ...
&gt;It was clear from day one that Bent was not in Lambert's plans.

Yes, because manager's frequently name players captain when they don't intend to play them.

&gt;how many of those 23 games he came off the bench for the last 5/10 minutes

Considering 12 of those appearances were starts... I'm seeing a fundamental flaw in your logic here already.
&gt;Even still, he scored and he looked lively. 

Not really. ""Looked lively"" is a cliche commentator phrase that holds no real meaning. Emile Heskey pretty much always looked lively.

Bent is an 18-yard striker, and possesses practically no hold-up ability. He generally relies on receiving the ball in close proximity to goal. This requires good service from midfield, which we did not (and still do not) have. In his entire premier league career, he has less than 20 assists. Process that for a second.

Without service and support, Bent was isolated and largely ineffective. Combined with the reactive counterattacking system Lambert installed, this is why he was dropped.

I like Darren Bent as much as the next guy, but it was abundantly clear that he was not the answer once we'd basically gutted our midfield, and there was no selfless hold up man (i.e. Heskey) there to create chances for him and make him look good.

I can go and find exact numbers of minutes for each match (they're on soccerbase) if you really want, but I doubt it will help your point much. I can tell you now that he played 815 minutes in the Premier League last season, scoring 3 goals. This season he's on 733 minutes and 2 goals (having played 70+ minutes on seven occasions, btw).

As for the slight lack of confidence regarding bigger roads, so long as you tell someone you're not all that used to bigger roads and group riding, you shouldn't have any issues, so long as you don't do anything massively stupid like suddenly stop for no reason.

WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSHIT. Have they conducted the same studies with Sativex as they have young kids who apparently developed schizophrenia due to smoking from a young age? No of course they fucking haven't. There is no way they can make such a ridiculous fucking claim without many years of comparative studies amongst the same type of users.

Sativex is basically just a pharmaceutical grade tincture. That is they take the dried plants and soak them in something to extract all the contents. If you go on the medical cannabis forums people report that it's basically just like eating a strong space cake and it's compared to the tinctures people make themselves at home.

true,codeduck,southafrica,Saffer at large,"The UK has no need to get involved in territorial disputes half-way around the globe.  That time ended in the 1950's when America took over the role of global policeman.  The UK needs to invest in technology to defend its real areas of influence - the North Atlantic, North Sea, Western Europe and the Arctic Circle.

This means fast, powerful destroyers, frigates and guided missile cruisers for the surface fleet, with maybe a few auxiliary aircraft carriers flying attack helicopters and / or STOL strike fighters, and a large, modern fleet of SSNs, with a reserve of SSBNs to maintain a nuclear deterrent. 

A submarine fleet is far more effective than a surface navy - ships are targets, subs are threats.  Use the savings from the carriers to equip more land-based squadrons with Eurofighters, Tornados and long range maritime patrol aircraft. 

Finall, cancel the purchase of the F-35. The Eurofighter is already a proven platform, and without the carriers there is no need for the F-35 and the money sink that it is.  If the RN absolutely has to have fighters, the Dassalt Rafale is another proven airframe which can take off from ski-ramps with no modifications.

But the other problem, if you've only got 9 terms, you've got a hell of a lot of stuff to cram in.  No word of a lie, I could happily fill a year long module on just the north american onion market, volatility and effect of derivatives trading on it.  Given that most people dismiss Marx completely (ie labour time is completely interchangeable etc.)  I don't think it is surprising that he fills so little of the syllabus.

I always have to mention this Churchill quote:
&gt;If you put two economists in a room, you get two opinions, unless one of them is Lord Keynes, in which case you get three opinions.

Considering this it is hardly surprising that Marxist economic ideas get so little time, they are not particularly complicated.  But it has to be said there is a cult around the man, which was my point about the grave yard.  Adam Smith for instance (who has inarguably had more of an influence) doesn't have a morbid fan club.

RE ECHR

&gt; What is special about the UK as a country?

It is a sovereign nation, the other territories you've listed aren't. If you want me to go into why that is an appropriate unit of governance then I think we will be wasting a lot of time no?

&gt; Why does it matter? How does justice vary on location? If the ECtHR was based in London (or Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast) would that settle the problems these conservatives have?

The problems - specifically with the ECHR - are that no it is not as simple to say that the UK has ultimate say. There are literally hundreds of thousands of asylum cases that are clogging up the court that are preventing various nations for exercising what they deem to be their desires in how to deal with them for example - it is hindering the normal process of domestic justice.  

This guys is pointing out some problems where rulings are encroaching on domestic laws: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7982785.stm

as is the Belgian President http://strasbourgobservers.com/2010/05/17/president-of-belgian-constitutional-court-criticizes-european-court-of-human-rights/

To say there are no problems is nonsense.

Marxian analysis is very - some might say too - mechanical.

Most people are fools then, especially in the light of the (not so) recent crisis, which Marxist economists were far better placed to explain, and several of whom predicted, whilst neoclassical and other mainstream economists were left floundering around, caught by surprise and without any theories to explain it adequately.  It brought back Marx with a vengeance, and it was funny to hear about so many economists reading him for the first time to try and get a handle on what was happening.

I don't mind this.

I use my broadband connection for work, I have an older version of one of their packages, it has improved support response time (having to failback to 3G is sometimes not useful depending on the work I'm doing).

I don't want to be pirating xyz I am not too worried about use of iPlayer.

I absolutely request and demand that I get some access to any servers I need to.  If I need to whip over a new image (often say 5gb) I want that to be going at 20mbits.

I don't mind paying up front for that.

Back when iPlayer first came out, I was with Be* and my internet speed noticeably tanked around after school time.

I've got my 80down 20up connection, I am not using it all the time, so I don't want to pay so much as if I was, but I don't want to be sharing it with someone who is using it all the time as they try and pirate the world, run a TOR node or whatever.

Now the QoS appears to be much, much better, it's less of an issue.  I really rate the zen FTTC I'm on as I get no appreciable slow down at any time of the day.  But I can understand why ISPs want to stop people using a residential connection as a server hosting type thing (that includes very busy P2P traffic).

I also see the benefits of this.  I pay £5.50 a month for my granny to have broadband.  It has a 10GB a month usage limit.  This is fine because she uses it just for short skype sessions with her great grand children who live down under.  It also means that if I am there one Sunday a month I can do some work if need be.

I was saying that if Farage won he would most likely deport EU nationals from UK (as his manifesto point suggests), meaning this would be a kind of a racism behaviour as he specifically targets a certain group (EU nationals) without taking into account ANY defensive grounds, for example fact that those immigrants could have established in UK fully and at this point legally.

Some other guy, whom I refused to discuss said ""it is a privilege"" to live in UK and if Uk suddenly changes rules because of some nationalist moron like Farage, then so be it, deport all EU nationals who have settled here legally.

Do you still think it's OK and cannot be put under racism behaviour?

P.S. I know I may be going a bit too far as racism is generally about particular race and EU nationals are not really a race... however looking from the context even an academic would admit that is some form of racism as UK (no longer being within EU) would discriminate EU nationals, solely on the fact of their countries of origin.",0,1389868773,null,0,false,0,ceqy1hy,t3_1v6l9l,t1_ceqy1hy,t1_ceqxvhj,null,1431966283,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That is academia.  There is almost a heard mentality around peer reviewed submissions.  We need look no further than the royal society for a, what is today, almost unbelievable bloody mindedness around Newtonian physics being the full complete answer.  It is difficult, you don't want to spend time bothering to learn about homoeopathy to dissmiss it as utter bullshit (yet many bang on about it), yet at the same time you don't want to ignore the fact that Einstein got it more right than it was before.

&gt;which Marxist economists were far better placed to explain

Got a link for that?

&gt;whilst neoclassical and other mainstream economists were left floundering around, caught by surprise and without any theories to explain it adequately

Plenty were not!  The problem was the lack of any consensus on what to do.  Everyone blamed the problem on a breakdown of trust, caused by a lack of modelling of correlated risk.  I think everyone excepted that explanation.

You think you've a perfectly hedged product, because you assume that if Bear Sterns goes bust, your AIG CDS will provide protection for that contract.  The problem is the model doesn't capture the inherent correlated risk.

I've not heard any 'better' explanation.  But obviously that might just be because of the bubble of a heard mentality.

&gt;Really? Have you read Capital?

It was a side note on a course I took, I skimmed the SparkNotes.  It didn't really make me interested in his ideas, because I think of economics as a branch of maths, the same way physics has no morals, economics doesn't either.  But then again I was being *trained* I guess in economics, rather than educated.  I had a background in engineering, computer science and systems identification as far as uni education went.

That's half the problem in the United States; people overreacting and blowing someones head of in 'self defense' because of a heated argument.

The main problem for me is that you are creating a problem where there is none. Despite what the media wants you to believe, it's extremely unlikely that you are ever going to be in a situation where you need a gun. I would feel ridiculously unsafe if I knew anyone could have a gun down their trousers for 'self defense'. I fell like it would be mainly the assholes who cause most of the problems would be the ones buying the guns to give themselves authority.

My parents split up in 2000 when I was 10, and were divorced in 2003. My mother, my brother and I moved 70 miles up North when she met her new partner, and my Dad moved up as well, despite his career as a relatively high-ranking police officer in the Met. My dad *broke his fucking back* keeping his career going, commuting up to 160 miles a day for over a decade and did every possible thing he could to support my brother and I. He never took a single penny out of the state, and now he is being lumped in to the typical Tory bracketing as a 'dysfunctional separated parent' who needs to be judged and ostracised.

My dad was a model of a hard-working, morally correct man. He was heartbroken when my mother and him split up, and coupled with the stresses he endured in his job and the fact that he never did get over my mum, he took to drink. He was a hard-working policeman who gave everything to that job for the sake of a better country. He was commended for taking down a post office robber armed with a loaded gun on his own. He worked horrible cases including homicides, rapes, and everything in-between so this man can get up on his little stool and shout about how dysfunctional families should be frowned upon. 

Fuck the fuck off, you uppity, self-righteous fucking thunder-cunt.

I think a major reason is that people see the 'failures' of USSR/Chinese/Vietnamese/Cambodia 'communism', with their massive State bureaucracies and central planning, and assume this is a reflection on Marxism, rather than on Leninism/Stalinism/Maoism/Primitivism.  Then they look at the 'successes' of 'capitalism' and assume that this reflects on the imaginary capitalism taught in economics departments, rather than a basically Marxian analysis of 'real world' capitalism more similar to what is taught in business studies departments.  Indeed, when capitalists try to run businesses as if imaginary capitalism were how things really are, [those businesses fail spectacularly](http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/07/sears-worst-retailer-company-america/).

&gt; I think of economics as a branch of maths

I tend to think maths is overrated as a method of modelling human economic behaviour, and I'm basically dismissive of homo-economicus as an outright lie.  If you look at genuine sciences, each builds on the last - the tools of maths lie at the core, on which is built physics, then chemistry, then biology, then psychology.  Economics should really be built on psychology, instead it attempts to supplant physics as the queen of sciences, going direct to mathematical models, which is patently an arrogant nonsense and completely ignores how humans, in fact, behave.

To quote economist Mark Blaug: ""Think of the following typical assumptions: perfectly infallible, utterly omniscient, infinitely long-lived identical consumers; zero transaction costs; complete markets for all time-stated claims for all conceivable events, no trading of any kind at disequilibrium prices; infinitely rapid velocities of prices and quantities; no radical, incalculable uncertainty in real time but only probabilistically calculable risk in logical time; only linearly homogeneous production functions; no technical progress requiring embodied capital investment, and so on, and so on -- all these are not just unrealistic but also unrobust assumptions. And yet they figure critically in leading economic theories.""

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; [The UK] is a sovereign nation, the other territories you've listed aren't.

And it has been since something like 1922, and might not be for much longer. Saying the UK is special because it is sovereign falls into the ""arbitrary historical boundaries"" category I mentioned above. And you seem to have skipped over the other first point I made, which I thought was the strongest.

&gt; The problems - specifically with the ECHR - are that no it is not as simple to say that the UK has ultimate say.

But that was the argument that was made earlier.

We started with ""[Conservatives] [don't want to pay for a whacky EU parliament and spend all year long debating with various courts in the EU what the exact definition of human rights is](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1v9hgc/george_osborne_lays_down_ultimatum_reform_eu_or/ceq1llp)"" and I pointed out those arguments were pretty silly. The latter, in particular, is nonsense as the EU courts tend not to deal with human rights issues. I've responded to your points on the first in another thread.

So then it becomes ""[what people want is the decision of human rights to be made in the UK](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1v9hgc/george_osborne_lays_down_ultimatum_reform_eu_or/ceq3882)"", so I put forward arguments against that, explaining why it is fairly silly, although I concede that we're still on that point.

Then we get ""[I think the outcome that is desired is not to have to invoke parliament to make final rulings on cases, but be able to trust a UK court as the final arbiter](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1v9hgc/george_osborne_lays_down_ultimatum_reform_eu_or/ceq63x7)"", and so I discuss that, point out that it is already the case.

And now you're saying that that isn't really the problem. Do you see what I mean about justifications v actual reasons? You've put forward 3 arguments, at least 2 of which I'm pretty confident I've dismissed, and each time I've done so you've come up with another one from a different angle. But anyway, onto this new one:

----------

&gt;  There are literally hundreds of thousands of asylum cases that are clogging up the court that are preventing various nations for exercising what they deem to be their desires in how to deal with them

Firstly, based on [this document](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Stats_analysis_2012_ENG.pdf), there were 128,100 cases bending before the ECtHR at the end of 2012, of which 3,300 relate to the UK. By the end of November 2013, those numbers [were down](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Stats_pending_month_2013_BIL.pdf) to 102,750 and 2,650 respectively. I can't easily find data on the subject of those cases, but I find it unlikely that even 100,000, or 97% of the cases, relate to asylum. Particularly given that I think 2,000 of those applications are the UK prisoner voting ones that were stayed pending the decision of the UKSC in the Chester case.

[This document](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Stats_violation_2012_ENG.pdf) lists the 2012 violations of the ECHR by state and by article. Of the 899 violations found, 87 (about 10%) related to Article 8 (often used for asylum cases), the bulk (80%) being Article 5 and 6 cases. Of course, that is far from conclusive, but suggests that it is likely fewer than 97% of the applications relate to asylum.

As for it creating a problem because these cases ""prevent nations from exercising their desire in how to deal with them"", firstly the ECtHR can't stop a country from doing something. At most it can award compensation for breaches and make loud noises (as we've seen in the prisoner voting cases in the UK). That said, telling nations how [not] to deal with things is precisely what the ECtHR is for; it is there to let national government's know when, in the opinion of the ECtHR, they aren't treating people within their power humanely. And they do a pretty good job of it; in the vast majority of cases against the UK Government, the Government has accepted the ECtHR's decision and fixed stuff, with the changes being accepted.

The Lord Hoffmann comments, according to that article, seem to be based on the ECtHR laying down the same rules for different countries, which seems an odd complaint to me. I might try to find his entire speech and have a read of it.

Marc Bossuyt is not the Belgian President, but was (is?) the Dutch-speaking President of the Belgian Constitutional Court. His quotes seem to come up again and again in these sorts of discussions. Most of what he is saying seems to relate to asylum cases, and changes in numbers (which are taken out of context). I'm also a bit suspicious of his fact-based claims:

&gt;  [Lord Hoffmann] referred to the judgment in Hatton against his own country, in which the Court held – with a mere reference to the right to private life of art. 8 – that in the end judges should be able to decide where an airport will be located and which flying routes should be used at London Heathrow.

Now I haven't read Lord Hoffmann's speech in full, but I have looked through both the judgments in the [Hutton case](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2003/338.html), and the ECtHR didn't say anything like that quoted. The Chamber found there was a violation of Article 8 mainly because the UK Government hadn't done a proper assessment in coming up with their policy for night flights (so nothing about saying it was the Court's job to decide where to put the airport). The Grand Chamber disagreed, finding that the issue was a complex one covering environmental policies and what-not, and thus the Government's actions fell within the margin of appreciation. However, they still found that there was a violation of Article 13 as, while the applicants lost the main part of their case, had they won, they would still have had no appropriate domestic remedy. Not that they were awarded any compensation/damages for it...

Given that at least one of his comments is factually questionable, I'm reluctant to take all the others at face value.

&gt; To say there are no problems is nonsense. 

Which is true, and why few people would say that. You've raised a number of issue, what I've said is that these ones aren't, imho, problems. And the ECHR is trying to deal with these problems - on the large number of applications, the CoE recently amended the treaty to put in place a more efficient way of handling cases, which may be partly what has led to the reduction over the last couple of years. The ECHR is evolving to cover the problems it faces, as it should.",0,1389873663,null,0,false,0,ceqysmo,t3_1v9hgc,t1_ceqysmo,t1_ceqxrse,null,1431966608,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Can anyone explain it to me a bit better? I understand Cortese and Pochettino have both been instrumental figures in taking the club into the top half of the premier league. I understand how gutting it must be to see them go after they seemed to be taking Southampton to a higher level. 


What I don't really understand is that I've seen a lot of Southampton fans saying this could be the start of a serious decline. You've still got a very good squad with a lot of assets and a strong infrastructure. If Liebherr was to sell the club to someone half decent, I'm sure there would be top managers queuing up to work for you.

Institutions like the police and the courts seem to deal more harshly with ethnic minorities.  For example the news earlier this year that black offenders receive harsher sentences than whites.

Fewer ethnic minority students attend higher education, and in general perform more poorly than white students.  While a lot of this can be accounted for by socioeconomic differences (after all, whites are generally wealthier than non-whites), not all of it can (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RTP01-03MIG1734.pdf).

I'd expect there to be similar stories for health issues and all sorts of other things.  And, similarly, look at the makeup of most mainstream media commentators and politicians.  4% of MPs are from ethnic minorities vs around 13% of the population.  I only ever see under-representation, not over-representation.

So, I think it's a bit off to say we're not racist.

People in emotional states (i.e. ones who have had their whole families murdered) obviously make different choices to ones thinking from a logical standpoint, that doesn't make it the correct or morally right decision.

For one thing, you are operating from the assumption of guilt of the person. The fact is that often in any investigation there are several suspects, any number of which might be red herrings. The issue is that very often the police (both here and in the US) are charted more on convictions then they are on catching the right or wrong person.

Lets go for a example. Say you have a burglary, the homeowner wasn't present, and your evidence is mostly circumstantial. You have two suspects, lets call them A and B. A is a pretty upstanding fellow, but there were witnesses of him being in the apartment block (where he doesn't live) around the time when the burglary is thought to have occurred. B has had trouble with the police before, and the apartment block is one of his old haunts, but he has a decent alibi, and he's gone around the merry go round enough that he gives some non-commital and un-compromising answers to the police's questions. They pull in A for questioning and hes nervous (its his first time being questioned) and hes obviously hiding something. At one point he clams up and refuses to answer anymore. With what they've got, A is a much clearer suspect and the witness reports make him a much more likely conviction, even though B has a past record.

The thing is, A was having a affair, and was in the apartment block visiting his mistress. The reason he was nervous and was hiding something was that he didn't want to ruin his marriage, not to mention that he had no experience with being questioned.

No problem, thanks for responding.


Firstly,

&gt;As an aside, I'm a little frustrated at how hard it is to actually get any solid information on this. You have both sides taking the same piece of vague information and claiming that it clearly shows their diametrically opposed views are right. The lack of transparency and honesty is appalling.

Agreed. Only the UK can ask the EU for clarity but they will not. This is important to remember, because everything that is said by outside parties is only speculation. Often it is presented as fact, and it is not. As you say about Barroso's comments,

&gt; Interestingly when he said it it was heavily reported. When it was reported that he was just making crap up; not so much.

His quote has appeared *everywhere* in relation to Scotland independence and most (my guess 90%) of the media has presented it as a negative fact at one stage or another. Do a Google search on ""scotland europe independence"" and see how many positive stories there are on the first page. Excluding wikipedia entries, I found zero. 

Should we take it then that Scotland will be kicked out of Europe? No, because only the EU can answer it and only the UK can ask them to do so.

Regarding the legal side of things, [I found that this short presentation to the Foreign Affairs select committee to seem plausible](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm). With regard to the comments made by Barroso, Van Roumpuy or Rajoy, they all assume that Scotland starts as an outside-the-EU country, however that isn't correct. The Select Committee guy says at point 8

&gt; From the political point of view, Scotland has been in the EU for 40 years; and its people have acquired rights as European citizens. If they wish to remain in the EU, they could hardly be asked to leave and then reapply for membership in the same way as the people of a non-member country such as Turkey. The point can be illustrated by considering another example: if a break-up of Belgium were agreed between Wallonia and Flanders, it is inconceivable that other EU members would require 11 million people to leave the EU and then reapply for membership. 

Those comments were made in September 2012 - it is inconceivable that media people are unaware of them, yet these ideas are never presented to their viewers or readers.


You say
&gt;There's an additional problem in that at various stages a number of representatives of member states have pushed the same line as Barroso.

Don't forget, though, that what a politician says isn't always true! Also, comments are being made to placate Spain who have not even agreed that Catalonia has a right to independence. If Scotland did vote Yes, why would other countries make problems after? Spain wouldn't have any need to bad mouth Scotland, so why would they go out of their way to cause problems? I agree there would be a need to negotiate things, but as the select committee guy says from point 12 onwards

&gt;12. Let us return to the question of the changes in EU legislation necessary for Scottish membership. We need to distinguish here between changes in the EU Treaties (primary legislation) and changes in EU regulations, directives, decisions etc. (secondary legislation). The changes in the basic Treaties for institutional reasons should not be problematic: for Scotland they could easily be calculated by reference to member states of comparable size (Denmark, Finland &amp; Slovakia have populations of 5-6 million). The number of votes in the Council for the remainder of the United Kingdom would not need to be adjusted (with 60 million it would still be comparable to France &amp; Italy) although its members of Parliament might need to be reduced in number in order to respect the Parliament’s limit of members.

&gt;13. In accession negotiations with non-member countries the EU has always strongly resisted other changes or opt-outs from the basic Treaties; at this stage it remains to be seen what might be requested by Scottish representatives concerning the euro or the Schengen area of free movement of persons. Without embarking here on a discussion of the implications for Scotland of these policies, we may note that although new member states are required to accept them in principle, they do not become members of the eurozone or Schengen immediately on accession, and are not permitted to do so. Joining the euro or Schengen depends on a series of criteria that are examined in the years following accession.

&gt;14. Let us turn now to the secondary legislation. Although a large number of technical adaptations would be needed in order for Scotland to implement EU law, the vast majority of these would be uncontroversial since they would be based on the existing situation. In respect of EU policies and legislation, Scotland’s citizens have a legitimate expectation of the maintenance of the status quo in terms of economic and social conditions. There should be no need, for example, to re-negotiate Scotland’s application of European policies in fields such as environment; transport, agriculture, etc.: it would suffice to transpose mutatis mutandis the situation that already exists for Scotland within the U.K. Since the rest of the U.K. could be affected, that process would require discussion and clarification with London, but it would have little interest for other member states who would be content to consider the question of secondary legislation on the basis of a report and proposals from the Commission.

&gt;15. Here again, it remains to be seen whether Scottish representatives would request changes in the application of EU rules and policies, for example the fisheries policy or payments into the EU budget. In general one would expect these matters to be solved on a temporary basis by means of a roll-over mutatis mutandis of existing arrangements for the U.K. until the relevant EU rules come up for revision, for example the renegotiation of fishing quotas, or the multi-annual budgetary framework. Such solutions would, in fact, be in Scotland’s interest since it could expect to obtain a better deal as a member state with a full voice and vote in the EU than in the pre-independence period. However, the adaptation of the British budgetary rebate could require difficult negotiations between Edinburgh and London as well as with Brussels.

{sorry for the bullet point numbering incorrectly, it automatically starts at 1 when it should start at 12}

This isn't fact - only the EU can give a factual answer and only the UK can ask them for one - but it seems plausible to me, more so than the bullshit stories that occur on a weekly basis in the media.

I guess he/she is assuming that, due the difference in  skilled workers between the Romanians and the middle class in the UK, they would end up being recruited for lower-wage jobs.

However, the point of choosing between dealing with cultures that are extremely different and cultures that are more similar is something that should be taken into consideration. I do think the degree of heated response that a lot of UK ""natives"" have to immigrants is way, way out of proportion to the actual amount of resentment that immigrants have towards western culture and ideals. I would love it if everyone in the UK could be fully tolerant and accepting of people from other cultures and have a truly cosmopolitan society. Still, as a politician I would have to take into account the response of the public into my immigration policies - which has not been the ideal one.

The situations aren't comparable. Cardiff is the capital of Wales and gets treatment for the whole area similar to what London gets for the UK.

Cardiff does have one advantage. The WAG has oversight on planning in Wales. Essentially people got fed up with councils being petty so the WAG can veto a council. This lets Cardiff do big projects more quickly in all likelihood.

You won't have to pay us a penny for this, so you really do get to see £65 out of every £65 ticket we sell. We make our money by charging fees to the customer.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; I don't know if this has been raised in this sub before, it most likely has. But this morning I bought tickets for the NFL International Series in Wembley, now all of the international series ticket sales are being handled by ticketmaster, which by definition, gives them a monopoly.

It gives them a monopoly over sales for that particular series, but if the definition is narrow enough near enough every company has a monopoly over something. Starbucks has a monopoly on Frappucinos, but they must also compete with similar products from other coffee companies. Ticketmaster has a monopoly on tickets for that particular NFL series, but they don't have a monopoly on tickets for other sporting events, nor do they have a monopoly on entertainment sales in general. Consumers have the option to spend their money on any number of other entertainment products, either in the form of live events or home entertainment, which are all competitors of Ticketmaster by this definition.

The ""service charge"" may be interpreted as a marketing gimmick, in much the way prices are displayed as £8.99 as opposed to £9, or advertised without VAT. Clearly this hasn't fooled you, and you are aware that the actual price for a ticket is effectively £70.85. This price is not conjured out of thin air. There are a limited number of tickets available, and there are set production costs to put on an event like this, both of which influence what price Ticketmaster can set. What is more, because Ticketmaster is effectively competing within a larger entertainment industry they cannot charge more than people are willing to pay, otherwise they will sell fewer tickets and the event will not be profitable.

The only question you have to ask yourself is whether the tickets are worth more to you than £70.85 each. If the answer is yes, the trade is worth your while. If the answer is no then it isn't, and you are perfectly entitled to walk away and spend your money on other entertainment.

It's actually fairly simple psychology. A person finds themselves in a place where they are forced to interact with people they already even subconsciously know are different even in a slight way and more is expected of them etc it builds and builds and they start to resent it and every little thing that happens compounds this. It's seen extensively in prisons and is more evident in times of war and how people can be treated due to barely existent reasons.

The reason you can be horrified is because you've never found yourself in a situation like that with human beings. 

Besides the managers probably didn't realise the extent of it since they would most likely get through with just hearing reports etc.

In this case - that law was supposed to be about catching terrorists. As it turns out, from the end of the article...

&gt; Police accessed the memory stick and found it contained information relating to the ongoing inquiry into alleged fraud - but nothing relating to terrorism or national security. 

That doesn't state that the information proved him guilty - ""information relating to the ongoing inquiry"" could be evidence of his innocence, especially considering he did give the password. But he was jailed under a law supposedly relating to terrorism and it has been subsequently proven that the pretext was false - refusing to reveal the password wasn't done to hide evidence of terrorism as there was no terrorism or national-security related information to reveal.

So it seems he was jailed not for fraud, but for presumably hiding information relating to a fraud. How many MPs and company directors have hidden information about fraud?

Are you trying to imply that BT should void their contract with Sky to facilitate you?

In terms of the tech world, it's not uncommon for companies to have Service Providers through rival companies; as a part of their contract BT will have to guarantee Sky ""X"" amount of engineers so they can finalise their own jobs and it doesn't cause bad competition between the two companies. 

While these Engineers work for BT, they will work within a Client Service team which has the primary responsibility of dealing with Sky's jobs where Sky can't address them themselves.

Firstly. The last time we suffered major upheaval we got our best finish of the season under Gordon Strachan coming 8th in the table. He quit, Lowe screwed the club and we nearly had to liquidate the club.

Then you have this situation which is very similar. 

Now Markus and Nicola came in, bought the club and installed a new philosophy. Made it a functioning business and set out a 5 year plan. We should be in year 4 of that plan if I managed to not screw up. 

The reasons for success are Nicola's planning and very very specific care and attention. This in addition to the money spent and the people brought in. The club is a mountain from a mound and it had Nicola's name through the core.

Add to that, that Pochettino is here under Nicola's influence. Has us performing better than every before and has in conjunction with Nicola has brought in players. This man has said he'll leave with the Chairman only 6months ago.

On top of that if they both go we lose our squad. Just look at the BBC's gossip column. 

Shaw, Lallana, Lambert, Schniederlin, Lovren, Roridguez all being talked about leaving the club. You could easily add Osvaldo to that list and you're looking at a gutted and filleted club.

Now that in itself is a bad thing, because chopping and changing managers is always a problem. The reason a lot of people don't like that Cortese has left, is because he was the one that was there when the original plans were laid down with Markus Leibherr, so we can at least think that he wants the club to move forward. Katherina Leibherr is a bit of an unknown to most people, we don't know what she'll want from the club, might even be to sell it, but maybe sell off all our assets first?


Key to it all is we've been through owner &amp; manager drama before, we were been a selling club through most of our previous PL history, all 15 years of it we were basically in or around a relegation battle, and as you're becoming a bit more familiar with, it's not nice. Now do it for 15 years. We don't want to watch the club go from something that could have been an up and coming PL team, a possible European contender, to another relegation dog fight season after season. 


Sure, others might come in and see it as an attractive place to work or buy, but what about the players? Players that are currently in form and being noticed. What if the manager that got them into this form, this playing style that wins all the plaudits, that believes in them and the club, decides to leave? What then? Our best players might look elsewhere, our young and talented squad might have to be supplemented with players who don't fit our philosophy, which in itself might change.


We've all been here before, and last time we were relegated. Twice. And dropped to the relegation zone in league one too, before the miracle worker that was Adkins was brought in. Yes, there's lots of infrastructure set up, youth and facilities etc, that can keep the club afloat, but if the next chairman or owners that come in and don't care too much about furthering the club, just think they can make a profit from sales of our talent, then suddenly we'll go from a promising squad to a squad that can is OK, to one that might struggle, then we won't be as attractive a prospect for a new manager, we won't be playing some lovely attacking football, and we will be at risk of becoming the Southampton of old, and no-one wants that.

But Pochettino is, he played under Bielsa at Newell's and has adopted a slightly less idealistic version of Bielsa's way of playing. And he's had solid Premiere League success with Southampton which I think counts for more relevancy than the Swiss league. Part of Southampton's slip since the start of the season can be put down to squad depth, the Achilles heal of Bielsista systems, and that would be less of a problem with Spurs current squad.

He betrayed the excellent Matt Smith with unworthy writing, he betrays every single female actress by being unable to write a compelling woman character, or any female character for that matter but a one-trick-foil for the Doctor. Anyone who watched the Christmas special was no doubt similarly disgusted by how, despite being repeatedly lied to, neglected and abandoned, over and over, over the course of a single episode, Clara evidenced no real emotion of her own and was just happy to see the Doctor off.

Moffat is good at two things - ambience, and writing scenes/dialogue. He cannot write women, he cannot write characters of any particularly great depth in general, he cannot write storylines. His ability to cohere a narrative is somewhere south of that of the kids I've seen in undergraduate Creative Writing courses. I think he is aware of his own weaknesses, though, because he relies so heavily on ambience and on scene-writing. He doesn't even try to put together a story that makes remote sense anymore.

The man cannot write, he has not the full toolkit necessary to call yourself a capable and competent writer. You cannot get by on just a few talents when the things you're bad at are so glaring and important. In every show I've seen him involved in, his horrible writing is carried by strong acting, a moving soundtrack, and the hard work of the rest of the production team. That's the only reason someone as atrociously unfit as him is even working at his level - he's the George Lucas of television.

But even so, the BBC is considering dropping him from Who because his plots literally make no sense, and, thank God, Peter Capaldi, the new Doctor, is calling him out on his shitty scripts.

If I were religious, I'd expect the right to a meeting room, but not necessarily a church with a tower with bell-ringing practice on Sunday afternoons. By allowing all requests we are creating hubs instead of encouraging dispersal which would cause integration and enrichment of our society and it leaves the resident population feeling marginalised when a temple springs up and they can't get planning permission for their potting shed (please excuse the exaggeration).

A friend reading Music at uni once told me that you can identify the country of origin of most music by stylistic features. What sets English music apart is that nothing sets it apart. We've been occupied by basically everyone going and so lost our own music and have an amalgam of everyone else's. I think the same thing is true of culture (some evidence is that we don't have our own folklore). This explains why we are so willing to others bring their cultures in wholesale without requiring them to be tempered to fit in with ours since the definition of our culture is basically fitting in with whoever turns up.

I remember going of foreign exchange trips as a kid. We were twinned with the most adorable family (funnily enough the only black family in the community and the dad was convinced that all English were racist. We changed his mind to ""all the English are racist, except us!"" That was as far as he was willing to go!) but they spoke really good English. I learned nothing. It was too easy to speak English and they were too accommodating. I wanted to learn French, but the easy option was always there. I think it's a similar story on a bigger scale with immigration. 

I genuinely don't know if the Americans have got things better or worse. Their pre-fixes are very ingrained: African-American, Italian-American, Irish-American. Generally marriages go within those groups, especially within the Jewish community. Then there's the racism with Whites feeling superior and Blacks complaining about racism while doing the exact same things to the Hispanics. 

edit: So on one hand the Americans do seem to divide themselves strongly along lines of origin, but on the other, they all strongly identify themselves as American. The useful thing about American culture is that while superficial, it is very accessible with their daily pledge and penchant for flag-waving. That provides excellent common ground. Compare that to English culture. The definition of our culture is basically being reserved and understated! Our most common and inclusive national past time is forming orderly queues and probably not talking within them! How can an immigrant feel part of us when our expression of ourselves to not to express ourselves?!

When they needed qualified people, we were perfect for the job. And I heard this over and over, how Romanians work hard, adapt, speak the language, how we're polite and ambitious all that. 

But now that poor people (shock and horror) can come and work in unskilled, low-paid jobs, Romanians (and Bulgarians) are scum of the earth. We were great for the white collar jobs, but when we want to come and clean toilets or wash cars, we're not so good anymore. And I don't think I've ever heard of a country in the EU that you can go to, go ""Give me benefits"" and they will, without asking questions.",0,1389882086,null,0,false,0,cer0pi7,t3_1v9rnn,t1_cer0pi7,t1_ceq88xa,null,1431967590,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

In Toronto you still have an Italian neighborhood, Portuguese, Jamaican, Chinatown, Russian, Orthodox Jewish, Ethiopian, etc. While there is a sense of exclusion to an extent amongst these neighbourhoods, they still integrate a lot better than what I've noticed back in the UK mainly due to the fact that it's been the norm since confederation.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"Insider trading. The NSA/GCHQ doesn't just read your emails, it reads the emails of major corporations as well. It can use this information to manipulate the market to earn millions or even billions of dollars, on top of its tax support. It can also use this information to manipulate the market to destroy companies, for instance a company that supports legislation restricting government surveillance, might suddenly find its stock shorted, killing its share value and losing it millions of dollars.

Degradation of internet security. The NSA and GCHQ &amp; Co don't just monitor your emails. They also deliberately weaken security protocols, such as encryption and firewall software, to make it easier for them to penetrate. These are called ""Back Doors"". The idea is that ""Good Guy GCHQ"" can use the back door to get around your security, in case they think you're a bad guy. The problem is that these back doors can potentially be used by others, for instance malicious hackers or foreign powers, if they figure out how they work. The NSA, in its quest to make its job easier, makes the internet less secure for everyone.

Algorithmic threat analysis. The NSA doesn't have an army of people reading your emails. That would be absurd. No, they use computer algorithms to correlate petabytes of data from hundreds of sources, to try to find people plotting attacks. The problem is that these algorithms do not have 3rd party oversight and testing to make sure that they actually work. It is quite possible for algorithms to generate false positives--marking an innocent person as a potential terrorist--while missing dozens of actual threats. We have no idea how the NSA's algorithms work, and they refuse to open them up for auditing. If we can't verify that the algorithms work, how can we verify that the NSA is doing its job correctly and tagging threats that are actually threats?

Blackmail. The NSA/GCHQ probably don't care about you in particular. But they do care about the actions of politicians. If they have access to emails and browsing history, they can use compromising information to blackmail troublesome politicians into not opposing them. If the NSA gets a reputation for having accurate information about these things, then eventually they won't even need actual dirt. They can just claim they have information, or fabricate it, and people will believe it because it's the NSA and the NSA knows everything.

Political spying. This might not resonate as much with you, but in the US we had something called Watergate, where the President of the United States spied on his political opponents and used the information he got to counter their political campaigns. He did that using actual spies breaking into hotel rooms and planting bugs. How much easier it must be to do that now, when all you have to do is ask the NSA to give you access to your opponent's campaign planner's email and phone records.
You're a criminal. No matter how good a person you are and how law-abiding you think you are, odds are you break dozens of laws a year, through ignorance or ambivalence. If the GCHQ, for whatever reason, decided to fuck with you, they could quite easily find evidence of some law you've broken, and pass it on to authorities and pressure them to prosecute. For instance, if you distribute MIT library materials without explicit permission...

Suppression of dissidents. One of the most important aspects of democracy is the freedom of dissent, the freedom to disagree with government and push for it to change. In a surveillance state, the powers that be, and the surveillance organizations in particular, have a vested interest in preserving the status quo. If you are perceived as a threat, you will be harassed, threatened, possibly attacked legally. Much like Aaron Schwartz was, who was prosecuted for violating a meaningless law that the alleged victim asked the prosecutor not to prosecute. He was harassed and most likely spied on constantly, until he committed suicide. Dissidence successfully repressed.

Interference in other countries' politics. The CIA has always interfered in other nations' affairs, starting revolutions and supporting dictators. Imagine what it can do with the support of the NSA/GCHQ. Everything I've stated in 1-7 applies double for non-western, developing nations, where NSA surveillance makes their work in the US look like innocent child's play. One government's spy agencies should not have the power to direct the economies and governments of entire regions.

Degradation of privacy rights. The fact that the government spies on you constantly degrades your right to privacy in all spheres. The government tracks everything you do online? Well then it shouldn't be an issue if companies track you too. Your email and phone records aren't private? Well if they can be searched, why not your physical mail? You want the right to remain silent? Ok, but we're going to listen in to what you say to your lawyer. You say we need a warrant to enter your house? It's ok, we've already used your webcam to see inside, so we don't need it anyway. Giving up on such a fundamental part of privacy, as what you do online, weakens privacy rights in all areas.

Look at what's happened in the past. The breadth and power of the NSA &amp; Co's surveillance is greater than any other spy organization in history. The KGB, SS, or Stasi would cream themselves if they could have access to the NSA's abilities. And if we're out-bad-guying the bad guys, are we really still the good guys? What happens when (not if--when) a corrupt or totalitarian party gets into office? We already know that these powers are abused. Imagine what they could do if targeted not at brown people with beards half a world away, but at you, your family, your community. What happens when the ""War on Terror"" comes home?

Possible data breaches. What happens when the NSA's own security fails, and hackers or foreign agents gain access to all of that information? No security system is 100% secure, and the information the NSA holds is literally priceless to the right buyers. You may be fine with the US government having access to everything you do or say online. But how about the Russian government, or a hacker looking to sell choice info to the highest bidder? Trade secrets, possibly locations of people in Witness Protection, communication between government officials, the sordid details of the porn habits of a billion people, ripe for blackmail. What happens when that info is compromised? When a hacker finds a hole? Or, if the NSA can backdoor American companies without their knowledge, why couldn't China backdoor the NSA's network without them knowing?

Sanitation of government jobs. You can't get a job in the government if you're a terrorist or anarchist or otherwise anti-government. But what happens when a dossier can be built of you in mere moments using your accumulated lifetime of emails and phone calls, which lays your political beliefs clear? What happens if you are tagged as unsuitable for security clearance, based not on you being a potential threat, but simply on your having different political beliefs than the current administration; or worse yet, the NSA itself. This becomes doubly concerning with the NSA's increased scrutiny of its own employees, where in their search to prevent another Snowden, you can be sure that no one with a Libertarian streak will ever enter the agency. When everyone in government bureaucracy shares the same political beliefs, and the echo chamber effect ensues, the beliefs of the public at large become somewhat irrelevant.

true,michael2l,null,null,"I like Flanno, but the boy can't put in a cross with his left foot. He's done great but he's not our future LB.  He's gotten his chances to play because Enrique is injured and Cissoko has been poor. He's played above his level so far, but I prefer more experience in a defender since mistakes at that position are more costly.  He reads the game well for a young lad and needs to get playing time to improve, but LB is not going to be his future unless he develops a left foot. I was hoping we could get a fullback with two feet so that he could provide competition/depth for both positions.  Glen Johnson hasn't had to worry about his starting job for a while and it shows.

In terms of not needing more midfielders I disagree.  The idea that we just need to field the best starting 11 to win a game is flawed thinking.  Look at the teams ahead of us in the table and you will see every game they have multiple international players starting the game as subs.  This allows you to cope with injuries and gives a good coach like BR the opportunity to change tactics in the middle of the game.  And most importantly it produces competition.  When you know a quality player is on the bench dreaming about his chance to come on for you if you are playing poorly it puts a bit of extra drive and desire into every pass, tackle, etc.

Also, we need quality CDM's in BR's system where the Center backs split wide and full backs press high up the pitch as we play out of the back.  Against the tougher sides I'd like to see us play two in that role (or if we're defending a lead) to help clean up mistakes in the midfield which have cost us dreadfully.  Liverpool have the highest number of mistakes leading to goals in the league and an extra CDM when we are under pressure away from home could make all the difference in the world between a draw and three points.

I'm biased, but seriously, the guy is pretty much the greatest of all time. Heisman trophy as a redshirt freshman. Put up 543 yards against Alabama. etc. If A&amp;M had a defense, we'd have been in the national title discussion.

He also has an unfair reputation of being a party animal and a heavy drinker. Much of this is spun by the media and ESPN as  making him out to be a villain and a punk kid. I don't believe that he is anything but a winner and a competitor of the highest professional caliber. 

His move to declare for the NFL draft means he gets to have professional representation, and moving to sign with FSG means that the professional representation that he DOES have will in some way be tied into LFC as part of a worldwide marketing scheme. More importantly, to me and many other die-hard Texas A&amp;M fans, it means our greatest ever player will be managed by a group of people who not only know what they are doing, but seem like good folks with a good track record of honest business and hard work done the right way.

Precisely. It's frustrating for us to hear about it, but making wild comments like how does that person sleep at night is ridiculous. We're not in their shoes, it's easy for us to get outraged when we don't know what they have to deal with. When you get told to do things and fall into a pattern, it's easy to become so engrossed that you don't realise what it can appear like from the outside.

It exists in healthcare too, just look at the way some of the managers and matrons of nursing homes behave. Sometimes the care can be really shocking from an outsider's perspective, but if you speak to one of those matrons they may genuinely not see anything wrong with what they're doing. They may care passionately about the patients, but from a lack of money and resources, they became so used to doing what they do that it just feels normal to them.

When you're in a position like that you often try to distance yourself from each person. It may seem cold, but deep down you really do care, but you know that if you got too emotionally involved about every person you'd see it'd tear you to bits from the inside.

It has become abundantly clear that everything remarkable about the original Star Wars trilogy was done *in spite* of George Lucas, not because of him.  Joseph Campbell's narrative consulting, Irvin Kershner's directing, Harrison Ford's acting, the incredible work of the special effects team, these are the things that made Star Wars great.

Lucas is a notoriously poor director - this is common knowledge, acknowledged by the actors he's worked with repeatedly.  The extent of his on-set direction is ""EMOTE MORE"" and ""we'll fix it in editing.""

The reason the original trilogy was such elemental storytelling is Joseph Campbell, who - literally - wrote the book on how human beings tell stories.  He was gone in the prequel trilogy.

The reason the original trilogy had decent performances for the most part, is because Lucas didn't direct all but one of them.  He directed all of the prequels, and look at the ridiculous, cartoony performances you got from usually-top-tier actors like Samuel Jackson, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor.

Very pleased with the lad.  His passing was rather crabbish but he looked settled on the ball which is the most important thing.  Once he gets over his initial bout of nerves at being in the team then he'll do ok.  Out of position a little defensively but not by much and that's been quite picky.  It's worth noting that he wasn't playing in our standard formation either and did take the Garcia role of coming on for an extra body in midfield.

Delighted for the lad, I adore watching new Academy graduates debut and he did lots right and nothing wrong.  Hope to see him away at West Ham

Not only that, but they really try to shove emotion down your throat now. The Doctor going into exile because he lost Rory and Amy was just stupid.

true,Yazman,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;It has become abundantly clear that everything remarkable about the original Star Wars trilogy was done in spite of George Lucas, not because of him. Joseph Campbell's narrative consulting, Irvin Kershner's directing, Harrison Ford's acting, the incredible work of the special effects team, these are the things that made Star Wars great.

* Irvin Kershner was involved only with The Empire Strikes Back, and had no involvement in A New Hope or Return of the Jedi (which, although Richard Marquand directed officially, by all reports I've seen from cast and crew, he was in the end just a proxy for George Lucas).

* Joseph Campbell did no ""narrative consulting"". Lucas never met him or even spoke to him until after Return of the Jedi.

* It's pretty hilarious to mention ""Harrison Ford's acting"" even though you go onto say shitty performances are down to the director? Lucas and only Lucas was director of A New Hope. Bit of a contradiction there.

* The ""incredible work of the special effects team"" was there because of Lucas. He built up an entire company to provide the effects and visuals and was quite innovative in that regard and is acknowledged industry wide as such. Skywalker Sound, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, they wouldn't exist at all without Lucas.

&gt;The reason the original trilogy was such elemental storytelling is Joseph Campbell, who - literally - wrote the book on how human beings tell stories. He was gone in the prequel trilogy.

The same Joseph Campbell who Lucas never even met until after the entire original trilogy was complete? Who never had any actual involvement in any writing of a Star Wars film? George Lucas was influenced by Campbell, but to actually credit him with all the work Lucas did on A New Hope is absurd. Campbell was responsible for non-fictional theories of mythology, and this influenced many people directly, including Arthur C. Clarke. 

Lucas is one of a select few recipients of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, not to mention a recipient of the National Medal of Arts, an academy award nominee for A New Hope in both directing and writing, as well as 4 different nominations for American Graffiti (including both directing and writing again). As well as having won the Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Award, which isn't given out to just anybody.

This is a quote directly from George Lucas:

&gt; Was Joseph Campbell (author of ""The Power of Myth"") an inspiration for you?

&gt;When I started making these movies, I wanted to make a modern mythology. I studied anthropology in college and took a class in mythology; I read some of his stuff there. When I started Star Wars, I did more research before I wrote the screenplay. I reread A Thousand Faces and a few other things he did, and that was the influence he had on me. Later, after I did Jedi, somebody gave me a tape with one of his lectures and I was just blown away. He was much more powerful as a speaker than as a writer. Shortly thereafter, we became friends, and we were friends up to his death. In that way, he was a mentor. He was an amazing scholar, and an amazing person. I was privileged to be around him.

Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20081120221951/http://www.well-rounded.com/movies/reviews/lucas_intv.html

Also note that he isn't credited either. Gee, I wonder why? Could it be that Lucas only read about him in an anthropology course and never actually heard him lecture or met him until after he made the trilogy?

&gt;

&gt;The **BBC World Service** is the world's largest international broadcaster, broadcasting news, speech and discussions in 28 languages to many parts of the world on analogue and digital shortwave platforms, internet streaming, podcasting, satellite, FM and MW relays. The World Service was reported to have reached 188 million people a week on average in June 2009. It does not carry advertising, and the English language service broadcasts 24 hours a day.

&gt;The World Service is currently funded by grant-in-aid through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British Government, however from 2014, it will be funded by the compulsory television licence fee levied on every household in the United Kingdom using a television to watch broadcast programmes.

&gt;BBC World Service is a patron of The Radio Academy. The Director of the World Service is currently Peter Horrocks.

2. It isn't really that uncommon for kids to hit their growth spurt early and, absent actually trying to get bigger through exercise, not growing much more after their early teenage years.  Also, working out too early actually can stunt your growth (see: gymnasts).  So if he was working out at 14 to bulk up and compete in the MLS, it could've had negative effects on his height.  Nevermind the fact that he was never that tall to begin with.

My opinion is that it's because our services are being stretched to the limit. Things like medical care, public transport, schools. They are struggling under the additional pressure and immigration is partly to blame. 

Lots of trades people are struggling these days, they are suddenly having to compete with millions of workers coming here offering to work for half the money.

Young British adults are struggling to get an entry level job because there is way too much competition from experience immigrants who are willing to work on entry level salaries whereas.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; saying countries are arbitrary boundries is silly nonsense

But where borders are is arbitrary, as demonstrated by how borders change. The current UK borders have changed in the last 100 years, countries across Europe have seen far more recent (and dramatic) changes. Current boundaries are mainly due to historical reasons, not any objective criteria (other than the odd bit of geography). Whic his a side issue.

I'm not sure what that link is supposed to show; Grayling objecting to the ECtHR is nothing knew; he is the most under-qualified Lord Chancellor this country has had in hundreds of years, and regularly spouts nonsense about the law. He was once described by the Telegraph as a ""Tory attack dog"" and I don't think there's anyone in the legal community who takes anything he says seriously.

On the ""violation of International law"", International law isn't really a thing. What Dean Spielmann is saying (made clear from the video) is that the UK Government signed up to a treaty, and what they are contemplating would involve a breach of that treaty. But that's it. The CoE can't force the UK to comply with the treaties, short of going to war over it - that's how international law works.

In 2004 the ECtHR ruled that the UK's semi-blanket ban on prisoner voting was in breach of the treaty. It is now nearly a decade since then, Parliament has held a vote on the matter and decided not to change the ban (despite calls from human rights groups, lawyers, judges and even a Parliamentary Committee to abide by the ruling). Most prisoners still cannot vote. To me that seems to confirm that Parliament has the final say on the matter.

Yes, there will be consequences if Parliament doesn't do something; there are some 2,000 claims from prisoners already in the system (looking at something like £1m in damages in total if they succeed), with some 80,000 more possible claims in May (the EU elections) and more each time an election happens. The Government can just pay up, and comply with the treaty (although it may also need to take steps to try to fix this), but ultimately, what Parliament says goes.",0,1389892524,null,0,false,0,cer4tj0,t3_1v9hgc,t1_cer4tj0,t1_cer0fm1,null,1435529351,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;

&gt;The **British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983** (1983 c. 6) was an Act of Parliament passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 28 March 1983. The purpose of the Act was to grant British citizenship to residents of the Falkland Islands, a British Dependent Territory in the South Atlantic.

&gt;Under the British Nationality Act 1981, a resident of the Falkland Islands was classed as a British Dependent Territories citizen unless they also had a connection with the United Kingdom (UK) itself (such as through having a UK-born parent or grandparent). British Dependent Territories citizens were restricted in their right to enter and stay in the UK. The new Act conferred full British citizenship on the residents of the Falkland Islands, giving them similar status to that of citizens in Gibraltar. The 1983 Act had retrospective effect from 1 January 1983, the date on which the 1981 Act had come into effect.

But as in all competitions, there are winners and there are losers. The people suffering from the side-effects of free labour markets right now are the ones who are unable to keep up with the competition. And we should all understand their frustration. Unfortunately, that is the nature of competition. None of us want to pay an extra 10% on our bus fares so that a British guy can be hired instead of a Polish guy.

If we send away all the immigrants, then we're all going to feel the pain of vastly increased costs for everything we buy. It's going to be a huge hit on the economy and probably spike inflation. It's not a real solution.

The only way to truly help these unemployed Brits while maintaining our economic health is to provide them with opportunities to re-skill into a different job. And help keep them in a decent condition to rejoin the workforce when they can.

And that can't happen if the tories keep cutting funding for training programmes and forcing people into unpaid labour, all while insulting them as scroungers and cheats.

they're actually not. they're *changeable*, but they are not arbitrary. i'm confused to as why you think you have a point here. clearly institutions need to have a jurisdiction - the whole argument is about what jurisdictions people think are appropriate. 

&gt; On the ""violation of International law"", International law isn't really a thing. What Dean Spielmann is saying (made clear from the video) is that the UK Government signed up to a treaty, and what they are contemplating would involve a breach of that treaty. But that's it. The CoE can't force the UK to comply with the treaties, short of going to war over it - that's how international law works.

&gt; The Government can just pay up, and comply with the treaty (although it may also need to take steps to try to fix this), but ultimately, what Parliament says goes.

The *whole point* of the anti ECHR position is that they don't want to be in breach and put up with the political fall out, arguments, and have to put up with the years of casework and rulings etc - all of which are real consequences. Saying 'oh they can't do anything unless they want to start a war about it' is a bizarre attitude to European relations. Understandably people want to be *either* fully signed up and abide by the rulings *or* prepared to make their own decisions on the matter - not to be in limbo in the middle with all the headaches that entails.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"You'd have to change the law. In several places.

Most hospital/ council/ etc. jobs have far more protection on several levels than you get in the private sector, and you'd have to rewrite a lot of rules to get around all that - a problem that private companies just don't have to worry about. Worse than that, the pay scale means if you give person X a rise who is on salary grade C, everyone else on salary grade C then has a case for *their* salary to be upgraded - a big deal when everyone is on rubbish money anyway and there *still* isn't enough to address that. Of course, we can always ensure nurses/ council staff/ etc. are paid more by demanding a rise in our NI/ Council tax contributions; it's not as if the equivalent staff in almost any equivalent private company get paid less...but nobody does, so here we are - that's why (for example) a lot of government/ hospital/ council IT is done by contractors; you're simply not going to get a server bod (for example) who's any good on 1/2 - 2/3 the wages anywhere else.

Of course, private companies do indeed suck a profit out of the pile, but in a lot of cases that profit is under some sort of regulation and in any case still won't be as much as the money lost due to wastage/ inefficiency/ etc. that happens in a nationalised industry, and the results are mostly better but cost more. Take the water utilities, for example - as I remember it, the underlying reason the Tories sold them off because most of the Victorian-era sewer network needed replacing, and that was going to be a huge bill increase - privatisation meant keeping costs down and the job would get done anyway (the downside being, of course, that we pay more anyway) - but again keeping this problem nationalised wouldn't have gone away with changing the law to allow the government to truly treat workers as private employees, which means we're back to having to pay people properly and our bills going up (and throwing away the rights it took so long to secure).

Plus, those same rights mean that the gov. is still frightened of strikes, even after decades (another rule that would have to be gotten around to run things as if they were private) - and ensuring they didn't happen again was a big vote-winner; I can still remember the piles of rubbish, electricity strikes, train strikes, etc. all happening at once...and people have long memories.",0,1389893807,null,0,1389900035,0,cer5evi,t3_1vcqnq,t1_cer5evi,t1_cer42d9,null,1431969836,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;As I said, that 1% is not spread equally around the country and it equates to 700k people

Have you read anything I've told you and given SOURCES to or just like UKIP supporter you will ignore facts? Like the link showing pretty good spread of population within whole UK and max being 6% in certain areas (which actually have been already previously affected by that certain immigration).

&gt;The percentage of residents of White Other origin has risen from 6.4 percent in 2001 to 14.5 percent in 2011. This is probably attributable to a large influx of Eastern Europeans (A8/A10) into the borough since 2004

I have found your source. *Waltham Forest has a population of 258,200 * 

*The data shows that the greatest number of National Insurance registrations in the borough over the last 10 years have come from residents originally from Poland (12,250), followed by Pakistan (10,760) and Lithuania (7,410). Other arrivals from Eastern Europe include Romania (6,940) and Bulgaria (4,170). South Africa is the fifth highest ranked source at 5,860.*

Total number of :

* Poles in Waltham Forrest is then: 4.7%
* Lithuanians: 2.87%
* Romanians: 2.68%
* Bulgarians: 1.61%

If topic of immigration is discussed, why haven't you mentioned anything about 10k new people from Pakistan (clearly, UK isn't forced to let in non-EU arrivals, especially if it claims it has a problem with too many immigrants).

What about this *Muslim: 21.9% / 56,541 in 2011 (15.1% / 32,902 - 2001)*? I don't recall Eastern Europeans being of that religion and it shows clearly increase of the population of 6%. Why don't you, nor anybody else notices this and focuses their attack SOLELY on immigrants from Eastern Europe?

As you can see, I was right about Poles being the highest of 6% in the areas with their highest arrivals.

And his first touch on the ball has clearly improved over the last year or so.

Take the analogy of Google: Google gathers masses of data on it's users (among others) and could use the knowledge of name, address and people's preferences to send gifts that people will enjoy. However, instead they use it to target advertising.

Just because they are making a centralised database doesn't mean it'll be used in a wholly or even mostly positive manner. The issue I have with this is that the pharmaceutical industry is notorious for dirty practice. Even if this data were only available to universities, I would still be skeptical with it as much of the uni research is chosen and funded by pharma companies.

Alright I see why you've made the comments you have now.

So this database will be enormously useful for showing associations between certain illnesses or environmental parameters that could easily lead to either possibilities for new drugs/treatments, or the application of existing drugs in different ways. Imagine if we were in the 1950s and this database existed, and someone decided to look at which people smoke and which people have lung cancer. Oh gee, look at that, 99% of people that have lung cancer also smoke. Maybe there's something going on there. That's a very simplistic example but hopefully you can see that having access to an enormous amount of medical data on an entire country's population could be an amazing tool for studying illnesses and developing new treatments.",0,1389896019,null,0,false,0,cer6ggi,t3_1vcziw,t1_cer6ggi,t1_cer6782,null,1431970382,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Lucas, Henderson and Gerrard are each at between 86% and 91% passing accuracy and are the highest non-defense passers on the team. I think Gerrard's few poor performances are clouding your judgement of his accuracy. Meanwhile, Lucas has more key passes per game than Joe Allen, which doesn't support your ""can't provide final balls,"" opinion. Henderson also has more key passes than Coutinho (1.9 per game) and is 3rd on the squad behind only Suarez (who is an offensive demi-god) and Gerrard.

Diame does provide more key passes than Lucas and Allen at 0.7 per game, but he averages a staggeringly awful 19.6 passes per game compared to the 64.9, 63.5, 53.6 and 37.8 of Gerrard, Lucas, Henderson, and Allen. Even with much fewer passes, Diame only manages to complete 78.5% of them, much lower than the 91.3%, 86.6%, 86.5% and 86.5% of Lucas, Gerrard, Henderson and Allen.

true,Thapricorn,lfc-08-09-grey-kit,null,"Why is Gerrard not taking the attacking role over Lucas? I understand that he doesn't have the legs to track back, but if we pushed Henderson a bit farther back into the box-to-box role, then he could be very effective there. Especially after he learns some tackling from Lucas and Gerrard, then Stevie will be, in my opinion, playing in the most deadly position he can for us.

 This is what I propose

--------Back 4 and Migs--------

--------Lucas-----Hendo--------

---Sterling---Gerrard------Coutinho

----------Suarez-------------------

So in this play, Henderson would actually be just slightly ahead of Lucas, and very close behind Gerrard. That way, if Stevie makes a solid tackle, Henderson has the legs to recover the loose ball and send it forward. In defense, Henderson can sweep laterally across the field, and put pressure on players while Gerrard has the time to come back and help solidify the ranks. Lucas is a fantastic player, but he doesn't have the ability to play the killer pass or rocket a screamer in as well as Stevie. If Sturridge was to come on, then I would agree that Gerrard can come off, where Sturridge will be played farther forward, and Suarez will drop back to a CF role as he is strong and smart enough to both hold the ball and be the playmaker. Alternatively, if we want to start Sturridge, then I could see really any of the midfielders coming off, depending on how we want to play the game, and then re-arranging the player positions depending on who we have. General principle I've seen is that Hendo is VERY versatile and can play nearly anywhere. Suarez is very good in the upper half of the pitch, so he's quite versatile. Gerrard needs to stay central as does Lucas. Coutinho is more ideally suited for a central role as well, where he can survey the field on both sides and thread killer passes from there. Sterling stays on the wing, and Sturridge seems to be very adamant about staying as a striker so we can give him that.",0,1389897113,null,0,false,0,cer6zjd,t3_1vcham,t1_cer6zjd,t3_1vcham,null,1435529171,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If you run a shop and you only need two people to run it, then having enough money to hire three people isn't going to make you do so etc. (You could say they can grow and buy a whole new shop, but that often takes orders of magnitude more money and further depends upon increased market demand etc.)

There's a reason Ivan has been a CB most of his career, and Azpi a RB. Yes they can play in different positions, I'm not sure how many people remember Ramires as a RB not so long ago. He was forced into the position and he didn't do to bad, but that doesn't mean Ramires should be a RB.

Cole coming back has also been brilliant, he isn't what he used to be, but that doesn't make him bad. He's the best LB we have, and Azpi is the best RB we have. Ivan would be as good if not better than Terry if he was still a CB, again if you're new to Chelsea, Ivan was at one point potentially the best CB in the world alongside Ramos/Silva/Pepe.

&gt;IT HAS BECOME increasingly popular to speak of racial and ethnic diversity as a civic strength. From multicultural festivals to pronouncements from political leaders, the message is the same: our differences make us stronger.

&gt;A massive new study, based on detailed interviews of nearly 30,000 people across America, has concluded just the opposite. Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam -- famous for ""Bowling Alone,"" his 2000 book on declining civic engagement -- has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.",0,1389898989,null,0,false,0,cer7w68,t3_1vcs3i,t1_cer7w68,t1_cer7ca7,null,1431971206,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Then they moved the crack, juiced up The Doctor, and then closed the crack so Trenzalore wouldn't be under attack anymore.

The one thing that was missing regularly this season was another midfielder on the bench that could come on and freshen things up. Alberto is showing some promise but he's just not the experienced player one would want to bring some solidity in those nervy finishes to matches. With Gerrard to CDM that problem kind of fixes itself and suddenly the team doesn't need a backup CDM but more of an AM who could possibly be versatile enough to play through the center or as a winger.

You sir, are a liar. Steven Moffat has been the BBC's prize cash magnet for the last several years. They wouldn't just drop him. 

Sure, Moffat is a lot different than RTD. But that's how Doctor Who has worked since 1963. New writers, directors, a new cast. The show regenerates every couple years, it's not like the transition from RTD to Moffat is  the first time this ever happened.

Chadli on the other hand, has just enough of those skills to go in and play well at a variety of positions.  Maybe never starring anywhere, but solid and productive.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"The 50th was about one thing, The Doctor's redemption for what he did during the Time War. The sub-plot with the Zygons was used mainly to get the three incarnations of them together, and to reinforce the War Doctor's belief that he was doing what was necessary. So, in that regard it felt kind of tacked on to the main plot, but it was necessary to get the main plot where it needed to be, which was the three Doctor's deciding to blow up Galifrey together.

   But, make no mistake, the main plot was about the Doctor's redemption, and that worked wonderfully. And, it was a neat way to bring in all of the Doctors without actually bringing them in, in their Tardises, rather than suiting all these much older actors up in their outfits once more. (Okay, the end scene where they're all standing there watching where Galifrey used to be was a bit cheesy, I'll give you that.) 

   This special though was important for re-booting the new Who, with The Doctor no longer being the ""Last Son of Galifrey"", which means they can move forward without having to reference the Time War again and again. And, it did a nice job of honoring the past, and moving the series forward into the future.

   Was it perfect? No. But, it was fun and satisfying, which is what the essence of Doctor Who is all about.

&gt;The television broadcasting is managed by the Central Broadcasting Committee of Korea (until 2009 called Radio and Television Committee of the DPRK ). Radio and TV sets in North Korea are supplied pre-tuned to North Korean stations and must be checked and registered with the police, though some North Koreans own Chinese radios which can receive foreign stations. It is prohibited to tune into foreign broadcasts. There are four major television stations: Korean Central TV, Mansudae Television (a cultural station only available in the capital), Korean Educational and Cultural Network, and Kaesong Television (targets South Korea). State television is always off air until its 5:00 pm evening news broadcast, except on Sundays which start at 6:00 am, and in emergency events or live events.

&gt;All broadcast media in some way promotes the regime's ideologies and positions, such as juche, and regularly condemns actions by South Korea, Japan, Israel, the United States, and other nations. The media in recent years condemns the United Nations, and its position against the country's nuclear program.

&gt;Compared to Western newscasts, North Korean newscasts are very melodramatic in style. KCTV's principal newsreader from 1974 to 2012, Ri Chun-hee, was well known for the wavering, lofty tone she used in praising the nation's leaders and the hateful one she used in denouncing the West. Many North Korean journalists who have defected to the South have noted the contrasts with the more conversational South Korean broadcasting style.

&gt;Due to the economic conditions in the country and the short broadcast day, radio is the most widely used medium. In 2006, there were 16 AM, 14 FM and 11 shortwave radio broadcast stations. The main radio stations are Pyongyang Radio and the Korean Central Broadcasting Station. There is also a black propaganda station called Propaganda Radio – which purports to be broadcasting from South Korea. Some foreign broadcast radio stations (see external links) that target North Korea are often jammed, though this can vary. The authorities designate such foreign media as ""enemies of the regime"".

&gt;South Korean television programmes cannot be received in North Korea due to incompatibilities between the television systems (PAL in North Korea and NTSC in South Korea) and the sets being pretuned, but watching them on VHS tapes on VCRs smuggled from China is relatively popular. South Korean soap operas, movies and Western Hollywood movies according to defectors, are said to be spreading at a ""rapid rate"" throughout North Korea despite the threat of punishment; inspection teams are regularly bribed or allowed to watch the cassettes themselves.

&gt;North Korean broadcasts have been picked up in South Korea, and are monitored by the Unification Ministry in Seoul, which handles cross-border relations and media exchanges.

&gt;Defectors are also streaming North Korean television broadcasts on the Internet. Korean Central TV stream

true,Gobshite_,smith,Smith,"Mainly the issues are with how the episodes are resolved. Here's a list of me being overly critical of the episodes.

Bells of Saint John - Wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It made me a little bit nostalgic of the Tennant era, but that was it really.

Rings of Akhaten - cop out involving the main monster being killed by emotions, then it explodes which will probably send the surrounding civilisations which were orbiting into deep space. 

Cold War - can't say much about it because people kept talking while I was trying to watch it, but showing the Ice Warrior's poorly CGId face was a bad move. It would've been better as a guy in prosthetics.

Hide - terrible 'love story' idea involving the crooked man. Would've been better off without that bit.

Journey to the centre of the TARDIS - 'it didn't really happen but let's say the Doctor remembers it.' The same cop out as when Rory got eaten by the crack.

The Crimson Horror - ^I'm ^just ^really ^sick ^of ^Victorian ^era ^episodes

Nightmare in Silver - The only issue was the annoying kids really. Cybermen are overpowered now, but at least they can hold their own rather than being slaughtered by the Daleks. 

Name of the Doctor - I felt that this was one of the only solid episodes, though Clara being nothing more than a plot device and her lack of development was really annoying me by that point. She doesn't hold up well against the likes of Amy and Rory.

Night of the Doctor - Probably the best episode all year. And it was six minutes long.

Day of The Doctor - unnecessarily time-consuming and somewhat dull Zygon storyline. Considering how it turned out it should've been called Day of the Zygons because their 'subplot' took up more of the episode than the whole novelty of three Doctors (the 10th doctor being somewhat sidelined after his introduction. He was sort of just there for comedic throwaway lines.) Oh yeah, and saving Gallifrey holds a massive finger up to the 9th Doctor. IMO they should change it so that they did actually blow it up the first time, all that stuff happened, then when we get to 11's point of view he stops it.

Time of The Doctor - poor/throwaway solutions to the Time Crack, Silence and Regeneration Limit issues, as well as the regeneration being too quick. You should be able to see the transition so you can see that he is still the same man rather than two separate ones. Also the 'old doctor' concept has always been kind of stupid.

Firstly you have NO legal status, when you get the papers to sign you will not find the words 'tenant', 'rent', 'lease' etc in them, you have a license, you are a guardian etc. It is a total legal grey area. Secondly (and this one is harder to define in concrete terms) but the company (Camelot) was just fucking dodgy, their agents were all eastern european, all had a very scammy, used car salesman-like air about them. Wanted everything in cash. The deposit was about £500 and you HAD to buy a 'fire pack' consisting of a little fire extinguisher and blanket for £100. Basically I was staying in a monastery and the priests decided they'd had enough of dealing with Camelot so I was booted out and I've never got my deposit back despite legal threats etc. There were also regular inspections and the agency expected me to show other potential guardians around (i told anyone who came the truth about the company).

All in all it left me with a sour taste in my mouth so unless the financial benefits are huge including losing your deposit I wouldn't suggest it.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"""Bowling Alone"" is the cornerstone of his work. The other study build on the ideas he put together there. The article Bowling Alone also came out before the book did. Putnam lives on Bowling Alone , especially because people like the CATO institute and the NeoCon right promote his work. The same kind of people that share your aversion to multiculturalism. 

Anyway, his work is built on a misunderstanding of Social Capital which Bourdieu uses very differently. I happen to be a student of Bourdieu and social capital when it comes to my own research as it impacts things like oranisations. 

You can chase the whole debate online if you wish, it's on going and Putnam has far from satisfied social scientists with his assertions. 

But again, I'm very surprised you don't seem to be interested in digging below the surface and critiquing the whole concept. I would have thought being the DEFENDER OF WESTERN CIVILISATION you claim to be - you'd apply some of that ""enlightenment thinking"" to your sources. 

Here's a starter for ten - can you find studies that show poverty having a stronger correlation to social change than ""social capital""?

&gt; type this: scholar.google.com  
&gt; and knock yourself out  

Why?

You asked me to provide links to the studies which found that mixing people of different backgrounds in one area led to social disintegration in those communities. I did. This one:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam#Diversity_and_trust_within_communities

I should point out that it appears Putnam does not himself like the results of his study. The Boston Globe report calls him a liberal academic whose own values put him squarely in the pro-diversity camp.  It says he struggled with how to present his work. He gathered the initial raw data in 2000 and issued a press release the following year outlining the results. He then spent several years testing other possible explanations. Putnam was quoted in the Financial Times as saying he had delayed publishing the article until he could ""develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity. He was criticized for this. In 2007, writing in City Journal, John Leo questioned whether this suppression of publication was ethical behavior for a scholar, noting that ""Academics aren’t supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings.""

I want to point that out in case people think you are painting him as some right wing agenda associate of the CATO institute or the NeoCons. He's not.

Now, if you don't trust his findings, fine. At least you now admit there is a debate rather than your previous statement of his work ""being taken apart by scholars"". Of course there would be a debate about his study. It would only be natural given the political ramifications. 

I don't appreciate your snide remark about being a ""defender of western civilisation"" nor your dismissive, deriding attitude so I won't be engaging in one with you however.

He owned the scene where the timelords give him regeneration energy and he realized it wasn't the end after all.  And then his final scene was emotional but not too emotional.  10 didn't want to go, so it was just really sad, and it doesn't help that he was a fan favorite.  But Smith accepted his regeneration.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; So we'd require a baseline of acceptable behaviour and people can do what they like from there. 

Who *exactly* defines what is ""acceptable"" and how? The government? An Academy like that in France?

I think it's acceptable for my gay friends to get married. Others won't, because it's not ""part of our culture"", so how does that argument get progressed at all?

&gt; For example, we're an English-speaking country, so all printed information and street signs are in English.

You've never been to Wales or some parts of Cornwall then?

And you don't realise - almost hilariously given your argument - that English is a language formed by immigration. It's a mixture of Latin (from the Romans), Anglo-Saxon (with Scandinavian influences), French, German, Indian, Spanish and in more recent years many, many, many other languages.

It pisses the French off that we're constantly evolving it culturally (a good reason to keep it as it is), and it is constantly updated and enhanced by other cultures who come here.

There is no such thing as ""native Englishman"". Everybody - and I mean *everybody* - here has foreign blood within 3-4 generations pretty much. It might be Celtic, it might be European, it might be further afield, but the concept of us being this pure race is laughable.

And the language is the same.

&gt; We'll support learning to read and write in English, but won't allow you to get by by us translating everything because you need to be able to communicate to play a full role in society.

Why? What exact harm is there in us translating public services?

To be absolutely clear, you think council service shouldn't be translated, right?

So when an abused woman wants to reach out for help, she should be denied that because she only reads, write and speaks Bengali or Urdu? And she should be denied the right to work as well? And health and safety and employment law information should be kept from her? So she should just sit there being abused and on benefits until she finds the time to learn a language internationally regarded as one of the most difficult in the World to pick up as a second language?

&gt; By accepting I don't mean anything goes, but would temper things with common-sense to be in line with our customs. 

Whose ""common sense"" and how are you defining it *exactly*?

&gt; For example, everyone would be free to practice their religion, but since we're not a Muslim country

What are ""we""? Christian? I don't believe in Christianity. Secular? I don't believe in secularism either.

&gt; , the call to prayer shouldn't be amplified from minarets and I'd require all official interactions to occur with an uncovered face. It's the way we do things around here.

Seriously, that's just right-wing, defensive, knee-jerk clap-trap right there. If a woman wishes to cover her face, she is entitled to do so. It has caused exactly zero problems to date.

I love multi-culturalism and will defend it *to the death*. Seriously, if your Britain came about (or any other monoculture), it would be time for a bit of inspiration from the French Resistance, as I would be unable to differentiate it from 1930s Germany.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"Steven Moffat isn't a great writer, not like Neil Gaiman or some such. But, he loves Doctor Who, and that's much more important for whoever is running the show. 
 
And, as for not being able to write women, I would refute that argument by pointing to River. A character he created, and who has certainly been portrayed as a strong, dynamic female who equals the Doctor in brains and resourcefulness, while having a good time in the process.

I will admit that he does have a tendency to not plan out his stories very well, and just kind of blunders into them and tries to figure out how to cram all his ideas into them. But, I'd rather have a showrunner with too many ideas, then one who just repeats the same old ideas endlessly and repetitively. 

   As for your assertion that Capaldi is calling Moffat out on his scripts, I doubt that very much. Oh, I'm sure there's discussion on the scripts, because Capaldi has been a fan of The Doctor for even longer than Moffat. I'm sure he has ideas and thoughts, and shares them with Moffat,but, when all is said and done, Moffat is the showrunner, and Capaldi works for him. If Capaldi really had problems with Moffat's running of the show, he wouldn't have taken the job in the first place.

Most large economic organisations, banks and ratings agencies (for what they're worth!), believe the UK leaving the EU will have very little impact on the UK's economy, Europe's economy or the wider global economy. The most surprising thing is how little people think will actually change. 

The UK has a massive trade deficit with the rest of Europe, we buy far more from mainland Europe than they buy from us, (50% more, so nearly a double trade deficit!), which means that Europe has every incentive to keep trading with us, and not charge us for the right to trade with them like Norway and Switzerland get charged. Essentially we are a massive cash cow for the rest of Europe, and this cash cow is only going to get hungrier and buy even more from the EU as our population grows to the biggest in Europe, 80 million, by 2050. This means that our economy will also likely be the biggest in Europe by 2050, whether we stay in the EU or not, whilst Germany's population is predicted to nearly halve, meaning things are going to get very interesting. It is likely that the UK, France and Poland will rule the roost in Europe in 2050, whereas now it is more France and Germany.

With reference to the wider world economy, most economists believe that a UK free from trade restrictions implemented by the EU will be free to buy commodities in unlimited amounts from any other country in the world. An example would be that at the moment we have to buy expensive French milk, butter and other commodities, and can't buy them from countries like the US even if they would be far cheaper. This means that other countries around the world would get a trade boost from selling more goods to the UK, whilst countries in the EU would likely get a knock and probably be sent back into recession for a short while. Most economists I've read from both sides of the debate believe this would mean the price of food would drop drastically in the UK, however the prices of a lot of other commodities would likely only drop a small bit.

Finally there's the point that the UK, and London in particular, is the largest financial centre in the world. Free from certain EU restrictions, the large international banks would be able to trade currencies and other things in a more unhinged manner than they already can. This might cause problems for the world economy in the long term, however initially could be a really good thing, especially for the UK and UK taxpayers, as the financial sector pays the most tax in the UK.

Essentially, very little will change in the short term, all effects will be felt over the course of several decades, but really any effects will be minor. The EU will have to find the £85 million the UK pays every day to be a member from somewhere else, this could be painful for other EU countries and would likely result in the main beneficiaries, France and Poland, having to drastically cut their CAP allowances.",1,1389907078,null,0,false,0,cerbx8i,t3_1ve2tx,t1_cerbx8i,t3_1ve2tx,null,1431973057,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Then they look at the 'successes' of 'capitalism' and assume that this reflects on the imaginary capitalism taught in economics department

Really agree with that, it's far too easy to relate maxist theory to the implementations of those who've said they are trying to follow it, even if they clearly are not!

&gt;Indeed, when capitalists try to run businesses as if imaginary capitalism were how things really are, those businesses fail spectacularly[1] .

Oh now I disagree with that.  I'd suggest that is exactly what you accuse those people of doing with USSR examples.  Debunking that terrible article as proof of capitalist failures would take all week.  Instead I'd suggest that they are only a failure compared to other capitalist firms that one measures them against.

&gt; Sure  (The link to David Harvey at RSA).

Ok, I'll be honest, that was terrible.

My first explanation of what the problem with the credit was, you could argue was to micro and not really looking at the big picture enough.  But I think all of his 'ideas' that he lists as responsible, from a massively out of context Greenspan quote onwards.  The engineer in me knows defining the problem is often creating the solution, I realise that political types are masters at re-defining the problem to allow their solution.  He does this to suggest you should be joining an anti-capitalist movement by the 9:30 mark on the edited version.  But my personal *oh he did not just say that* was the suggestion that the creation of more billionaires in India than ever before is somehow related to this crisis.  Simple evaluation of the economic indicators show that it is trending due to internal demand.  He also blames re-capitalisation sovereign debt for Greece, rather than the fact they've systemic fraud and tax revenue rates are below projections with the fear that major banks (such as Dresdner which Commerz was forced to swallow) have significant exposures to, and shifting in regulations around the modelling of that exposure, the implementations of many firms CVA changed how willing they are to lend.  He starts off by incorrectly defining the problem, and effectively tries to make those he is criticising look bad, whilst failing to acknowledge all those who did in fact see it coming.

&gt;Economics should really be built on psychology, instead it attempts to supplant physics

I think the idea is that economics is built on what people do.  Psychology is often built on what people wish people would do.  I take it we're familiar with the simple experiments on altruistic tenancies Levitt and co love to go on about?

This kind of behaviour is really best modelled by economics, just so long as no one ever tries to explain why we do it, only that we do, do it.

Yes, although it's worth looking at different trackers and their fees to see if something else fits well. Index trackers are there to stick money in and forget about, you shouldn't be moving money often (caveats below).

&gt; Are the providers (H&amp;L etc) essentially just offering Vanguard as one of their fund options, which you could also get direct (if you had the minimum)? I'm struggling to understand the relationship.

Yeah that's my understanding. Vanguard are massive and therefore probably can't really be bothered dealing with you unless you've got a great wad of cash. On top of that though, I don't know if you could get a vanguard fund in an ISA going direct. 

&gt; What kind of % yield should I expect, realistically?

Ah, now that's tricky. Looking at the markets historically and accounting for inflation, I'm roughly planning on about a 5% return (over many years). Try playing with http://firecalc.com/ or the bigger version (but more complicated) http://www.cfiresim.com/input.php 

Note that these look at historical data for particular bits of the market, usually the S&amp;P500.

You might get a 50% loss one year, or a 50% gain. The boglehead advice is to invest long term and *don't pull out when it crashes*. The markets have (again, over long periods) recovered, and those who sold out at the bottom of the dips lost out massively.

&gt; Any fees/points I should be aware of going into this?

The classic advice always applies, never invest what you can't afford to lose (bad markets can drop the value of your holdings greatly). Other than that, look for differences in the buy/sell price (some have this, some don't) and then at the various charges. There are management fees (typically low with vanguard, but others too), and also some fees that HL apply (I think there's a 0.45% fee per year charge for funds like vanguard either now or just from march onwards).

Look around the site, get confused and look up loads of acronyms. Opening an account is free so you can do that, then chuck £100 in and invest in something. You'll probably end up following it day by day watching it gain 30p and lose a quid, then gain 90p... Also don't be afraid to call HL and ask if there's stuff you're not sure of. 

* Caveats

The overall advice is to stick your money in and leave it. However, you'll want to rebalance things occasionally if you've got investments in multiple things.

Morbius accepts and begins to overpower the Doctor, projecting mental images of Pertwee, Troughton and Hartnell. As Morbius says ""How far, Doctor? How long have you lived?"" their images are replaced by unfamiliar men in historical costumes (portrayed by members of the production team).""

Your student loan has nothing to do with your credit rating. It doesn't show up nor is taken into account. You can't have debt collectors chasing you because the payments are taken directly out of your wages before you get paid. And when the 30 year time limit hits any outstanding amount is written off.

&gt; Since the loan is accruing more interest than my savings it makes sense to pay it off anyway.

Only if you know you'll earn enough money to have paid it off through standard deductions before the 30 year time limit. If you don't then overpaying is just setting fire to the money.

(At least two recent letters, Passport, any medical documents)

 - Collect all her money she has available and sure she can get to it at any time

 - Check out http://foyer.net/ or http://foyer.net/foyers/ to see if there's one near or around her area and if so, call them first thing in the morning. 

If there is a foyer in her area or if she willing to travel the distance to one if its a little out, she'll be OK. Under extreme circumstances, she can try to go to the foyer in her area explain herself and for the night (maybe two) let her stay to get herself together.


If your friend has serious mental health issues they do offer support for that, the counsellors the helped me a lot.

The last thing I would say is, make sure your friend from this point onwards doesn't lie to you. Heed my warning on this, if she is lying then tread very, very carefully don't get caught up in her life if she is.

Do whatever you have to make sure she understands that she should not lie to you about the current situation.

I was in a much worse position than this person and my ""family"" just didn't want to help me, they saw my saw me an my mother side of the family as eyesore and my mother side of the family lived 40 miles+ away and at the age of 16 there was no one I could turn to.

I learned life the hard way, if this person is being trueful, lets help...




Good luck and hope

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Really agree with that

Glad we agree on something at least!  But yeah, I think it's fairly obvious to be honest, the sine qua non of any implementation of Marx's conception of 'communism', or even 'socialism', is that a society has to have achieved advanced capitalism first.  None of the countries which ""went communist"" ever did that.  The idea that it _necessarily_ means nationalising everything and setting up massive State bureaucracies to run a command economy is nonsense.  My (anarchists') fight with Marx has always been about whether we should seize the State and use it to get to socialism, he said yes, I (we) say no because States always serve the interests of the most powerful minority against the rest of society.  History has tended to support our viewpoint, you may think, although I'm clearly biased on this.

&gt; I'd suggest that is exactly what you accuse those people of doing with USSR examples. 

My argument here is that imaginary, 'idealised capitalism', doesn't work, 'successful' large corporations are in fact run internally in a very similar manner to command economy Soviet bureaucracies, those with internally free markets implode, and I assume you're arguing the same about 'idealised communism' - i.e. that it doesn't exist in 'the real world'.  The difference, though, is that Marx was describing an actually existing system when he critiqued capitalism in Capital.  Revisionist capitalist economists have tried to mythologise something which they claim is 'pure capitalism' but they flit from defending the existing 'real world' capitalism and talking about imaginary 'free markets' as it suits them.  The fact is, such things have never and could never exist, since capitalist markets are wholly dependant on a State to establish them, protect private property, etc..  On the other hand, when talking about socialism, Marx was describing a project with a clearly defined objective - worker ownership of the means of production.

&gt;that was terrible.

Can you explain further why, I'm not sure I followed your logic in your critique.

&gt;But my personal oh he did not just say that was the suggestion that the creation of more billionaires in India than ever before is somehow related to this crisis.

In what way?  This is classic Marxism - overaccumulation leads to crises and also springs from them.  The argument is that, since the crisis wealth has accumulated further - whilst there was a brief dip in fortunes at the top end, since 2008 the banks that were 'too big to fail' are [bigger and more failure proof than ever](http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/HuffPost-Too-Big-To-Fail-555x766.png), therefore the systemic risk is proportionately greater now than it was then and capitalism is _even more_ unstable.

As for Greece, the critique here is that psychologising the crisis as a question of Greek culture is inadequate, since it implies German frugality and their export-driven economy is somehow 'better', but economics 101 clearly tells you that every national economy can't follow the German model, indeed, on balance, a Greece for every Germany is required.  In effect, the German model is just as irresponsible as the Greek one, and - as Harvey says - capitalism is merely shifting its problems of overaccumulation and overproduction around.  The whole Eurozone crisis is as much Germany's responsibility as Greece's, and funnily enough, it is German (and French, American and indeed British) banks which are sitting atop a house of cards of their own making on the lending, and insurance and reinsurance of derivatives which will come back to bite them if Greece ever gets to do what is in the interests of its own people.

Wales has two official languages as well as devolved powers, hardly comparable. Are you seriously suggesting we make every language our official national language? Obviously not.

I'm not suggesting any kind of linguistic or racial purity, I don't know where you're getting that from. 

You are right, I don't think council services should be translated. It is very expensive and is a cost that perpetuates itself. 

If we ensured people had an acceptable level of English it would provide *better* support for your battered woman, not worse. Obviously if she had basic English she could make herself easily understood to anyone, but also she'd need to attend lessons and a key element of abuse is the social isolation of the victim. You are advocating a society where she is trapped by her language unless she can somehow reach some council offices and be lucky enough they have the right pamphlet in the right language in a place she can find it. Teach the poor woman English give her a chance.

Health and Safety at work is a very good point. Have you read that? You are responsible for the safety of yourself *and others*. She may not be eligible to work without English since having the skills to shout ""look out!"" or ""fire!"" are fundamental in most places.

English is a hard language to be proficient in because of our history of adopting words from other languages which means we have multiple words meaning the same thing, but have graduated meaning. However, it is one of the easiest languages to be understood in because we are used to hearing it mangled by foreigners. You can get a lot further with a lot less in English than most languages. Compare that to French, you don't need to mispronounce much before they've totally lost what you're getting at even if they aren't being arse-holes and pretending not to understand. Also, the resources for learning English are unparalleled. 

Sorry, for better or worse, you're living in a Christian country. Doesn't matter that you don't believe (neither do I). That's that. It's a cross we have to bear. 

If a woman wishes to cover her face she should be allowed to unless it interferes with official matters or security. You try walking into a bank wearing a motorcycle helmet, see where that gets you. You're allowed to wear motorcycle helmets by law and under some circumstances the law demands you do so. However it is unacceptable to do so under other circumstances. Equally, when interacting with the state where identification is required it is reasonable to be expected to be identifiable. Moreover it is considered impolite in our society to interact with others covering ones face and eyes. It is culturally insensitive for others not to observe this.

What I'm imagining is a world away from 1930s Germany, don't be silly.

Ok, so you think I should go and do something hypocritical so you can laugh at me for being a hypocrite? Well, I suppose it's as solid as many of your other points.

&gt;Table 5.4b of this pdf shows that, in the latest year for which we have data, Lancashire police arrested 627 people for sexual offences. 0.3% of these were Pakistanis. That's two people. 85.5% were white British. In Lancashire, there are 1,296,900 white Brits and 45,000 Pakistanis. This means that 4.163 per 10,000 white Brits were arrested for a sex crime, compared to 0.44 Pakistanis. If you're a journalist, you might say that the chances of being arrested for a sex crime are nine times greater if you're white than Pakistani. If you're a statistician, you might say they are 0.037 percentage points greater.

The way most companies work with agencies is that they have an 'ownership' period normally around 6 months, this means that once you are submitted by one agency no others are allowed to submit you to that company until that period is up.

This is for legal reasons because a lot of people out their are dicks and they would loose a lot of money.


My advice would be try going back to the original agency and see if they can submit your application again, they might not have the role but they may be able to help you.


The problem is that recruitment is selling people with high rewards but very quick paced and high targets, because of this a lot of bad recruiters will drop you and go into something else the money they realise they are not going to make any money from you.

The EU is the UK's main trading partner, worth more than £400bn a year, or 52% of the total trade in goods and services and I would argue that the UK is always better positioned to secure beneficial trade deals as a member of the EU than as an isolated country. For example, the EU is currently negotiating with the US to create the world's biggest free trade area which would be highly lucrative to British business. If Britain went for a clean break from the EU, its exports would be subject to EU export tariffs and would still have to meet EU production standards just as Norway and Switzerland have to abide by many EU rules without any influence over how they are formed.

Furthermore it could be costly for UK exporters if they face EU legal arguments against UK standards.The UK could lose a lot of jobs and business if companies dealing with the eurozone, especially banks, move from the City to the EU.

Speaking of jobs tens of thousands of them could be lost as global manufacturers move to lower-cost EU countries. Britain's large foreign-owned car industry would shift into the EU (see [Nissan](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ceo-warns-nissan-may-quit-uk-if-country-leaves-eu-8928347.html) and [Ford](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEIQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feurope.autonews.com%2Farticle%2F20140115%2FANE%2F140119768%2Fford-will-reassess-uk-operations-if-britain-leaves-eu-report-says&amp;ei=9nPYUon5NrCw7AaInoHYCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBJ3iHRCjK0_j2v0TRB7u70zn_Fg&amp;sig2=1aJeifKc-59rgvMa3FBgKg&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.d2k)) and sectors linked to EU membership such as aerospace would also suffer such as Airbus production which could move to France and Germany.

Then's there the issue of global influence. While it's true that many in the country don't care about this and think Britain should move on from the days when it was a super power, I would say that it is always better to have a say on global matters than being left with a policy of isolationism that historically hasn't turned out very well. Stripped of influence in Brussels, Berlin and Paris, Britain would find itself increasingly ignored by Washington and sidelined on hugely important global issues such as the environment, security and trade. There is also the fact that ALL of Britain's allies (especially America) want it to stay in the EU.

Finally, there is also the matter of all the social benefits that Briton's enjoy thanks to the EU. All the benefits from EU employment laws and social protections would be stripped away. Withdrawal from the European Arrest Warrant could mean delays for the UK in extraditing suspects from other European countries. Also, the right of UK citizens to work and live in EU member states may be restricted.",0,1389914938,null,0,1389917219,0,cerftg3,t3_1ve2tx,t1_cerftg3,t3_1ve2tx,null,1431974950,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

He was also caught out of position a lot. Whenever Lucas is on, you usually see him in the middle, in front of the CB's, Gerrard was often no where to be seen. Big gap of space for attackers to run into. I think he was anticipating the pass too early and ended up jockeying players and being pulled to either side, whereas Lucas has the timing down perfectly to where he arrives to the attacker on their first touch or for the interception.

I read through that whole article and the face the writers states.

""All attempts to politicise this death should be resisted, as should..""

Just wow, how f****ing rude, why just because they say so? or because this whole underlining issue that White British people are still secretly racist to every other race reminds them of that sour taste in their mouth which is their own ugly racism.

The whole piece is just a the writer stating their opinion as opposed to writing the news to inform people and not be biased.

I want to clearly state that I as a Black British man, these types of ""reports"" from such biased people is just angering and upsetting.

There is so much I want to say on this but, the only way for anyone who is not black to understand what true pain not only the family is going through or truly understand this disgusting convert, underhanded racism that slowly drives black people to gang members and drug dealers is to actually be black.....

For example, today at work my white colleague said to me.

""x and y always tease me for living in &lt;heavy black populated borough&gt;, I don't know why, its bloody lovely area.""

Now senior white managers (x and y) well, obviously don't live in &lt;heavy black populated borough&gt;, but yes, he never said WHAT they teased him about but, as a black man who grew up in that area.....I know what they said to him, he didn't tell me what they said for a reason.

""It's not what you show, it's what you're concealing.""

This is just a small piece of BS convert, undertone racism I see and hear daily, imagine dealing with this EVERYDAY, ALL DAY in small and big chunks......

Being a gang member or a drug dealer; you deal with very 'select' people, if your product is good you make between £110 to £500 a day and if you're unlucky have a run in with the police every so often and maybe lose one or two days profit but you can easily make that back again with the right connections, definitely beats a day at the office.

As it happens countries inclined towards passing high minimum wage laws tend to be more developed than countries that don't have them at all or have them at low rates, but that's more a function of the war of ideas. As it happens [*most* countries have a minimum wage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country), but the extent to which that affects the economy will vary significantly.

If a minimum law wage is raised to £7 per hour then companies can only justify employing people who create more than £7 per hour (perhaps a fair bit more if you factor in training costs in combination with a high staff turnover). This means that if you are unskilled, or at least less skilled/experienced than the average candidate who succeeds in gaining a minimum wage job, you have no chance of getting a job without investing money in education (which you don't have, on account of the lack of job). If that law did not exist you could compensate for your lack of skills by outbidding more skilled candidates, and on getting the job you could start building your skill set. The reason a minimum wage law is bad is because it punishes exactly the group who its proponents claim to be helping.

I covered that in the first part. I'd be useless as an armed police officer. I'd just shoot everyone but they are highly trained not to which is why people getting shot is quite low compared to the number of times they are called out.

However even the very very best make the odd mistake or take a decision they regret later. Or he could have simply shot some guy pointing a gun at him or his colleagues.

I just like considering every possible option.

Players like Alberto and Ilori are great young talents with some experience in other leagues, but there must be something they're obviously showing in training that makes it clear they aren't ready yet.  Alberto has had limited opportunities and looked behind the pace of the game on each occasion.  He had a nice assist but the rest of his play felt slow compared to everyone else.  They'll get there and have their chances when they're ready.  We haven't seen Ilori quite yet but Alberto hasn't done much to prove he's ready to go in his limited run outs.

Players like Smith and Rossiter are still just way too young.  Ibe as well, he's not quite there yet.  It's really risky to have these players coming into games that we aren't running away with.  I was really not happy with Smith coming on against Chelsea, it felt like surrender.  He tried his best but he's just not ready to touch that level yet and I don't fault him for it at all, it was just a poor decision from BR (and possibly a statement to the guys in charge that we need some players).

We could do with a fullback, and a defender most pressing.  We don't have much depth to speak of in either area (2 injuries at fullback and we're in trouble... 1 injury in midfield and we have no subs through the middle... 2 injuries and we're in crisis).

Also don't think Shelvey had the right mentality for this Liverpool generation that BR is trying to create. He seemed to get frustrated easily as he couldn't keep up with the tikka takka, and this often led to bad fouls (ManU red card 2012-13).

I reckon Alberto is better suited to the team than him in terms of play style and mentality.

&gt;

&gt;**Dunluce Castle** (from Irish: Dún Libhse) is a now-ruined medieval castle in Northern Ireland. It is located on the edge of a basalt outcropping in County Antrim (between Portballintrae and Portrush), and is accessible via a bridge connecting it to the mainland. The castle is surrounded by extremely steep drops on either side, which may have been an important factor to the early Christians and Vikings who were drawn to this place where an early Irish fort once stood.

&gt;

&gt;**Dunluce Castle** (from Irish: Dún Libhse) is a now-ruined medieval castle in Northern Ireland. It is located on the edge of a basalt outcropping in County Antrim (between Portballintrae and Portrush), and is accessible via a bridge connecting it to the mainland. The castle is surrounded by extremely steep drops on either side, which may have been an important factor to the early Christians and Vikings who were drawn to this place where an early Irish fort once stood.

When allowed to have free run, and go where deemed necessary, he was much more productive, if not flashy.  He was literally a 'Poor, POOR man's Bale' in a way at Fulham.  He was made to be more disciplined positionally here.  We see it all the time with US, when he is in the zone and free to range around, he gets goals and is involved more, when he has to be more disciplined he disappears for long stretches of time.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"I agree with /u/Whisky_Drunk but going to the job centre would still be of some benefit. I was on JSA for 3 months a bit over a year ago. The benefit is simply the small amount of dole money you get (£56.80/week for under 25s &amp; £71.70/week for 25 and over). They don't particularly help with the job search (apart from the occasional one or two advisers) and can be a hindrance due to time spent proving your job search to them when you could be actually searching. However, it's much better to get a little money than not.

The Job Centre do start sending people on courses after a while but most of the time these aren't particularly worthwhile. The cynic in me believes that the purpose of these is find a reason to withdraw benefit rather than improve your skill set.

There are other pluses to being on JSA. I would recommend going for opticians and dentist appointments and get any repeat prescriptions you need as soon as you're a claimant as these are all free while claiming. Also, you may be able to get grants for some adult education courses too.

On the down side, there have been a number of changes since I was last claiming and as far as I'm aware these all makie it more difficult for and are to the detriment of the claimant. Then again, you'll still be better off as a claimant than not (and likely so will your mum).

In terms of being terrified of going, don't be. The employees there will have come across loads of people with very similar situations and are obliged to help. Generally speaking, the first couple of meetings will go fine (though on occasion you get an arse as an adviser - often you don't get the same person all the time) and it's a bit of light relief for them from having to find reasons to try to sanction other claimants.

In the meantime, volunteering and seeking courses are helpful. Also, perhaps joining an agency for temp work might help - far from the nicest way to work but could be worthwhile for a bit of cash and may be a stepping stone of recent work experience. Try getting help to make sure you're making the most out of your CV (it's always worth having other people give it a read through if only to proof read grammar and spelling). Upload your CV everywhere (reed, jobsite, monster, etc). Train yourself for interviews - I found (and find) this [book](http://www.play.com/Books/Books/4-/9105090/919907200/-/ListingDetails.html?_%24ja=tsid:11518%7Ccat:9105090%7Cprd:9105090) particularly helpful.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"Yes, but I'm also looking for experience at the highest levels, things like CL. As good as Southampton and Pochettino have the potential to become, Pochettino hasn't really been proven at any other clubs. AVB, I had my doubts after reading that Falcao *and* Hulk were on that Europa League winning side. It seems too risky, even riskier than taking on a former Chelsea manager like AVB, who had one stellar season.

No offense, but he's still a rookie coach in my eyes, and at the levels we want to compete at, I'd rather take the risk of having a young manager who has lead a team punching above their weight in the CL of all places. Basel might be third in Group E, but they're also bunched in with the likes of Shalke and Chelsea. 

I'll have to do with watching Some of Southampton's highlights. As much as I'd like to see a Bielsa system tried, I would want it with someone who has managed at the levels that we want. Bielsa and LvG are perfect, but since age is an issue for a ""long term"" manager (air quotes because managers rarely last longer than a couple of years in the PL, so maybe Bielsa or LvG aren't bad choices after all), I'd want Yakin.

It's not at all what you think it is. [The money sign is not at all related to the autograph scandal.](http://www.goodbullhunting.com/2013/9/3/4690406/lets-talk-about-cashinout)

The money sign means ""Cashing out"", which is a term our running back, Ben Malena, created *two* years ago - well before the Heisman or any autograph issue. Many members of the team have been doing it for two seasons. [Here's Malena cashing out in 2012](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/0e/38/8a/0e388a4a63d6a26d250928b2810c7db1.jpg) - it's clearly 2012 or earlier since he changed his jersey number to 23 after that season. You'll note he's wearing a headband that says ""Cash Out King"". 

It is supposed to mean that the player is ""cashing out"" his hard work in practice with success on the field (similar to how a gambler can cash out after winning big).

Is it stupid? Yeah, absolutely. But it's also completely unrelated to the autographs - it's a inside thing between teammates. If you've ever played on a sports team you know that guys come up with inside phrases, sayings, and other things that only mean something to each other. Cashing Out was never intended to get attention - and it didn't, until after Johnny won the Heisman and ESPN had nothing better to report. 

[Here's](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodbullhunting.com%2F2013%2F9%2F3%2F4690406%2Flets-talk-about-cashinout&amp;h=0&amp;w=0&amp;sz=1&amp;tbnid=pUM4QXBPGM70gM&amp;tbnh=162&amp;tbnw=312&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=f3nBCTO1jJMAVM&amp;ei=16fYUtSJLs77oATkgoCAAg&amp;ved=0CAUQsCUoAQ) another picture of Malena cashing out.

You are welcome to interpret ""cashing out"" however you wish, but please realize that it is not a hand sign meant for you, the NCAA, the other team, or anyone else. It's a symbol of unity in the team, and it's meant for his teammates. Generally when a player scores, he'll look back at his teammates and ""cash out"" and they'll do the same back at him. 

So what you see as a sign of him being self centered is really just him celebrating with his teammates. Is Sturridge self-centered when he does his dance? More so than Johnny, since Sturridge's dance is alone and is clearly a ""hey look at me"" moment. Yet I don't see anyone criticizing Studge for being too self-centered. 

&gt;And until Manziel shows some maturity on the field, it would be best for Liverpool and FSG to shy away from him.

He *does* show maturity on the field. He regularly gives a high five or butt-slap to a player who tackles him. He helps the opposing team up. He's the first player to run over to the opposing team after a game to shake their hands. He is the first to take a knee when an opposing player is injured. He says nice things to other players on the field:

&gt; @espn I was the one who johnny was talking too. He said “what’s up nick, nice hit.” True story

— Nick Elder (@NickElder1) August 31, 2013 (Linebacker for Rice University)

But these things aren't what the media focuses on. And unless you watch the games, you'll never see or hear about them. 

Johnny's maturity issues are all *off* the field. And frankly, when you compare them to our Suarez they're absolutely trivial.

Johnny's worst crimes are:

* Probably signing autographs for money
* Drinking underage
* Being on twitter too much

It's funny to me that a group of people who supported a player throughout racism accusations are also the same people who demonize a player who has, at worst, gotten paid based on his own name (something olympic college athletes are currently allowed to do under NCAA rules). 

I'm not trying to say the guy is a saint; he's made plenty of mistakes. But it amazes me how much people blow them out of proportion and judge him, even though they no little of the true story. And people fail to realize that many of the mistakes Johnny has made (drinking, partying, posting stupid shit on the internet) we also made at that age.
