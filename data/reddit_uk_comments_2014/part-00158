Also, see in China or Korea or Japan - After school, they still speak incredibly poor English, and they would be more motivated to learn English than we would about Chinese/Russian.

The workload is too big and a lot of people will feel it is forced on them when it is not needed. I think maybe making European languages mandatory - French, Spanish, German etc, and leaving Chinese as an optional course for those who are motivated to study it.

true,f15h3r,null,null,"There was some stadium work in the late 90s adding a second tier to the anfield road end. 


When that was completed, anfield was not particularly under sized for a premiership stadium so there was no great push to spend a huge amount of money when only old Trafford was significantly bigger.

In the mid 00s that had started to change. City got the old Commonwealth games stadium and their capacity grew overnight, arsenal left Highbury for the emirates, Newcastle completed major renovation and old Trafford continued to grow. We were ready for a new stadium and had designs for one back in 2005ish.

There were a number of reasons this didn't happen (pressure to ground share for example) but the main one was that then chairman David Moore's did not have the money. This led to the sale of the club to Gillet and Hicks who promised a spade in the ground within months. 

History shows us that didn't happen and they were ousted before any work begun. When FSG took over a stadium was not the top priority, financial stabilization took precedent. FSG wanted to re-evaluate building a new stadium and took some time to consider all options. When this period was over that announced they wanted to upgrade the existing stadium and this led to the recently released plans.

Tl:dr lack of necessity at first followed by turbulent ownership changes.

For example, what happens to a council tax paying tenant of a large building of flats when the leaseholder decides to make structural changes to the building for which they obtain planning permission... what about where an elderly couple live together in a home they have owned for decades, and the husband dies causing the home to become the sole property of the wife. Who completes these re-evaluations and how is it paid for? Under what financial circumstances are re-evaluations prompted (i.e. does the construction of a large drugs misuse centre which instantly knocks huge values off surrounding properties trigger some sort of reassessment? can people appeal and how is that dealt with/paid for etc.) I really think that idea is a non starter, despite superficially appearing to work.

In reality, it won't happen. But if it were to be rolled out a better approach would simply be to apply changes at a glacial pace, starting with small 1-2% rises in certain property brackets. Drastically revaluing propertiesis effectively what caused the poll tax riots and was the biggest single cause of the conservatives losing power in 1997.

true,kylotan,null,null,"&gt; What kind of projects are we talking about in terms of complexity?

Depends where you're applying. But generally you need to be able to show them that you can do what they do. If they make GUI programs in C#/.NET, you need to make a GUI app in C#/.NET. If they make Android apps in Java, you need to make an Android app in Java. Your business logic is unlikely to be as complex as theirs but you need to show you know your way around the tools and the languages.

&gt; People bang on about data structures for example, and then many go on to to say you never use them at all, or you're rarely asked about them and so on.

Again it depends on what language, what role, what sort of development. In most modern software development nobody is going to ask you to write a linked list. But if you're making games for consoles, you'd probably need to be able to do that. Either way, you do need to understand the data structures that a certain language gives you (even if you can't write them yourself) and know when to use them.

&gt; You read things about graduates not being able to do FizzBuzz for example, are questions really that basic? 

The FizzBuzz thing is a silly riddle-like question. If you know about the % operator in most languages then it's trivial. If you don't, then it's difficult. Most people never have a legitimate use for the % operator when learning so it's not something they remember in an interview situation. But some places might throw a question like that at you. Everywhere is different; there's no standard approach for interviewing programmers.

&gt; is my goal even realistic? Boots/BCM seem to employ a lot of people and help train them and a lot of people seem to really thrive there, but I've no idea if I'm being I little too optimistic. 

What is your goal? To work as a software developer? Of course that's realistic - thousands of people do it. Is it easy, when you have no degree but are located in a city with 2 large universities pumping out a few hundred computing graduates each year? Not really. Luckily, most of those graduates scraped through, often being reluctant to actually code anything along the way, so if you work hard both on producing portfolio pieces to show and on learning good development practices, you'll get there in the end.",0,1401836151,null,0,false,0,chygbkc,t3_276zat,t1_chygbkc,t1_chyfl0z,null,1434081541,1,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,1

This could lead to weak government and slow the legislation even more (or increase the bureaucracy); I agree with assemblies in Wales, Scotland and NI, but to have a separate one for England is totally unnecessary in my opinion.

And this would lead to even more 'political point-scoring' - for want of a better phrase - in Parliament. If you make the House of Lords elected, the Lords themselves will try to do things that make them win those elections, e.g. make false promises. It would also question the primacy of the House of Commons, as the Lords may say they have a better/fresher mandate than the Commons, potentially leading to the stalemates in Congress over in the USA.

There are several monthly tech events that are worth putting in your diary:

* [Tech Nottingham @ Antenna on the first Monday/week of the month](http://www.meetup.com/Tech-Nottingham). Developer focused event with talks. Unfortunately, this was on last night so you've missed it for this month.
* [Second Wednesday @ Antenna and as the name suggests, second Wednesday of every month](http://www.secondwednesday.org.uk/). This is more designer/agency/web focused. As a dev I find the talks a bit hit and miss. It has the largest attendance and offers ample opportunities for networking. Oh and two free beers and food.
* [NottsProgs @ Contemporary Bar (usually) on the third Thursday of the month](http://www.meetup.com/NottinghamProgrammers/). This event has no formal structure or talks and is just a get together in a bar for programmers. I have attended a few times and the conversations have always been interesting, it attracts mainly people in industry but there usually are a few beginners and hobbyists. 
* [Dot Net Notts](http://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/) Also just seen you mention c# below, there is a Dot Net user group that started up recently. I am not a .Net dev so have not attended.

With regards to your background; I am a developer with a degree but not a traditional CompSci degree.

You would have to examine the individual countries, or perhaps Washington State which I believe has had such laws for a number of years. They see far more people

Who are these ""people"" of whom you speak that can't fathom it? I don't think anyone denies that there will always be the potential for abuse, but personally I don't think that outweighs denying what should be considered a fundamental right.

By a degree of the same reasoning (that this sort of law should be avoided because of the potential for unintentional harm by that law) we should not allow more care homes/not have allowed them in the first place because it will be somewhere a family can put their elderly relative to ignore for the rest of their life and/or be abused into an early grave. You could even argue that GP home visits shouldn't be allowed because it gives doctors the opportunity to bump-off rich patients.

I feel for people like yourself because you are being marginalised for just wanting to have a good time. People like myself (Atheist) are not really going to support your cause because we don't have faith or any belief in religion (I fully respect your right to your beliefs though). Then from the other side the extremists if religion don't care for people like you who are not prepared to take a stand and wage war on the heathens and non-believers.

My advice is that you continue doing what you were doing before. Be a nice person, help people out, and all that. Hopefully they will pay it forward. When it all boils down as long as the majority of people are being awesome to each other, the world will be a better place, and then everyone wins, regardless of the reasons, rationale or religion behind the actions.",0,1401839463,null,0,false,0,chyhpb9,t3_273zfy,t1_chyhpb9,t3_273zfy,null,1434082321,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

&gt;__Birmingham Curzon Street railway station__ (formerly __Birmingham station__) was a [railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_station) in [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), England, used by scheduled passenger trains between 1838 and 1854 when it was the [terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_station) for both the [London and Birmingham Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Birmingham_Railway) and the [Grand Junction Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction_Railway), with lines to [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) and to [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) and [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) respectively. It was then used for excursions until 1893 and goods traffic until 1966 when it closed. More recently, the surviving [Grade I listed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_I_listed) entrance building has been used for occasional art events.

true,Ulthwe_Sky,null,null,"Hey, I've just finished my 3rd year in Dundee. I would highly recommend halls in the 1st year, the best way to meet people by far. I stayed in the Heathfield flats, which are basically in the centre of the campus. Belmont is literally across the road. Seabreas is closer to the art buildings but still a 5min walk max to anywhere on campus. As for what they're like; Heathfield and Belmont flats are identical, very modern. On suite bathrooms in every room, 6 to a flat with shared kitchens. The rooms are a decent size and have a good desk space. 
I don't know much about Belmont Tower (in the middle of the Belmont flats) only that it's not the same and some of the rooms are bigger but you pay a bit more for them. 
Seabreas has 2 sections, an undergrad and postgrad. The undergrad are basically older versions of Heathfield and Belmont, but not as nice. Bare white bricks and much darker inside. The postgrad section is identical to Heathfield and Belmont. I will say that Seabreas seems to have a lot more of a party atmosphere though, and there's often more going on there than the other halls.  

There's also Westpark, which is about an easy 15-20 walk away. Same flats as Heathfield but quieter and a bit cheaper. I would recommend these if you're not a party animal and don't mind the walk. Couple of my friends lived there in first year and said the walk wasn't really worth it. 

The halls are quite expensive, but that does include all your bills and internet. On the other hand Dundee is probably the cheapest of the Scottish cities to live in as a student. After first year I recommend moving into a non uni flat, as they are substantially cheaper (we pay £290 each a month for a 5 bed, 2 bathroom flat that's the other side of the road to the campus).

Outside of uni halls there are several student only options; The Hub, The Old Mill, Kieller court and Opal. I would avoid the old mill like the plague. Kieller court is really nice but the most expensive, with variable room sizes and shared bathrooms.  That said they feel more homely than any of the others. The Hub is quite nice, very like the Heathfield halls with larger beds and smaller kitchens, however the building is always absolutely roasting, like its heating is on way too high. All of those are literally across the road from the campus. Opal is further away, and mostly used by Abertay students. Never been in so can't tell you what it's like. 

Basically, I would go for Heathfield or Belmont flats. They're in a central location, nice to live in and good for meeting people. I do miss first year when I could stagger out of the union drunk and see my flat kitchen window...

Take eg http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/regional-assembly-plans-in-ruins-after-northeast-votes-no-8002983.html
&gt; Mr Prescott had already delayed plans to stage referendums on establishing assemblies in the North-west and in Yorkshire and the Humber. The official explanation was that the two regions were not ready to stage all-postal ballots, but **the suspicion was that ministers hoped that a vote to create an assembly in the North-east would create a ""domino effect""** across the north of England.

Or http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030313/text/30313-22.htm

Normally, the Government lay down a policy of government, including local government, administration and so on. But in this situation the localities will decide what sort of administration they have. We might be left with a situation where the North East has a regional assembly but the rest of the country does not.

&gt; **I feel sure that the Government are banking on the possibility that, if they can get one region to vote for a regional assembly, there will be a domino effect** whereby all the others will say, ""if they have an assembly, we must have one as well"".

Yes it does. For an action to be selfless is requires no benefit for the self. This is obvious.

&gt;Someone feeling good about giving to charity or the homeless doesn't mean that they gave to charity for wanting to feel good about it.

Not overtly no. They may not even be aware that they are performing these actions because it makes them feel good, but it is still an innate part of it.

&gt;And thinking that everyone does every nice thing for some self-interested reason is a pretty sad thought to have. 

Why? I don't feel sad that there are no selfless actions. It's a part of reality. There is still good in the world, and good actions can also be actions that aren't selfless.

&gt;The idea that people don't just do something nice for the sake of being nice, or go out of their way or inconvenience themselves without any need for reward is frankly not only wrong, but a shit way to view those actions.

&gt;people can just do nice things, thats a fact,

I don't disagree with this. People can do nice things. People do nice things. These things aren't selfless though.

Your philosophy of ""it's a bad way to view the world so that isn't how the world works"" is a pretty ignorant and sad one to have, in my opinion.

true,justthisplease,null,null,"It is not a band aid, it is a fundamental change in the economic system meaning money is not created as debt. I do not think you have understood fully. In this country we have more debt than money because money is created as debt. If we paid off ALL our debt we would have no money and still be in debt.

QE is not the point. ALL money creation is debt created out of thin air by banks. House prices are a function of supply and demand AND of supply of money which rarely gets talked about in the mainstream. If the economy is doing well banks will create more money and use this money for mortgages, then each bank has an incentive to create more and more money to get more mortgages that will give them a 3% profit, so we get reckless lending increased house prices and increased debt. 

I am convinced QE [has helped fuel the stock market] (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/24/recovery-bubble-crash-uk-us-investors) 

&gt; Few stock market investors really believe in these stories. Most investors know that current levels of share prices are unsustainable; it is said that George Soros has already started betting against the US stock market. They are aware that share prices are high mainly because of the huge amount of money sloshing around thanks to quantitative easing (QE), not because of the strength of the underlying real economy. This is why they react so nervously to any slight sign that QE may be wound down on a significant scale. 

(but you are focusing on QE which is not the main issue). 

It would help climate change because 97% of money is debt which we have to pay around 3% interest on meaning there is more debt in the economy than money meaning we all have to keep working and expanding the economy just to pay off the debt (money) meaning the cycle never ends and we have to grow the economy to pay off our debt but growing the economy means the banks create more money (debt) which we need to pay interest on, meaning we can never pay off the debt. This is the biggest threat to climate change. Also if we took the £32billion out of the hands of private banks and put it into the hands of an accountable public body there would be more money to invest in renewable energy and green projects.

You know what? Fuck it, I'm just going to write out a list of all the things I'd change if I could. No I'd never be able to get it all done in one term, but hypothetically if I could this is what I'd do in power.

1. Re-nationalise the railways ([saving us about £2bn](http://www.imeche.org/news/engineering/report-calls-for-railways-to-be-renationalised-to-save-money))

2. Lower tuition fees back to pre-2011 levels while re-introducing the EMA - order an inquiry into the viability of total abolition of tuition fees and how that can be costed for and what the effects on the quality of university education might or might not be

3. Introduce a proportional representation voting system for the House of Commons and the power of recall for any elected representative at any time of the year

5. Draw up a written constitution and a bill of rights (which the HRA can be rolled into as it would be redundant) to more securely safeguard the rights of citizens against the encroachment of the state

6. As part of the constitution, devolve all powers beyond foreign diplomacy and the military to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - the constitutional guarantee ensures that parties elected mainly by us English cannot roll back the freedoms they have gained, while also giving them the benefits of UK membership

4. Disestablish the Church of England and remove the bishops from the House of Lords - make 50% of the House of Lords elected, keep 50% appointed, rename it the Senate - 'Lords' are an anachronism

5. After the Queen's death, dissolve the monarchy and replace with a system like France and a rebalancing of power to match - a 'Presidential' Head of State elected by a direct referendum with universal suffrage

4. The fundamental tax issue right now is avoidance - get the best minds and lawyers in the country to get a renewed push to clamp down on avoidance in the UK as well as the EU level, with a simplification of the tax system obviously being part of the measures that would be necessary

5. Introduction of a 50p top rate of income tax, a mansion tax, and the rolling of national insurance contributions into the income tax, while generally raising income tax across the board, reducing VAT by 5% while raising and significantly simplifying corporation tax and significantly raising air passenger duty, and lowering business rates to encourage smaller businesses.

6. Increase funding for facilities that provide support for those suffering from mental illness/disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and alzheimers, as well as increased funding for disability benefits as well as the DSA. These are the most vulnerable citizens among us and they deserve whatever help we can give them.

7. Encourage and provide financial incentives to those willing to form businesses as workers co-ops, encouraging work-place democracy

8. The replacement of the minimum wage with a living wage dependent on the cost of living per region of the country - will save massive amounts of money spent on in-work benefits for those who can't get by on the low minimum wage, as the burden is shifted on to the private sector and not the government. Would also order an inquiry into the economic viability of a Basic Income.

9. Legalise and tax cannabis, while raising taxes on tobacco and cans of alcohol (pub beer can remain the same) - cannabis tax could be an enormous source of revenue

10. Encourage community and shorter sentences for non-violent crimes with a focus on rehabilitation for offenders, to socialise and equip them with the tools necessary to return to society able to pursue a legitimate, legal career - benefits us when they don't commit crime and start paying taxes!

11. Begin a massive social housing program with priority given to those currently on social housing waiting lists as well as a decisive effort to get our 60,000 homeless people into homes and back into a system where we can help them recover their lives

12. Lead a fucking *inquisition* into policing in this country, in particular the Met - ban the use of kettling at protests, remove the requirement to ask for permission to protest, severely restrict the circumstances under which one can be stopped and searched, end the mass surveillance by GCHQ and the co-operation with the US' NSA, eliminate TPIMS. Boris Johnson can shove his water-cannons up his arse, we aren't having militarising the police.

13. Massive investment in renewables and carbon-neutral technologies - nuclear power plants to replace the most polluting coal-fired power stations, as well as off-shore wind turbines, solar panels, and tidal and wave energy sources. The goal will be to eliminate all use of coal and replace it where possible with renewables but nuclear will make up the bulk of it as a stop-gap before we move to renewables. Also make good on the proposal to pipe geothermal energy from Iceland to the UK - they have waaay more than they need and it could be a part of our energy mix, while fostering trade and positive relations between our two countries.

14. End secret courts. Make discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation just as illegal as it would be for race. 

15. Begin to cut away at the military budget, largely in terms of the numbers of troops, ending funding to Trident, while ensuring that we are equipped with state of the art technology, and well-trained, disciplined troops with government support for those made unemployed to find work and readjust to civilian life

16. Abolish the bedroom tax and reduce the harshness of the tests for things like JSA - those defrauding the system are borderline non-existent, the system must work for the benefit of the vast majority who use it legitimately, instead of treating them like the criminal 0.3%.

17. Scrap HS2 and instead divert some funding towards upgrading the aging existing railways and improving connections between the northern cities, including replacing horrible old carriages with bigger, comfier ones on the new British Rail

18. Make a sort of 'Civic Education' GCSE compulsory across all schools where students learn about *how* the government works, what basic concepts like income tax and the welfare state are, how voting works, who qualifies for voting, and education on what their rights and responsibilities are. Should help with political engagement and the fight against apathy where it is unjustified while not doing much to force those who have genuine reasons to not vote into doing so.

Mistakes by the team management aren't looked at and any player is thrown under the bus and forgotten about, in order to support the latest in form players easily and without question.

The funny thing is Brendans original plan involved passing system built from the back by the likes of Allen and Sahin, but turned to a system where neither of them could be used to their potential. A system where Hendo is no longer surplus, Gerrard builds from the back and Coutinho and Sterling track back and press the midfield. 2 years ago Fabregas would have been great, but we already have couple of players who can break down defenses with through balls, we just need a player that takes a bit of the work from the defense and attack. Lallana for our system would be the supporting role that can play in a game when we are under pressure and when we attack without needing to re-adjust or prepare a week for it. Just like it's natural for both Hendo and Sterling to go wild when the defenses are falling apart and join the backline when we are under pressure.

Next Generation had its issues early on as well, but it improved greatly. With Doctor Who, you've got to understand that it is intentionally a campy show, but usually in a fun way. The problem that Dr. Who had when it returned in 2005 was how to reintroduce the show to a new generation that was generally unfamiliar with the original run of the show when you had 26 years of back canon to explain? The 1996 Fox TV movie tried to do too much in one episode, and mostly failed. The first season of the new series tried to explain things much more slowly across the whole of the first season. For the most part, the season improves as it goes. Episode 2 takes us to the future, episode 3 goes to the past to meet a famous historical figure. That introduces how the TARDIS works. We learn a bit more about the Doctor and Rose. Then, we have a two part episode that deals with the present day, the consequences of time travel with the Doctor, and introduces UNIT, Earth's military agency for dealing with alien threats from the old series. Unfortunately, the aliens are some of the worst and most childish from the whole of the new series. BUT... make it through all of that, and you get to episode 6, which reintroduces one of the most famous (and camp) villains from the original run in a smart, clever, and surprisingly effectively terrifying new way. It's a great episode, and the show really starts to shape up after this point, with an occasional weaker episode here and there. Even Mickey, the ""creepy black boyfriend"", massively improves over the course of the show, and by season 2, one of the most shocking things is that he actually becomes a genuinely well developed and interesting character. 

Another thing to understand is that if you don't like the Ninth Doctor, try the Tenth. Or the Eleventh. Or the Fourth. Just pick a different one. The reason the show has survived so long is that every time they replace the lead actor, the show reinvents itself and has a completely different feel.

Shortly after, the RAC further countered by introducing their famous 'we cover you, not the car' product which led to the AA counter-retaliating by erecting '30' signs at irregular intervals on minor roads in built-up areas with or without street lighting.  This was a reference to '30 pieces of silver' - accusing the  RAC of selling out.

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"&gt;Give me some national treasures that go under a typical tourist's radar.

I am not British, but I have often been an American tourist in London.

In London:

[Dennis Sever's house](http://www.dennissevershouse.co.uk/).  You don't have a tour guide.  There aren't any signs explaining the rooms.  You can't talk, use cameras, or use phones.  Each room recreates part of a house from a different time, complete with smells and sounds.  The fiction is that the occupants just left each room.  There is a connection between the rooms, so they do tell you which one to go to first, but the house's motto is, ""You either see it or you don't,"" so it's not spelled out for you.  I found it incredible. 

[Hayward Art Gallery](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery).  This is an innovative modern art gallery that I found quite interesting.  It constantly changes its exhibits, so I'd advise you to check its website before you go.

[Royal Gardens at Kew](http://www.kew.org/).  This isn't a little-known attraction, but I wonder how many Americans visit.  You have to take a train ride that lasts about 45 minutes if you leave from north London.  It's one of my favorite places in Britain.  Warning: Lots of walking, if that's a problem for anyone.

[Postman's Park](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/city-gardens/visitor-information/Pages/Postman%27s-Park.aspx).  A British friend took me to see it.  It's a monument to the heroic acts of ordinary people.  If you look at the picture, you can see plaques under an awning.  Each plaque describes a person who sacrificed his or her life to save someone.

[The Churchill War Rooms](http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/churchill-war-rooms).  This is another tourist attraction, but it's really well done and definitely worth seeing.  They've preserved the bunkers where Churchill and his staff stayed during the Blitz.  The automated tour is worth paying for (they give you a headset and it talks to you as you go through the bunkers).

Don't worry too much about annoying the British.  Just don't delay people in London (e.g., don't fumble with your Oyster Card at the turnstile or suddenly stop walking on a busy sidewalk).  You should also expect ruder customer service; take it in stride.  Beyond that, if you know how to not be a douche in America, you know how to not be a douche in the UK.",0,1401863544,null,0,1401898367,0,chyqi7u,t3_278je1,t1_chyqi7u,t3_278je1,null,1434086410,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

tl;dr - IBWT does not use a bank account, you can deposit via Royal Mail (any post box, any office), and Royal Mail have specific services for mailing hard currency (and they are very helpful over the counter).

Royal Mail also offer excellent cover, which generally works out cheaper than international transfers (cover is not needed, you can deposit with just the price of a stamp, but we **highly** recommend that customers use the Royal Mail cover).

We don't charge markups, people put their own value/price down, you can view the trade windows without registering an account or logging in (we do charge 0.3% on transactions (buy/sell)).

[https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_gbp](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_gbp)

If you are depositing via Royal Mail then you only need to register an account via an email address (if you are withdrawing via Royal Mail then you need to register a withdrawal address, but we do process withdrawals direct to banks, assuming your bank has a branch in Plymouth, which most do).

Deposits via Royal Mail take 24-48 hours, depending when you post your deposit and dependent on bank holidays (think postman mailing days).

Also, we don't require identification for withdrawal of **your** coins (we do employ an email 2fa for withdrawal, for a little added security for customers).

I find one major problem with using contractors is that people expect them to do all the work for you, when this is *even less true* than if you'd hired people yourself. Contractors will try to deliver exactly what you ask for, nothing more and nothing less. The problem is that the specifications then need to be so detailed that you may as well do the whole thing yourself.

When you realise halfway through that the system that you asked for is not the actual one you need, that's when these expensive disasters to re-write everything occurs.

If I were going to do a govt IT project, I would spend a year working out what needs to be done by documenting all the existing processes and making a summary that people can understand. Then, small piece by small piece replacing elements of the existing system, keeping in touch with the people who use it to make sure it's working (hint: it won't work first time).

Deep geothermal is again a maybe.  The geological surveys which have been done to test it out are miminmal at best.

Look, my problem is not with renewables in principle.  My problem is that we needed to start building a PROVEN high baseload technology 10 years ago, because if oil prices continue to rise as they are (and there is no reason they won't, trust me).  Nuclear is presently the only techology which is guaranteed to give us what we need.  Then, maybe, we transition to renewables most of which would require reconfiguring the national grid, which is designed around having a high baseload supplied by centralised power stations - something renewables cannot offer.

The problem is that labour fucking pussied around the issue for 15 years (please note I'm quite left wing and not a tory fanboy, but labour fucked us on energy), when the unpopular decisions re energy policy needed making, and now our infrastructure is hopelessly ageing and it's only going to get more and more expensive to update it, because the price of oil is going up and we'll need a ton of oil for all the building work.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; I guess that does not bode well for government projects.

The biggest problem is the entire apparatus of government IT projects is set up to decide who is to blame for when it fails. The costs involved in this are obviously excessive and usually the reason the project fails.

Government IT needs an entire change in mentality. Software is not so much a project that is delivered but infrastructure that is developed, advanced and maintained on an ongoing basis. Government departments should take direct responsibility for hiring/firing and managing their developers. Rather than trying to nail down a specification that goes into a contract.

Specifications have never been done right in the history of software engineering. Thirty years ago specification management was seen as the cure all of software contracting. Nail down the specification correctly and contracts can be negotiated honestly, confidently and in good faith. Of course specification management is still crucial but nobody in the private sector is under the illusion that it actually solves the whole problem anymore. Specifications are nearly impossible to get right even if the world was static. The world unfortunately is not static on top of this. It is time government caught up.

Without good specifications it is impossible to outsource your development, outside of a few narrow well understood projects, without losing all control over the outcome. This leads you towards iterative development in house. You have your people. You have control of the purse strings. You have a system designed for identifying gaps between expectation and reality as an ongoing process and changing direction based upon it.",0,1401868500,null,0,false,0,chyrlrd,t3_279jtn,t1_chyrlrd,t1_chyr9xz,null,1434086925,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

**heres a joke for you**


A British SAS squad and an American Marines squad are together in the middle of a city. The commanding officers of each group are discussing the merits of SAS vs Marines: these officers have reputations for being the strongest, toughest and most feared men in the whole of the armed forces. The American squad leader turns to the British officer and says, ""My Marines are so much braver than your SAS.""

""I doubt that very much,"" says the SAS officer.

""They are much braver,"" says the American. ""Watch this.""

The American squad leader turns to one of his Marines and shouts, ""SERGEANT!! Climb to the very top of that building and jump off.""

""SIR, YES SIR,"" shouts the sergeant. The sergeant runs inside the building, runs to top and, without a second's thought, jumps off the top of the building and smashes into the ground. He survives but is very badly injured and gets taken away on a stretcher. The American leader turns to the SAS officer and says, ""Now that's bravery.""

""Yeah? Well watch this,"" says the British officer. He turns to his men and bellows at the top of his voice, ""YOU, PRIVATE, CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING AND JUMP OFF.""

The private looks at the officer and says, ""Sir, GO FUCK YOURSELF, Sir.""

The Officer turns around to the American and says, ""Now THAT'S fucking bravery.""

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"The two most predictable reasons a player doesn't carry over their form from an old club to a new club are tactics and mentality. 

**Tactics**

Downing flourished at Villa because they were a counter-attacking side that looked to exploit the pace of Downing, Bent and Young. They had lots of space to attack.

When Downing came to Liverpool, he came to a side that had one of the highest levels for both possession and time spent in opposition third in Europe - a side that was often up against 10-man defensive units. There wasn't much space to attack - instead, players had to take on defenders and play incisive passes. Downing was - and remains - no good at either. Kenny's lack of tactical instructions (he prefers to buy players whose natural game and decision-making complement one another, and in this case it didn't work), and Carroll being unable to nail down a starting place didn't help.

Lallana's coming from Southampton, the team that play the most similar football to ourselves in the league. They press, they play incisive and intricate passes, and are always positive and attacking. Lallana's their poster-boy for all of that. In that sense, there's no tactical reason why he shouldn't succeed for us.

**Mentality**

Throughout Downing's career there had been a pattern of underperforming in his first season at a new club. Beyond that, there wasn't any real information to go off about what his mentality was.

Lallana, though - made captain of Southampton in their first PL season, and instantly assured on his England debut. Takes the responsibility of being Southampton's main player/creator - even at Villa, Downing was the 3rd of the attacking three, with Bent and Young especially taking most of the focus and responsibility.

-----

Personally, I don't think there's any predictable reason Lallana won't succeed at Liverpool. Frankly, he's a better footballer than Downing, his past success is in a system similar to the one he'll join, and the signs suggest he has a much better mentality to cope.

As much as I respect your entitlement to say whatever you want, you're being as bigoted as 1/3rd of the population in your eyes.

Firstly why is it 'rightly so' that they should want a united ireland?  Its just as 'rightly so' that as many (or more) want to remain part of the uk.. so you should change your language rather than come across as a total troll.

1/3 or more dont care either way, i'd say its higher, dont assume, just because someone is a catholic that they hold fervent views of nationalism and republicanism.

Additionally, please do not assume that there are 500k bigots, racists and otherwise stupid people in this country, additionally, please do not assume they're all protestants.

Understand the difference between a flegger/loyalist and a unionist.  they are not the same thing.

I agree that the DUP are a bunch of cunts. I also agree that SF are a bunch of cunts too.  Yes the first minister should resign, but then again, most of that lot should fucking resign on both sides.

Joint sovereignty is fine with me, provided that the Dail throw as much money into NI as London does.  Fuck it, get some shiekhs to throw in a few billion and i'll let them boss me about too.

As someone who grew up in a protestant village, who didnt reject the free education that was offered him and married someone from a different background I feel just as Irish as the next man, but equally, British.  I work regularly in England i know the differences, but then I work equally in Dublin and i can see the same differences, like it or not, we're as different to london as we are to dublin.

Are you sure your economics stack up? why would we be better off lumping in with Ireland and the Euro when its a broken breadbasket ecomomy? the UK is growing faster than it has in a Long time, prospects are good and sterling is strengthening.  There is no barrier to the entire european market, so saying that uniting with ireland is going to solve things is lentil knitting hippy bullshit.  I think you'll find the UK has its eyes on a bigger market prize than a few million relatively poor Irish citizens near by...   we're selling bucketloads of landrovers to germany, france middle east, china etc... 

How many Rolls Royce jet engines are being exported to Irelands huge aviation industry compared to china...


face it dude, economics is never going to win that argument.

What would make a case for joint soverignty?  If the idiots in stormont cannot do anything? If the FM keeps being a cunt.  They're going to wreck it for themselves in good time.

It will come about when its a better alternative to what is currently in place... that '1/3 of triumphalist and bigoted people' are doing a good job of it.  

But they'll not go away just because you give them a new fleg.. have you considered the troubles mk2?  look at the anger about Dublin and Monaghan.. do they really want 30 years of the same shit?  doubt it.

A lot of you bring up valid points about cesc maybe lacking the type of young legs and engine that likes getting stuck into tackles or being a more ""industrious"" player. Where I differ in opinion is where a lot people think that he wouldn't be able to play along stevie and that he won't be able to play in our ""style"". For one, cesc fabregas came up through the Barcelona system so he was always destined to go back. The same Barcelona team that nearly perfected the type of pressing (win the ball back in 6 seconds intensity, high up the field pressing) that so many teams, including liverpool, have adopted. that marvelous pep led barcelona team has changed modern tactics significantly. cesc fabregas would do just fine in adopting our style, even playing alongside Stevie. 

cesc fabregas will be the type of player on a tightly contested champions league night that will unlock a defense. 

finally, I still think stevie still has a great engine and intensity, so I don't even know why that's even being brought up. He's not the marauding champions league winning stevie g, but hes so smart, for what he's lost in his legs, hes gained in experience.

Alonso just signed a new contract, so this looks feasibly the only way to make a homecoming occur. Would provide depth and experience, but probably not essential in this deal.

The price of extracting oil has been going up by about 10% since about 2005.  That gives you a doubling in about 10 years.  Let's look at uk energy and food bills.  Oh, look, they've both roughly doubled in 10 years.  Wonder why.

The current house price and general asset bubble is cause by QE, and the only reason we're doing QE is because we're energy stressed, and so need to print money to paper over the cracks.  Which can't continue forever.  The only reason there was a bit of growth earlier this year was the fact that china was out of the oil markets so we weren't getting outbid.

Thing is, I don't know what one could realistically do.  The entire country is now designed around an oil dependant infrastructure.  I don't want to sound like someone shrieking on r/collapse, but when that infrastructure gets too expensive to run, what the hell are we going to do?

My weekly shop seems to go up every month or so with Sainsburys, what was £20 a year or so ago is now £30 in there. Even if I go in for a few bits it's always seems to be over £20. The girl and I did one of those ""bit's we really need every six months"" shops a few weeks ago, it was well over £100. 

There's only two of us too. I wouldn't even like to think what it costs for a family to shop there. 

I will add that as we live in what was once a normal area area of London that has become affluent with the housing prices shooting up exponentially and I'm convinced that Sainsburys have put their prices up accordingly.

true,MrStix,lfc99,,"Although an unlikely scenario, I believe that we would raid the market for a powerhouse midfielder as well as a full back and versatile player. I believe that if Suarez was to leave, we have ample attacking back-up to step up. Sturridge, Lambert, Borini, Sterling and Ibe. However another world class striker to replace him would not hurt. What I would be looking for would be goals from midfield. Someone who fits the mould of Yaya Toure who can add a bit more brawn and drive from the midfield.    

Best Case Scenario:    
Moreno - 15 million    
Emre Can - 8 million    
I'm not sure about any realistic powerhouse midfield targets - 20 million    
Benzema - Potential Swap Deal for Suarez -    
Caulker or Lovren - Max 10 million     
     
In summary We get 50 million plus Benzema from Real Madrid. We spend all of it plus 3 million on the players listed above.     

We line up with this team next season. The first person per position would be first choice.    
     
GK: Mignolet    
RB: Johnson/Flanagan/Wisdom/Kelly    
CB: Sakho/Agger    
CB: Lovren or Caulker/Skrtel    
LB: Moreno/Enrique/Robinson    
CDM: Gerrard/Lucas    
CM: Henderson/Allen    
CM: Coutinho/Powerhouse Midfielder    
CAM: Sterling/Formation shuffling resulting in Coutinho playing in the hole    
ST: Benzema/Lambert     
ST: Sturridge/Borini

We have a bit of a different problem in games which comes down to two things - one is the specification itself which determines the timeline and budget for the contract. The publishers (actually in my experience even though producers do the asking it comes down to a lawyer nobody is brave enough to stand up to who actually demands it) expect you to work in an 'agile' way (most don't actually know what that means) and yet to be able to sign up to two years of detailed deliverables before you even start. So you could do the first bit right and then someone will compare it to what the contract says and 'fail' your payment because it doesn't match. And so on.

The second is they get cold feet early. This is what lead to the  creation of the 'vertical slice' concept whereby some genius decided that from a risk management perspective the best thing to do would be to get one bit of the game to finished quality as early as possible. The problem here is that logically means you have to write the whole thing much earlier than you'd planned (as someone drily observed, nobody makes a cake a slice at a time).

What then happens is the developer abandons good practice under pressure and fakes the result in a way that compounds development in the future and again you have a spiral that wrecks the project.

 [**Pizzo (extortion)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzo%20(extortion\)): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [Southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy), the ___pizzo___ is [protection money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_racket) paid by a business to the [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia), usually coerced and constituting [extortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion). The term is derived from the Sicilian *pizzu* ('beak'). *To wet someone's beak* ([Sicilian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_language) ""fari vagnari 'u pizzu"") is to pay protection money. The practice is widespread in Southern Italy, not only by the Sicilian [Cosa Nostra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosa_Nostra), but also by the ['Ndrangheta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ndrangheta) in [Calabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria) and the [Camorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra) in [Campania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania).

&gt;Another [etymological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology) explanation of the term is ""beakerful"", referring to the right of an overseer to scoop from the grain being threshed by peasants.  Paying the pizzo might also be in kind, for example by forcing a company to put someone (often a member of a criminal organisation) on the payroll, compulsory provision of services by Mafia controlled businesses as well as subcontracting to Mafia controlled companies.  Pizzo is distinct from [""vig""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish) which is an agreed to percentage on a transaction.

&gt;Businesses that refuse to pay the pizzo may suffer [harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment), including [arson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson). In return, businesses receive ""protection"" and can enlist neighbourhood Mafiosi to cut through bureaucracy or resolve disputes with other tradesmen. Collecting the pizzo keeps the Mafia in touch with the community and allows it to ""control their territory"".

It seemed to me to be a good way of ranking players' worth. Some, like Bale in his last season with us, seemed to score game-changing goals on a weekly basis. Others - off the top of my head Ashley Young is the best example - only seem to score when their team is 3 goals up and it changes nothing.

Despite industry claims to the contrary (employing the same PR company and campaigns which hid the dangers of tobacco for decades, regardless the companies involved's knowledge of them), fracking has a well-deserved reputation of fucking up and depleting water supplies.

There's good evidence now of raised levels of many chemicals around fracking sites which bear a characteristic finger print of those employed or released, many of which are hazardous to health (e.g. arsenic).  It's no great surprise then to find that research also suggests raised levels of numerous kinds of illnesses and health problems in humans and animals in those areas.  And for them to deny they have a track record of polluting water supplies is doubly scandalous given that they report such effects in their own literature, and they know that 5% of concrete casings fail immediately and up to half do during their drilling life cycle.

I can't speak for utilities costs for the size of property you're looking for, for definite, but I can give you an idea of my costs. We're in a 3 bed house in South Cambs, so our council tax per month is £137 (covers bin collections etc), utilities for us are approx £180 (gas/elec/water). Obviously that's for a much larger property. Council tax will obviously vary depending on the area you choose to live in, but could be roughly around that figure. Definitely shop around for good utilities deals if you can - I'm too lazy to bother and am probably paying over the odds. 


Pets - we have cats too! I pay for a healthy pet club in our vets which gives me all their flea/worm treatment and yearly vaccinations free, for £36 per month (for 3 cats in total). Obviously vetinary charges can be excessive, which is why I went for the club thing. If any of them need treatment, though, it's charged on top - it's only the basics that are 'free'. We own our home so I'm not sure if you'd have to pay an extra pet excess to your landlord. My sister (in Wales) wanted a cat, and was told by her landlord the extra charge would be £200. I don't know if that's fair or not, but it seemed ok to me considering all the other charges landlords and agencies put on to their costs these days. 


Re your question on salary - I'd say you'd find it difficult to both survive on one income of £21k. If you were both earning that each, you'd be fine, but two people surviving on one income in Cambridge city might find it tricky. Not impossible, but you'd have to be very frugal.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"FSG had plans to put in a committee after they sacked Comolli (April 2011). Rodgers was appointed in June 2011. They'd started putting the committee together by that point, but Barry Hunter and Dave Fallows had previously been working at Man City and as part of their exit from City were unable to work for a new PL club until after the 2011 summer transfer window; so for that first window, the club was restricted in its ability to scout players. Others might have been involved in the decision-making process, it wouldn't have been just Rodgers and Ayre, but I wouldn't know who else.

So since August 2011 we've had the committee in its full form, as listed by rydieo. Rodgers has the final say on a player joining the club, but the committee may decide not to pursue a target he wants. 

I think the power balance has shifted after the latest season - where Rodgers was a success and the transfer committee certainly weren't, with only Mignolet and Sakho being successful deals (with a slight case to make for Toure and no verdict on Ilori), and lots of missed targets. That's why we're seeing some less ""value-for-money"" type targets, and more PL-proven entities like Lallana and Lovren and Caulker - Rodgers won't want constant guesswork about whether a signing is going to be good enough or not.",0,1401876750,null,0,false,0,chyt0z3,t3_278neb,t1_chyt0z3,t1_chyft0f,null,1434087660,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"Careful, making bread or biscuits from scratch can be more expensive than buying them. Supermarket brand bourbon creams are dirt cheap.

I make a lot of special fried rice as a bulk cookable, freezable meal. Rice is cheap. My recipe is:

* 8 servings rice (4 cups, rinsed and cooked in 8 cups water)  
* 2 large onions, chopped  
* 8 rashers bacon, chopped  
* 2 cups peas (just throw them right in with the suff frying, fairly late in the process after bacon and onions are done)  
* Mangetout and minicorn, if they're packaged together and on sale for £1, which they often are  
* beansprouts - usually a big bag for £1  
* spinach - also usually a big bag for £1  
* 4 eggs  
* soy sauce

It makes 8 meals for about a tenner, depending on the deals on the bacon. More if you don't have soy sauce already. I cook the rice in a largish sauce pan and while that's going, in my giant two-handled sauce pan, I do onions, then add bacon, and when that's done all the other veg, then the eggs and stir til it's all cooked, then the cooked rice goes in there and the soy sauce last of all, stir it all up til it's thoroughly cooked. Adding pine nuts in too is nice, but they don't come cheap. They get added before the veggies.

true,vampatori,null,null,"I've been a software engineer for over a decade, I've worked in the public sector a little, and I've done work in the private sector for public organisations for years, including the FSA and NHS.

Public sector work is seen as 'easy money' in the private sector.  There is tons of money, constant work, very poor requirements analysis/specification, very poor internal project management, very poor internal quality control, and a shockingly poor bid selection process that can often lead to collusion between bidders.

But the worst part is that no matter what you do, they'll still pay you!  All it takes is one legal letter from your cheap-ass lawyer and they cough up the beans.  Every time.  The people there just can't take the hassle, and it's not their money, and is not what they're paid to do, so they don't care enough to fight it.

Everyone from PWC to the local Excel expert are taking advantage.

The solution is simple.  Create your own software development house.  Pay them properly, hire good people, and don't be afraid to get rid of people that aren't up to scratch (a huge problem with the public sector).  Work with the open source community and be as transparent as possible so the public can play a part in the oversight process (and even lend a hand, I would love to do that).  Work with educational establishments to get students involved in really important and interesting projects, to feed the organisation, and to further the 'everyone programming' goal government is banging against its head.  Software re-use across all of the public sector.

The reason why they don't do this is because then they don't have anyone to blame but themselves.  Most people running these projects from the public perspective don't give a shit whether these projects work or not, they just want to be seen to be doing something - usually because they're being pressured from higher up to do so.  IT projects failing because of someone else is so common now, so they're never blamed.

There is an element of this in some areas of the private sector too I might add.  I've worked in banking and insurance and they predominantly hire contractors at £500+/day for year on end (some had been there for over a decade!) just so they have someone else to blame when things go wrong.

I've met people in these public organisations that wouldn't let us work with the staff that would be using the software, that continue on a path even when it's explained to them that it's not what they need, that haven't read the specification documents and argue when the features in their heads aren't present, that have no understanding of what a prototype is^*, that turn down the source code when it's offered and explained to them, and so on.

At the very least they need to have really highly qualified, and appropriately paid, technical people employed by the government to oversee these projects, and to impart technical knowledge into the public sector.  Whoever is managing the projects, that has to be their primary job.  If they're going to use third-party developers (sometimes it's required, for very specialist things) they need to have a really solid procedure of oversight.  Access to source control, live testing results, bug tracking, public accessibility to help, and so on.

Also, they don't talk to each other at all.  I had dealings with one particularly nasty individual that ran a company doing 'work' for the NHS.  He claimed to have a big team, but just had one young developer that would knock up stuff in VB that was awful (he was just inexperienced, not malicious).  So he would take their money, then *use them as a reference* to get the next job at the next health authority/trust!!  And so he built his entire business by doing this and never getting caught.  We tried telling organisations about him, but last time I checked he's still in business today.. probably changed his company name a couple of times too.

In all my time doing this I've never met one organisation that was any different.  Only one company I worked for (doing the FSA stuff) was good, the rest were varying degrees of bad, and that company went bust!  Shock.. those that actually do the right thing, are honest, and do what's best for the customer can't compete on price so inevitably lose out to the parasites.  One big customer that moved away from us called my boss saying they'd made a mistake, that they wanted to come back to us, but it was too late, the company had dissolved.  It's madness.

Another potential solution, though ridiculous, might be to offer prizes for software.  They produce the specs with internal technical people, get them passed by the rest of the organisation and the public, then offer a prize.  Perhaps stagger the prizes like NASA is doing with SpaceX/Boeing/etc. so that the top three by a certain stage will get a small payout, then the top one, if it's up to scratch, will get a large payout and a promise of an extra, say, 2 projects of similar size.  It's not ideal, I know, but better than what we have now.

The only solution I can see is the insane developments in computing power that will happen in the next two decades. And that it can be harnessed to model new nuclear/renewable energy technologies - things like the polywell reactor, reactors that use depleted uranium, thorium, advanced solar etc. Automation may also take up a lot of slack. This will likely be enough to keep a relatively functioning economy, but likely too late for climate change. 

But conversely that may never happen and the fact that humanity is predicted to consume 50% more energy by 2040 and that a lot will be made up with unconventional gas, oil and tech like coal-to-liquids (shudder) means we'll completely torch the planet faster than anyone expects.

Over the last 10 years oil prices have been rising about 10% a year on average (though with significant volatility).  Food prices are directly linked to oil prices, guess how much long term average food prices have been rising by.

If you don't believe me, then go here and look at annual average food prices:  http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/manage/uspricehistory/USPrice.asp

They're flat up to about 2005, and from there they start what looks like the beginning of an exponential curve.

Then go here and compare the what's happened with oil price.  http://www.statista.com/statistics/262858/change-in-opec-crude-oil-prices-since-1960/

Relatively flat until the early-mid 2000's, and since then it's going up.

This is a combination of China, the fact that conventional oil production peaked around 2005, and the extra cost of extracting unconventional oil from things like tar sands.  Since 2005 the costs of extracting oil have increased by around 10% annually, while they were flat before.  Food's doing the same.

At present, short term and short hours contracts, and this isn't people being lazy, they're just not worth taking, as you lose so much in welfare, and the costs of working, like travel, just are not taking into consideration.

The way to develop a complex system such as this is to develop a broad view and then segment it into what can be manageably developed, tested and rolled out one segment at a time. That usually doesn't fit well with political ambitions though hence projects get steam-rolled through even if they have little chance of success. Likewise it is possible to develop *everything* as long as you have a VERY extended trial and protracted roll-out in a very limited area - that usually exposes failures to public view (and raises the chance of failure during larger roll-outs due to the limited testing sample) though hence again, politically its not what ministers want to see.

It needs to be a movement from the people, to demand that it be done this way, to the point that it forces politicians to change, and makes them accountable.

I'm actually embarking on this very crusade with my current organisation, Oxfam, though they have different, but related, problems.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"It is utterly impossible to transition our current setup to renewables.  Not going to happen.  There are too many engineering and technical challenges which are likely insurmountable

One of the main issues is energy density.  Oil and gas are extremely, extremely dense sources of energy.  Using fossil fuels you can make generators that kick out 1000W/meter squared.  Most renewables (hydro excluded) struggle to get above 10W/ meter squared, hence all renewables plants require large construction over vast areas.  The entire global agriculture and transport system is based around the fact that you can fit VAST amounts of energy, into a relatively small volume of liquid, which you can then stick in a tank and then go do whatever.  Renewables have no way to replace that, unless you use biodiesel, which is so energy inefficient it's untrue (and is also food).  Battery technology has something like 10% the energy density of fossil fuels, but most batteries require lots of heavy metals that ruin the land where they're mined.  We don't have any synthetic fuels that we can magic out of the air yet, so at best we're probably stuck with batteries.

In order to transition to non-fossil sources of energy we'd need to redesign all of global agriculture and infrastructure within a relatively short timescale.  Something which it took us about a century and an insane amount of oil energy to build in the first place, and which is presently dependant on oil energy to maintain.  The size of such an undertaking is not to be underestimated, and would probably cause yet more environmental destruction in the meantime as we burned more oil and mined more materials to build the vast arrays turbines and solar panels.  This would entail a significant decline in living standards for those of us in the developed world (this is non negotiable) and would probably need a fairly large overall reduction in global population.

This guy goes into quite a few specifics in various blog posts:  http://theenergycollective.com/robertwilson190/257481/why-power-density-matters

Long story short, even if we could produce as much energy as we currently use from wind farms and solar, most of it would be of no use to us, because it would all be electricity.  The most important parts of our system (agriculture, transport) are powered by high energy density liquid fuels.  We don't have a renewable high energy density liquid fuel.  More to the point, the electricity system is also maintained by fossil fuels.

How reddit works:

1) Post stuff you find interesting/relevant

2) Upvote other posts you like

3) Downvote stuff you don't.

So if there is content you want, post it. If other people want it, upvotes ensue.

Otherwise, chill out, cupcake.

Myself I drive at a speed that I am capable of breaking for the conditions I'm driving in.  A ""dark and rainy night"" I'm certainly NOT going to be going 12 mph over the limit.

[so that a pedestrian who is hit by a car travelling at between 30 mph and 40 mph is between 3.5 and 5.5 times more likely to be killed than if hit by a car travelling at below 30 mph.](http://www.stoppingdistances.org.uk/facts/speed.htm)

I'm a speed junkie, if I had more money right now, I'd be working on my aerobatics pilot rating, when I'm down in Cornwall I bomb down the roads, but often my passengers don't like the heavy breaking, because I'll never take a corner I can't see round at a speed that I can't stop within what I can see.

However that isn't necessarily required, if we transition the relatively easy stuff such as grid scale generation (nuclear, tidal both energy dense, and offshore wind where lack of density is less of a problem) that produces a massive cut in emissions and fossil fuel usage. A 50% cut would take us back to 1965 levels, this then alleviates the situation so that we have more time to transition the harder stuff.

I don't think when anyone talks about 'switching to renewables' they mean using absolutely no fossil fuels or producing no emissions at all, not in the short to medium term at least. They mean getting as much of our energy needs from renewables as possible so that we drastically reduce our environmental footprint.

I believe so. He rarely loses possession, he puts in a lot of work, and he's excellent going forward. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's everything that Poch likes in a centre-midfielder.

  &gt;  Do you believe Dembélé has the quality to take us to top 4?

Definitely. He makes for a brilliant box-to-box midfielder, who I think would be great alongside Sandro (playing defensive-mid) and Eriksen (playing attacking-mid).

   &gt; How do you think the player is best utilized?

Being the transitional guy from defence to attack. Given the chance, he can take the ball from our goal to the opponents with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that I enjoyed seeing him as more of a centre-forward in Europe where he just attacked and attacked, but given that we have others who can do that I'd prefer him being the box-to-box midfielder.

You are reading way too much into Dr. Who, it reflects popular culture and public opinion far more than the opinion of the scientific community.

Nowadays people who say ""there is no scientific consensus on global warming"" are talking crap but in the 70's there really was no scientific consensus on global warming.

From wiki:

&gt;In the early 1970s, evidence that aerosols were increasing world-wide encouraged Reid Bryson and some others to warn of the possibility of severe cooling. Meanwhile the new evidence that the timing of ice ages was set by predictable orbital cycles suggested that the climate would gradually cool, over thousands of years. 

It was only by 1979 that some consensus appeared to emerge,

&gt;The 1979 World Climate Conference of the World Meteorological Organization concluded ""it appears plausible that an increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can contribute to a gradual warming of the lower atmosphere, especially at higher latitudes....It is possible that some effects on a regional and global scale may be detectable before the end of this century and become significant before the middle of the next century.""

Which was then consolidated in the 1980s.

&gt;You keep referencing the general public like it has some innate ability to know what's right and therefore if a view isn't popular then it must be wrong

Absolutely not, the general public are wrong about a lot of things and are easily mislead by flashy PR and misinformation. What I am saying and again its something a lot of hardcore greens don't seem to understand is that to effect change it is not just enough to be right. You have to get the support of the general public otherwise they will reject the changes and this being a democracy if they reject them they won't happen. Which is why it is important to minimise the impact of switching to renewables on peoples day to day lives.

One could argue though that had the deceased been wearing *something* reflective the driver would have spotted him and been able to evade/stop earlier. I'm not discounting the fact that this driver was exceeding the speed limit or using his phone, or trying to downplay the seriousness of this.

I drive a lot. Tens of thousands of miles a year. I know it is bloody difficult to spot someone at night in the rain, especially all in black. I upgrade the lighting in any car I have to make it easier to spot people, and my current car is getting drilled &amp; grooved discs, uprated pads and SS brake lines fitted on Friday and all round new Vred tyres the following week, funnily enough.

All I'm saying is that there's a lot of factors in accidents, with emphasis on this one.

We're talking:

 - Weather

 - Time of day

 - Clothing of the victim

 - Awareness of the victim

 - Speed of the driver

 - Awareness of the driver

 - Use of a phone by the driver

I also don't doubt for a second that the condition of this guy's brakes, tyres, wipers and other various conditions of the car potentially contributed.

Then we have this representative from Brake, trying to *completely* discount and disregard the opinion of a solicitor no-less that perhaps, if people are crossing roads in the dead of night, they might want to think about wearing something that doesn't help them just blend into the bleeding road. Brake are so one-sided it's unbelievable. We ***all*** share a majority of these roads, be it in cars and trucks, motorbikes, bicycles and as pedestrians, and the onus is on ***all*** of us to make it as safe an environment as possible.

He also kills our attacking momentum far too frequently. I can't recall which match it was, but there was a moment last season where Dembele picked up the ball deep in our half. Shrugged off two tackles/fouls, carried the ball to the final third, and then rather than picking out what would have seemingly been a simple through ball to Paulinho or Adebayor, who were making runs in behind their back line, he tried to square it to Lennon running down the right wing, only to play it a few feet behind, forcing Lennon to stop his run and track back to collect the ball.

I thought as a moment it summed up Dembele's game really well. Looks like a juggernaut in the middle of the pitch but nearly always lets you down in that final pass.

That's why I'd love to take a punt on Banega for the reported fee. Yes he's mental but if he can get his shit together, he'd be exactly what we've been missing since Modric left.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"This is my entirely unscientific perception on anti-immigration sentiment in the UK:

1. There are a small number of genuine racists/xenophobes. Probably no more or no less than there are anywhere. These people are straightforward bigots, some of them are hatemongers, generally society does not tolerate them at all if they really say what they think. These people are generally against all immigrants, probably on a sliding scale from dark to light skin.

2. There is a greater number of people who, whilst not racist/xenophobic in any meaningful way (no inherent bigotry or animosity towards a race or skin colour), nevertheless feel threatened by the way multiculturalism has appeared to erode the sense of a common culture and allowed separate cultures to exist side by side rather than integrate into the whole. These people do not object to other cultures when they integrate with and become part of UK culture, but they feel alienated when foreign cultures directly challenge the culture they have grown used to or make them feel that they are ""a stranger in their own country"". These people tend to be most against immigration of groups that don't seek to integrate or have difficulty doing so (non-english speakers, Roma gypsies, groups who form their own enclave and seek to apply their own laws and norms etc.)   

3. There is an even greater number of people who don't give a hoot about the skin colour or nationality of immigrants but do care very much about the numbers of people joining our population and what impact this is having on services, infrastructure and community cohesion. These people are not anti-immigration so much as anti-mass immigration and they would like to see a better managed system. And of course, unless there is reform, the greatest risk of continued mass immigration comes from the EU.

I would argue that Group 1 is a problem of inherent attitude/sentiment, whereas Groups 2 and 3 are simply a symptom of terribly incompetent management of immigration policy over decades and an even more appalling inability to discuss immigration without falling into discussions of racism in the most black and white terms (pun intended). For far too long, any concerns about levels of immigration and unwanted consequences were shouted down as prejudice and hate. Ironically, this allowed the problem to get worse and meant that even non-bigoted groups like 2 and 3 (who are far greater in number than the actual bigots in group 1) felt pushed towards parties like UKIP and thus give the impression that the UK population is anti-immigrant when in fact it's overwhlemingly anti-uncontrolled immigration.",0,1401885921,null,0,1401886183,0,chyv10x,t3_27a8is,t1_chyv10x,t3_27a8is,null,1434088603,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Now that I've had my eyes opened to other supermarkets, and eat a better diet with more structured shopping requirement I can see how crap Tesco is. 

Truth is Tesco has nothing going for it, it's not particularly cheap, I'd say the pricing is very much average. The range of stock is very predictable, all the same old brands that everyone stocks, their shops are generally quite bland and ordinary. What pisses me off the most is that their deals and discounts are just so gimmicky and impractical. When I was younger I'd just walk down the ends of the aisles and buy whatever was on offer and eat it all week, ending up eating 1/2 price pizza express pizza and chinese ready meals day after day.

That just doesn't cut it anymore. Morrison's is a god send, it actually offers consistently low prices on actual main food groups that are needed for day to day life. I can buy Morrison's brand bread for like 60p, a store wrapped steak or fish fillet for 2-3 quid, 500g of mince for £2.50. Even their deals tend to be on more practical stuff like juice, cheese, sausages, frozen pizza or milk. 

If I want a bit of variety I just go to Aldi which is great for meat joints, weird European stuff and booze. Tesco can take its half price ready meals and gimmicky discounts on stuff I don't actually want and stick them up its arse.

They're very helpful if you're pretty specific and open-minded. Personally, I'd urge you to take an older cat (i.e. one year+), and speak to the shelter workers about those that have been there the longest, and why. Sometimes kitties just get depressed, and as a result they won't be the ones showing you love and attention and preening themselves in your general direction, but that doesn't mean to say that they won't be loving, adorable cats when given half the chance. I got my last cat from a shelter when she was probably around two years old, and she was a wonderful cat - lived to the age of 21 or 22 and, apart from her final year, never had any serious health problems.

Having just done a quick google for pets4vets, I've found mixed results. Positive cat experiences, but some kind of guinea pig horror, just by searching vets4pets + awful + terrible (and then I narrowed the search results down to the last year). 

Whatever you do, make sure it covers serious health problems too. A quick search for 'insurance' in /r/cats returned a thread where someone had to pay $4,000 to treat kitty leukemia.

true,TonyZeSnipa,flair8,,"I think he has a place in the starting XI if he doesn't get injured, and he starts playing the ball more vertically than horizontally. With him starting to play more of a CM/DM he needs to be able to distribute the ball more equally around the pitch. I do like that he isn't afraid to tackle and be physical for the ball, but I think once he gets the ball at his feet he cannot be afraid to dribble, he is probably one of the best that can on our team.

 He has the quality to take us to the top 4 in my mind, but he needs to be able to pull together a full season without injury. If he can become more counter attacking like in the DM role, I feel that could be enough to push us through. Counter attacking for us was weak this season, attempting to and defending them. I feel that because of how well he can dribble and his tackle success rate, if he helps us by starting a faster counterattack by moving the ball himself down the field, that's how I think he'll be utilized best.

He's done wonders and Feyenoord in the last 3 seasons he led a a very young and inexperienced squad, to a 2nd, 3rd and 2nd placed finishes. However early in his career he did have some disasters. At Valencia most notably and his tenure at Ajax wasn't great either. He was extremely stubborn and not the best man manager. He refused to play Van Der Vaart and Sneijder at the same time because he claimed the don't work together which led to VDV being sold for much less than he was worth.

459,000,000,000 - 34,700,000,000 = 114,300,000,000 kWh surplus (or the entire yearly usage of the Netherlands and a bit more to spare (ref 3 also))

Well, the scientists who ran the study used a well accepted procedure. Their work was peer reviewed, and then re-peer reviewed by *The Lancet*. The Ministry of Defence described the methodology as ""robust"".

So yes, I think the figure is quite believable.

The removal of Saddam Hussein was *explicitly not* the stated purpose of the war, because that would have made it much easier to prove war crimes charges. That's why they made up the whole ""we could be attacked in 45 minutes, it's self-defence really"" nonsense.

Personally, I agree with you. I believe that removing Saddam Hussein *was* the true, illegal motive for the war. *That's* precisely what makes it an illegal war of aggression.

Do they? I'm not claiming to be an expert, but there are clear differences between them.

On Europe, the Tories support a referendum, and leaving if we don't get a renegotiated situation, and many backbenchers hold essentially the same views as UKIP. Labour and the Lib Dems are both more pro-EU, don't support a referendum, and support continued cooperation with Europe. 

On drugs, I'm pretty sure the Lib Dems support decriminalisation, while Labour and the Tories don't. 

On domestic spying, the Lib Dems oppose a lot of that sort of stuff, while Labour and the Tories are fine with it.

On healthcare, I know people will mention Labour privatisation in the 2000s, but I don't think they such an ideological slant to privatising as much as possible as quickly as possible like the Tories do, and unlike the Tories, they'll have plenty of backbench members who will oppose that sort of stuff. 

I do wish there were more differences between them, don't get me wrong, and I don't think the Lib Dems have put themselves in a good position to show their ideology, but I think it's become a bit too popular to say 'they're all the same' when they aren't.

 [**Group of death**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20of%20death): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __group of death__ in a [multi-stage tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_tournament) is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_tournament) which is unusually competitive, because the number of strong competitors in the group is greater than the number of qualifying places available for the next phase of the tournament. Thus, in the group phase, one or more strong competitors in the ""group of death"" will necessarily be eliminated, who would otherwise have been expected to progress further in the tournament. The informal term was first used for groups in the [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) finals. It is now also used in other [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournaments and other sports.

For all those who don't know: You could compare the BILD with the S*n, pretty popular, full of controversies full of bullshit and tending towards the right wing. They're actually quite powerful in Germany, the bestselling newspaper as well. Most of the time Idon't even click their links, the thing is, they're said to have pretty good sources, especially if it's about (german) football.
If anyone's wondering why they refer to Leverkusen as ""Werksklub"" or ""Werkself"": They were founded as the club of big pharma company Bayer and still are - ""Werk"" means ""factory"".


""Now it’s probably going to be quick!

As BILD got to know, Englands vice-champion Liverpool provided a written offer for Germanys u21-national Emre Can (20) towards Bayer Leverkusen.

The transfer’s just before execution.
The player is said to be in agreement with the Reds long since.
Leverkusen would like to keep Can (33 Bundesliga appearences). But the midfielder has a clause for a transfer for a foreign club and can leave the “Werkself” for 12m € this summer.

Leverkusen, in the end, would earn a big transfer profit: Can came 2013 for about 5,5m€ from Bayern.

Director Rudi Völler said already in the BILD-Interview: “The business would be lucrative. But that isn’t the crunchpoint [? The core of the matter?]. We believe, that another year at Leverkusen would be good for Emre. Roger Schmidt [the new Bayer-coach) did already speak to him, he totally likes the player. I’m convinced that Can would improve under Roger.”

But for Can it probably means soon: Liverpool instead of Leverkusen, English tradition instead of german “Werksklub”.""

The player has already plácet the operation and conditions are agreed his five-year contract with the Reds . And Seville is waiting to close a sale that will pave the way to strengthen a planning template that lacks only make a few tweaks after a memorable year. These are broad strokes , but very important, especially given the uncertainty that exists around Rakitic. And to know what to expect with suizocroata and other players who may be tempted during the summer, the club want to get as soon as possible to strengthen liquidity in the market .

This week could have important news about the operation, which is reaching its decisive phase. The clubs are negotiating to try to iron out the differences between supply Anfield club , about 20 million , and the club asking Nervion 22. During the last hours have been some reports that suggest the possibility that the Liverpool have wanted to lower the cost of operation including same Iago Aspas, for which they paid in 9 million euros last June. But Sevilla does not want the assignment or the Galician footballer of Suso. Just want to have liquidity to undertake other prominent signings.

To finish and finalize the transfer to iron those differences , José Castro himself is scheduled to travel to Liverpool. This was announced Tuesday Marca, even this move looked imminent . However, Sevilla president has the full agenda and, among other things , is heavily involved in the preparation of the tribute that the club will conduct auditions this Thursday the former president and head of Sevillistas Nervion Roberto Ales . The leader does not know when to find the hole to meet with the directors of Liverpool , whose agenda is also full . But it appears that should not be delayed beyond the next week the completion of a transfer that will leave Sevilla impressive returns in a spectacular operation.

The player , meanwhile , remains on the lookout in Seville, also wishing to travel to the west coast of England for what will be his new home. In fact, the player already knows firsthand what it is like English football and how Anfield thanks to its continuous contacts with former colleagues who have fought last season in the Premier League , as Luis Alberto (Liverpool ) and Campaña (Crystal Palace, before assignment to Nuremberg ) .

Alberto Moreno, after being left out of the final list of the World , counts the hours to give a leap in his career unimaginable just a year ago and a half, when it still belonged to the staff of Sevilla Atlético . His projection has been brilliant and should settle for the first team was key to exit Spahic Anzhi in February. The player of Cerro del Águila was fixed on the left side , as Unai Emery trusted him and gave him the post of Central Fernando Navarro, with whom he competed hard this season at left back .

Personally, if someone was getting me a gift, I'd really like a high end lipstick (about £20?) because the packaging is often so lovely and it's such a classy thing to have. For example, how gorgeous is this Channel lipstick in Mademoiselle (I just googled 'everyday lipstick Channel' and this came up):

Other brands that I personally think have beautiful packaging and great quality products are Too Faced and Stilla. 

Picking out her favourite brands and then looking at their bestsellers on their website is probably a good idea too. I personally wouldn't recommend getting another Urban Decay palette because that's kind of boring and I don't think Naked 2 or 3 are as nice as the original, but you could have a look at the UD lipsticks, for example, that seem popular on here. I don't know that much about Mac so I can't really help you there, but their lipsticks are, again, popular on here, so you could always see what colours she already has and then search things like 'popular Mac lipstick colour'.

Koke has clearly been getting a lot of interest and it seems both Barca and ManU are willing to pay his 60m Euro buyout. That seems a little much for a player that would likely join our already stacked midfield. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've seen of Koke, he plays on the wing or in a more attacking position where we already have a great deal of talent.

That being said, Pogba is also set to go for somewhere in the 60m range, but I would be more keen on this with the departure of Lamps and Luiz as we need someone to play next to Matic. While ideal, it seems Pogba is remaining quiet until after the WC by simply saying everyone is happy at Juve, etc. I'm anxious to see if we can make moves for him after Brazil. 

Finally with regards to the striker situation, this still has me on pins and needles. I've come to the realization that Costa is probably happening and I think that's fine, but part of me still really wants to see Lukaku next season, and if there is any truth to the rumors that Ba/Torres are sticking around (""...has a future with Chelsea"", ""Ba's situation will improve""), I still wonder what the 2nd and 3rd option for striker will be next season?

Yes.


Similarly if the driver hadn't been using his phone whilst driving and hadn't been speeding at night in the rain, we can probably both agree that a fatality like this would have been less likely.


I see no issue with either being made as comments on the case, though one of the above is enshrined in law and brake as a road-safety charity are obviously going to be pointing the latter out. I don't see what your trouble with brake here is - they stated that the visibility issue is beside the point in a case of a driver breaking the law and causing a fatality.


I still don't see what you've added to this discussion. You told us all how much you really fucking hate brake and then arranged a hypothetical situation to explain how lacking hi-vis makes a pedestrian more culpable for a situation where a distracted, speeding driver kills them...

Schneiderlein is much less of a traditional destroyer and more of a positionally aware CDM (similar to Bentaleb when played in that position) who is capable of making a tackle but also brings more passing ability from the deeper part of the pitch.

AFAIK they generally calculate the interest on a daily basis, and pay it at regular intervals (e.g. monthly). 

&gt; How do a use my 5% interest current account properly?

Just ensure your employer pays your cash into it. Generally they seem to have a limit on the maximum amount they will pay the high interest rate on. If you decide to hold cash in the account to get that preferable rate, then put anything above that limit somewhere else (unless you are just holding it there before you invest it, etc).

E.g. They'll pay 5% on anything up to £2,500, so if you had £3000, then put 500 of it into your savings account.

&gt; I have been at my job for ~8 months and this is my first job, so I don't know if I should set up a credit card etc for good credit, I am terrified of debt. 

The question is, why are you terrified of debt? It is important to ask yourself how organised and disciplined you are; it may be that you aren't yet ready to take a credit card. Look on MSE for guides for first-timers.

&gt; What kind of account should I setup for savings?

Look on moneysavingexpert.com for good savings accounts advice. Which type you want to go for will depend upon your personal circumstances.

Having only Capoue and Bentaleb would leave us rather exposed unfortunately, especially since the next option, Veljkovic, has doubts as to his physicality from the coaches. As we saw from this past year, even having two first choice CDM's, a quality youth in utility, *and* the fact Sherwood hardly played any CDM's, we still came up against the line in terms of fitness. We would certainly have to replace Sandro if he goes. 

Edit: For the record and clarity though, I do very much want Capoue to start even with an incoming replacement if Sandro is sold. But given how diminished we became at the position even with Sherwood not playing a true CDM and bowing early out of the domestic cups, it is simply too much risk going into a season consisting of four fronts with only one CDM above of the age of 21 and two youth players, one of which was removed from developing as a CB due to his lack of physicality and size and the other who being better at playing the No 8 role next to the CDM.

We spied on Merkel - likely so that we can negotiate better deals for the UK in EU matters. We can find out what the likely maximum € should would agree to on a particular deal. That kind of thing.

And we spy on the middle east because it is a hotbed for terrorism and because their own government, intelligence and security services are inept, corrupt and untrustworthy. Of course we need an ear to the ground, looking for potential terror plots, finding out the changes in terrorist organisations (like the Pakistan al-quaeda apparently splitting up), any new terror groups etc. That's a pretty obvious one. We also have vested interests in not letting those countries go to war with each other, so keeping an eye on them and their plans is a good idea. Maybe you could argue that we shouldn't try to be the puppet masters, but we already are.

And lastly, they are protecting our safety here at home. Clearly they over-reached and went too far with the whole PRISM bullshit, but I do understand the premise.

General Electric (GE) makes a once widely used 1.5-megawatt model. 1.5 MW is its rated, or maximum, capacity, at which rate it will produce power when the wind is in the ideal range for that model, between 27 and 56 mph. Turbines are now generally in the range of 2-3 MW. 

from (1)

http://www.rensmart.com/Weather/WindArchive

http://www.withouthotair.com/c4/page_32.shtml

http://www.withouthotair.com/cB/page_263.shtml

these will show you that average is given to be around 6m/s 

At slower wind speeds, the production falls off dramatically. If the wind speed decreases by half, power production decreases by a factor of eight.

Again from (1)

we are more looking at a quarter of the speed that the turbine you used is rated for, so in fact it is half as much power that is generated or about 1,642,500 kWh

which given your estimates is 197,100,000,000 kWh a year

which is a 261,900,000,000 kWh deficit

Do you think there has been a decline in the standard of living in the past 10/20/30 years, even as increasing amount of production have moved overseas?

I would contend that it does not. My argument is that whilst we have lost a large number of manufacturing jobs, the decline in the cost of producing these goods has made up for this loss - whilst well paying union jobs have fallen people can still consume more than they previously could. This short/medium term boost is also coupled with the technological innovation that has sprung up in the newly developed countries. For instance the thousands of jobs lost in the 60s-80 in British dockyards to South Korea/Japan has enabled these countries to industrialise and produce many new goods/technologies we would not have had.  The existence of Samsung or sony whilst it may have put Amstrad out of business has still benefitted us.

So yes, your question was loaded in the sense that it implied that there is something coming after democracy. When there is no such basis to form that judgement. 

I honestly don't think it's as bad as some doomsayers make out. I mean look at all the other historical or current alternatives. Currently the only other system that is challenging Western Liberal or Social Democracy is that of Chinese/Singaporean pseudo-Authoritarianism. Which I don't believe any person who has lived in or experienced the West would advocate is a better system for governance. There are other systems still in use today, such as Korean Stalinism, which I'm not even going to go into. 

In terms of Communism, we have ex-USSR and Eastern Bloc countries to look at, again would anyone beyond blinded old Communist nostalgists advocate we move to a system like that? The only other successful Communist system in Europe; Titoist Yugoslavia, while not as bad as USSR still started to fail economically in the 70's and produced some pretty awful results in it's breakup, and was at a standstill legislatively after the death of Tito. 

You could also have Fascism, in it's traditional sense, with more authoritarianism and melding of Corporations into government (which bears uncomfortable parallels with the USA right now). So that's great if you like having no say in a society and getting a stagnant economy after 10+ years or so without war to drive it. 

Historically we could have englightened Absolutism, examples being Frederickian Prussia and France under several monarchs. Which is an okay system I guess if you get someone good like Frederick the Great, not so good if you get a dick with unlimited power. What else? Oh yeah, Feudalism, which I mean is great if you want to be a serf. Aristocratic Republic if you think Italian city states in the 15th century or the old Greek cities were a great system for governance. 

Conceptually the only other one I can think of is the one Heinlein puts forth in Starship Troopers where only people who have done civil/military service are allowed to vote. Which takes on the form of a sort of restricted Roman-esque style Democracy. 

I mean, what other system is there really? They're all shit. Democracy certainly has it's problems but I can't really see a system that's better. ",0,1401896010,null,0,false,0,chyyyxo,t3_27a7pk,t1_chyyyxo,t1_chyyg0j,null,1434090461,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Well I come from Glasgow so I grew up used to enormous areas of land that had been industrialised and then abandoned and never repurposed, instead massive schemes springing up and little to see beyond service industry or welfare providing a living for those remaining. Is that a better quality of life than working in a shipyard? Maybe not the ones from those days but like you said with modernisation it doesn't mean it has to be repeated.

I'm not saying anything about the relative merits of different courses, and it's certainly not about ""looking down"" on anyone, but students need to get better at deciding what they want to do and pick their courses accordingly.

Gove (who should be best informed of all) sees fit to suspend people and send in Ofsted.  We are spending 6 figure sums and disrupting 1000s of kids' educations based on what?

Smoke!  So far, nothing.  So far we have not only NOT found any evidence, all the schools seem to have been given a clean bill of health.

So is this Islamists eating children?  Or is it peoples irrational fear and prejudice making politicians, the media and us people see monsters that are not there?  I hate when people who dislike X or are not pro-X are labeled X-phobics.  But here I think the label is fitting.

Peoples Islamaphobia makes them see problems where there are none.  It makes them willing to believe rumours and then treat rumours as fact.  It justifies spending time and money and damaging social cohesion in order to go on a fishing expedition.

I am not accusing you or anyone else in particular of Islamaphobia.  But that is what the media and politicians are both stoking up and being led by.  And that is very dangerous IMHO.

Truth is, Isco's season has been so-so.

When he left Malaga his priority was regular playing time in order to develop further as a player and secure his place in Spain's World Cup squad.

He started the season very well at Real Madrid. His confidence was sky high after having a great season at Malaga and a stunning European Championship tournament with Spain's Under 21s (he was my player of the tournament FWIW).

His favoured position is playing on the left wing, allowing him to drift in centrally towards goal on his right foot, or as a number 10 behind a frontman.

At the beginning of the season he started well and was playing regularly either out wide or behind Benzema.

Then, predictably, when Real Madrid signed Bale Ancelotti began to tinker, and for all the promises of regular playing time, Isco began playing less regularly after struggling to adapt to being asked to play a deeper role with more defensive responsibility in central midfield - in order for Real to accommodate the attacking riches. 

It got to the stage where his form stank and he wasn't playing at all besides cup games and the odd cameo role as a substitute, even Jese's emergence had relegated him down the pecking order further. Rumours began to leak about his discontent and desire for a transfer/interest from foreign clubs around January.

Then, he got a few lucky breaks. Khedira got a serious injury, as did Jese. Both of these forced Ancelotti to utilise Isco in a central role, and more often.

He was still rotated a lot, and his form wasn't close to what it had been but he did reasonably well. He started in the Copa Del Rey final, but was on the bench for the CL final - to make a late sub appearance.

In summary, he didn't get the regular playing time he wanted, he hasn't developed the way everyone expected to him to, and he didn't get a place in Spain's World Cup squad (nor even the provisional) and he'll be watching the tournament from his TV.

But, he has a Copa Del Rey medal, likewise a CL medal.

Depends on how you measure a success, but I doubt would've been his ideal when he signed for Real in the summer.

Part of me still rues that we missed out on him. He could've been a superstar here, and I'm adamant that he'd have been a better player for it, and I believe he'd be flying to Brazil for the World Cup.

true,Red_Vancha,eng-hertfordshire,Robert Peel ftw,"There is a book called 'The End of History' which basically theorised that, since the Soviet Union collapsed under the successes of capitalism and liberalism, eventually all governments will transition into liberal democracies, and eventually coalesce into a united yet transnational, federal democracy, similar in vein to the EU. I'd imagine the fall of Communism, and the influence of this book, are some factors as to why people say democracy is the end point of governance. 

The author, Francis Fukuyama, is kind of onto something, because as history has progressed (since atleast the Middle Ages), people have become more individual and championed individualism, or a small state with limited powers. Given this, one could perhaps say that governments will eventually collapse as we pursue a pure form of individualism, liberty and free will, unhindered by the laws of government and governed only by our own actions. I don't think this will happen, because I think we need, or have come to be used to being governed. 

However, there is one thing Fukuyama does not account for, and that is the ever-changing flux of government and power.

Says exactly who? Where did you get it from? Of course I can compare things based on different views/perception etc!

On the other hand your ""comparison"" is completely irrelevant and shallow. Comparing a cyclist on a pavement to a car on a pavement? Vehicle's type, speed, size etc doesn't have anything to do with it? Or the small fact that many pavements are shared by both pedestrians and cyclists?

&gt;if you murder someone you go to jail, if you cycle on the pavement you receive a fine, is that ok?

No, if you said ""if you murder someone you go to jail, if you cycle on pavement you also go to jail, is that fine?"" would make more sense. The comparison is connected with the fact both things are regulated by the Highway Code, is this good enough for you?

&gt;But to make it clear: yes the difference in response is ok because they are different offences.

I'm going to echo what some people have said already in that he is truly irreplaceable at this point, not just in his goals/assists but in that he gets EVERYTHING going in the final third, he is worth 50/60 odd goals directly or indirectly every year ( I know this is all common knowledge but just to highlight the problem)

If Benzema was seen as a replacement in the starting eleven we've a big problem as he is no where near good enough and it seems very likely he would throw a bitch fit in leaving Madrid. 

Our best hope would be to buy a goal scoring midfielder ie Sanchez/Pedro/Pjanic/reus (all incredibly unlikely even if we fuck loads of money at them) and a tricky goal scoring forward ie Muriel/Cavani/tevez/el shaarawy. All of this is both A) unlikely and B) still a big downgrade because they have to get used to the league, are still big risks and you lose the defensive output of a less attacking player if you play a goal scoring midfielder.

Then it's not a comparison. You're simply asking two separate questions: should cyclists be ticketed for cycling on pavements, and should cars be ticketed for not signalling. If that's truly what you were asking then you're post was confused.

&gt;On the other hand your ""comparison"" is completely irrelevant and shallow.

My comparison was an example of how to compare two things. It was relevant because of that. 

&gt;Or the small fact that many pavements are shared by both pedestrians and cyclists?

Not legally, which was the point.

&gt;No, if you said ""if you murder someone you go to jail, if you cycle on pavement you also go to jail, is that fine?"" would make more sense. The comparison is connected with the fact both things are regulated by the Highway Code, is this good enough for you?

Except that the two things that you ""compared"" had different punishments so my one was more analogous than this.

&gt;So the offence should be based on its type, consequences don't have anything to do with it? I've thought that whole judicial system is based on consequences as in an attempted murder will get you lower fine, while successful murder will get you higher.

When a punishment is meted out it is definitely based on the type of offence, though often mitigated by circumstance (which can include potential consequences). ",0,1401898704,null,0,false,0,chz09uk,t3_27ahqn,t1_chz09uk,t1_chyzza4,null,1434091144,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This ideal that humanity, at one point in time, is on the verge of something profound and forever-changing is seen throughout history - the radicals of the French Revolution believed nations all over the globe would unite under the cause of liberty and class struggle, and depose the aristocracy in power, ushering in a new age of tolerance and equality. Similarly, the Cold War brought with it a fear of destruction and nuclear war - peaking during the Cuban Missile Crisis - with bunkers being built, post-apocalyptic stories being told, and an anxious feeling towards new technology such as robots and nuclear weapons that would eventually come to kill us all.

I think that whenever we think we are on the verge of something, we either manage to mess it up or get ourselves out of it. I don't think we are good at thinking in the long term, or looking to the past to correct our present mistakes, but somehow humanity has this ability to escape near-death situations by being adaptable.

I think he is quite talented and has a rare combination of skill set. He is physical strong and is so technical gifted that he can even dribble okayish. 

I wrote the following a few weeks at /r/soccer 

&gt;Quite high actually, He had some troubles making the transition from Youth football to professional football, because he could easily dominate other Youth players which is physical strength, something he couldn't do against grown men. 

&gt;But he adopted during his year at Leverkusen and doesn't have those problems anymore. 

&gt;He is still what I would call very raw. His Technique is amazing for a Center midfielder, he is good at dribbling and his passing is superb, his passes don't jump but clide above the pitch and the strength of it are usually right, too.

&gt;But he lacks ""intelligence"" on the pitch, which means he decides to make the wrong decision on the pitch. He plays the risky pass when he should play it save, which often still leads to a dangerous loss of possession, or he goes into a dribbling which leaves his team mates out of position when he loses the ball. A lot of people seem to only remember those moments and don't rate him because of that. 

&gt;But all of that are things he can improve with more experience, and if he can improve with that he will become a big player in the future. 

I don't know if he can improve Liverpool immediately, but he has the potential to do so in the future.

&gt;**The grades**

&gt;We consider C to be the norm, a straight line, a ‘good’ that indicates a player is performing well and their development is on course.

&gt;C+ signifies the player is outperforming and, while not quite ready for a higher mark, is progressing better than we had expected when the list was originally released.

&gt;C- Suggests that while a player is still on track, they have slipped back marginally and really need a positive 12 months from now to prove that they can fulfil their potential.

&gt;The other markings are a little more straightforward.

&gt;B implies that the player is not only developing well, but has become an integral part of his team, is playing well and/or has cemented a place at international level.  An excellent performance.

&gt;D is awarded to those whose last twelve months has disappointed.  This might not be the player’s fault, often injuries or competition for places may have hampered development.  A D marking does not suggest that an individual has become a bad player; it’s just that they haven’t attained the level we would have hoped.  We expect a high standard.

&gt;E is awarded to players who have fallen badly by the wayside with no immediate indication that things are going to improve.  They’ll still have a career as a professional footballer, but it could have been much more than just that.

&gt;A is easy to assess, difficult to attain. All of the characteristics of B, but not just an integral player; someone that has excelled and become the catalyst for their team achieving success.  We considered that only two players were worthy of this mark last time around: Mario Götze for his defining season in Germany which was the major factor in Borussia Dortmund winning the Bundesliga, and Eden Hazard, the main protagonist behind Lille’s title success in France.  Those two have set a benchmark against which everyone else will be judged. 

So basically he looked like he could have been great but he probably won't be, but he still has talent. Yeah, nobody knows what to make of this one.

There are differences between the two which mean they need different campaigns. As FGM is illegal it's practiced mainly in back streets by dodgy drs or abroad so there are many associated health risks, hence the urgency.

Also as it's practiced mainly abroad and usually on older girls, it usually happens in school holidays - which is why you see these stories around the school holidays.

Finally, the point of FGM is to stop women enjoying sex, it's a way of exerting control over them. While also barbaric, the point to MGM is not to stop men having sex. FGM removes the entire clitoris, so in this sense they are not comparable. A better comparison would be removing the whole end of the penis and make it impossible for men to enjoy sex. When you think of it in this way you can see why people are so horrified by FGM.

In this thread someone always leaves a comment saying 'but what about the boys?' But I wonder if have any of them realise that campaigning against FGM will have benefits for MGM as it brings to attention the whole mutilating babies thing and slowly turning opinion against it.

I was out with a few mates, and a few of theirs as well. One of them was going nuts with the sectarian abuse toward anyone who could hear and was ready to start a brawl for no reason other than being a cunt. If it wasn't for the fact I and a few of my mates got him to shut the fuck up, something probably would have happened. 

Fast forward about a week, and I was out by myself, walking home. It was around 10 or so, so there was more than few guys out drinking. Then, one guy stops me and just starts asking me why I hate catholics so much. I had never met the guy and had no idea who he was. I tried explaining that I didn't hate catholics, that my mother's from a catholic family and so on(My dad's a protestant, I'm a protestant and I was raised in a largely protestant area, but half my family are catholics, and I've had a few mates who have been as well. Don't see the point in stirring up trouble because of it) but he just wouldn't have it. 

He kept asking me why I was shouting about ""Getting the dirty taigs out my country"" and ""Cleaning the streets of fenian scum"" and shit like that. I asked him where the fuck he heard me say that, and he told me that he seen and heard me and a bunch of my mates shouting that shit the week before. He then went on to point out that I was by myself and his mates were just down the road, that they would leave me for dead etc. I tried to talk my way out of it, and just walked away from him, but he shouted to his mates and they chased me down. 

I reckon they may have actually killed me, but a few other fellas jumped in and stopped them from going overboard. Still, a couple of cracked ribs and a broken nose was what I got for hanging out with the wrong guy. 

Funnily enough, I ran into that same guy at a party and he was at it again, trying to start shit and just making a scene, and this guy beat the shit out of him for a being stupid sectarian cunt.

true,OhMySaintedTrousers,null,null,"Right, here's a strange one: I saw something like this on the M4 once, but the driver *kept on going*!

It was a good day, clear visibility. Suddenly entire road is enveloped in thick smoke, reduces visibility down to literally a few yards. Luckily it wasn't too busy but I'm still amazed we all slowed down enough without a crash. I remember being worried that if I braked as quickly as I wanted to, someone behind would pile into me. 

Where it got weird... after a while the smoke thinned out and we all carried on driving, everybody being sensible, doing about 10MPH, expecting to reach a pulled-over / on fire vehicle in a few moments... we didn't... gradually realised that the smoke was coming from a 4x4 of some kind that was *still going*, and apparently under control. I didn't attempt to catch it up enough to read a number plate, because of the thickness of the smoke, and the other drivers, and (quite honestly) shock. 

It kept going, and going, and sped up, and was doing a decent (motorway) speed and I for one was not going to attempt to chase it at those speeds in the cloud of dense smoke that was *still* pouring out behind it!

Weirdest thing of all - I saw - from the plume of smoke - it pull off on a sliproad. I then noticed it *re-join* the motorway immediately, after I'd driven past the way on. At that point I was in front of the damn thing and just put my foot down. 

I was baffled by what kind of mechanical failure could (a) lead to such an immense amount of smoke, and (b) still enable the vehicle to drive, under control, fast, for a distance of several miles. 

Looks like this could be the answer. It was some kind of 4x4 pickup so most likely a diesel, a runaway engine is certainly possible, presumably the transmission was still working, also the brakes hence controllable, drivable vehicle. 

What I still don't understand is why the driver didn't stick it in neutral, pull over, and run like fuck, which is what I would certainly have done. 

If anybody's got any theories I'd be fascinated. 

(By the way I should probably have called the police but had nobody with me in the car and didn't fancy playing with my mobile in those circumstances. As for calling them *afterwards* - yes, probably should have done, but frankly I assumed that at least a hundred people saw what happened and some of them must have had passengers who could phone it in.)

true,webgirly,null,null,"It has, for most people, just on s smaller scale. The thing with Manchester is, the city centre is tiny.  There are still tonnes of bars and restaurants and you could live there for yeaaars without trying all the ones you'd like to try.  There's also a shitload of great music, gigs of all varieties, theatre, museums, a gorgeous library, art galleries, shops, from Primark to designer to independent shops, festivals, markets, and sports facilities all over the place.  But the city centre is dinky.

So you live in one of the ""villages"" that surround it; and that's where you find aaaalll the other stuff.  My experience is of South Manchester, and with the university scene (and I'm nowhere near average uni age) there are even more events being organised, parks, more bars, more restaurants, more independent shops and festivals, and the busiest bus route in Europe that will take you directly through South Manchester into the city centre for (at the moment) a quid.  

I've lived here 5 years, and have never been stuck for something to do on any day of the week.  Plus it's easier to meet new people here, and get into new scenes.  And it's cheaper.

London might have all that x10 for x10 of the cost, but how many hours does one have in a day?  Quality, not quantity.

The quality of certain things London will trump just about anywhere; we don't have anything on the scale of the Tate, or the Natural History Museum, for example, but that's what visiting London is for, and you can get a direct train for £20 if you book in advance.

Not really. 

It depends entirely on the functionality of the virus -  for example, if it's a two program process, ie the initial download silently obtains your network information and sends it to a discreet server. 

Using that information you could target the PC from any network and instigate an attack - effectively meaning once one botnet is taken over you could make a completely new one and attack existing infected PCs.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"Left back and RB are extremely similar. I play fullback and switch sides all the time. if there is one difference, its that its easier to play fullback on the same side as your favored foot. this is because you are more inclinded to make a challenge with your favored foot. RB's are usually jockeying the player facing the right, meaning they can tackle with their preferred foot and vice versa for LB's. This is the biggest difference. On either flank, the strategy and mindset are always the same. Its the same role, but flipped. 


There are plenty of examples of fullbacks switching sides. Look at how well a player like Flanno has adjusted to LB. Look at Johnson at LB, he was the same (not great..the same hot-cold self). he didn't have a drop in performance just because he switched sides. In fact i remember he had one or two good games at LB. Not consistent, but he's not consistent at RB either. my point is that the jump for a professional player isn't THAT bad. Also if it means he would immediately get regular minutes and not be looked at as backup, I'm sure he'd enjoy it.

If Johnson can't pick up his form I think trying Can out as RB would be better than starting Flanno there all the time. the attacking flair is what flanno lacks and Can has it in spades. Similarly, the concentration and defensive effort is what Johnson lacks, and Can seems to have those traits whether he's playing LB, DM, or CM. 

If we sign him, I'm betting that we'd see him tried at RB at least ONCE. 

edit: Also just because he was never tried as RB doesn't mean he's bad at it. Him playing at LB was obviously due to injury issues. He never played RB because he never had to. he played LB because the manager was forced to put him there, probably due to another players injury. look how great it turned out against one of the best teams in germany.",1,1401904045,null,0,1401904245,0,chz2xq4,t3_27axnm,t1_chz2xq4,t1_chz2l8v,null,1434092399,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Your best bet is to keep your pre-uni current account and use that as an account to receive your 'income' (e.g. finance loans and grant, monthly allowance)

In addition to this, you want a savings account (high interest), and a student bank account with interest free overdraft. You'll find that this allows things to balance quite nicely. Live day-to-day using your student account. If you have a big expense (e.g. rent), transfer the money to your student account and pay it from there. You'll soon figure out how much you'll need to live on per month, and this will allow you to split the money from the current account between the savings and student accounts.

If you have an overdraft, don't be afraid to use it. It's interest free, no fees and you normally have a year to pay it off after you graduate!

One final thing: make sure you put away the spare money into your savings, and do not touch it! you'll need it when you finish uni (this is my mistake). Good luck!

true,OhMySaintedTrousers,null,null,"Fair enough question. Actually, no, to be perfectly honest, at least in urban areas. I do cycle a lot, but here in rural Wales when I'm cycling for exercise / pleasure I'm on tiny minor roads with hardly any traffic, and it's great, apart from the fact that many of the road surfaces are pretty much corrugated. I use a fairly cheap racing bike for obvious reasons... I do accept that the local councils simply don't have the money to re-tarmac what must be thousands of miles of minor roads every time the milk lorries destroy them. 

Cycle lanes are *almost* non-existent here. There's a half-mile stretch along an A-road on one of my regular rides, which in fairness was put in at the same time as a separate development; they're just expanding that at the moment so with a bit of luck it'll become a usable route in the next few years. Some of the Sustrans away-from-road routes (e.g. the Aberystwyth - Tregaron railway line route) are absolutely fantastic.

But my point is that cycle routes *have* to be developed gradually, as other road works happen. There simply isn't the money to make everything fantastic at once, and if the money appeared and the council tried, the disruption to regular traffic would be too much. 

An example of where this is happening near me is the A-road between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth, which - piece by piece - is getting cycle route along side. It's frustrating at the moment because of the need to re-join the road, and cross the road in places. Another ten years and it can maybe be joined up.

Probably the most scenic, flat, away-from-traffic cycle route in the UK is the Dolgellau-Barmouth cycle path which is totally fantastic. Some people do use it to commute to work, too!

If we're counting purely *recreational* cycle infrastructure - which I admit is disingenuous of me: Nant yr Arian, Coed y Brenin, any of the south Wales MTB trails.

But qualitatively it's worse than London for me, I don't agree that its easier to meet new people there either, when I was there it felt like their was a large split between the student population and the Saturday night on the town locals. To me it seems like Manchester suffers from a degree of Mancentrism, people saying stuff like ""Manchester's got everything"", raving about how good certain things are when they're merely okish, there's lots of good stuff but also a lot of over commercialised crap full of people trying to convince themselves is fantastic. Feels a bit like the city is desperately trying to compensate for not being London. Personally I prefer the depreciating attitude of a city like Brum or Leeds, at least there if you make a good find it feels special, rather than expecting greatness  and finding something that doesn't live up to the hype. 

As for London there's a certain buzz that only a city with 8 million people can create, like living in a different country altogether where different rules apply. It also feels like you automatically have more in common with people since virtually everyone is from somewhere else.

Ignore the freekicks and penelties, look at the purpose in all those actions, he knows exactly what he wants to do with the ball as he gets it forward and that is what Dembele needs. He has this fantastic talent of just sailing past people and making it look effortless but the problem most of the time is that he has no really purpose when doing it.

&gt; Wales' newly-elected Ukip MEP says he sees no inconsistency between his party’s stance on immigration and the fact that he employed “dozens” of eastern European and Filipino workers in a care company.

&gt; One of Ukip’s major campaign policies at the recent election was its opposition to **unlimited** migration from other EU countries.

&gt; Mr Gill said: “We employed people from overseas because we could not find local workers to do the jobs. We had a care home of our own, but mostly our workers were employed on home care contracts we had with Hull City Council and other organisations. The workers were paid more than the minimum wage, but not massively more.

&gt; Mr Gill said he did not consider there was any inconsistency between his role as a Ukip politician advocating Ukip’s policies and his previous role as someone involved in importing labour from overseas.

&gt; He said: “So far as the workers from the Philippines were concerned, it was not at all easy to get work permits. We had to demonstrate the lengths we had gone to in trying to recruit local labour. Work permits would not have been granted if we could have recruited locally.

&gt; “We didn’t need work permits for people coming in from Poland and other new EU countries because they had a right to come to the UK and work. But based on our difficulty in recruiting local people, I would imagine there would have been no difficulty getting work permits if that had been necessary.

&gt; “My focus at the time was to employ people who would enable us to fulfil as a business the care contracts we had. I can see how this could look bad, but it’s a case of ‘damned if you do and damned if you don’t’. If we hadn’t employed people from overseas, we’d have been called racist. The fact that we did employ immigrants is leading to charges of hypocrisy. **But Ukip has never said it wants to stop all immigration – it wants to limit the numbers.”**

I'm an Oxford student who smokes and, while I'm not an expert on the street-dealing situation here, I can give some general info regarding the weed situation in the UK.

First, nomenclature-wise, American terms will generally be understood. Weed and bud are probably the most common terms, although ""marijuana"". Also, many people won't know what is meant by ""smoking a bowl"" as joints are more typically smoked in the UK (usually mixed with tobacco).

The quality of UK weed is pretty variable; the average is probably lower than that of California, Washington or Colorado if you're used to the super high quality medical-grade stuff. That said, it has improved in later years, although most hash is still not great.

Regarding Oxford specifically, while I've been here I mostly bought off friends who have since gone out of business. If you want to go hunting for dealers, either make friends with appropriate people around your college, or go wander around Cowley Road. It's one of the more ""disreputable"" areas of Oxford (although, in reality, far safer than most US/UK inner cities) and is frequented by the sorts of people who might be able to assist in your search.

true,OfMiceAndMouseMats,null,null,"I think there has been a major tonal change between series.  I'll preface by saying I've enjoyed both immensely and will be sad to see it end, but I hope the writer keeps on writing new and equally powerful television.

In S1, Keiran was just another partially deceased person, and it was mostly about his personal story (which I won't ruin, because its the best 4 and half hours of television BBC3 has ever put out).

In S2, Keiran is suddenly special and matters to the wider world.  He could be the [](/s ""First Risen"").  That's massively different from the domestic story of S1.  It mirrors the progression of Being Human, actually, how initially it was just 3 'monsters' learning to be human, and ended with them saving the world.

As a result our attacks are slowed down time and time again which allows the opposition to reorganize defensively. The ball will always be faster than the player. Another thing that is frustrating about him as a player is his work rate during transitional play. At times this season he looked anemic and slow and made little effort to receive the ball from the back and link up play. When he played alongside Paulinho, we looked desperately lost and time and time again in during our transition play and Dawson was left with little option but to boot it ahead with a long ball.  He is very graceful on the ball and can be fun to watch play as a result, but he, for me at least, isn't the right man for the job and I'd like to see him sold for a good price.

The expense of keeping one around is astronomical even under ideal circumstances. Maintenance, fuel, pilots' wages, hangar fees, etc, etc, are going to cost you 6 figures annually. A family friend had a jet for a while, and I remember him bitching that fixing the windshield on the thing cost $40-50k once. We now live in a world where very few businesses or individuals feel financially invincible any more, so fewer of them are choosing to buy jets, and this has led to a huge increase in charter services. You can still book a jet if you need one, but the pay-as-you-go route is (for most people) a tiny fraction of how expensive it would be to own your own. 

So if you're in charge of a huge multi-national corporation where you actually make use of your jets several times a week and they fulfill a valuable role in your operation, then it's worth it to keep one or two around. For most football clubs these days, especially the ones attempting to behave like viable businesses (like LFC), owning a jet is a pretty dumb financial choice.

Gerrard is a special talent and always has been. We will not end up with another midfielder with the same skillset. Period. Thus, Rodgers has altered Gerrard's play style to extend his career and his remarkable influence over games.

When Gerrard eventually retires, Can will likely take over the position that Gerrard currently plays, but also likely without the long sprayed balls and with a much greater defensive, combative mindset (despite Gerrard's excellent defensive form). He's raw now, but will hopefully develop into the outstanding CDM/Holding Midfielder he can become. With him there and some maturation in our center halfs (Sakho + 1), Rodgers has a lovely platform to allow his more creative central midfielders (Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Sterling, whoever else) expansive opportunities for forward runs and a great deal of freedom to be creative. I believe this is the idea behind this acquisition, and is Rodgers' preferred midfield system to which he will pivot once Gerrard's special skills are gone.

I would argue that one of the reasons BR wants Can now is so that Can can learn from Gerrard and hopefully glean some of his special skills along the way.",0,1401910579,null,0,false,0,chz67vo,t3_27b5ud,t1_chz67vo,t1_chz3ww4,null,1434093948,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Please do not make such a false equivalence that female circumcision is somehow automatically worse than male circumcision. Female circumcision ranges from the sewing/cutting that's been written about in papers recently to making pin pricks and decorative piercings. Whereas male circumcision always involves the forced removal of healthy tissue from babies.

Secondly, do not lie to bolster your opinion. Women who have been circumcised can live perfectly normal lives without any adverse effects, exactly the same as men can. The risks (infection, haemorrhage, scarring, difficulty in genital function, loss of genitals, death) are practically equal for boys and girls (and are most often caused by improper operation).

There is absolutely no reason to ""wait until FGM has been addressed"". Even suggesting so shows bare faced sexism. Both problems can be tackled at the same time, there is literally no reason why not. It's like saying that we'll wait until prostate cancer is cured before starting on testicular cancer.

37,000 local homes and businesses to benefit from BT roll-out 

Super-fast broadband is now available to the first homes and businesses in Egham and Guildford, BT announced today. 

Up to 37,000 local householders and firms in Egham and Guildford are poised to join the high-speed revolution as engineers complete the local upgrade in the coming weeks. 

The latest development means that around 131,000 local premises in Surrey are either already connected to the high-speed internet technology, or soon will be. BT has also announced plans to pass another 193,000 premises in the county with its fibre network either later this year or during 2012. 

BT’s local access network business, Openreach, expects to make super-fast fibre broadband available to two-thirds of UK homes and businesses by the end of 2015*. It will use a mix of fibre to the cabinet (FTTC) and fibre to the premises (FTTP) technologies. Both are much faster than those speeds previously available to most UK homes and businesses. 

FTTC, delivered to street cabinets, currently offers download speeds of up to 40Mbps and upload speeds up to 10Mbps. Openreach is planning to roughly double these speeds next year. FTTP, taking fibre all the way to homes and businesses, will offer speeds of up to 100Mbps.

- Get vat registered and get on the flat-rate scheme. You charge 20% on your bills but only have to pay HMRC 13%, so you get to keep 7%. You'll get taxed on that, but it's still worth doing, especially if you have a steady role.

- When you get a business bank account, set up 2 additional accounts along side it. Savings accounts will do. These are your Tax and VAT accounts. As soon as an invoice is paid, take 40% and put it in the Tax account, and (if you're VAT registered) take another 20% and put that into the VAT account. Do this FIRST, before paying yourself. You won't pay out anywhere near the 40/20% rates, so you'll accumulate cash in those two accounts. This will keep you afloat in the future when you're not in work.

- Learn and understand IR35. Don't get caught out by it. Stick within the law, and you'll be good.

- Get insured. ASAP. Better coverage means it easier to get into larger companies down the line when you're looking for work.

- One thing I did, just before I started contracting, was to get a clean credit card which I use for all my business purchases. Keeps thing really simple. Plus it earns me airmiles! Check with your accountant first, but this is a great way to get cash-back.

- Also check out Xero. Really good way to manage your accounts, and most accountants understand it and use it now.

- Sooner you can pay off your debt the better. There's nothing like seeing that £300 a day coming in and knowing that there's very little of that going back out!

* Economy to leave sluggish growth - the relatively high growth rates now don't make up for the very poor growth rates we had previously. The longest recovery we had in Britain in the 20th century (in terms of GDP recovering above its pre-crisis peak) [took four years](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/sep/27/recessions-compared-1930-2008). We *still* haven't reached that point today, 6 years after the recession started. The US, which didn't use austerity, [reached it in 3 years](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/the-american-economy-bigger-than-ever/). The growth we're seeing now isn't a victory for austerity, either, because [Osborne slowed down significantly on austerity after 2012](http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/fiscal-policy-plan-and-recovery-explaining-economics) and it was only after that that growth started to pick up - suggesting that if he hadn't bothered with it in the first place then we would have much better growth. In addition, low growth in the past makes it easier to have high growth in the present, but that's no better than having moderate growth over the whole period (although it looks better if the high-growth period happens to coincide with an election).

* Rebalancing the economy towards the private sector - more an ideological than an economic objective, and easy to achieve when you have control of public sector employment and don't much care about the consequences for growth or the social impact.

* Reducing the fiscal deficit - concentrating on this is a stupid idea when the economy is barely out of recession, but in any case, [the head of the OBR recently said that ""Deficit reduction appears to have stalled""](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/09/what-osborne-wont-admit-growth-has-increased-because-slower-cuts). Is it a coincidence that this is happening at the same time as we are seeing higher growth rates? Doubtful. 

But seriously, I shouldn't be criticising Osborne - it's well known that only Conservatives know anything about economics, and thus that any criticism of Osborne has no basis in economics or the facts and is purely ideological. There is no justifiable criticism of Osborne, for he is the way, the truth, and the life: no economy cometh unto recovery, but by him.

And in most cultures where female circumcision is performed, male circumcision is also performed with equally unhygienic instruments.

I don't recommend private landlords, stick with a big name letting agent because even the nicest landlord will likely cause hassle. Like when the washing machine breaks, who's paying? That sort of thing letting agents have clear rules on.

The letting agent's website will let you search for the type of property, by location, number of rooms, price, etc. Pick a few you like the look of, phone the number for the letting agents, and ask for a viewing.

Go to the viewings, find one you like. Some are furnished, some are unfurnished. Furnished come with beds and sofas included, maybe wardrobes. Unfurnished typically come with kitchen appliances (cooker, washing machine) but that's it.

See one you like, tell the letting agents, and they'll take you through the process.

You will need:

To pay a one off admin fee if using a letting agent. typically £150/person. Paying this will ""reserve"" the property, so nobody else can swoop. 

Pass referencing. Letting agents will ask for your employment details, and previous addresses in the last 3 years. This is to check you can afford the rent, and have no convictions, bankruptcies, court orders, that sort of thing. If you can't pass that, consider private landlords. 

Possible guarantor. If you don't earn enough, or you've worked less than 6 months at your current job, they may ask for a guarantor. (typically your parents, student accommodation usually ask for this) The guarantor promises that if, in the event you can't pay rent, they will. It's a backup, last resort thing in case the tenant turns out to be a bum who moves in with no intention of paying rent. Otherwise nobody would rent to students.

You pay a deposit, plus the first month's rent, and then sign the contract and get the keys. The deposit is typically 1-2 months rent. My place is £300/mth rent, and I paid a £400 deposit. Deposits should, by law, be placed in a deposit protection scheme. But this is the landlord's responsibility, not yours. Letting agents will always do this, if using a private landlord you should ask early on about it. If they don't, you may need to sue them to get your deposit back. The protection scheme is to protect tenants from having their deposits stolen by landlords who refuse to give it back at the end of a tenancy.

That's about it. It's not complicated at all really. Just find a letting agent's website, find a place you'd like and ask them for a viewing. They'll take you through it all. Can't emphasise enough, that letting agents are much better than private landlords.
