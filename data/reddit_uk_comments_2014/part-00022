I would definitely rethink taking a mortgage out for 40 years, it's a long time to be tied into a contract. Also just because your bank has accepted you for a 200k loan shouldn't mean you should go for house that price, if you and your partner split or either one of you loses your job you might find it a struggle to pay it off along with bills etc don't forget your bills will go up as you will have to have home insurance, builders insurance, life insurance etc etc. If anything needs to be fixed which is bound to happen you will have to pay for that. 

I would definitely recommend you save a bit more before purchasing a house for 170 or look at buying something well under that.

All he had to do was accept that what he was doing wasn't actually helping his cause, that the police were not going to put up with it, and that his efforts would probably be better directed elsewhere. He was given several chances to realise that, and didn't.

The rules really are not that strict: No alcohol/drugs paraphernalia/weapons in your rooms (if you brought in cans/bottles of booze we'd label them with your name and keep them at reception), you must be out after 10am and can have your room key returned to you at 5 (though you must not return after 10pm, people often did not return at all thereby taking up a bed and not using it), 28-day maximum stay (we made every effort to find them temporary housing/another hostel place in that time), no visitors, and you must spend the night in the room. The lateness policies exist for a reason - if you're not using the space, then it needs to go to someone else.

Part of my job was helping people with benefits applications - I spent hours interviewing people, helping them with forms, phoning the DWP... I even offered CV writing help. People could volunteer to do some cleaning in the building in exchange for a £3 lunch budget, and we'd fetch it for them. We tried to help in every area of their lives, including access to GPs and dentists.

One main issue for people was the waiting/'reserve' list. We had people come in every day that we just did not have room for. We had 'winter provision' between November and March, allowing people to sleep in the reception area on freezing nights/handing out blankets, so that helps a bit. 

Also - the environment can be quite intense, and some people would rather avoid it. I regularly had to call the police/ambulance/someone to remove a loose staffie that someone had let in to the building (that one only happened once). Staff were regularly insulted, sometimes assaulted. ",0,1390468345,null,0,false,0,cewq36x,t3_1vuq2w,t1_cewq36x,t1_cew10px,null,1432068631,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt;  had Britain turn up to Kyoto and championed coal in the name of progress

31% of our power still comes from coal. Coal that has fuel miles because it's been shipped half way round the world rather than 20 miles from a UK mine.  

The closure of the pits was not an environmental decision.

&gt;Hey, that might even be why Labour - champions of the North and the poor class - didn't reopen them.

When you close a mine it can't be reopened. The build up of gas, water from abandoned mines make it too complex and dangerous to reopen.

That's why there was a call for mothballing - a process where a skeleton crew maintain the mine, in case it needs to be reopened.  

But out future energy security was less important than fucking the miners.  With all the interest in fracking, it's easy to forget we used to have access to billions of tonnes of coal that can be turned into oil.


Thatcher's policies were a disaster for this country - house prices are due to her right to buy policy, the overheating SE is due to the destruction of the North, our energy prices are due to a dash for gas powered stations that even Sir Denis Rooke (chairman of British Gas) said at the time would lead us dependent on foreign supply for domestic heating within 30 years.

In the context in which he was doing it, it was obstructing police work. And you don't have a right to talk to senior police officers whenever you want and for as long as you want. The police have every right to tell him to go away, which they did several times. 

&gt; Not warranting of a beating.

He didn't get a beating, he got cuffed. His version of events is extremely unreliable given his obvious bias, lack of video and vested interest in bigging up any minor injury he might have to sell a story, get attention to his cause and discredit the police. 

&gt; He was walking in front of them, filming them, so he was walking at the same speed as them, which by means he was not obstructing them.

They were consistently catching up to him to move him away as he kept slowing down and turning around, he was walking away extremely slowly, and continuing to do the things he was being told to walk away for. 

&gt; He wasn't, as you suggest, filming himself.

I actually said he was filming his shouting at police, filming his obstructive activities. The fact that he doesn't appear on screen in the video doesn't make a difference. 

&gt; All the police had to do was answer his question. Which they refused to do.

Which they have every right to do. You can't just walk up to police and expect them to answer any questions. Particularly once they've peacefully refused to, and you've carried on asking. What makes you think that the onus is on the police here? If all he was interested in was getting a question answered then he could have stopped annoying them, and sent them an email, called them, texted them, asked politely if they could message him an answer at a time that was more convenient. You know, like a civilised adult. 

&gt; And then they acted like thugs.

No, they asked him very politely but forcefully to move on several times which he chose to ignore. Then cuffed him and in doing so, he fell over. Not particularly thuggish.

&gt; After this, they ignored his suffering (similar to their actions in previous cases where victims of their ""restraint"" have died), and told him to ""fuck off.""

Well he wasn't actually suffering, he had some minor bruises. And given that he was whining at them all day, I don't blame them for thinking his suffering was a continuation of the same.

true,nnth,lfc68,,"Raheem is great on the break, he played his best games when we had Suarez playing up front alone and Sterling as a very advanced winger, almost playing off Suarez but on the right. With Sturridge in the team, I think it's too much of a luxury to have Sterling *and* Salah/Coutinho *and* Sturridge in the side because none of them are natural enough defenders. It's not that they won't work hard enough, it's that they leave space because they're all essentially forwards. This is what happened against Villa. We need to play 4 in defense and 3 in midfield, or 5 in defense and 2 in midfield if we want to play essentially 3 forwards. Personally, I'd like to see us line up like:  

--------------------Mignolet-------------------  
-Johnson---Skrtel---Sakho---Agger---Flanno----  
----------------Gerrard--Allen-----------------  
-------------------- Hendo---------------------  
--------------Suarez-------Sturridge---------  

Our best games this season have included one of two things: 

Allen, Lucas and Henderson in midfield, OR Suarez and Sturridge up front. Whilst Lucas is injured, I'd prefer to see us attempt this system, and go for the best of both worlds. Both Suarez and Sturridge have played out wide in their time, they're athletic, technical, intelligent, able to come deep to create space for the other, and seem to have a great understanding and so I don't think we necessarily need wingers at this moment, at least in the starting XI. Johnson and Flanno both are able to run the length of the pitch for 90, so I think this system will have enough width. Because most teams in the league play 2 centre backs and one DM, this system allows us to go man for man in the attacking third, and so able to hit teams on the break with Hendo's pace and energy, and the guile of Suarez and Sturridge.

Are the soaring number of Nurses who work for the NHS applying for hardship grants also 'self inflicting' poverty on themselves?

That's about £10 a week to live off. What are you supposed to do when your washing machine breaks or the toilet needs fixing or you fall ill and need medication that's £12 a week for 2 months? You have to get money where you can and not everyone can go back to mum and dad and ask for a favor.

Plus I'm confident that the skills learned there have helped me earn enough extra already to have covered the costs. ie. I could have lived the last 4 years as a pauper and already paid the loans off. But why pay an interest free loan off early?

Also, uni isn't just about the education. There is a general experience there that is great fun. You think of what people pay for holidays every year, for some people £2000/year is not exsessive holiday money. Uni was 10 years worth of holidays crammed into 4. Good fun times.

that's the ranking thingy 

When my friends tell me Chelsea bought this trophy and that, I see it is as us spending big to catch up with the big clubs and then making a big signing or two when needed. Next step I see is bringing in some of the youngsters to the main team and actually make money in the transfer market. 

We have the manager every Chelsea supporter wanted, we have the new backbone ready to takeover once Lampard/Terry/Cech do finally leave, and a whole damn squad (23-25 players) out on loan who can either be used in the first team or be sold for a tidy profit if it doesn't work out :) We're also well within this whole FFP rule so no chance of us missing out on UCL. 

Only thing that can truly screw us over is bad management.

&gt; Had Davies's teacher told him that when he was 10, would he have been tempted to try being gay? He practically jumps out of his seat, exploding in incredulous giggles. ""I reckon in my case, almost certainly not."" So what exactly is his worry? ""You see, it's not so much telling them it happens. It's explaining in a certain amount of detail how it happens.""...

&gt; ""But I'm changing. This is going to sound quite appalling, but nobody in my circle of friends in 1986 would have admitted liking Erasure, or would have been seen dead going out and buying a Boy George CD. Now I've got Boy George's greatest hits, and I love it!""

Bonus race relations hilarity:

&gt; Davies wishes our mainstream parties could debate what the Americans call culture wars, ""without everyone jumping up and down in a rage"". Why, only the other day he was having a conversation with someone at the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, and wished it could have been in private. ""Because he was telling me what it was like to be a young black man searched by a police officer. And I could have told him,"" he exclaims delightedly, ""what it's like to be a police officer, trying to search someone who didn't want to be searched!""

&gt; For a moment I think he's joking, but Davies really does see these two experiences as analogous. Registering my amazement, his face falls.

&gt; Julian Brazier : Has my hon. Friend seen the figures from America, where different states have a range of approaches to the age of consent and gay rights? Does she know that in those states and cities, such as San Francisco, where the laws are most liberal, the incidence not only of AIDS but of hepatitis A, hepatitis B and gay bowel syndrome [this is not a real medical condition] is vastly higher than in those states that have tight laws on homosexuality?

A 16-year-old boy may be troubled by his growing sexuality and be unsettled and frightened of girls. He may not be doing well at school and could be strongly pressured by the militant gay lobby. Therefore, he should be protected.

I'm in the process of becoming a UK citizen. I have to pay through the nose for the privilege to work and pay taxes here.

First visa: roughly £850, spousal visa, valid for 2 years, allows me to work, can't claim any benefits. I get fingerprinted and questioned every time I enter the country. I was fingerprinted and face scanned to obtain this visa. Even though I'm a Commonwealth citizen, I'm treated like some non-EU vagrant.

Second visa: roughly £850, ""Indefinite leave to remain"".  This means I can live and work and claim benefits. 

After 3 years of being in the country, and physically remaining in the country for the majority of that time, I am eligible to apply for citizenship.  Another £850, thank you!   I was lucky that I arrived before they changed this waiting period to 5 years.

I am married to a British national, my children are British, they go to school here, I've worked here and paid taxes. I don't get any special treatment, or an automatic right to be with my family.

Be realistic, the courts are likely to grant PR to any father that applies unless there are extenuating circumstances and any father to a kid after dec 2003 automatically has it if they make it to the birth certificate. 

PR doesn't give visitation rights, it doesn't mean you get a say if you have no custody: it means you get to be informed. Without PR there can still be child support due. The system is fucked but ultimately the legal benefits of marrying the mother of your children have always been there. 

You can't argue ""fair"". The world is not fair. Fathers do not have the same opportunities as mothers, nor do they have the same difficulties. The problem is when mothers unlawfully deny the father. Then the courts can intervene for the father, but even then it's not fair because they have to pay legal fees.

Because it's not enough to live off - especially if you have children. That's 7k less than the average wage. 2/3 nursees have said they want to leave the profession. Record numbers are applying for hardship grants and work related stress is at an all time high. Try talking to some of these people before you think that sort of wage is livable. Clearly you have no idea of how hard it is for them.

&gt; You said ""after bills"". Make your mind up.

Yes and go figure that people don't live off thin air after they've paid their bills. One off bills are not regular and come out of the blue - Breakages and wear and tear are not included as ""bills"" - neither are holidays, unfair charges, leisure activities and unforeseen circumstances. £10 a week is not enough to exist for an entire week for an adult who has a place to maintain. You don't include ""Aunts funeral at 48hour notice  - £45 return train ticket"" in your bills.

&gt; Buy a cheap second hand washing machine for £50 or use a laundrette?

Exactly my point - you've just wiped out 5 weeks of savings. Then how do you transport it, plumb it in, get rid of the old one. It all costs money. £50 is a LOT of money to someone living on the breadline and it's arrogant to just throw assume people can pull £50 out of their pocket.

PR means jack shit if you have no custody. It can help you gain custody, but if you never married and PR is never established don't expect the courts to be sympathetic. Not having PR doesn't protect you from child support either. 

The concept of the mother automatically having custody, to bring you back to your original point, is NOT archaic as it is under 100years old. FATHERS used to be able to take a child from his mother and deny her access. Even as a newborn. Is that fair? No. 

Is raising a child an even distribution of work? No- there are BIOLOGICAL differences. Is the system fair? No. Is it broken? Yes. Is it attempting to find the best solution for a child with parents who cannot communicate peacefully? Yes. 

Until fathers have the option of getting pregnant and giving birth, the world of raising kids will never be fair.

Ideally, BR would want to use Salah/Sterling on those wings as either wingers or inverted wingers, and Suarez being played as a 9 1/2 where he can drop deep to supply balls to Sterling/Salah and draw out defenders, or Sterling/Salah to overrun the defenders allowing for Suarez to get into the box and tuck it in.


The 4-2-3-1 relies on the two holding midfielders and the #10 that plays behind the striker. We would need a player with the caliber of Yaya Toure for this formation to be successful.

I don't pirate games as steam has made it simple and relatively cheap in comparison to any other medium/platform. Music I'm perfectly happy to pay for but almost none of it goes to the musicians or the main guys behind production, almost all of it goes to fat cats who do not want to change their business model (I don't think that Apple for example should take such a large cut for 'distribution' and then licence that for 5 devices).

I pay a netflix subscription so I watch what I want when I want without all the advertising but I refuse to go to a cinema and pay £10-20(depending on if it's 3d) for a film that I don't know if I'm going to enjoy. Then you get ripped off for popcorn, fuel to get there, food afterwards... I cant afford to go myself never mind if I had to pay for a family.

The blocking of websites is a dangerous idea full stop who do these governments and corporations think they are to tell us what information we can and cant access and asses.

Focus on how you fit the ""Descriptors"" from page 18 on. For the ""Limited Capability for Work Descriptors"" they *should* be selecting the highest scoring descriptor that fits you in each category (e.g. ""manual dexterity"") so work out which that is and describe how you fit it. Do the same process in future when you are filling in the ESA form that the Job Centre post you before a medical. Point are cumulative so answer for as many categories as apply.

For the ""Limited Capability for Work-Related Activity Descriptors"" from page 26 onwards you only need to meet a single one, but they are all quite high hurdles. 

Do not assume that the ATOS examiner will either accept your letter or read it if they do, so send a copy to your Job Centre as well (marked for ESA and with your NINo on it obviously).

Edit: Having re-read your post then one of the exceptional circumstances may apply (p.12) based on your mental health situation: 

* ""they suffer from some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement and by reasons of such disease or disablement, there would be *a substantial risk to the mental or physical health of any person if the claimant were found not to have limited capability for work-related activity*."" 

e,g. being made to look for a job could make your condition worse. If this might apply then you will need medical back-up before they will accept it. If you have or get a mental health professional or if your GP knows you well then ask them for a few lines outlining your condition, then ask them to state in writing if the statement above applies. To be honest this is more likely to work at the appeal stage than at the medical assessment stage but they sometimes accept it first time around.

Keep up to date with the case law around that; things regarding European treaty compliance are often overturned by higher courts, so they are often in constant flux. It's only been a month since the law change, so it has yet to be challenged.

Also, from how I read the article, it looks like you should still be OK so long as you're employed in the other EU state and display some degree of integration.

I don't really see any football reason to sign Dongou. We have Benteke Agbonlahor Weimann Holt Helenius Bowery Delfouneso, Kozak injured, Bent on loan, Burke Robinson and Drennan looking to push on from the reserves. Dongou undoubtedly has potential, but what is the best that can happen? We play him instead of one of our other young strikers that needs games, he gets up to speed starts scoring and then we have to give him straight back. If he has as much potential as they say - he made the bench alongside Valdes Alba Mascherano Busquets Fabregas and Alexis the other day, just 18 and has already made 4 senior appearances scoring twice - there is no chance in hell we will be able to get him on a permanent deal.


He may not have quite the same potential, but if we are looking for a quick young striker to develop, go for Callum Robinson. Like Dongou he has excelled in the NextGen Series, has pace, skill, knows where the goal is and he is already on our books.

I honestly blame media, especially social media when it comes to people feeling depressed when it comes to the transfer window. There are far too many people who claim to be ITK and link clubs with every Tom, Dick and Harry from around the world. People desperate to hear news lap it up like dogs in a desert and then become hysterical when nothing comes of it.

I can say this because I'm describing myself from as little as 6 months ago. I disregard everything now and I'm a lot happier with the situation. Liverpool Football Club are actively trying to keep their business under wraps so as to not be pipped at the post by other clubs looking to swoop in and capitalise. As far as I'm concerned, no news is good news.

Realistically we won't be able to sign any of the available world class players until we can show that we can compete with the best. Last season we finished 7th, it's not good enough to attract the quality of players everybody wants to see at the club. We are currently sitting in 4th and have made a vast improvement upon last season. If things continue to go our way we can maybe start to think about attracting the talent everybody talks about, but until then I wouldn't expect anything exceptional to happen in transfer windows.

Summary: 
The Queen and her family never vote or stand for election to any position, political or otherwise.

This is because The Queen's role is to provide continuity and the focus for national unity, and the Royal Family's public role is based on identifying with every section of society, including minorities and special interest groups.

With the removal of hereditary peers from the House of Lords in 1999, the Royal Dukes (The Dukes of Edinburgh, York, Gloucester and Kent) ceased to be members of the House of Lords and therefore became eligible to vote in elections, and to stand for election.

But members of the Royal Family do not exercise these rights. To vote or hold elected positions would not be in accordance with the need for neutrality. ",0,1390488404,null,0,false,0,cewu41k,t3_1vxxjb,t1_cewu41k,t3_1vxxjb,null,1432070421,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13

He claimed a crime had occurred. That doesn't excuse him for any future wrong doings.

&gt;I think the whole point is that this was a peaceful protest

Look, as I said, you don't have the right to ""peacefully"" get 20 of your mates and physically block every way I have out of my house just because you don't like the way I live. That's not something you're allowed to do, and if you try, the police will come and arrest you.

Similarly if you sit on the a road every time a truck tries to drive somewhere because you don't like what that truck's involved in, the police will come and they will take you away. That is as it should be and that is what the overwhelming part of this country would want, including yourselves if the situation were not this specific one.

**The Tin Foil Hat Brigade**

The Tin Foil Hat Brigade (or James Smith to his mates) is a Liverpool, England based act who uses Nintendo Game Boys to create his punk stylings.

Unlikely, those statements would have been written long ago. Yes officers are legally allowed to write statements together. However there is a difference between that and lying. We can't say that they lied, yet you've just completely accused them of lying with not a single shred of evidence. As long as it goes against the police, you're happy. You don't have a reasonable, considered approach.

Admittedly, this article is flimsy. We will probably never know how many times she got kicked. However, corroborating this article with Police behaviour I have seen at demonstrations and other similar stories, many of which have only come about because of bystanders filming, I can well believe it is true. "" 

Rigggght. So what you're saying is, your previous experience, which has nothing to do with this particular evident is proof that it did happen. Sure, we'll go with that.  I for one, having been part of demonstrations (admittedly moreso when I  was younger) and never having had any trouble with the police, and now being a police officer I find it hard to believe that they weren't provoked into such action for whatever reason. I know people who were at that particular demonstration and they didn't get into any bother with police either, odd that.

If it were true, would you condemn it out of hand? Or would you still think that what happened here and the outcome were reasonable?

If what's true? If the officer did kick her and broke her leg, well if they were legally entitled to then no. If they weren't that's a different matter isn't it. Police officers are each responsible for their own actions. 



I don't feel bad about accusing officers of assault at this stage. No one should expect to have their legs broken at a demonstration. And more extreme versions of this kind of tactic (going to the media to attack people prior to any sort of trial) are regularly used by the Police in this country. In other words, they use the sensationalist media to influence juries to get the results they want…

That being said, I'm seriously starting to question Liverpool's transfer office. They scout someone for 2+ months, then take upwards of 20 something days to hammer out the paperwork and negotiate...only for another club to swoop out from under and swipe the player. Which leaves us back at square one...WITH A WEEK TO GO IN THE TRANSFER WINDOW. Look at previous signings where we got deals done quickly, like Sturridge and Coutinho, they've worked out well. I'm feeling it's the same story all over again: Dempsey, Sigurdsson, Mkhataryan, Willian, now Salah. All players that wanted to come and were practically at Melwood, until they were signed up by someone else.

Yeah, you can all say theywere all greedy and wanted more money...but look at the one constant in the negotiations...

Unfortunately, with that being said, maybe we need to take a good hard look at our transfer policies/board and make some changes

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Ha, enjoy this comment from /r/chelseafc, then:

&gt;We are absolutely not doing them a favor. Look at it this way, Juan Mata is a ""luxury"" buy for Manure. They already have Rooney, Januzaj and Kagawa competing for the #10 and now Mata is added to that clusterfuck. He can't play wide as we all know so Manure are literally spending 37 million pounds adding to a position of strength. That is 37 milllion that can't be spent on a class LB, CM, CDM and a quality winger, not to mention a quality striker as vanPersie is aging.

&gt;Now with that in mind, even with Mata, Manure are gonna be hard pressed to get top 4 this season. No Champions League, no extra money, combine that with the fact that they'll have to qualify for Europa instead of their lucrative preseason tour, Manure could be royally fucked in the ass with no CL to attract top quality players and no money to fix their true areas of need. I truly believe this move will cripple Manure within the year and Mourinho seems to realize it too. This is akin to us buying Torres (panic buy that doesn't fit the team) but unlike us Manure don't have bottomless wallets.

&gt;P.S. Calm down your boners for Juan. He couldn't adapt and the Chelsea today WITHOUT him looks better than the Chelsea WITH him.

&gt;TL;DR Mourinho fucking over Manure and CLUB&gt; PLAYER

I love how selling a club one of the best players in the league is ""fucking [them] over."" Goddamn these guys are twats.

The stats included are for 0-60 minutes of game time, rather than 0-90, considering the fact that Juan usually got to play the first 60 minutes rather than the full 90. Use the ""Time in Match"" slider to compare full-game stats.

--------

What follows is very subjective, since I love the diminutive dazzler. No offense meant to anyone, just my personal subjective $0.02 worth: 

Some interesting points from the comparison above:

1. **Performance Score**: Juan is a distant second behind Hazard and narrowly ahead of Oscar. While his Attack &amp; Defense-specific scores are abysmal in comparison to the other four, when it comes to possession, he is galaxies ahead of the pack.

    **MY Understanding**: He is superb when the side wants to retain possession and play a careful, methodical, creative, technical game but does not offer much in terms of either attack or defense. Or counter-attack.

1. **Goals Scored**: He has scored none this season. Hazard has 5, Oscar has 4, and Schuerrle has 3. Willian, like Juan, has scored 0 goals in the EPL.

    **MY Understanding**: The stats speaks for themselves, don't they? Then again, I always considered Juan as a playmaker in the hole rather than a striker in the hole.

1. Shot Accuracy: Continuing along the lines of the previous point, Juan has tried 6 shots with 17% accuracy. The others are fairly ahead of him in this regard. His nearest competitor, Willian has 7 shots with a 43% accuracy. Hazard of course, leads the accuracy pack with 67%, while Oscar dominates the number of shots with 28.

    **MY Understanding**: Again, as with the previous point, I wasn't expecting him to shoot all that much, but his accuracy stats aren't all that confidence-invoking, either.

1. **Pass Accuracy**: This is where his stats **really shine** through. Longest average pass (18m), second highest in terms of key passes - cumulative AND average key-passes per game - behind Hazard, best passing accuracy (90%), joint-second with Oscar for number of assists. Keep in mind that these stast are *inspite of* the fact that he has played only 13 games in the EPL this season.

    **MY Understanding**: I did say that Mata is more of possession-favoring chance-creator rather than an attacking/goal-scoring midfielder, didn't I?

1. **Defensive Actions**: As expected, his stats here are abysmal. Oscar shines with the most number of clearances (12), Hazard has the most number of interceptions (9) and Schuerrle has the solitray block to his name. Mata has made 2 interceptions, two clearances and zero blocks. Willian has a 5-0-1 for his Int-Blk-Clr stats, while Schuerrle has 4-1-9 in the 649 minutes that he has played in 17 games.

    **MY Understanding**: Yeah, Mata isn't all that great at defending, but then we all kinda knew that, didn't we?

1. **Defensive Errors &amp; Discipline**: Oscar is the only person to have made one defensive error and to have one yellow card against his name. None of the other four seem to have any stats in these two categories.

    **MY Understanding**: Not much to draw conclusions here, so I'll refrain.

NOTE: There aren't any stats for the **Duels Won** (by which, I am assuming they mean aerial duels, of course) category, so I'm going to assume that none of these five players have won any duels.

#**Overall interpretation**: 
Juan would (be/have been) a good fit for a team that likes to dominate possession, pass the ball around and launch incisive attacks through creative, technical play - regardless of whether teams like to sit back or press up. He wold ideally be deployed as the creative force floating in the space behind the striker waiting for the ball, drawing defenders away from him with his magical possession skills and/or setting up the striker/strikers with his skillful passing.

* I don't know if that playing style corresponds to that of Manchester United or Moyes, but it certainly does NOT come anywhere near Jose's playing style that we have seen this season. 

* The closest playing style I can think of is that of Pep or last season's Benitez or RDM **after** he won the CL for us - which, incidentally, may also be why he was such a big success in the last two years.

He may be moving to direct rival but bear in mind that the club also did accept a bid from a direct rival. They too, like him, had the option of rejecting the bid outright. Transferring the blame entirely onto him for discussing terms is quite narrow-minded, IMHO. 

As for him staying and fighting for his place, he did stay for half a season warming the bench while he was at the peak of his form without as much as a peep. For him to do that - in a World Cup year, no less - was a risky move. Shame it didn't pay off for him. 

Two years may not make him a legend, but he certainly is a club icon - at least for me, anyway. 

If this transfer does happen, I will be deeply saddened. Like I said, I love the diminutive dazzler. I hope he does well wherever he goes, as long as he has two bad games every year.

Spurs Canada Members
 
As there is great interest from our membership on the recently announced THFC tour to Toronto, Chicago and Seattle in July, the Spurs Canada Board is sending an update to our members.
 
So far, the only information Spurs Canada as a supporters club has received, is that THFC will be playing TFC in
Toronto on July 23rd.  We have asked THFC for more information, and as soon as this is received, we will send it to our
membership via email and post it on our website and on our twitter feeds.
From past events hosted in North America, the following have been typically been planned for supporters groups, however without details from TFC and the host venues, we are just anticipating the activities at this time:

 
- usually a Supports Club event at a THFC practice takes place
- Supporters Clubs host one or more events at local venues (this could include Scallywags in Toronto)
- meet and greet opportunities
- designation of a Supporters Club section for purchase of tickets in the match venue. Normally a special code is provided to Supporters Club members. Note that all members are responsible for purchasing their own tickets, Spurs Canada will not be purchasing a block.
- other activities funded or arranged by the Supporters Club
 
For Spurs Canada members, the Board is working on some ideas for members only events, prizes draws and activities to take place on or around July 23. More to follow on this!
 
We are all very excited to hear more as the plans from THFC and the Toronto FC evolve and over the coming months, we will receive more concrete information to pass onto our members. Be assured that as soon as we receive information, we will send it along to you.
Thank you,
John McClelland

true,henry_tennenbaum,null,null,"I agree with most of the points already made, although personally I neither wear a helmet nor any hi-viz gear. 

There are a few additional recommendations I'd like to make:

* Download [citymapper](http://citymapper.com/apps/). It is the best navigation app available for London. It shows you both a fast and a quiet route for each journey and is indispensable should you use the barclays cycles until you've got your own. Forget the official app. In fact, download the offical app, give it the lowest score possible, then uninstall it and scream in the general direction of whoever's responsible for this abomination. Citymapper is better in every way. It shoes you the next docking station and the number of available bikes as well as the station nearest to your destination. 
* Buy a cap/beanie, maybe one from sealskinz (waterproof), if you don't have one. The hood of your jacket, if it has one, will probably limit your vision if it rains. It will rain, and if you think that it sounds daunting to navigate a three lane roundabout in the dark at peak time, try to imagine the same under heavy rain and without the ability to check what's behind you. Something like a [buff](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=buff) together with a cap will protect you damn well.
* Get mudguards. Depending on your aesthetic preferences, they might look horrible to you, but it's just nice to not to have a backside that's completely covered in mud after a 10m ride. Apart from that, some cyclists just plain hate you if you don't.
* Get two locks. Something like the [Kryptonite Evolution Mini](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kryptonite-Evolution-Mini-Unisex-Bicycle/dp/B005YPK9VQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390491384&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=kryptonite). Two of those. If your bike is cheap and you don't care that much about it, one of those together with the included cable will be enough to secure both your tires and the frame to a bike stand.
* As mentioned before, get good lights. For the back, I'd recommend two: One that's permanently on, one blinking. 
* Also mentioned before: Claim the road if there isn't enough space for the cars to overtake and you keep up with traffic. It's better to make them a bit angry if you have to than to endanger yourself.

In previous regimes (like the last 2 yanks) we over paid on players transfer fees and overpaid on wages. That left us in a poor position in the long term as we couldnt invest in the squad as money was tied up by paying the likes of Downing, Crouch, Cole and others massive wages which they didnt deserve. Even Glen Johnson was given a 100k a week wage, how many other full backs can earn that??

So although its frustrating to see targets move elsewhere, Im quite happy that we are now sticking to a sensible, long term plan which will help us in the long run.

No, stories get leaked and some of them (very rarely) are true.

On the local radio (who never report a transfer until it is 98% completed) they reported that Salah was flying out today to have a medical and finalise the deal, although hold on one minute, it seems another team with the correct ambition came in and placed the 12 million on the table for Basel without a second question asked.

Whilst we are most definitely a passionate and rowdy bunch, this gives you absolutely no right to dismiss the opinions of others simply because they aren't British. In fact, it just makes you look like an ignorant fool.

Furthermore your stance on Mata is frankly ridiculous. This is a player who we have essentially relied on for two years. He is a true blue and not a single part of me believes he wants to leave us at all - let alone for Yanited. Unfortunately his hand has been forced. Why? Because Mourinho doesn't fancy him - he isn't a Mourinho player and that is who's fault? Mourinhos, not Matas. I needn't explain to a fellow Chelsea fan precisely why Mata isn't a Mourinho player, as it should be obvious. Since Mata needs to play to secure any chance at a world cup spot and United are the only team offering him a home. A home that pays us 40 million and reportedly doubles his comparatively meagre 65k a week at Chelsea. Make no mistake - Mata wants this deal as little as we do, but as any person would, he has to look out for his career. Rotting on the bench at Chelsea is not an option for a world class talent in a world cup year.",0,1390492915,null,0,false,0,cewvv1s,t3_1vxl67,t1_cewvv1s,t1_cewtj0s,null,1432071480,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

1. Show me where the public has gained from this.

2. As apposed to selling off public interests like the tories did before. PLus read what I said, when things get out of control the government is allowed to intervene. Hence capping rent.

3. Yes they wont be because rent is so retarded. But people will have a slightly better living standard. 

4. Irony much when you are talking constant shit. Unfortunately I cannot find the article, but Ill keep looking. London is the most expensive city to live it, not the premier. Out sourcing work and selling our factories to other countries to save money i.e. pay the ceos and shareholders a lot of money while firing the workers and docking their pay. The lack of new houses making people fight for a place to live, so landlords can charge what ever they want.

5. And the rent for these places are over the top, the waiting queue is over a year long, and all for lack of housing. Like the olympic villiage. Sold to overseas investors and will be rented out to only the rich.

6. Making stuff up doesn't mean it's true, and again, most expensive city on earth. And yes they should be, who ever lives there should be taken care of. Living standards are a basic human right. I work In london, but have to commute because rent is over the top. Why can't I live there. Oh yeah cause tory cunts want the rich and poor gap pushed further. And your sound like a typical tory....

7. It's coming to a point where travel is so expensive that people will only be able to look for work in the surrounding area. Travel for some fucking reason rose above inflation. The big wigs gotta make more money.

8. I asked first, you are talking constant shit, typical tory. At the end of Browns term before the crash, we were in quiet a good place economically. Unemployment was low, were were doing well. Then bam tory bankers fucked it all up. And we ""gave"" them power... Even though they were not voted in...

9. Nice to change the subject away from the point you made. A banker fucks with you money he should be held to account. It's well known that the tories sit on the boards of some of these financial institutions and these banks provide capital to the tories. 

And you come off as a right wing twat. Who thinks that it's ok to take money from the poor and give to the rich. Because people are recoverying less doesn't mean the tories are doing a good job. They constantly suit figures for their own gain. Like unemployment figures, which should read temp employment. I guess you were ok with the tories upping uni fees, so less people can go to uni as they don't want to live their life in constant debt...

If I work for a company as a contractor and build them a fantastic product that makes them millions, I don't get any bonus at the end of the year.

Many contracts are not a full year, so the higher rate has to be factored in to the short employment time span.

It's very hard to compare contractor rates to fulltime wages.

The difference is that when I was living in London, I could travel all over the place: within the UK, within the EU, no visa required. I could go away to Paris or Rome for a weekend. I could take a week off to drive around the Lake District or the Isle of Skye. 

And that's just for short trips. What if you decided you didn't want to live in London any more? You can just move to another city, or even another country. No need to apply for work visas. Just up and move.

true,thecavernrocks,null,null,"You are missing the point entirely.  Everybody knows this and still overconsumes calories so you have to work out why they are.  In a laboratory, the laws of thermodynamic are relevant.  To the average person, who mostly just wants to lose weight and isn't a fitness freak, they need to be able to eat in a way that doesn't decrease the happienss in the rest of their life, their energy levels, and their output at work.  Many mental issues can arise from decreasing calories too much and feeling hunger almost constantly.  A type of psychosis can even emerge.  For someone who doesn't feel hunger anywhere near as much, to tell this person who would kill just to eat a morsel and it's only been a few hours since they last ate, that they should just eat less, is completely missing the issue.
 
Until you sort out the very serious and debilitating metabolic issues that cause an insane amount of hunger, then they're not going to be able to just eat less for life anywhere as easy as other people.  Going on about the laws of thermodynamics is meaningless.  It's like saying how do you drive from London to Manchester?  And then answering ""You put petrol in the car"".  It is meaningless in the real world.
 
Seriously it's so eerily like when a conservative MP says something like ""if heroin addicts want their life to improve they should just stop taking heroin"".  Obviously not to the same extent, but yeah some people underestimate just how hungry one can get when your body is extremely innificient at using calories.  The calorie levels they are expected to eat *for the rest of their lives to stay normal weight* in studies in world war 2 were classed as semi starvation diets.

The caliber of players we want are rarely going to pick us over Chelsea/City/etc. and their clubs certainly aren't going to pick lower bids over higher ones.

If we don't get it this season, then when will we? United are far too strong financially to fall away, and Mata will make a difference. The top 3 are already decided, Chelsea/City have too much money, and Arsenal look really strong and have paid off the Emirates debt. They will go from strength to strength. 

We will be stuck competing with Spurs and Everton. We are trying to be like Arsenal in the market but they were already established in the top four so they could do it.

I'm looking at this deal in the same light...we'll just have to see what happens with this guy.

That said, it is deluded and reactionary (in my opinion) to pin all your hopes on this guy like he was the key to our success this season. If he had come here and that was your expectation, I'd say there's a high likelihood you would have been disappointed. Now, maybe he gets better next year, but then we've got Suso coming back and also the possibility of Ibe becoming a factor on the wing within the next 6-12 months, so there will be a lot of competition there shortly. If we buy another winger, it should be a more proven character who we feel more confident about his ability to slot right into the team and make a big impact THIS SEASON.

Stop getting all your news from the Guardian. Maybe you feel mopey about the economy, or you're having some teenage angst or something, but the UK is a damn awesome place to be. I've lived in several first-world countries in the world (US and Asia), and the UK trumps them all overall in terms of quality of life, overall balance and greatness.

You get a free education to 18, world class universities, free healthcare, a very safe society in general, a healthy work-life balance blah blah blah. We just take it all for granted. You try being somewhere else where they don't have those things. We are also respected throughout the world. We punch above our weight in just about everything we do - especially sport, culture (TV, movies, music, art), innovation, science and engineering. We are still one of the largest economies in the world (and currently the fastest growing economy in Europe IIRC). We have a powerful military, nuclear weapons and experience fighting, and generally doing well in, wars too.

Sure we aren't perfect, and some countries don't like us. And maybe you can point to a tiny oil rich nation somewhere and single out a few things that are better on paper.

CEOs are important because they have a huge amount of power - meaning that even the smaller decisions they make could impact revenue by millions of pounds. The larger, strategic decisions far more so.

That means that, for a large company, the difference between a good CEO and a merely competent one could be a huge amount of money. If we're talking about a multimillion pound swing, large amounts of compensation become pretty insignificant compared to that potential difference.

Now, there are plenty of reasons that may not be *fair* - we can fix it through taxation or regulation. But that doesn't mean that it isn't a rational decision to remunerate top execs well.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Clearly the people rioting are NOT rejecting the capitalist market or making any sort of protest against it. They are simply exercising opportunism because of jealousy. They chose to STEAL the desirable trainers rather than earn the money and buy them. That's not rejecting capitalism or getting back a life stolen by the system - it's pure greed and opportunism.

Perhaps.  Though, as I said elsewhere, perhaps they've taken on board the goals of capitalism without internalising the means, or perhaps they've worked out the game is rigged and adopted the means they perceive the people at the top use rather than the more 'middle class' values you subscribe to?  Perhaps the abused workers in the developing world would view this differently than you do?  Perhaps they'd identify more strongly with people in situations more similar to their own than with the employers who abused them, and prefer their appropriating the products of their labour?  Perhaps they wouldn't be that upset about what happened to the latter?

&gt;Those people rioting aren't making any sort of stance about working conditions in those companies. If they are stealing the stuff, they clearly want it and support it. And most of them were wearing sporting apparel anyway while doing the rioting. Their best protest against working conditions would be to not buy the things they disagree with.

&gt;Looting JD sports doesn't hurt Nike, Adidas etc anyway. That stock was insured, and JD likely already paid for it, so their insurance company eats the cost and will pass some onto JD. Nike and Adidas will just ship more stuff out to replace it. Hell, maybe stealing stuff actually helped Nike and Adidas.

I sympathise with these two points generally, but see my point above and also consider that the rioting mob was not of one mind, they were individual people with individual intentions, actions and rationales. Class consciousness and feelings of solidarity take time to form, and in the early stages of revolutionary change, it's often the case that actions taken are unfocussed and misdirected - this _particularly_ applies in terms of international solidarity - one of the reasons fascism is always a danger.

I'll try to get the conversation moving in a slightly different direction as per the instructions of a commenter below me. We should have thrown the absolute fucking sink at Juan Mata. United will not be playing in the Champion's League next season and if we aren't either, then Everton or Spurs will be. We have so much more to offer a player like Mata and while we already have Coutinho he's still very young and mistake prone. As United have just shown, Mata is not the type of player you pass on if you have a shot. 

I'm praying this lack of transfer activity in January means there will be a big push to make a major signing in the summer, hopefully someone of Draxler type quality. As other people have said, I'm infinitely less concerned with losing Mohammed Salah the player than I am with FSG apparently penny pinching when the dotted line is in sight. There are incredible players out there that we should have be throwing our hand in for, not just sitting on the side dithering over a couple of million quid.

Likely choice?  You could pick up an older keeper from a relegation squad, there are actually some decent choices there.  David Marshall from Cardiff is only 28, and has had flashes of greatness.  Obviously not a top 4 keeper, but serviceable and gives Archer a few years to develop.  Not sure of Stekelenburg's form of late, but if Fullham get relegated  he could be a good temporary starter (holy hell, just checked their goal difference -26. nevermind)

I'm sure Chelsea didn't buy him to replace Mata. He's more of a talent for the future and improving fast. Good signing for any club. Sad to see him go, but glad we had him.

I think the Transfer to Chelsea was longer in the making, than the approach from liverpool. When Basel played at Chelsea, Salah asked Bernhard Heusler (President of FC Basel) if he could stay in London right away. It was thought of as a joke at the time in Basel, because it was clear that Salah wouldn't stick around for ever given his talent. Now i think it could have been more than that.

We can keep on producing young players and hope they are good enough to take to 4th but sooner or later we will realise it doesn't work.

However, they were already established in the top 4 when they did it and didn't have Man City around to take up one of those top 4 spots.

We are going to get further and further from the top teams the way we are going unless we get top 4 THIS SEASON. That is the problem.

It certainly seems our Salah interest was genuine. It seems our Willian interest was genuine. I'm only bummed about missing out on the former, but far too many people on this sub (not saying you but plenty of others) are concerned only by ""signals of intent"".

Lets go ahead and look at how Tottenham have faired after we basically wrote ourselves off in favor of them for 4th this year.

I think midseason signings are with a young squad like ours, generally more important than even the summer signings. Because this past summer my whole thought process was, ""Guys calm down, everyone is forgetting we've got a ton of young players who are maturing and improving every day, we'll improve just based off their improvements and our overall squad cohesiveness"". And look what's happened. Henderson, frankly, should be starting for England or be in with a shout. Raheem you could argue the same. He's delivered more end product than other England wingers we hear about. If Coutinho gets out of this rut we'll see the same from him. Sturridge has improved even. Suarez has. 

In January you don't see those same improvements jumps as you do in August or September. Which is why a signing is always a good thing. But I'm more discouraged by the fact it *appears* we aren't looking for cover/challengers at DM.

Frankly, I think Salah would have improved us but not in a way we even needed right now. We can score goals. We have pace. I think thats why we didn't budge on our valuation. Ultimately I think we were trying to head off competition for him in the summer but than Mourinho was a big cunt about it. As he is often.

Jet wash to get it all wet. Nice soapy water (cold not warm - warm water can cause the salt to react and corrode the bike more) and then a rinse with the jet wash again...and dry with a chamois or cloth.

does it not factor that our evaluation could be wrong? we've overpaid for a lot of players all not too long ago

&gt; This is real world where couple of million not spent on Salah, can be more efficiently spent somewhere else.

Well at the moment it doesnt look like that money is going anywhere else

&gt; Efficiency can be described as the extent to which time, effort or cost is well used for the intended task or purpose.

like signing a young, proven, CL experienced goal scoring player to help us get into the CL?

&gt; Time to grow up and see that running a football club is a business and not a video game. Every business decision has a consequence, and inefficient ones will see your business run into the ground.

steady there granddad..it was 12-16m... for a young, proven, CL experienced goal scoring player, not 35 like carroll or 20 like downing but an actual young, proven, CL experienced goal scoring player.

if anything we've done much better since they left and apparently were doing financially better

We have one of the best number 10's in the world in Mata, we have no need to sell him in this window, especially not to Manchester fucking United.

We have 3 AM's playing wonderfully at the moment in Hazard, Willian &amp; Oscar. They really seem to be striking up a great understanding at the moment, which is great, but that might not last forever, what if they have a dip in form, what if Oscar gets injured tomorrow, who would you want to get a chance to replace him? Juan Mata.

It's not as if Juan hasn't played for us all season, he's gotten plenty of minutes. No he hasn't performed to the best of his ability, but I'm certain a player of his quality could break into our team if given a good run, which he very well could get if an injury occurs. 

Now onto the next point. 

We're selling one of the best number 10's in the world to one of our direct rivals, a club we all hate here, a club that are no doubt going to be challenging us for major trophy's for the next few years.

true,rska884,null,null,"You're misunderstanding how American sports work (or just phrasing your comment wrong). They didn't spend 300m on two players; they commits 300m to two players in wages over the course of 5-7 years. They didn't trade them at a lower cost, because there was no purchase fee when they acquired them or when they moved them on, at least not in the sense we'd mean it in football. Comparing the players traded for gonzo on either end doesn't quite work either, as none of them became much anyway (in either direction) and the real purpose of the second trade was to move salary anyway.

Which brings me to the important point; your phrasing makes it sound like they spent 300m on two players, then received less than that in return for them. The reality is that they paid the players wages for two years, then the Dodgers took on the salaries. The only financial loss you could point to is the two years of wages, but both players did play (and in the case of gonzo, actually contributed decently), so now you're raising questions of how much they were really worth compared to their salary.

Bottom line is FSG didn't spend 300m on these players, and didn't take a major loss on them when the contracts didn't work out.

The sitcoms have been dry and stale for the longest time, yet some gems still emerge. We all know names like Faulty Towers and Blackadder, but who apart from a savant that squanders their time can tell you what other guff was filling the radiowaves at the time?

Personally I feel that Britain's Got Talent and other such stage shows, or whatever they wish to be called, are the worst culprits. Even before the backlash such as with Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror, I felt horribly alienated and repulsed by the very sight of it. So I never watched it. 

As it is, I cannot recall the quality of television before the late 90's, but these high-budget low-inteligence freakshows appear very recent to me, and I would support you in so far as they have warped what producers see as content that drives high viewing figures. 

The news sadly look a turn for the worse and felt compelled to follow the Murdoch model of focusing only on violence and greed to the point of calling it snuff. Still, you're on reddit.

I'm just saying there was a pretty vocal group of fans ranting after the Dempsey thing, just as there are people freaking out about losing on Salah. Also, much has been said over the years about what it takes to define a player as ""world class"", but I really don't think Salah qualifies for that label, at least not yet. 

But yes, I agree we need to bring quality first team talent into the club *right now*...we can build from our talented core of young players, but we need to shore up the squad with proven talent in the short term so that we're not a mid-table club by the time we start seeing major returns from those younger guys. 

The problem is I don't think Salah was necessary to further that goal, nor do I think it's particularly wise to spend money just for the sake of it...just to signal our intent, or whatever other rationale that gets thrown around for that sort of buying philosophy. 

If we don't bring in a player or two in January to at least *try* to fill some of the obvious gaps in the squad, I'll be as disappointed as the next guy. But for now, I'm just going to try to chill and maintain the faith.

Now, Dempsey certainly wasn't a huge factor at Spurs, but I actually think for £6m he probably would have helped us immensely in the first half of last season. We only had Suarez and Borini...

said this twice now, how am i making this sound like either of them? I have not once made any reference close to it?

we bought Llori for 7m he went straight into the reserves and out on loan, Borini for 10 and out on loan and he's linked else where, assaidi for 2.5 out on loan.. thats **19m** right there that we've spent RECENTLY and are not here at the club right now because we dont have need for them.. not to mention all the current players here that we have over spent on, some who arguably are not CL quality.. salah is the type of player we could use RIGHT NOW, you know, to help get us into the CL? none of those players can help

Obviously, get as much out as quickly as possible. Hopefully this gets most of it out, and then rinse the rest down. There are machines that can pump concrete, which would be ideal to use, but I'm not sure how safe it is to use them with setting concrete.

Failing that, [this](http://www.na.graceconstruction.com/custom/concrete/downloads/TB_0106.pdf) suggests that concrete hydration (i.e. setting) stops at temperatures of around -3 to -4°C, so I would probably run a load of pipe carrying something fucking cold through it, like liquid nitrogen, and find a way of keeping the room at those temperatures.

Beyond that, adding loads of sand/aggregate into the mix to the point that there's too much for the cement to bind together should stop it from setting solid, but you'll have difficulty mixing it in properly and into the corners whilst it's on the floor like that.

You're generally looking at a few grand for pretty serious injuries. It only gets substantial for permanent life affecting injuries.

We are playing Sterling on the wing, and he is doing very well. Thus, due to his good form, we are not desperate for a winger. Other positions, we are pretty depleted. 

On previous purchases, mistakes were obviously made, but we are also uncertain of their outcomes in the end. They may turn good, may not. Cannot comment on it at the present.

Just because Salah is quality does not mean that we MUST have him. Sure adding more quality in the team is always good, but we have other issues in the squad and I'm sure that why LFC was not head over heels in acquiring Salah. 

I don't agree that if we were to bid their valuation early they would have accepted straight away. Basel knew there were other interested parties in the market, and I'm sure they would have used it to negotiate a higher price for him. 

You are 100% correct that we do not have depth on the wings. However, as I said before, our concern at this moment is NOT scoring goals. We need to improve our defensive work and that means improving on our LB, RB, and DM. 

How do you not get this by now? Why over-spend on a position we do not lack, where we can use that money to strengthen positions that are lacking... Salah is a good player, but there is NO POINT in spending more than what we value for him, when we are not desperate for winger. We are scoring goals and creating them just fine. Offensively, we have made it work without a winger, why you want one so bad? It would be nice, but that's a bonus at this point.

With Navas and Zabaleta, I'd much rather see Chadli on the left than Eriksen.

We are close this year and have a real shout at it. I do agree that we have some really promising youngsters on the squad but we need proven players added in. The thing I see is that if we can get to top 4 this year then we will be able to bring in quality that will make us a threat for awhile. 

It's true that losing Suarez won't be the end of the world but it's a big step back. As much as I don't want to admit it, we just aren't in the same situation as United are if they don't make top 4. They just got Mata with no assurances they will be top 4. I think their long standing success and the fact that they have a bunch of money to toss around will let them still attract top targets.

We definitely aren't doing that right now and if we miss out on top 4 we will have to for sure hope we hit on promising talent in the 10-15 million range. 

While I love what we have been doing the past couples years and you can see a real sense of the type of squad that is trying to be built, I fear if we don't hit it this year we are going to take a step back for a couple of years.

---

&gt;**The Mermaid Inn** is a Grade II* listed historical inn located on Mermaid Street in the ancient town of Rye, East Sussex, southeastern England. One of the best-known inns in southeast England, it was established in the 12th century and has a long, turbulent history. The current building dates from 1420 and has 16th-century additions in the Tudor style, but cellars built in 1156 survive. The inn has a strong connection with the notorious Hawkhurst Gang of smugglers, who used it in the 1730s and 1740s as one of their strongholds: Rye was a thriving port during this period. Some of the smugglers, their mistresses and other characters are reported to haunt the inn.

then why aren't we linked or going after any of these players? we got 6 days. for a team with priorities, the manager of our team gave me the impression that he really wanted Salah by spending so much time on him, didnt he even go out to watch Basil play? yes I think he did

&gt; we are playing Sterling on the wing, and he is doing very well. Thus, due to his good form, we are not desperate for a winger. Other positions, we are pretty depleted.

he is, but what about the other wing? what if either winger gets injured like the trend in the team seems to be, are we really expecting sterling to play every minute of football for us this season?

&gt; Just because Salah is quality does not mean that we MUST have him. Sure adding more quality in the team is always good, but we have other issues in the squad and I'm sure that why LFC was not head over heels in acquiring Salah.

but brendan the man who decides the team, who plays and where went out to watch him play and essentially scout him personally, if the man who decides all that thinks we should spend all this time and effort persuing him that i believe, as he is the manager and the professional, that we wanted him pretty badly.

&gt; I don't agree that if we were to bid their valuation early they would have accepted straight away. Basel knew there were other interested parties in the market, and I'm sure they would have used it to negotiate a higher price for him.

then if we knew for so long then why did we try haggling with them for so long? if its apparent they're not moving im sure we could have coughed up the 11m thats being reported for him considering we spent almost as much on players we're willing to loan out.

&gt; We need to improve our defensive work and that means improving on our LB, RB, and DM.

then why not peruse defenders instead of spending all this time on Salah?

&gt; How do you not get this by now? Why over-spend on a position we do not lack, where we can use that money to strengthen positions that are lacking... Salah is a good player, but there is NO POINT in spending more than what we value for him, when we are not desperate for winger.

how many young talented, CL ready (experienced not mega priority) do we have? Sterling only became first team because we had nobody else good enough to take the position at the time. 

&gt; Offensively, we have made it work without a winger, why you want one so bad?

Our defence is such a shambles because half of it is out injured, on a good day we have a pretty good defence. Although its one of those sometimes/sometimes not things, teams are starting to get smart when playing again suarez and can at times make him ineffective for stretches of the game (not to say he doesnt seize a chance when he gets it), sturridge helps boost things but if we can get goals from other players besides SAS, then it takes a lot of pressure off our defence and us overly relying on suarez (and sturridge now he's back). 

&gt; We are scoring goals and creating them just fine. Offensively, we have made it work without a winger, why you want one so bad? It would be nice, but that's a bonus at this point.

there have been a fair few instances this season that we havent been able to produce shit, if a team keeps the ball away from suarez or he's having a bad day we arent scoring for shit (this was made worse with sturridge being out), to have an additional goal scoring player would be a massive boost.

&gt; Other positions are more important, thus spending over the valuation does not make any financial or even footballing sense.

I've seen reports at us willing to pay between 8-10m, chelsea have snapped him up for 11m (according to most reports) if we were willing to pay 8-10 the extra 1-3m really shouldnt have turned us off, considering there are a couple of players in the team that could be off in the summer. Of course there is the argument 'what if he gets to chelsea and flops??' there is a risk, but he's already an established player, for him to join and lose his current playing level and then flop would be very unlikely. the financial gains we'll make alone for making the champions league would more than cover for what we spent on him, not to mention the increased revenue we'd generate.

It's not a case of them 'wanting' to sign a player. There is a million players out there that they'd want to sign. They weigh up a number of factors such as current squad composition, age,  price, ability etc and then approve it or reject it so a comment like that is useless. 

What I'm saying is if Rodgers has to work just to get the committee just to approve a player, they should bloody well make sure that any player they approve is almost a dead cert to sign.

It seems every player they approve, they miss out on and that's not good enough. I really don't care about these ' let's not overreact, it's only one player' comments because simply put its not fucking good enough because it's ongoing now, despite us having a good January 2013. 

We'll never know the real reasons we didn't land willian, Mkhytarian, sala etc (we can say they chose other clubs but we should have wrapped all three up before they had a chance to choose other clubs) but if it's a case of haggling over a few million its unforgivable. 

This is the first window in a long long time where we have been inside the champions league spots for the duration and we simply have not used that leverage. If we miss out on fourth this year because of squad depth, it may be a very very long time before we see it again.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"What is clear is that your article is supported by actual facts based on very recent history. What is clear on that is that the work Brendan Rodgers and those around him, have been doing is showing results that can be empirically verified. Those are indeed excellent facts that everyone should look at again and after that think back to the period that lasted from the last season Rafa was in charge through to Hodgson taking over before Kenny replaced him and then ended somewhere after the first half of the first season after Rodgers' appointment.

I think it is pretty clear we are a lot better off and it is a lot nicer to look at our team and observe the position on the table with a lot more satisfaction.

Alas human beings are not satisfied ever. A positive or a negative, depends on the situations we find ourselves in. From my point of view, I am very happy with how the season has been going, a little less happy with how our reinforcements during the summer have been doing so far this season (speaking in general, would like to exclude Sakho who has been excellent and Mignolet solid who has been solid until a few recent lapses) and very unhappy about how well the teams around us seem to be doing. But that is football gents and ladies. Life isn't too different most of the time. Sometimes everything goes your way, other times nothing does, but most often some things work toward your favor and others don't.

I would love Liverpool back in the CL. I would love more players and better players in the beloved Red shirts. I understand the chance to get closer to that right now is one that will be tough to carve out again, even more so, if one considers possible departures of Suarez and Gerrard in the not too distant future. They are the cornerstones of our team this season and it'll be a very bitter blow when either of them won't be turning out for us on the pitch again.

I look forward to the rest of the season. I firmly believe that even without further additions LFC have a chance for top4. I would love it if we bettered our chances with a couple of additions to the squad but if that doesn't happen, I see very little reason to lose faith and expect all future matches with a fear or even panic. Like it or not, this was the minimum we wished for in the past three seasons and I for one hope the team can build on it. From the evidence provided even in this article, Liverpool has every chance of achieving CL qualification.

I trust in the squad and the technical team behind them to land us the top4. I think we've all seen plenty of proof to keep faith and be excited for the rest of the games. I firmly believe that is more important than the additions of Salah or any other player. I firmly believe that should make us excited.

I greatly dislike that.  Just for giggles, let's say he was (seemingly) about 30 Earth years in that shot, then when we see him next he's (seemingly) 60 Earth years.  Again, we're being conservative.  So what did he do for 30 years?  Assuming it was only 30, given that the Doctor seems to physically age rather slowly.  Or did he age terribly because of what he did?  Nope, he was the (seemingly) 60 years when he was pondering pushing the button.  It seems to be one of those little nuggets of info that just goes ignored.  Like everyone says Eccleston was 'clearly' newly-regenerated when he just met Rose because he looked in a mirror and seems surprised, as if he hadn't seen himself before.  This scene is sort of alluded to in Hurt's regeneration scene.  But in that very same episode, we meet a guy who has been 'chasing' down pictures of the Doctor, noticing the same face at different points in history.  The same, supposedly new face, which hadn't yet gone on these adventures.  So which is it, is it a new face or a face which is plastered throughout history?

And yes yes, in that episode he hadn't yet gone on the adventures, he did in that one second between leaving Rose and then returning and saying BTW, it is also a time machine, timey wimey and such.

I never suggested that the filter has been enacted in legislation, only that the *content* may be defined as being illegal in legislation with further legislation to come to enforce the existing law in a better manner.

&gt; so what is to be banned is not defined in law.

Except of course, when it is: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/part/5/crossheading/pornography-etc

2) If I am wrong - and I'm not - please link me to whatever legislation, the section and subsection which you believe defines what is to be censored behind a filter.

At no point did I suggest that the law defines what is to be ""censored behind a filter"".

I stated that the content that is to be considered as illegal is already defined in legislation or will be defined in further legislation, be it an Act of Parliament or an S.I.

The response posted by the OP seems to indicate that the Security Minister wants to make it illegal to use the internet to access content that is either *already* illegal or will be made illegal at some point in the future.

I don't have a great issue with enforcing the existing laws, which is quite different from some amorphous filter that is cloaked in mystery.

You can argue that so-called ""extreme pornography"" is a matter of taste, but our legislators have passed a law that defines what it is and not to be considered illegal in this case and that law is there for all to see.

*(6)An “extreme image” is an image which—

(a)falls within subsection (7), and

(b)is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character.

(7)An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, any of the following—

(a)an act which threatens a person's life,

(b)an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals,

(c)an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse, or

(d)a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive),

and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real.*

I'm studying EEE at the moment (2nd Year), in the first year we had a couple of lectures with the CSE guys, we shared Linear Circuits, Electronics 1. This year we share Digital Systems, Signals and Systems, Communications, Control 2 and Digital Design (Group Project).

Are you trying to say it's unfair because women have to carry the child and give birth? 

&gt;I was posturing why women automatically get PR and not men. It has nothing to do with a father being unimportant in a child's life. I also pointed out how PR doesn't mean jack unless there are also custody rights. 

Your line of reasoning makes men into sperm donors and walking wallets.

&gt;Women who violate court arrangements to suit their own agenda are acting criminally. 

Are they? I think you'll find it takes a long time for any legal action take place. Also, this is civil law and not criminal law. The mother doesn't break the law and can only be in violation of the court order.

My girlfriend lived in the Hawthorns, and as far as a hall goes room wise, it's awesome. Big modern rooms, nice kitchens, lots of ensuites, lots of double beds (!)... it's the nicest hall Bristol has, and it's literally on campus which none of the others can boast. However, it is expensive, and is a popular choice with international students, which can be a contributing factor in it being one of the 'quieter' halls social life wise. Depends entirely what you are looking for in accomodation.

I stayed in University Hall and I can reccomend it. It is the cheapest, smallest, 'crappest' hall the uni has, but it gets a very good mix of students applying (unlike, say, Wills, which is 75%+ very rich private schooled students). It is also so cheap. You need a bed, somewhere to make some half assed food, and perhaps a desk for the rare occasions first year demands work of you, take the money and have a massive social life.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Yea, I definitely agree that some of our dealings this summer were very strange.  I can't really figure out the method in all of it because it felt like a bunch of like for like swaps with no real gain in talent aside from the Sakho purchase.  In particular I didn't like the Aspas move and I think we overpaid quite a bit for Alberto.  I can't comment on Ilori because no one knows what we really paid for him, just that according to BR the £7mil reported price is way higher than the reality.  Aspas and Alberto cost us what... about £14mil between the two of them right?  It seems so weird to spend that kind of money on players when you're about to enter a new season with top 4 as the main objective and you only have 4 senior midfielders total + you regularly employ a formation that calls for 3 of them (of which at least one is confined to a very defensive role and you only have 1 actual defensive midfielder in the whole squad).  Aspas had 1 good season of top flight football and was the big fish in a little pond.  The Moses loan was weird too with Assaidi still yet to get a real chance to have a go for us.  we bring those guys in and loan out our own for no real net gain in talent or impact, you might even argue we ended up losing out with how Borini and Assaidi have been performing of late.  Suso too for a creative attacker, though I don't mind his loan so much because he'll come back to us a much more mature player and we'll reap the benefits of that.  It's odd that we swapped our youth for other youth and then gave none of the new youth a real shot.

The problems were there before the season started and they weren't addressed aside from at CB with the Sakho signing (and I'm still amazed we got him).  We got a bit unlucky with our fullbacks having 3 injuries at the same time and then it really got piled on with Johnson's long term injury.  It's just really confusing how we were chasing around more attackers when we have problems through the middle and could use another fullback and it was something there to see before matchday 1.

Who is really to blame for these transfers?  I'm sure Rodgers has input but we know he doesn't have total control.  The whole committee thing probably bogs down the process a bit too, which could explain why it seems to take us longer to tie up deals lately.  Is it something to do with how Ayre is looking to negotiate once we do have players identified?  I can't help but feel really frustrated, yet I have no idea where to target that frustration.

Of course not, no - that would be grossly naive.

&gt; People aren't yelling for death of x race because of pictures, and words on the internet.

No, but ease of access to eager young recruits, funding networks etc etc don't exactly help matters.

I'm sure you have seen the threads on this sub about the number of (allegedly) radicalised British nationals that have gone to fight overseas in various countries, along with the threads about the Home Secretary stripping citizenship from dual nationals.

Its impossible to say what effect stopping the spread of such materials will have, but there IS a problem and this IS part of it.

You could do far more to combat terrorism by legalising and prescribing heroin so that the money from addicts doesn't flow back to the Taliban in Afghanistan, but unfortunately there is no support for such a radical solution.

&gt; Not that I am disagreeing, but if that's what the criteria is, all it takes is someone to point to a website and say 'This could lead to terrorism.'

Part of the problem is that it's all so subjective, which is what makes it such a difficult problem to resolve.

Where does one draw the line between something that is in bad taste, something that is unpleasant, something that is downright dangerous and then something that should be illegal?

true,stile99,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; The one criticism I will grant them is that Moffat is not the best showrunner and his bigger plots are a bit too complicated for their own good and require dedicated viewing to follow.

Basically, this is my reason.  Moffat seems to attempt to bite off more than he can chew, and when he chokes, he just claims he meant to do that all along.  Every new week brings a new interview, this is my vision, no wait this is my vision, no wait this is my vision, actually just kidding, this has been my real vision all long, no wait, that was just a red herring, THIS has been my real vision all along.  Gets old fast.  I saw a meme once (no link, easy to find if you are curious) that described the Doctor as various kinds of cats.  Smith was the cat that suddenly falls off the back of the couch then looks at you with the ""I intended for that to happen"" face.  As one might imagine, that actually describes the character, which in turn describes the way the character is written.

Again, just my opinion, but anything actually resembling a plot that comes from Moffat's pen does so by sheer accident.  He then does his damnedest to convince you that accident was exactly what he wanted.

As noted, he's had a great run, and people can be for it or against it.  Fandom is even more polarizing than politics.  But one thing I think we can all agree upon is he's had his turn, and it is time to give someone else an opportunity.  We may like what he's done with his four seasons, we may not like what he's done with his four seasons.  But four is enough, there's really not much more he can do.  Great.  Thanks, Steven.

It's easy to say that people should have freedom and liberty, but a lot of people then get upset when people use the freedom and liberty to choose a different standpoint. If we're blocking material of ideologies we don't agree with, then we're not giving people the freedom to fully educate them and choose. 

By your definition, the majority of newspapers should be made illegal because they have certainly influenced people on a massive scale. But as much as I disagree with the shit the Daily Mail spouts, I'm happy to let it continue because they have a right to publish their bullshit views and the people who read it are free to get sucked into that ideology, no matter how much I am against it.

You are absolutely right, but I thought the main 'recruitment' path wasn't via this method, but more in communities and close knitted friends, connections via this path.  Not that online recruitment isn't a thing.


&gt; Where does one draw the line between something that is in bad taste, something that is unpleasant, something that is downright dangerous and then something that should be illegal?

This is where it is difficult - certain people have less tolerance than others.  People will jump up to defend people of another race, or gender, just to not seem racist/sexist.

There are definitely disturbing messages sent to people out there, but people getting arrested for tweets is ridiculous, and to quick haste, when there are other ways of dealing with it.  If it was the case of someone commenting and messaging repeatedly, then I would more understand, but it does seem to follow the pattern of 'I can't use the already implemented functions to stop this, I best complain to someone.'

But, as I was saying, steps have to be taken carefully.  I don't believe the whole internet is going to be locked down, but I definitely don't trust the government to be in charge of deciding on the legality of sites.

true,TheMountebank,null,null,"I would say that the mainstream media itself is, on balance, fairly neutral towards police. Of course bad news (mistakes made, corrupt officers) will always sell better than good news (investigations go well, officers do work that's expected of them). One bad officer is always going to cause some people to think that they're all the same, so it doesn't take many bad stories for every officer &amp; force to be tarred with the same brush.

The problem is that the government excels at manipulation of the public for things like this. Across the board, if a public service like the police or NHS is making noise about pay &amp; conditions, or they're under ""independent"" review then expect a barrage of stories painting them in a bad light. I'm not saying the stories aren't based on fact, but they'll be selective and the timing of their release is quite well timed to ensure the public loses sympathy for them at the right moments. There are plans this year to ""encourage"" GPs to open surgeries for longer hours, whilst being financially  compensated only a fraction of what that'll cost them. I think we can expect some ""GPs are overpaid, inflexible and dragging the NHS down"" type stories in coming months. They've already been set up for it with being put in charge of services &amp; budgets that they never wanted to be. Chances are statistics will be wheeled out showing how things have gone downhill since they were put in charge (with little mention of how they didn't want to be).

The other issue is that it's difficult for these services to defend themselves in the press. If they stand up for themselves too much, they come off defensive. If they employed the best media consultants/spin doctors, then the cost of that is highlighted as a waste of money.

Overall I think that those services should realise that they're never going to win and just plod along anyway, carrying on doing their jobs to the best of their ability.

true,michael2l,null,null,"I think Januzaj stands out so much because the rest of his side really lacks any sort of creative spark in terms of making an attempt to put the other team on the back foot.

I still think Januzaj also has stood because his efforts on goal have often come from nothing where he took on a player or two and then puts it in the back of net, whereas Sterlings goals have come via assists where he mainly just had to put the ball on target with a little bit of pace.

I think Sterling is more physically gifted in terms of taking on players with his speed, and he definitely offers more defensively in fighting to get the ball back, but I think Januzaj offers a good bit more in terms of his composure and confidence in the attacking portions of the game.  He certainly isn't as quick or as strong as Raheem, but he's just as tricky if not more so, and he is better at keeping his head up and picking out teammates.

At times Raheem can be a little bit too overly reliant on his pace, where he only has one default position which is go, and he very often successfully beats his man but doesn't really have a plan as what to do next.  He'll put in a cross to no one or find himself in position with no options often times.  One thing I really liked in the Oldham game was that he seemed much more confident and willing to slow his game down.  The goal he setup for Aspas and the subsequent Aspas header that hit the post, on both of those he stopped the ball once he got into the box, squared up his man got his head up, and then beat his man and put in a cross with a deft touch into an area he knew he had players to attack the ball.

He also needs to look to take players on to get in a shooting position, which is a little hard for him playing on the right, but it's something Januzaj does routinely coming from the left as a left-footed player. Raheem has missed a few sitters this year, and it seems to have affected his confidence where he'd much rather pass than shoot even when he should be looking to have a go, whereas Januzaj will take a shot when given half a chance.

**SALAH**  
Is it the end of the world that we didn't sign him? No.  
Don't get me wrong, I really think he would have been a useful signing. With an injury to Sterling / Coutnho (I know he's not a true wide man but it's the only way I see him fitting in the squad at the moment) we are suddenly seriously lacking in depth. BUT; with Sterling's current form and the creativity coming from Henderson et al, this is not a massive area of concern for me  
  
  
**LUCAS**  
I see the calls for a back up DM, and I have to agree. It's been mentioned time and time again, but we really struggle without Lucas. Our defence just seems so expose and opposition have so much space to run in to. We seem to be playing with a mindset of ""allow pot shots, they have to be lucky to go in"" but without Lucas, I feel then amount of time and space oppostion attackers have makes pot shots less ""lucky"" and more ""only a matter of time"".  
Having said this - I don't believe we will sign a quality DM. Here's my reasoning: anyone looking at potential move must see it as an opportunity to be a bit part player. Lucas is the man for that role, and we're looking for a replacement. Let's be honest, we are not going to get a world beater DM and in my opinion, Lucas is one of the best in the Premier League (arguably the strongest league in the world). Because of this, anyone coming in as a DM is NOT going to be a game changing every week starter...  
  
**GERRARD**  
I've seen a lot of people calling for his head, and in some ways I understand this. However, look at his performance in the Pirlo role for those few minutes Lucas was on vs. Aston Villa. I feel this demonstrated his value to us perfectly. He may get criticised for trying the 'hollywood' pass to often, but his passing range and ability is second to none in our squad an really allows us to open games up. He is always one pass away from opening the defence or setting sterling / suarez in to space. I don't think the effect this has on our team, or the mindset of the opposition, can be underestimated. For me, if we can find a way to accommodate him in midfield (I'm not a manager so I'm not even going to try and get in to the mindset of an armchair football manager plan) he still has a vital role to play for this season and possibly 2/3 more  
  
**COUTINHO**  
Yes, he's not been in the greatest form in the final 3rd. Yes, his shots are frustrating. No, I'm not entirely of the mindset of some others here that ""once he scores one, he'll start banging them in"" (see goal vs. Everton for reasoning). However, I think he is the unsung hero of our team. We all expect great things in the final 3rd (and its understandable given the start of his career with us) but he is still you. Cliche I know. However, I think his contribution is far more telling than any stats can tell - something people on Reddit seem to read in to far tpp heavily. Coutinho is THE link in our transition play. He is the man who gets the ball, turns and runs. Beats the first man almost inevitably with quick footwork, and opens space to get play moving forward. I agree entirely that his final pass is off at the moment, but that doesn't take away from the work he is doing in the first 20% of the opponents half. In my opinion he is the player who consitently get play moving forward, opens space for the attacking transition, and offers options for our transitioning midfield. I really do feel that if he is dropped we will miss this, and in games he's been missing from previously our attacks just seem laboured and sluggish to get started - making them too predictable as the opposition have a chance to set themselves and assess where we are building from.  
  
**MIGNOLET**  
Yes he's had a few mistakes lately. He's young, and our defensive performances have been borderline shambolic. In amongst these mistakes he's still been pulling off quality saves but there's only so much he can do when we're conceding 4/5 guilt edged chances a match. This area does not concern me at all  
  
**STERLING**  
Boy has my opinion changed. Last year, even in his rich vein of form, I felt he was still overrated purely because he was young and local (don't get me wrong, I felt he was was good, just not the messiah some people made him out to be). The start of this season only reinforced my opinion. However, recently he has really shown a change in all departments- attitude, creativity, physicality, touch. I've been hugely impressed. Much like Coutinho, I feel his impact comes just as much in allowing us to transition in to attack as it does in the ""stats that count"" such as assists and goals (even though he's been doing well there too)  
  
**MOSES**  
Fuck off  
  
**DEFENCE**  
Weak from set pieces. Everyone can see this, and I think we all have sweaty palms every time there is a set piece near the box. This has been emphasized massively by consistent injuries though. Sakho and Agger have been solid this season (although there are definitely faults to both) and we all no how good Agger can be.Unfortunately, through both rotation and injury, we've never seen any get a solid run. A Skagger/Skakho/Sagger combo could all work leaving an effective sub on the bench, but fitness has never left this possibility. Kolo is also a solid back up but has been left far too exposed by some of our defensive midfield problems when he has played  
  
**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
  
We're playing well. I FUCKING love watching this team. Compared to the drab of the last few years it's brilliant. If we can iron out the defensive mistakes and solidify a consistent back line we still have a great chance of top 4. Yes, there have been disappointments, but look at the performaces against some of the top teams - Man City, Spurs etc. We have been one of the best teams this season no doubt, it's just areas of naiivety that have cost us. Look at Chelsea - if you watched highlights of all our games vs all their games you would say liverpool are the better team. They just have more experience of how to perform at the top level. If we can keep it up, we'll be there soon and that's what really excites me. Imagine a team with as much flair as ours, couples with the experience of that winning mentality. Frightening.  
  
Recent results have cast a shadow, but look at the season as a whole. This is the best we've been in years, and with Brendan, FSG, team spirit and current youth prospects, the future is nothing but bright. Even if we don't make top 4 this year (which would be a massive disappointment - never would have said that at the start of the season) we look to be well on the way to getting there soon.

Steven Moffat could not have known that he would create The Warrior for the 50th anniversary, an incarnation of the character that came between 2 already established versions of the character. How could anyone plan for something as big as that 2 to 3 years ago? I know 3 years ago I wasn't planning for any of the things that are happening today, so how could Moffat? How could anyone plan for that sort of thing? Tell me, 3 years ago, would you have even thought that Matt Snith's Doctor was the last regeneration? Cause I sure wouldn't have. Also, as stated in the 50th, Matt Smith's Doctor is the one that forgets. He has tried his hardest to forget about the time war, he forgot about how many children there were on Gallifrey that day. He also seemed to forget what ""Bad Wolf"" is after seeing his confused face after it is mentioned. So who's to say he didn't forget about that regeneration up until seeing him in the series 7 finale. And that may be the reason he talks about regeneration in Let's Kill Hitler and Nightmare in Silver (though in LKH, since the hologram says ""regeneration disabled"" instead of ""no more regenerations"" goes back to my first point of not planning for such a large and show changing decision). So what it comes down to is that this is a little flaw because Moffat came up with this show-changing idea and not planning for said idea 2-3 years in advanced",0,1390518019,null,0,false,0,cex844j,t3_1vuro8,t1_cex844j,t1_cew1pq7,null,1435520204,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,sneakyi,lfcflame,,"They spent the Torres/ Babel money on Carroll.

They are fine with spending transfer income on players. 

They are cheap when it comes to putting their hands in their pockets to spend their own money.

They loaned the club 40 million which took the club's debt to 80 million.

They could have turned that loan into equity and cleared the debt off the club. Many owners such as Abramovich,  Mansour and Al Fayed have done this for their clubs.

FSG will not do this. The debt they put on the club was something they promised they would not do when they bought the club.

They have a plan to make the club self sufficient.  That is great but they have no will to put large sums of their investment firms money into the club.

That's why we are known to be trying to be successful on the cheap. Not a bad thing. 

If it works.

What I don't get is we HAVE the money to pay these transfer fees but we continue to try to save 1 or 2 million by being stubborn. Don't FSG realise that if we get CL football next season we will benefit hugely from the financial benefits that come with just qualifying for that competition? Not to mention much bigger names will be easier to attract with European football. What will the money saved by missing out on targets like this be good to us in the summer if we have to wait another whole season to have the chance to qualify. Just remember, Utd and Tottenham are having their worst season in a while. They'll probably be a lot stronger next season why we continue to stay the same or get weaker if Suarez decides to go. FSG are tight fuckers, just remember they cashed in big time late last year with the Boston Red Sox winning the Baseball World Series. I just think if they really cared about the success of LFC they'd have payed the £12m (which isn't breaking the bank when it comes to football these days). Just remember, we've missed out on many targets because of there methods of saving money. Yes bargains are out there but not every transfer you can screw the other team.

true,apr400,null,null,"&gt;Sure, it's a stupendous pay rise, but I'm surprised the article doesn't 
&gt;even guess how much it would cost to raise the staff pay to a living wage.

The thing that it irritating most of us is not that we are not getting payrises, (although it would be nice if salarys had vaguely kept up with inflation instead of plummeting) so much as the fact that the top brass are getting significantly above inflation rises almost every year. It shows a real lack of any kind of care or consideration for those below them whatsoever. Sure if they didn't take the huge rises and instead it was distributed amongst everyone then it would be a fraction of a percent, but that would be more than they are offering now, and there would be far less of a feeling of them and us. 

It is also very irritating that they take all the credit for making our Universities leading research insitutes. No, that's us that do that, day in day out submitting proposals, doing research, and so on whilst the University centre skims ever greater amounts (50%+) off our research income and provides very little other than increased bureaucracy in return.

We will reach breaking point soon I think. We are well on the way to doubling the number of students for the same number of staff. Teaching loads, and admin loads seem to go up every week, and lecturers are having to work longer and longer to keep up. There is absolutely no slack in the system whatsoever, no time to sit and think up the new research ideas, no morale amongst the academics, just a feeling that the Uni administrations are actively trying to make our lives harder.

There are machines that can pump concrete, which would be ideal to use, but I'm not sure how safe it is to use them with setting concrete.

Where to? What's the access like to that room? You've got a few cubic metres of concrete to get rid of in a confined space. The machines that pump concrete pump it with an inhibitior in it then mix an accelerant in with it so start it setting once it's outside the machine. The life span of a (very expensive) pump pumping setting concrete can be counted in minutes.

&gt;Failing that, this suggests that concrete hydration (i.e. setting) stops at temperatures of around -3 to -4°C, so I would probably run a load of pipe carrying something fucking cold through it, like liquid nitrogen, and find a way of keeping the room at those temperatures.

Quick! Get the liquid nitrogen! Into the confined space.... so that no-one else can get anywhere near the room without both breathing aparatus and protective clothing! And hook up a heat exhanger and piping system to draw heat aw... what do you mean it's set already?

&gt;Beyond that, adding loads of sand/aggregate into the mix to the point that there's too much for the cement to bind together should stop it from setting solid, but you'll have difficulty mixing it in properly and into the corners whilst it's on the floor like that.

Ok, so your last ditch plan to get rid of the concrete is to MAKE MORE CONCRETE? You'd need about 4 times the amount of sand before it would actually not set. Plus you'd rise the level past all the signalling switches which are at present possibly savageable......

This was a piece of regulation brought in by Thatcher; and I think it's actually a good one, in that it _enforces_ a freer choice, and supports the local traditional styles.

One interesting, and unexpected, effect of this was that the big breweries sought out microbreweries, so that they could claim to be hip and trendy, whilst not having to sell the competitors brew... this lead to a resurgence in the small brewery scene.

It didn't apply to non-brewery owned pubs, but as a result of that regulation, it is perhaps expected that most pubs have a couple of pumps for real ale - certainly, outside of a 'wine bar' or a 'cocktail bar', I can't think of a pub I'd go to that doesn't have a couple of real ale pumps.

There are two things both described as Help To Buy.

One applies only to new builds.  You put down 5%.  The government buys 25% *(and retains the equity on that 25% on disposal)*.  And after year 5 you start paying the government for its share.

That scheme tends to attract semi-decent rates, because the banks treat you as having put don a 30% deposit.

The other scheme you put down 5% and the government insures the rest.  But they attract a rate of around 5%.  As far as I can tell just because they **can**.  The banks don't seem to be competing, they all just happened to choose to charge the same rates.

Help To Buy **has** caused an increase in prices, but not in the direct sense.  But everyone talked it up so much and claimed it would cause a huge housing bubble that people hiked the prices.

In reply to extra help, honestly there's not much around, and it sounds like you've sorted it out yourself. It you're not at risk of homelessnes then the best thing to do is tighten your belt/go in to your overdraft and wait for the money to come.

Yeah - it's like this one. The government has 20% equity in the house and put the money up for it. There is no charge for this for 5 years after which a fee is levied each year (which grows year on year).

So I'm hoping that the house value won't go up too much over those 5 years (because if it does, their 20% will be worth more and I'll have to repay more), and I'm hoping to save up enough to nuke it immediately at the end of those 5 years so that I don't have to pay fees on it either.

I put down a lot more than 5%, so I managed to hit the best rates that I think were possible. The downside was living with parents for far far longer than normal to be able to save up the deposit.

* Mata signed for £23.5m, and now reportedly has been sold to United for £35m, although this point is probably mute as CSKA Chelski are not a team focusing on their books too much.

* And lastly, being pure speculation, maybe this transfer will warm relations between the clubs for a future move of Rooney

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Right, but unlike in the American model of shows where it's all about writers acting as a team, the showrunner has a titanic, if not the *exclusive* influence on the show.

You see, in America writers work together in a ""writers' room"". Here a group of up to about 12 writers sit down and loosely block out what they want to do with a show. While creation is usually spearheaded by two or so ""lead writers"", all writers will get input on the show, and all leave these meetings ""on the same page"".

Doctor Who doesn't use this model. In fact, it's extremely rare for all the writers on the show to actually all meet one another all at the same time.

Instead, the BBC will solicit scripts from a host of writers (sometimes ""celebrity"" authors like Stephen Fry or Neil Gaiman), who send them in. While these authors usually will have a sit-down with the showrunner about what they want from the show, rarely do they speak to any of the other writers or have significant say on what the rest of the show will be like outside their episode.

From there, the episode sent in is edited by the showrunner, sometimes to the point where it barely resembles the source material.

Ultimately the showrunner has the most control on the show with this model. They end up doing a lot of the footwork and the product onscreen is by a large part directly by their design.

For instance: All writers were kept in the dark on what Clara was in Series 7b. Because of this, a personality for her was never fully established, let alone agreed upon.

And even if we ignore the fact that the showrunner already has the majority of creative control, Moffat has still personally written 40% of all Doctor Who stories since 2010. That's more than any other writer on the project. 

Right now, Moffat is dominating the show and for many his formula's getting a bit stale.",0,1390527015,null,0,false,0,cexc9ha,t3_1vyy4g,t1_cexc9ha,t1_cexbuho,null,1432080165,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Not only do you have to be the best applicant available, but also better by such a margin that the employer will overlook their fears about your degree. That's a lot to ask.

I'm a very attractive retail candidate and even I found it difficult getting an interview. Heck, I lucked out at GAME. They were a small store hiring 4 people and got 600 applications. So they just invited everyone to giant group interviews and invited the best 10 to one-on-one interviews later. They didn't look at my application until I'd already impressed them in the group stage. Starbucks overlooked it because they have a culture of young employees with high staff turnover. It's less of an issue for them. But I've also seen my manager reject others for being overqualified so I'm not particularly reassured.

Employers fears aren't unreasonable, either. Graduates don't want to be there. They're looking to move on and up the ladder. I am too. I turned down a promotion at Bux two months ago because next week I go part time to start my Masters. How can I blame employers for being wary?

Well Deloitte just released revenue (before expenses), LFC made 240m Euro. 

If we take into account losses,  £49.3 million (2010-11), to £40.5 million (2011-12) and then to £14.9 million (2012-13) (FABULOUS), 
We are definitely on the right course. FSG's goal is financial stability and increasing revenue streams. This summer we will definitely have more money to spend.

Are we going to sit back , absorb pressure, then fast counters? (need to play more box to box midfielders, quick wingers)
Are we going to go mano a mano (high work rate players and flood the midfield)?   
I would suggest that we need physical ball winning midfielders (sandro, paulinho, capoue) that are going to manhandle their smaller midfielders and midfielders who are tough enough to go up against toure, and our wing backs keep theirs honest.  
Its possible to win, not likely but very possible, we have to be clinical on our finishing, especially from setpieces.  
I think playing a quick counterattacking setup is how we should start the game, my lineup would be  

------------------Lloris----------------  
walker----chiriches------verts----rose  
------sandro---------paulinho----------  
lennon--------eriksen---------chadli---  
--------------adebayor------------------    

what i like about this lineup is that anyone of the 4 central defensive players (chiriches, verts,sandro,paulinho) are capable of making deep runs into man city's half; we have experienced box-2-box ball-winning midfielders in Sandro and Paulinho; our attacking wingers have enough pace to trouble the opposition on quick release passes into channels up front; allows eriksen to play either centrally as deep as he wants to pick up the ball or just of Adebayor's shoulder.  
If we convert from setpieces ( we have enough training ground time to get this right) I see no reason why we cant win 2-1...and stake our claim for a top 4 finish   
I cant wait to see this lineup with a swap out of lennon /chadli for lamela/townsend

Mostly because he tends to drift out wide a lot, while Sterling tends to cut inside, but I just don't believe that dribbling stat.

Somewhat related, Januzaj is a lot more direct in attack. He gets the defenders on their heels, and uses his pace a dribbling skills to catch them off balance, whereas Sterling tends to drag the tempo down a lot more, and not utilizing his pace as well (he has gotten a lot better in this regard recently though).

Januzaj is also a much, much better finisher than Sterling. All of Sterling's goals have been tap-ins, and some of them still only barely went in. Januzaj has had some great attempts from distance, just missing the target, but that's still only recorded as a shot (as you can see he has more attempts but less accuracy).

I think Sterling can be a good, possibly great player. Right now though, Januzaj definitely looks the better talent. These stats do not in any way indicate otherwise.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt;Scoring goals isn't our problem.

No, it's not a problem but I am a little concerned about the fact that Suarez and Sturridge are our only clear goal-scoring threats at the moment. But, you're right, I'm not too bothered about missing out on Salah; There's no guarantee that he would've provided that additional goal-scoring threat.

I think a lot of the uproar over missing out on Salah is not necessarily the player but what the ""missing out"" represents: We may not get anyone this January.

&gt;i'm being pessimistic sure, but can any of you honestly see us getting into the top four in the next few years unless we crack it this season? I sure as fuck can't.

Totally agree with you here. It's not pessimism; It's cold reality.

I want to echo your thoughts: It's no secret - Each year we miss out on Champions League the separation between the Haves (Champions League clubs) and the Have Nots (non-CL clubs) will continue to grow and it will become more and more difficult to gain that all-important CL spot. With the table as tight as it has been, this season **is** one of our best chances in recent memory to gain that elusive CL spot. If we miss it this season I think we'll find ourselves on the outside looking in (i.e. 5th, 6th) for a number of seasons. It's imperative that we get 4th place *this* season. And we need another solid and hungry player or two this window to freshen up the squad, add a bit more spark, create some competition, offer some inspiration and give us that extra push to get us to where we need to be. I hope something happens.

(The very thin silver lining is that we do have a lot of young players who can develop and grow into players who can get us 4th place a few years down the line: Sterling is only 19, Flanagan 21, Sakho 23, Brad Smith 19, Coutinho 21, Henderson 23, Sterling 19, Ibe 18, even Sturridge is relatively young at 24).",0,1390534851,null,0,false,0,cexfsl1,t3_1vycpy,t1_cexfsl1,t1_cexbghv,null,1432081903,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3
