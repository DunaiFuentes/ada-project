true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"Which parts specifically do you disagree with?

&gt; I would like to hear your thoughts on why Di Matteo did better than Avram Grant

Because he won the Champions League. And the FA Cup - so 2 trophies more than Grant.

Luck played a part, as I've admitted, but this is a results business, and Di Matteo got the result. Also, it's not a direct comparison - Grant had a stronger squad,  whereas Di Matteo had arguably the weakest squad of the Abramovich era. Di Matteo's achievement in taking this team, who were down and out in the competition, to the final, through adversity nothing like what Grant faced is more of an achievement to begin with, and that's without even considering the final. 

To be hypercritical, you could say that Grant should have won that final, or even that he should have managed the players better - who's to say that better management of Drogba would have led to him not losing his head and getting sent off, preventing Terry from missing the penalty in the first place? The players of the 2011-2012 campaign have heavily credited Di Matteo for the way he inspired them, and created such a strong team spirit - which was *such* a key part of us winning that trophy, and it is not something anybody can do. You make it sound as if Di Matteo bumbled his way to that title, that it was all down to luck, when that is not remotely the case.

&gt; his form sucked in the league and his cup form was only slightly better than other Chelsea managers

Yes, we've established that. We've also established that there are a few extenuating circumstances, and I maintain that ultimately, Di Matteo winning the Champions League overrides that all.

&gt; I am not saying that what Di Matteo did is ""no big deal""

It really does come across like you are.

To me i want LvG because of all the candidates that we have been linked with (Prandelli, De Boer, Yakin, Tuchel, Capello even Spalletti has been mentioned) LvG is the only one who can potentially change the entire culture of a club from top to bottom.  Considering our current culture is very much as in transition as our management position has been of late having someone who can instill a culture that positions the club for success now as well as down the line is massive.

So C x 2 -10% (C x 2) + 32

The issue is not that the quality isn't there, it's that the back line has to gel together and work as a unit. Look at Arsenal--the reason their defense was so solid earlier the season was that their backline finally started clicking after having played together for a bit--it's not as if Mertesacker and Koscielny are very far ahead of Agger and Skrtel, if at all. Our issues right now will not be solved by just bringing in more expensive players, but by working on our defensive solidity in the coaching and practice department. 

That and possibly some better fullback competition. I think Johnson could definitely still have a few seasons of quality left, but I think it would be a good idea to bring in someone to provide competition for the spot.

You can go direct from Peterborough to Nottingham, or it's a short walk from Newark NG to Newark Castle and you can go direct from there to Nottingham. It takes less time to go Newark but you don't have to walk in Peterborough. 

(You could also go direct from Edinburgh to Derby and then to Nottingham, but the CX between Derby and Scotland is *always* late (I've never seen it less than 15 minutes late, mostly they're around 35/40 minutes (there's a good reason, they go between Scotland and the west country, Aberdeen to Penzance etc)) and also it's *really* busy because it goes through about 10 major cities.)

National rail will not direct you through Peterborough or Newark NG, but they're really good for advance tickets to and from Scotland, so it'll be cheaper. 

The 27 bus leaves Nottingham station and gets to Keyworth about 1/2 hour later. 

You should bear in mind that the journey from Edinburgh to Nottingham will take about 5 hours, then with the bus on top and 15 minute prompt arrival I'd leave at least 6 hours before the interview starts. 

Edit: actually, thinking about it, I would get the sleeper, unless you want to stay the night. Get yourself an advance sleeper ticket to Euston, then another one from St Pancras to Nottingham. You'll be in London at about 7, trains take about an hour and a half to Nottingham from London and then you can go from there back up north again. You can book tickets for the trains 6 weeks before travel time, but advance come 5 weeks beforehand, so book them in March if you go by rail. It should cost you about ¬£60, for the trains.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"&gt; I disagree with you attributing a huge amount of success to a person who had a poor record of games but happened to luck his way into winning the right ones.

This is pretty much textbook devaluing his achievement, no matter how many times you insist that you think ""winning the CL was good"". Just repeat that back to yourself... do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? Winning against Everton at the weekend was good. Getting a B in an exam is good. I just had a good hot chocolate. Winning the Champions League is **fucking fantastic**. It was the greatest night in the history of Chelsea Football Club, and you call it ""good""?! That we won it against all odds, when we were down and out on so many occasions just elevates it even further. It was bloody remarkable, not good.

&gt; I disagree with you thinking that this is a better achievement to someone like Hiddink or Grant

But winning the Champions League is a better achievement - there is no two ways about this. Winning the Champions League and FA Cup &gt; winning the FA Cup (which Hiddink did) and winning nothing at all (which Grant did). This is definitive. Yes, Di Matteo finished lower in the league, but in my book, unless you win the league, the only thing that matters about league performance is qualifying for the Champions League - Di Matteo didn't do that in the league, but he managed it anyway, so it just doesn't matter. 

If Grant or Hiddink had won the league, there would be a discussion. If we were talking about who is the better manager, there would be a discussion. If we were talking about league performance, then there wouldn't be much of a discussion, because we know it's Grant and Hiddink, and it's the discussion you seem to think you're having with me. But it's not. We are talking about who had the greater *achievements*, and regarding that, you just have no argument. Di Matteo achieved more than Avram Grant and Guus Hiddink in his time as Chelsea manager. And as I've said several times, that Di Matteo's squad was *hugely* worse than the squad at Hiddink and Grant's disposal just adds to Di Matteo's achievement, and this is a fact you seem to be consistently ignoring. 

&gt; I don't think that it was all that much better than what ... to a lesser extent **Ranieri** achieved

Will Russia pull the plug on the $15 billion to Ukraine? Will Russia cut off or increase the price of the gas that Ukraine is dependent on? It appears that the IMF, the EU and perhaps individual G20 nations are poised to participate in a bailout if necessary. 

Angela Merkel, William Hague and unnamed American diplomats have urged Russia to refrain from a show of military force. Ukraine isn't a full NATO member so it's not clear what options are available if the worst happens. 

So, back to the original point: how significant is it that the US has represented against a Russian military intervention in Ukraine? Will this carry more weight than the EU representations?

(I'm going to venture a prediction that Russia won't use overt military force, based on the damage caused to their economy by the raised tensions a few days ago.)

If Drogba scores his penalty Di Matteo is the greatest manager in the world

If Drogba missed..  Di Matteo who?

There were two differences between Avram Grant's season and Di Matteo's.

1) Drogba scored a penalty and Terry didn;t

2) Di Matteo had terrible league form over a 1/3 of a season, Avram Grant had amazing league form over 2/3 of a season.

Now you seem to think that #1 makes Di Matteo a better manager. It doesn't. It makes Chelsea, the club, have a better trophy, but it is not because of Di Matteo being better, it is because of luck.

#2 is over a long period of time so luck can be ruled out.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. Who was the better manager for their short stay.

And it's not what I'm talking about. Thank you, for eventually confirming that you are arguing with a straw man. 

I have never said that Di Matteo was the better manager, I am saying that I don't care if he was a good manager or not, because he won us the Champions League. This is literally what I opened my first reply to you with, and you still seem to have missed that entirely.

One more time, Di Matteo leading us to the Champions League was a remarkable achievement, and in the eyes of the vast majority of Chelsea fans, represents the greatest night in Chelsea's history. This is not up for debate.

edit: just saw your edit. Ranieri shitting his pants against Monaco is so many million miles away from Di Matteo's achievements in winning us the Champions League and FA Cup with that ragtag squad, that it's probably about as far away as you are from any sense of perspective or reason, i.e. an awful long way.

I never said it was.

I am claiming that the difference between Di Matteo's Champions League success and Avram Grant's Champions League failure was purely down to luck - that there was very little, if any difference in managerial skill in their respective Champions League campaigns.

Read that however many times it takes before it sinks into your mind. Now read it a few more times. Now, since you didn't understand it the first 5 times I mentioned the same thing, read it again and again.

Now considering that Avram Grant was much better in the league than Di Matteo, how can anyone argue that he wasn't the better manager when the only thing in Di Matteo's favor is luck.

&gt; And it's not what I'm talking about. Thank you, for eventually confirming that you are arguing with a straw man. 

Well that's an incredibly stupid thing to say since you replied to me in the first place, that would make you the strawman. It can't be a strawman when it is my topic of conversation to begin with.

Of course if Madrid / Bayern came calling he might have his head turned, but it seems as if Sturridge doesn't have the status that often goes along with players who join those clubs. Sturridge has been as good as Aguero this season, and yet many regard Aguero as a top 10 player in the world. Does anyone, aside from Liverpool fans, rate Sturridge that highly? 

I may be wrong given that Madrid signed Bale, a British talent. But there was talk of Bale to Madrid back in the 10/11 season, when he had a few good games and suddenly skysports and the like were following Bale's every step even before he became a great player. Interesting how the media can raise the standing of a player. 

Anyway, if he can become more decisive in certain situations, he often gets the ball caught under his feet or stops the ball when there is no need, then he will be even more devastating.

Being a parent is something you need to go into with the knowledge that one will be getting a new individual who may not be what you picture in advance but nonetheless you still have responsibility to love and care for.

However let's face it, this is pussy footing around the real reason: in the overwhelming majority of cases it's because the parents come from a culture with a pronounced preference for male children. Regardless of the other merits of these cultures this is utterly contemptible. It's also not something the overwhelming majority of the UK (or western europe for that matter) condones - regardless of pro/anti abortion stance.

A part of me would almost love to let these cultures have-at and see where it lands them in two decades when most of their precious sons have zero prospect of ever getting a girlfriend or giving them grandchildren ... but (aside from the pointless abortion of millions of female children) this sort of gender imbalance history shows has tended to make cultures and nations fight wars with thier neighbours.

Grant lost to fucking Barnsley in the FA Cup, with a far superior side than the one Robbie had. But I see you haven't mentioned that at all. Instead focusing on the League form between the two. Grant took over when Chelsea were still firm in the title race. While Robbie took over when we were in shambles. We were 5th in the table (20 pts behind the leaders, and 7 pts behind 3rd in the table) when Robbie became the gaffer. 

Also did you forget that we sacrificed our League position towards the end of the season in 2012 to focus on the Champions League? Look at the team sheets from our last 5-6 matches. We went to Anfield and the Emirates and fielded weak sides so we could luck our way throughout the Champions League.

No one is claiming Di Matteo is a better manager than Grant. What we are saying is that where Grant failed, Robbie succeeded. I'd much rather be lucky than good.

Now I'm going to disagree about selling any of our CBs, like what others have stated, we have some good squad players and some good starters. If we want to be competitive on most fronts next season we need numbers. Kolo offers experience and leadership for the young defenders. Skrtel and Sakho are our partnership, the reason Skrtel has been making so many mistakes lately is the cause of the lack of consistently good coverage by his CB partners, he has had to play with 3 different ones in the span of 3 months, their can't be Amy relationship building because of that.

Agger is a leader on the pitch, although he is lacking match fitness and confidence, but we can't get rid of him. He'll be a good backup and great for smaller cup matches. I could see us selling Coates after he is fit. And Kelly seems to be on his way out. So we will need to get 1 more young CB unless Wisdom comes a different player after his loan.

Fullbacks I believe we are set for now on the right, we will buy 1 world beater who can start over Enrique, Cissokho is only on loan and we won't be keeping him. Or trust Enrique and find a suitable backup, I want Luke Shaw to join us and we could get him depending on how well we finish in the table. 

We don't like talking about the title but according to numbers and our fixtures its possible. City and Chelsea need to beat us at Anfield if they want to win it.

Moore, 28, joins the Goats after having last featured for Sanica Boru Elazigspor of the Turkish Super League, where he went scoreless in 17 appearances.

Prior to landing in Turkey, Moore spent a chunk of his young professional career with Aston Villa in the Premiership. He also enjoyed stints with West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City.

One more dominant CB would be welcome and FSG should expect to spend 15-20M GBP for one. The Champions League requires quality and depth. 

You are right about the fullbacks. With all oof the injuries and up and coming youth it is difficult to predict what the needs will be. Certainly Johnson will have to be replaced if he leaves and Enrique may never see the form he once had.

The money lent back was *not* a loan, because the lynchpin of this scheme was that the trust would not expect repayment.

Carr would have been furious if the loan had been recalled, because then he would have given them his salary for nothing.

Whether the contract was written or oral, the one transfer depended upon the other. Any repayments stipulated in the ""loan"" were a sham.

Questions remain a) did his letters/lobbying get more attention than any other citizen in the UK? b) is he likely to become politically neutral when he becomes King? 

The answer to a) is almost certainly, in which case the Ministers have questions to answer also, why are they giving more attention to one persons views over another (although we know this goes on all the time). 

I'd like to think the answer to b) is that yes he would change when he eventually becomes Monarch, but it's looking more and more unlikely.

The way you worded it seemed to suggest it is absolutely out of the question, as if they were as good or important as Suarez. The fact is, they are both getting older, which means Agger's injury problems are likely to get worse, rather than better. And Skrtel's lack of pace isn't going to magically disappear. I understand experience is also required in a title winning team, and selling all your senior players isn't a good idea.

My personal opinion would be to sell one of the two. I like Agger more as a player (his style and skill I prefer to Skrtel's), and his dedication and leadership are great assets, but his injuries combined with high wages just don't justify keeping him over Skrtel. I'd like us to sign a new RCB to start along side Sakho; Skrtle and Ilori on the bench; Kolo would be for 'emergency use only' so to speak. 

Edit: I'd also like to say that there is certainly doubt to your claim that ""Skrtel has been fantastic this season"". He was fantastic two seasons ago when he won LFC POTY. By that standard, this season has been far from fantastic.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"No.  Even though Sherwood has as many glaring flaws in his tactics and approach as AVB does, you have to remember:

1.  We've scored three or more goals four times under his short reign.  The last time AVB had us scoring three was back in April last year.

2.  He brought Adebayor back in from the cold.  Can you imagine where we'd be without his hot streak?

3.  We got a short term bump in results (which new managers often get).  Even if it is dwindling now, it's still better than nothing.

4.  At least the players seem to like him and have more unity.  Sherwood seems much more of a people person, which is something we do need at this time.

5.  But the main reason for me is to do with reputation and the overall narrative of each manager.  AVB's story in the media is as a precocious intellectual out of his depth.  The longer he stayed, and the longer our play and results didn't go his way, the more ingrained the sense of his failure would become.  Players would get more and more distrustful, confidence and morale would dip lower, and the press would be braying for blood.  Sherwood meanwhile has no real narrative behind him.  As a novice, nothing is expected of him.  If he doesn't get us into Champions League, no one could say they were expecting differently.

I certainly am not a fan of Sherwood, but I think the relative success he's had proves what a bad job AVB was doing.  His appointment is not the answer, but at least it does allow the club to fail to achieve top four without as much scrutiny and disappointment than if he were still at the helm.

Newcastle have parked the bus. 

Kop End.

Suarez shoots.

Smashes it against a defender.

It falls to Gerrard.

35 yards out.

On his right foot.

He does what Gerrard do do.

Smashes the fuck out the ball.

Keeper dives far right corner.

It dips right at the last second.

Hits the bar.

Rockets back down into the net.

He runs towards the Kop.

Pops his shirt off.

He's only gone and got a tattoo of the LFC crest over his heart.

He plunges into the on rushing fans.

Everyone cheers.

Everyone cries.

The game kicks off again.

Not a single person isn't singing.

true,DahhKid,null,null,"I disagree. We're going to need all of them come mid december when we're grinding out Win after Win in all 4 competitions we're in. We need our top talent in 2 of the aforementioned games (the league and hopefully the CL but if not the FA). If we are in any tournament style league/cup I'd expect the strongest performing and best gelled defensive pairing to start for the harder games and other games against weaker opponents to see younger talent begin to get more time.

Let me tell you this, Arsene Wenger knows what the fuck he's doing when it comes to this and it seems it works.  I think where he's making the mistake is in Ozil being overplayed because for some odd reason he wants to justify his big signing so badly.  He's managing a great team that, at the start of the season with the form they were in, could tear into some of the best teams across Europe and really stand a shot at pulling a win out.  Though he's lost some of his best players, selling a good defensemen who is in his prime years is not something on his list.  Vermaelen isnt in top form, hes still there playing his part. Agger and Skrtel will play their parts as will Sakho, Ilori, and Wisdom though the latter two will be getting growing roles as their talent progresses.  

We need a little more quality out on the wings of the defense and in the wings, possibly more in the CDM area as well as a strong contender for Lucas/Gerrard.  I'd like some more in the CAM area as well, someone to really make Hendo/Allen/Coutinho work hard and could almost step in on the first team and if not would be integrated almost immediately.  I want to see Coutinho get displaced so he could push the talent of the team even further.  Someone like Kroos, maybe even Muller, though the latter is more a dream.  I'd really like to see Shaqiri push in on loan rather than Moses unless Victor decides hes going to put some testicle behind putting on the red shirt and actually try out there.  As a CDM, I'm not too sure who I'd like to come in. 

Rodgers seems quite willing to rotate players the more hes comfortable with the skill level they produce so in time I believe you'll be seeing the likes of Alberto and co. against lower teams when our defense doesn't allow all this nonsense to transpire.

true,Jenwrr,null,null,"&gt;I've heard there is a sizable population of American students at the university. What do the UK students generally think about the Americans, and do we tend to integrate well?

Every country stereotypes others, what matters is being a well balanced person. As long as you don't play the perceived faults of your country, you'll be just fine.

&gt;Current/former students: Any insider recommendations on (catered) freshers housing? I am not on a budget and would ideally like to be close to campus &amp; social life.

Can't answer on Edinburgh Uni, but catered halls in the UK are generally awful, with high prices to boot. The vast majority of students live in self catered halls, I had some friends stay in Pollock halls that were apparently not bad. The people are more important than the place, halls are just a place to enjoy yourself (party?) and sleep.

&gt;What's the nightlife like at the University, and more broadly throughout the city of Edinburgh?

Edinburgh nightlife plays 2nd to Glasgow's, and you'll do well to visit Hive as a fresher just so you can comment first hand on how bad it is.
That said, Edinburgh does have a really rich nightlife that covers everything from low key bars to large nightclubs.

&gt;I apologize for how ridiculous this sounds, but... What do Scottish guys think of Asian girls? I have many friends in the UK and while many are ridiculously popular with the guys, some (of equal attractiveness!) have said they've experienced slight racism over there :-/

It's all personal preference. Everyone has their own tastes, but if someone is judging you solely on race then you probably shouldn't care about them either. There's no particular prejudice /against/ asian girls.

Re. racism, scotland has a pretty mixed history. Yes, it does happen, but no, it's not really /big/ anymore. Every city has its bad apples and bad neighbourhoods, but the university and the area around it are full of students of every race, religion, and creed, who have open minds, and Edinburgh as a whole is very friendly with such a huge amount of the economy being from tourism.

--------------

Ultimately, Edinburgh is a great city with a bunch of great higher education institutes.

Additionally, asking these sorts of questions is a great indicator that you care about where you end up, and that same care sees people right, no matter where they end up.

true,Annaeus,cnty-expat,Flashbacks to my time in 'Nam,"As far as I can tell, the entire interview revolved around what the word 'affiliate' means. The interviewer - and the Daily Mail - appear to be arguing that 'affiliate' means some kind of influence, policy-making role, or right to participate on an equal footing. Harman seemed to be explaining that in this case 'affiliate' simply meant 'financial donor' and nothing more, and explicitly denying any influence by PIE.

Maybe they should have refused the donation, but at the time - as Harman explained - there was no process for vetting donations and based on the name 'Paedophile Information Exchange' alone, as another commenter noted, the group may have been advocating research into treating paedophiles before they abuse. Sadly that is not the case, but the time needed to vet 1000 donors by a group with only 6000 members may have been viewed as a low priority beforehand.

Perhaps they should have instituted a vetting process as a result, addressing the problem once it arose, but that doesn't change the fact that there wasn't one to begin with. It's a truism of historical analysis not to make moral judgements of past decisions based on what was learned afterwards.

As a politician I can see why Harman avoided agreeing with the word 'mistake', as that is usually assumed to mean some kind of culpability or negligence, at least by the press. Accepting the donation was certainly 'unfortunate' and 'undesirable', but when the word 'mistake' is likely to be extrapolated to an admission of malfeasance I don't think the interviewer was ever going to get agreement on that point from a politician.",0,1393310267,null,0,false,0,cfo487u,t3_1yu90w,t1_cfo487u,t3_1yu90w,null,1432549377,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

When you explicitly say ""the first ¬£x you earn is tax free"", that's not a loophole. That's very specific legislation. A loophole is more like this:


If you want to, you can just open a Widgets franchise of your very own. You will have to pay some royalty to Widgets UK Ltd or whoever for the use of their name. You can count that royalty as a business expense and get tax relief against it. That is fair and legal. The taxman will take his cut from Widgets UK Ltd, and all is right with the world.  

If you open the first UK franchise, Widgets UK Ltd might not exist yet, so you work directly with Widgets Inc's US office. It doesn't affect your tax liability, but the UK government won't get their cut from Widgets Inc. Still perfectly fair and legal. 

A loophole is when Widgets UK Ltd launch as a subsidiary of Widgets Inc, and open 100 stores. They still pay the same royalty to Widgets Inc, and claim tax relief against it. 

They're the same company, everyone knows they're the same company, but because they're legally different entities, this royalty payment is perfectly legal and proper, just as it is for your small franchise. The UK can't tell Widgets Inc how to do business because Widgets Inc don't operate in the UK. They could introduce legislation to remove the tax relief for Widgets UK Ltd's royalty payments, but suddenly all the single franchise owners are getting fucked over on tax and go bust. 

Basically, most loopholes aren't loopholes, they're perfectly legal, often specifically legislated, but sometimes quite creative, ways to take advantage of the tax laws in a given country.

**Zersetzung**

&gt; The Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as Zersetzung (pronounced [ ¶…õ…êÃØÀàz…õ ¶ ä≈ã]) ‚Äì a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means ""decomposition"".
&gt; 
&gt; By the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that methods of overt persecution which had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even its exact nature. Zersetzung was designed to side-track and ""switch off"" perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any ""inappropriate"" activities.
&gt; 
&gt; Tactics employed under Zersetzung generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks such as breaking into homes and messing with the contents ‚Äì moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, smear campaigns including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a vibrator to a target's wife. Usually victims had no idea the Stasi were responsible. Many thought they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result.
&gt; 
&gt; One great advantage of the harassment perpetrated under Zersetzung was that its subtle nature meant that it was able to be plausibly denied. That was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 80s, especially in conjunction with the Ostpolitik of West-German chancellor Willy Brandt massively improving relations between the two German states.
&gt; 
&gt; Zersetzung techniques have since been adopted by other security agencies, particularly the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).[28]",0,1393318920,null,0,false,0,cfo66v9,t3_1yuw0g,t1_cfo66v9,t3_1yuw0g,null,1432550366,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

true,collinsl02,null,null,"First off, I can't comment on Ireland as I've never been there and I don't know enough about the country to advise.

Both Edinburgh and Bath will have good rail links.

Edinburgh is a large city so it has rail links to the rest of the UK with fast services to places like Manchester, Birmingham and London, whilst Bath sits on the Bristol to London mainline, so you get fast or semi-fast services out to London and Bristol (and by extension south Wales) and you get semi-fast services to lots of other places as well - the Portsmouth to Cardiff service stops in Bath Spa.

You will also get coach services that run to lots of places in the UK so if you don't want to use the train you can take those.

I would personally recommend Edinburgh as it has a large student population, and hence probably a better nightlife than Bath, although I haven't studied in either place. Bath will also have a higher cost of living that Edinburgh, because the further north you go in the UK the cheaper it generally is to live, plus Bath is a tourist town so prices are higher there anyway. Rent is also higher in Bath.

Stereotype-wise, people from Scotland are seen (wrongly imo) as either drunks, or ""highlanders"" in kilts and wild bushy beards, who always want to fight. Scotland does have one of the highest obesity rates in the UK though, and you can find lots of deep fried food there, including for some reason deep fried Mars bars.

On the subject of food, there are some major differences between the UK and the USA anyway. For instance, we don't use high fructose corn syrup here very much, so you might notice a taste difference in products that are sold in both countries, like coca-cola. We tend to think of American cola as very sweet compared to ours. We also don't put sugar in a lot of things you do, like bread. 

We have shops like KFC and McDonald's, and plenty of other fast food chains, but we don't have many Mexican food shops - we have Indian, Chinese etc instead.

Cost-of-living wise, you may well find a lot of things more expensive than in the USA, like electricity, gas (natural not automotive, which we call petrol), fuel (petrol/diesel), and food prices are probably slightly higher than in the USA too. Plus if you factor in your currency conversion rates you might find things significantly more expensive than you were planning. You should look to spend about ¬£20-25 a week on food, maybe ¬£4-5 a week on electricity (depending on how much you and whoever you live with use and whether or not you have electric or gas heating/hot water and an electric or gas stove (or combination thereof) plus maybe ¬£2 for gas if you use it - if not, tack it on to the electric price).

Alcohol here is one area where it *might* and I stress *might* be about the same or slightly cheaper than in the USA - I don't drink and this is based on information I picked up from an east coast American before so this might not be true for you, or at all.

History-wise, Bath was probably ""founded"" by the Romans sometime in the AD60s, where they built the bath house that still stands over the hot springs, and a city gradually grew up around the bath house. It appears however that stories of settlement on the site date back much further than this.

The baths gradually fell into disuse after the Romans left, and they experienced a revival during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 15/1600s. 

During the English civil war, Bath was surrendered to the Parliamentarian forces without a shot being fired, and was a major garrison for the New Model Army until they were driven out in the battle of Lansdowne in 1643.

Starting in the Stuart period, but gaining rapid momentum during the Georgian period, the town gained lots of new housing and visitor accommodations due to the upsurge in people using the baths. Most of this accommodation was built from Bath Stone, which gives the city it's trademark colour scheme. Around this time Bath also gained it's first purpose built theatre.

During WWII Bath was bombed in reprisal for bombing raids on L√ºbeck and Rostock. This occurred between the dates of 25th and 27th April 1942. Bath was not bombed again, mainly because it lacked any significant military targets, and it is also rumoured that Hitler liked how the city looked, and wanted to preserve it for his pleasure after the war.

These days the main attractions of Bath are the museum of the Roman Baths (unfortunately now closed to swimmers as the water is not safe by modern standards), and the American Museum in Britain, the only museum of Americana outside of the USA, at least according to the museum. There are also 5 theatres in Bath, and there are also numerous other museums, including the Bath Postal Museum, the Jane Austen Centre, the Museum of East Asian Art, and the Victoria Art Gallery. Bath has also given rise to two different types of what you Americans would call ""pastries""; the Sally Lunn bun, a type of teacake which is sold only in the Sally Lunn Tea Rooms, and the Bath Bun.

Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland, and was the site of a Mesolithic campsite somewhere around 8500BC. The city itself was founded sometime before the 7th Century AD - the Romans recorded a Celtic tribe living in a hill fort somewhere in the hills around Edinburgh in the first century AD but it is unknown exactly when the city was founded. The Royal Burgh of Edinburgh was founded sometime early in the 12th Century AD and by 1365 it was recorded as the captial of Scotland by a French tourist.

In 1603 James Iv of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England whilst occupying the throne of Scotland, uniting the two kingdoms. In 1638, King Charles I's attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition leading to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the English civil war, Scottish support for Charles Stuart's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation by parliamentarian forces. During the 17th century the borders of the town were still defined by the city walls, so in order to accommodate the increasing population buildings were made taller, sometimes growing to 11 stories. These have now been replaced.

In 1706 and 1707 the Acts of Union were passed, finally uniting the countries of Scotland and England. This caused the loss of the Scottish Parliament, restored in 1998, and after this point Glasgow overtook Edinburgh as Scotland's largest city. Edinburgh entered a period of decline which was only recently reversed. Edinburgh now hosts a large financial centre, and otherwise relies on tourism to sustain it.

The Scottish parliament is responsible for all areas of Scottish administration and Law, with the exception of areas such as Defence, Foreign Affairs, and taxation. thus Scottish law is different from English law, but it is based along the same lines.

* There are 2 universities in Bath: Bath Spa which has more of the arts degrees and Bath Uni which is more science and engineering. I was at Uni.
* Nightlife is ok in Bath. The main student night in town is(was) on Monday with the University having big nights on friday/saturday and wednesday. Going into town on any day other than monday is fairly expensive. Bristol is only 13 miles away and is a far bigger city with more of a nightlife. Train journeys between the 2 are frequent and fast and there's often a coach organised by various societies at the University.
* Bath is a lovely town but not a cheap one. Average rent for a single room in a shared house you're probably looking at ¬£300 + utilities. There aren't many easily accessible budget supermarkets (Aldi,Lidl) and Sainsburys seems to have a monopoly on the town.
* Bath is on a main rail line that links London to Cardiff it's easy and relatively cheap to get to places like: London, Bristol, Oxford, Bournemouth (best beaches in the UK imo), Cardiff etc.
* Public transport in bath is good. Most students don't own a car because parking is at a premium. There are good bus services and at the end of the day Bath isn't that big - you can walk most places in under an hour.
* There's plenty of culture in Bath the whole city is a british heritage site, there's a fair few museums and galleries a fantastic abby (Id recommend the carol services there) and the roman baths to visit.
* It won't matter that you're asian. There are a lot of asian students in bath.

The Telegraph article this comes from doesn't give any more context.  Perhaps this document was merely describing a range of views other people held.  Perhaps the word before ""childhood"" was ""late"", given that this was apparently connected to them calling for the age of consent to be reduced to 14 (which it is in many European countries).  Perhaps they were even talking about 17-year-old gay men, as the age of consent for gay men was 21 in those days (EDIT: actually, shouldn't we be demonising the many politicians who were strongly attached to keeping an unequal age of consent?  How come it's appropriate to dredge up insinuations of sympathy for paedophiles from decades ago, but outright homophobia and racism have to stay in the past, because ""things were different then""?).

If the document actually did say what the Telegraph are insinuating, then the complete context would be pretty damning, but instead they chose to print a suggestive fraction of a sentence.

true,JaiBhambra,flair5,,"Centre Backs. 

We should sell Jan Vertonghen next year. I think he's bound to go soon, give him a rise and hope he doesn't want out this summer. The only way I can see that happening is if LVG comes in, I think he'll at least give us another year. With an extension/pay rise we could fetch a healthy sum for him. Perhaps ¬£20-25m, that'd be a realistic price for a centre back with a few years left on contract. I really wouldn't want his contract to go run out slightly and risk losing higher bids because of it. 

I also think Kaboul's contract shouldn't be extended. He is probably our greatest centre back when fit, Jan is MASSIVELY overrated as a defender; he's good on the ball but sometimes his positioning and decision making is worrying, the guy slides in too often and should hold his ground and jockey more, I actually really rate Naughton's standing tackling and I think Jan could learn from him. But back to Younes, his injuries are too big if a liability, sorry buddy!!

I think in terms on contracts Hugo will follow Jan, and we NEED to give Walker a massive pay rise and pin him down. 

I figure some people will agree with a few things, so I guess the really unpopular bit would be the dig at Jan's defending. He's a great player but a really average defender. 

Edit: Lennon. He's been virtually gifted a starting spot over his career due to a lack of competition. And he fails to deliver in 9/10 games, he still somehow remains a club hero that doesn't know how to cross or finish. And we should've kept Huddlestone.

If more people acknowledged that being fat is a problem on many levels (including attractiveness) then the trend of obesity should decline. Otherwise we have complete opposite when some morons excuse being fat and don't do anything about it. That's just stupid.

This is about entertainers. Are all women entertainers so bloody awful that having them on the show (by any means) will completely ruin the show? Will having the ""most entertaining"" men on there make the show THAT much better as a result. I'm kind of sick of the same 10 faces, who dominate these panel shows and have stopped watching them as much as a result. I used to love Lee Mack, but I'm just really tired of him now. Give me Jo Brand over him any day.

I doubt they do diminish the show in any recognisable way. A lot of women (but obviously not all) find women funnier regardless because they can relate more. In their eyes this would make the show better for them and they tend to represent a good chunk of the watching audience. If it was a female doctor who was 10% less effective at saving lives than a male doctor I would understand the vitriol, but this is people who make jokes, who are witty and entertain us. They have a built in fan base. If Phil Kay was on a show I never watch - I'd watch it for him alone. I went to see the live recording of him on QI - he was utterly brilliant and people were roaring at his random antics and arm waving, in the final show they edited 95% of him out and all you got was a quiet few quips of him in his seat.

I would argue that even if the ideas is to increase the ""overall"" presence of women on a show and by some miracle chance these shows are ""10% less funny"" for some people then I don't think anything bad is happening. If you're watching a show thinking ""Ugh! I bet she's only on there because she's a woman"" you have separate issues.

What I see happening is the number of people on sickness benefits massively increasing because of people wrongly declined or not well enough to deal the stress from Atos finally getting their benefits.

The government will make a massive issue of how this number has grown massively in a short time due to people taking advantage and they will make the rules on accepting people for sickness/disability much stricter. They will probably also make it near impossible to appeal a decision.

They will then get someone like Serco to take over as they can say they have years of experience working with the NHS (even if lots of people know they did a shit job).

Serco will find an even higher percentage of people unfit for work and those people will not be able to appeal or at least find it harder and much more stressful to do so which will put people many off.

&gt; IMO, it doesn't really reflect anything apart from the health of those 100 companies.

He made a very interesting point in the interview; studies have shown that when the FTSE is doing well, smaller businesses are, on average, doing worse.

&gt; I'm not an economist but aren't there are other, much more appropriate, measures of the economy such as GDP

There is no single measure of any complex system that will tell you anything even remotely descriptive about it. We also have to remember that the GDP includes projected growth targets from organisations that are simply opinions.

For example, recently many government debt rating have been downgraded from AAA to something lower and even more meaningless by the same people that rated the mortgage derivatives that were complete junk. Now when a government has to pay more to borrow money this is a very bad thing. This being a capitalist economy, we *need* to borrow money to grow faster. If it costs more to borrow, we are taking a bigger chunk of our growth and giving it to the lenders. Our GDP is, thus, partially based on the opinion of fat cats.

Think of the numbers in the business sections of the news. It is practically, roll the dice, is the number bigger or smaller. 

Our political and cultural actions seem to have two basic responses:

* BIGGER ""Thank you almighty number god, we will appease your infinite power with more free market liberalism""

* SMALLER ""Oh no numbers god, how can we appease your wonderfullness. We clearly haven't implemented enough free market liberalism.""",0,1393332319,null,0,1393332663,0,cfo88ke,t3_1yvqcu,t1_cfo88ke,t1_cfo7ij3,null,1432551330,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

This time however it all went horribly wrong.  I'd been gone maybe 4 or 5 hours and I guess I wasn't really paying attention to where I was because before I knew it I was completely lost.

Realising this I start following any sign that mentions any place I vaguely recognise.  Sooner or later I'm going to be back on familiar territory and all will be good.  Eventually I come to a sign that has a name I know will get me back on track.  The only downside is that the road it suggests to take is an A-road, which I generally like to avoid where-ever possible unless I'm familiar with how busy it is because I enjoy living.  I don't have a map (adventure!) and I'm not familiar with the roads (lost!), but I'm tired and pissed off and I want to get home and it's an A-road right?  I'm legally entitled to be on it as long as there is no sign telling me not to.  So I figure ""fuck it"" and bite the bullet.  

Turns out this A-road is the A120 outside Stanstead airport.  Without a doubt the worst decision of my cycling life.  The second I leave the slip road I regret my decision.  To this day I cannot for the life of me think what made me continue forward.  3 fucking lanes of holiday makers and heavy goods vehicles flying by at ~60 mph.  I thank god it was a Sunday afternoon and the traffic was light.  I have never been so scared.  In the end I got off, I picked up my bike and I walked along the embankment as far from traffic as I could get.  It was still scary.  Never, ever, ever would I dream of doing that again.  Eventually I made it off safely (obviously) and berated myself the whole journey back for being so fucking stupid.  I still feel like a fucking idiot to this day.

A valuable lesson was learned: just because you can ride your bike somewhere definitely does not mean that you *should*.  There's always another route.  Be aware of where you're going and think before you pedal.  And take a map.",0,1393334087,null,0,false,0,cfo8mr5,t3_1yvv7n,t1_cfo8mr5,t1_cfo81ua,null,1432551515,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The problem here is that there are lots of funny women but most of them aren't physically attractive, like Jo Brand. She's lovely and sweet but her wit does the talking, a wit developed from that need.

When society places more emphasis on how women look and less on what they say or do, of course you're going to get a shortage of female comedians. There just aren't that many out there.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; I totally agree; I absolutely despise positive discrimination in all of its forms.

The biggest problem with PD isn't even that it is unfairly excluding people who'd otherwise be there. The real problem is that it doesn't even achieve its aim.

There is real flawed thinking in the whole process of fudging figures in the business end of an organisation. That visibility is the biggest factor in distribution. That reality would just correct if the image of an organisation looks right. Usually there is some kind of functional failure further down the pipeline.

Not a gender issue but Welsh rugby had looked at this problem with regards to a huge gap between regional participation at youth and professional level. Major fixes were made at grass root levels and the weird distorted picture at professional level went away (somewhat, there are generational issues that will only go with time). The nature of the fixes meant no amount of PD would have created a balance. There were serious coaching issues in some regions of the nation. You can't fix a functional issue with image. No amount of role models would have helped coaches learn how to bring their players forward.

However PD has become a sacred cow of feminists despite decades of no results. If they want women to be comedians you need to ask how a person becomes a comedian and figure out how a person goes from that decision to sitting on a BBC panel. Once you have this pipeline in place you can ask the question at what point there are serious cases of women dropping out and target that.

PD is like having a non-working train system and creating the image of a working train system to encourage the non-working system to fix itself. Rather than figuring out where the trains are derailing and relaying that bit of track.",0,1393335281,null,0,false,0,cfo8xbe,t3_1yvqxc,t1_cfo8xbe,t1_cfo7ly2,null,1432551661,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Whether they make you laugh or not is irrelevant - although there will be times when they do not, and they made the program worse because somebody better could have filled the slot.

Let me re-write that with the facts as they are happening now in TV comedy land.

""There's the issue though, if you put only put on men who are signed to the Avalon and Off the Curb talent agencies and nothing else then they are literally there to maximise profits for the production company.

She's very famous, and her talent is widely acknowledged, so why haven't you?  I mean you've heard of Andy Parsons, because he's a panel show captain, despite being famous for being painfully unfunny.

That's the problem, there's plenty of funny female comics, so why aren't we seeing female panel show captains? Can you imagine how weird it would look if there was a comedy panel show that mainly featured women, we're so used to this male presence in the format.   If Sky can do it why can't the BBC?

The panel show is a great way for Uk comics to be appear, but I'd like to see more variety.

His current form is bad, like the vast majority of defenders who have time off are. We are basing his ability off less than 90 minutes right now. He hasn't been back a full game yet, and yet apparently that is enough to make a decision on his form.

When I see a lengthy period of poor performance then I'll at least give credence to the idea of selling him, but I can't help but to see this as knee-jerk, like when people wrote off Skrtel, the same as when people wrote off Allen and Henderson. 

The stats from this season show that in his 8 full games before his lengthy injury this season, there have been 7 goals scored against our defence with Agger in the team, and 5 of those were against Chelsea and Everton **away**. Hardly indicative of bad defensive work. 
The only reason he isn't a regular now is because Skrtel had an upswing of form which meant it was impossible to drop him, and Sakho was acquitting himself well at the time too, making him also undroppable. 

He's had a hodge-podge season of injury, and there is argument in selling an ageing player with a history of injury who is on high wages, but if you are telling me we are selling him due to him getting worse as a player, I'm completely in disagreement. Players need match time to get form, and he's not had it apart from the start of the season - Where apart from his brain fart to give a penalty, I thought he played quite well, and contributed greatly to our 3 clean sheets to start the season. 

He is trumped by Sakho, but unless we can get a good replacement (Not a Kolo toure style, but an actual replacement) who is of the same calibre, I don't want to see us sell, as we inevitably will have injury in the backline, especially with the good chance of Champions League coming around the corner.

Meal times are quite early in the evening which many don't like. IIRC dinner ends at 19:00. I have first year lectures finishing at 18:00 three days a week, so you can see why people are a bit put off by that. Self-catered people have more flexibility. I've heard mixed things about pollock food. 

Generally speaking Pollock people will make friends at pollock, self-catered people will usually either make really good friends with their flatmates, and if not, in societies.

His touch has been poor, and he drops deep with really moving us forward.  Comparing that to Soldado, who's only problem has been his finishing touch, I think he's link up better.  When he drops deep, he provides an outlet for a pass, moves it on quickly and accurately with one or two touches, and then *gets back up the pitch*.  This especially evidenced itself against Dnipro.  And that can't be attributed to the competition, because it had nothing to do with them.  It was *Soldado* doing the right things, and being in the right places. 

Another one is that I don't think there is one time where Sherwood's tactics have lead us to a win.  Since he's started, I've gotten the feeling that he's not making us any better.  AVB limited us.  He forced us into a system that didn't suit our strengths.  Tim just removed those limitations.  That boost we got early on was the result of him giving the players freedom, which I give him all the credit in the world for.  But his system and philosophy aren't anything special, in my opinion.  Especially lately, where he seems to have gotten away from the attacking philosophy we had early on.  I don't think that was is particularly unpopular, but it's a little more specific than just wanting Sherwood to leave, so I threw it in.

Apart from that first one, I don't think I really have any truly unpopular opinions.

That's what it comes down to, no?

Totally disagree tbh. If I may use football as analogy. Or any business for that matter. If you want to build an amazing team, you don't just pick the most talented people. You pick the people with the abilities most suited to the role in question. There are plenty of occasions when picking someone with less talent but better suitability will produce better results. I don't think this does go against the idea of meritocracy. Not sure if this is an urban legend or not, but I heard a story once that in the army they would try to have one colour blind person among squadrons that were scouting for camouflaged enemy bases. By having one colour blind person in the group their results were improved and they spotted more enemy bases. Now the colour blind person may not have been the most talented person available, but it's an example of where the most talented person won't always produce the best results.

That may not be true, but it's a good analogy of what I feel is going on here. I don't see anything apart from the beeb trying to produce the best TV shows that they can.",1,1393336682,null,0,false,0,cfo9aud,t3_1yvqxc,t1_cfo9aud,t1_cfo8qmm,null,1432551837,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Or people are going to get sick of him and turn off, which is what I've been reading in the press and hearing from people I know who watch it (not that this is any kind of proof but it's an overwhelming feeling). I've grown tired of reading articles bemoaning the very tired format. The problem is with the comedy culture of these shows - not the fact someone on the screen is there simply because they own a vagina.

&gt;I don't think shoehorning Joe Brand onto more stuff would help that an ounce

No one is suggesting you shoe horn - this to me just seems like you're showing bias. She's as qualified as anyone else to do the job (and has proved this by being the host on HIGNFY with the 3rd most appearances). The idea would be given the choice of two perfectly decent presenters (one of whom happens to be female) you opt for the latter to create diversity and difference on any one particular show. When Brand says the format is tired she's right and has the qualification to say so.

&gt; that's a wider problem of getting unknown/little known talent onscreen

That's the current problem that exists now - regardless of gender. These shows are saturated with the same faces, it's caused irreparable damage to viewing audiences - consequently not an issue that's making your blood boil at all. People want good comedy, the Levison enquiry has caused the BBC to completely calm down on what it's putting out, the quality has dipped.

&gt; You pay a licence fee so that something like a comedy panel show is as entertaining as it could possibly be.

Which is entirely subjective but something I would think you're quite wrong about. I'll ignore the fact that often these individuals have their jokes written for them, totally negating the argument, but some panelist have stopped going on the likes of HIGNFY because of it's tired formula. I've read interviews and seen first hand how very funny individuals (like Phil Kay who I mentioned) who've had the audiences  roaring with laughter - but the've been cut. One big example was Will Self who said:

""I'm afraid that without the reality element, the programme has become just like any other pseudo-panel contest, where funny fellows sit behind desks cracking jokes. The sharpest crack I made all evening ‚Äî and the one that received the most audience laughter ‚Äî was cut for transmission,"" (edited quote)

&gt;  I suspect I'm not the only one who finds that demeaning and needless.

The BBC are a little more media savvy than that. The initial cry came from audience members who felt these shows were becoming tired and formulaic. This was followed by claims from both male and female comedians that there was favoritism and overly macho point scoring comedy. Some of the program makers even admitted to it.

&gt; Maybe I'm tired of shit being done in my name because I'm too little and defenceless to make it on my own in the world.

Again - it seems like you're lensing a problem that's smell a little bit Firstworldproblems. 

&gt; Maybe using child abuse and homelessness as a cop-out to try to shut down discussion 

No ones trying to shut down the discussion - you're obviously very concerned about this issue, but out of kilter for what one might deem ""sensible"". If the BBC was found to be favoring women over men then people should be upset, but not as angry as you appear to be - they've done and will do far worse in the future I'm sure. But you're so vehemently against any bias in the direction of women you seem to have used that to ignore the fact that it plainly and obviously occurs in the other direction, and yet this is of no mentionable consequence.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"Ha! Literally everything you just said is entirely wrong. It's quite an achievement.

Britain was named because it was inhabited by the Brythonic (Britonic/Prythonic... I will go with Britonic henceforth as it's shorter) speakers, a different family of Celtic languages than what were spoken in Ireland. No Britonic speakers ever lived in Ireland.

Brittany in fact *acquired* its Brythonic tongue by Britonic *immigration* - that's right, before the Saxons ever arrived, you guys were even then exporting languages! Ireland did too, our Gaelic family replacing the Britonic tongues in Isle of Man and Scotland. Before 'you' arrived they spoke something akin to Gaulish.

The term ""British Isles"" dates to the mid 1500s, when it was coined by John Dee. It was an attempt to reconcile the idea that England and its burgeoning hegemony over Britain and Ireland was a superior nation with the idea of, well, everyone not hating the English. The idea was to minimise the recent history of conquest by the Saxons and by the Normans, and try to tie everyone back together as ""Britons"". It helped that Dee himself was Welsh, perhaps the last remaining true ""Britons"" after the assimilation of the Picts.

In the same treatise, Dee also coined the term ""British Empire"" (successful) and ""British Ocean"" for the North Atlantic (not so successful). In other papers, he suggested that Ireland should be included because it had been conquered by King Arthur, and America should be included because it was discovered and claimed by one ""Madog ab Owain Gwynedd"". But his favourite book of his own was De Heptarchia Mystica, a guidebook for summoning angels under the guidance of the angel Uriel.

The term ""British Isles"" and ""British Empire"" latched on far stronger than ""British Ocean"", but not everyone liked them - some men liked to be conquering the world for England and had no interest in representing the unwashed Scots and Irish, who themselves raised some scholarly objections.

The objections were notable enough that in 1621 Peter Heylin had to come to the defence of the ""New Britain"". In his highly politicised ""Microcosmus"" he defended the grouping of Ireland with Great Britain and the minor islands with these three arguments:

1. The inhabitants of Ireland must have come from Britain as it was the nearest land
*(They didn't, Irish mythology and recent genetic research shows the Irish as having come from the south, probably northern Spain.)*
2. He notes that ancient writers (such as Ptolemy) called Ireland a Brtti Éh Iland. *He did, but he was the only one, had never been there, and he thought there was another island nearby called Thule. He's also responsible for inventing a tribe called the ""Iverni"" (from when ""Hibernia"" came) who apparently had a city in what is now Kerry. Spoiler: Kerry doesn't have anything one could describe as a city even today, because it's mostly a sheep-spattered mountain range. ""Iverni"" just means ""fertile land"", and Ptolemy was most likely filling in blank space. That everyone had stopped bothering to refer to Ptolemy for 1500 years coinciding with the invasion of the Romans which polarised Irish and Briton cultural differences doesn't seem to matter.*
3. He cites the observation of the first-century Roman writer Tacitus that the habits and disposition of the people in Ireland were not much unlike the Brittaines
*Well, no shit. Both were Celtic peoples, in a close trading relationship between the islands and all down the Atlantic coast.*

Even then the term didn't gather momentum until the 1700s, and the Act of Union. Not coincidentally, this is around the time of the start of Irish republicanism. The final nail in the coffin for a ""British Isles"" as a concept if not a term was the mismanagement of the Irish potato famine. While it's fanciful to suggest it was caused on purpose by the British, it certainly highlighted the low priority of what were supposedly equal subjects in Ireland. Henceforth, an unquenchable desire for self-determination burned, not just in ""Gaelic"" people, but in even in the protestant populations of the cities. Ireland would certainly have settled for ""Home Rule"" (you call it ""devolution"" today, I think) and was awarded thus in the 1910s by the British parliament; however the advent of WW1, in which Irish soldiers fought alongside British soldiers for the last time as official comrades stalled the process and Britain baulked at actually implementing the Home Rule bill - despite its now officially legally binding status - leading to the Irish War of Independance, Churchill's barbaric Black and Tan campaign, and finally the partition of Ireland.

I am not surprised anymore at British people's complete ignorance of Ireland's move to independence, but I am surprised that you think *Britons came from Brittany*. Good lord.

You want to find some evidence for this claim? The policy of making quotas for female entertainers proves they favour women.

The BBC is introducing this because feminists think favouring women means equality. Equality should mean gender doesn't come into consideration when choosing entertainers, the BBC have officially become a sexist institution by making a policy which explicitly states that women should be catered to. If this was about true equality, the policy would state that a mixture of both genders should be present in any shows. The fact they specify women as being deserving of a position proves they are sexist.

Rates appear to have declined quicker post-2007, but these data are insufficient for determining how much of the change is a result of recession-induced changes to behaviour.

ONS data going further back have been charted by [The Economist](http://media.economist.com/images/20100206/CBR849.gif). There are some interesting drops to be seen around periods of recession in the early 1980s and 1990s.

Although not specific to teenagers, it appears to suggest significant associations between adverse economic conditions and reduced birth rates among persons aged &lt;30 years. Country-specific changes may be such that the impact isn't direct, but mediated by the effect of recession upon marriages, especially in more conservative nations such as Greece.

I've spent the last 4 years mostly associating with British people because *~~well at least they're not Australian~~ we have a lot in common*. I am past the point of caring when Asians call me British, or English, or Icelandic (both Ireland and Iceland are pronounced Island here in South East Asia), because they mean no harm and have no idea of our history. I would dearly love everyone to move on from the past and be best buddies - I am (I whisper to avoid the attention of the UKIP brigade) after all a European federalist, the culmination of which would probably be the political lumping together of these islands.

However, many people follow the trend in Ireland, perhaps fanned by our history education which is basically ""and then the Brits did this to us"", of not being particularly fond of Britain, all the while watching Corrie and supporting Liverpool. I very much wish they would get on with life but you don't make things easy by deciding to completely ignore their wishes on something as personal as national identity. Respect can only be mutual.

He is, for example, angry the exact same way whether he's facing down a Dalek or a Silent, and those are two completely different enemies with completely different emotional attachments to the Doctor's character. This also applies to joy, sadness, hurt, whatever. His vocal inflections even stay the same.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"Social tactics from Mourinho are as important as tactics on the pitch. The article refers to these as ""mind games"" but understanding the contours of sport media and its effect on players is equally as important.

Being pragmatic is a good thing, and playing down our title chances is smart even if it isn't true. 

If Mourinho wasn't deconstructing the headlines of ""Chelsea, Champions Elect"" and ""Chelsea current favourites to win Prem Title"" by playing down our title chances we'd end up watching the press burn Mourinho and the squad in effigy at the end of the season.

If we have no expectations to win the title the press and pundits can't burn the squad, club, or Mourinho for not winning the title. The blame will be shifted to other things, the schedule, a lack of striker firepower, whatever you want really but it won't end up on Mourinho because he's on record saying that Chelsea won't win the league.

Pellegrini is in for a treat from the press if Manchester City walk away with nothing, which is unlikely. Pellegrini said that he'd bring home silverware this year back in July or August, and the press is going to hold him to account on that.

In short, playing down our title chances is good and Mourinho is right to do so. It takes pressure off the players and it'll keep pressure off Mourinho if we don't win anything.

P.s this isn't a claim in that sense but the link will explain all that.

Read that link it will help, my advice is call your bank with an income/expenditure form calculated to show them you don't have enough money to pay them much back a month and they will be more than happy to work with you to resolve the issue, I put it off for 2 years and wish I'd have spoken to them on day 1, they increased my planned overdraft to avoid any more fees, entered me onto a ¬£50 a month payment plan and froze ALL interest, charges and fees on my account for 3 months, this has been extended due to no change in circumstances for myself so I now have a fee free and interest free overdraft so I am saving money and will make the min payment with no consequences then when I have enough money saved I'll hit the overdraft in one go.

Who's up and coming in that area, let's get them on the show!"" As opposed to a rule, you could have had a goal, and made decisions with that goal in mind. It wouldn't mean every week you have women on, but by giving more female comedians more exposure naturally you could have evolved the corporation to a point where it would be weirder to see a show *without* a woman on it. They could have been the ones to drive the growing celebrity of a whole new generation of comedians - male *and* female.

Instead, they've made some arbitrary rule that has to be followed 100% of the time, and made the whole thing completely artificial. Which is the issue, because now any woman on one of these shows looks like a box-ticking exercise instead of a natural growth towards a more equal share of the limelight.

Of course, they'll say that they *had* to make this rule because the natural evolution simply wasn't occurring. But you have to ask - is that because it couldn't have ever happened that way?

&gt;I don't see anyone boycotting this website over the same shit you're condemning the DM for 

I pointed out how that is totally and utterly disingenuous given that the DM doesn't have users it has staff, it' isn't a platform that users aggregate content it is a publishing house that creates content for a product they sell. Self evident differences that make attacking people who criticize the DM for using reddit silly. But apparently you've changed your mind because now 

&gt;Defend the bad stuff on reddit, condemn the bad stuff on DM, I love double standards, especially with a smattering of hypocrisy thrown in for good measure.

So which is it, can we only criticise the DM is we boycott reddit or are we ok to use reddit so long as we condemn the relevant parts of it? 

Given that I'll ask you to point out where exactly I defend the bad stuff? There's plenty of shit on reddit that makes my blood boil, [such as this](http://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/doxxing_internet_babes_she_wanted_it/) which runs up againts issue I have with site wide policy. Still much of what I condemn is the result of what the users on the site do, not reddit as a site or even in large parts the policies of how it runs the site, and that is totally consistent with condemning the DM for what *they* do. 

A simple way to look at this is to ask what Reddit and the DM could do to stop what we are criticising here. The DM can make other content, reddit would have to moderate every post every user made making it effectively impossible for reddit as we know it to exist. It's just not a comparable set of circumstances.

This is a bubble plain and simple. It has formed due to low interest rates adding to high capital availability (QE as a source), that is being invested in shares because they give a better return than other projects (due to low economic growth), which in turn pumps up the shares which causes more investment. As credit lines become strained (interest rates rise, QE decreases etc.) we're going to see a down turn that will spiral due to share price over evaluation. Again.

1: The transaction cost of moving: with estate agent fees, solicitors fees, mortgage fees and stamp duty, the costs of every move can be very high. The fewer times I can do that in life the better.

2: My expectation that house prices (especially in London where I‚Äôm buying) will continue to rise, especially in the 10Y time horizon I'm considering, which means I will make more money on a bigger investment. 

3: My observation that my career is has been really taking off recently, which coupled with the economic recovery bodes well for that larger place to become ever more affordable. 

4: My fianc√©e‚Äôs career is also taking off.

5: Interest rates are low, so at the moment I have the opportunity to get somewhere bigger and leverage up my investment.

6: Interest rates will rise in the coming years, so I need to make sure that I can afford it when they do. It does mean I‚Äôm going for a 3 year fixed-rate mortgage now, which has put a slight cap on the total size I could buy, but I believe it‚Äôs worth it.

There is a risk here though: if prices fall, market demand disappears, rates rise a lot, and my career gets worse, then I‚Äôm screwed. It is not the safe option, but an investment decision whilst being well aware of the risks. It may be that you prefer to play it much safer.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"It is worth noting that Mock the Week is no slouch on this. Over the course of the series they've had a number of women on the show.

However either the editing is sexist or these women are not as funny as the guys because in every single one of those episodes the women get much, much less air (i.e edit) time and in the time they get they don't shine anywhere near as brightly as the guys.

Male patriarchy, sure but you can you genuinely offer me some female comics that are on the same level as the top comedians at the moment? All I can think of is Linda Smith but alas she is no longer with us. D:

EDIT: You guys wanna counter my points instead of merely downvoting? I'm trying to suggest that MTW are trying to get women on but they never seem to do as ""well"" as the men. Surely that's understandable from the fact that the women don't get invited back that often or get given much edit time when they are on.  
Are we suggesting that the patriarchy also extends as far as the editing room?  

Additionally while the comedy clubs might have the patriarchy this isn't an industry like software development where people are hired/fired/interviewed and a company culture is founded. Most comedians, especially stand-ups are both independent contractors and are hired/fired on a measurable meritocracy based on audience laughter.  
While I can appreciate that an amazing female software developer might have difficulty due to communication issues and/or people making assumptions, I fail to see how an amazing female comedian would have difficulty. Her job inherently expresses how good she is at her job when she does it.  
If you make people laugh then you get asked back. Unless you're suggesting the patriarchy is mis-judging the laughter a female comic receives.  ",0,1393344357,null,0,1393349941,0,cfoc3pk,t3_1yvqxc,t1_cfoc3pk,t1_cfo9iz1,null,1432553216,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,Garuda_,eng-lincolnshire,"Grimsby, Sheffield, Oxford, Lancaster, Windsor","&gt; Britain was named because it was inhabited by the Brythonic (Britonic/Prythonic... I will go with Britonic henceforth as it's shorter) speakers, a different family of Celtic languages than what were spoken in Ireland. No Britonic speakers ever lived in Ireland.

Yeah, and they came from Brittany. Britain derives its name from the Brythons, who came from Brittany, which is exactly what I said.

&gt; Brittany in fact acquired its Brythonic tongue by Britonic immigration - that's right, before the Saxons ever arrived, you guys were even then exporting languages! Ireland did too, our Gaelic family replacing the Britonic tongues in Isle of Man and Scotland. Before 'you' arrived they spoke something akin to Gaulish.

Are you trying to make an argument that the Irish were never 'true' Brythons because they immigrated? So did the ones in Britain (so did EVERYBODY in the 'Isles of Disputed Name)

This was well over 2000 years ago, I think any 'imported' language or culture from back then can safely be considered to be 'at home' in Ireland. What a fucking stupid argument.

&gt;The term ""British Isles"" dates to the mid 1500s, when it was coined by John Dee. It was an attempt to reconcile the idea that England and its burgeoning hegemony over Britain and Ireland was a superior nation with the idea of, well, everyone not hating the English. The idea was to minimise the recent history of conquest by the Saxons and by the Normans, and try to tie everyone back together as ""Britons"". It helped that Dee himself was Welsh, perhaps the last remaining true ""Britons"" after the assimilation of the Picts.

I don't deny this at all. The term British Isles doesn't predate 1500 and John Dee absolutely had an agenda, but that doesn't change the fact that the British Isles are an archipelago with inseparable history and culture, and that the terminology has been accepted for five centuries, far outliving Dee's agenda (the British aren't at all interested in 'claiming' Ireland these days) - Telling us off for using accepted terminology because it has an inbuilt agenda that favours us seems a bit hypocritical given that you guys call yourself 'Ireland/Eire' - A name that specifically carries the agenda of making Ireland seem like a singular body (encouraging the assumption that Northern Ireland is a part of the ROI)

I find it ridiculous that you cite a 500 year old agenda and equally old counterarguments when that agenda is clearly long dead, and the ROI is doing exactly the same thing to this very day with Northern Ireland

That isn't evidence of a bubble.

Neither of which share prices appear to be bubble levels if you ask me.

He also mentions:

&gt; Few stock market investors really believe in these stories. Most investors know that current levels of share prices are unsustainable

This is demonstrably false.  A quick look at the options and futures show that investor consensus is definitely not that prices are unsustainable.

He argues that we have lower GDP than we did before, so we can't have a higher FTSE100 price.  He almost acknowledges QEs effect, but his conclusions are appear very miss leading to me.  If you look at GDP figures, un-adjusted for inflation, then we've got higher GDP than we had five years ago.  As the FTSE100 will have been inflated by QE and such, I just can't understand why he compares inflation adjusted against it.

What I am saying is having a higher than before FTSE100 is more an example of our inflation, not automatically a sign of a bubble.",0,1393345236,null,0,false,0,cfochv4,t3_1yvqcu,t1_cfochv4,t1_cfoazcl,null,1432553402,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It all comes down to Anti Money Laundering. Provided the businesses involved can demonstrate that they are abiding by the rules and have mechanisms in place to prevent the free-flow of cash to/from bad actors (and as a general rule - having a UK bank account means you have been subjected to some fairly intensive checks, with or without your knowledge) - nobody cares. 

Remember, none of the European exchanges have any kind of AML licenses (Bitstamp is actually Slovenian and has registered a shell company at an address in Bracknell, UK through a known shell company provider). Barclay's, and by association other foxex companies that depend on a bank account such as TransferWise were not going to take the risk.

It's worrying to see that the BBC did not note that Mr. Begg was released from Guant√°namo without charge and that they didn't include the contextualising information police provided to the media:

&gt; **We are confirming this name as a result of the anticipated high public interest to accredited media. We would take this opportunity to remind you of the requirement to report responsibly,** that this is an arrest, not a charge, and that our naming does not imply any guilt.

There is a frightening lack of information in the BBC's report, in fact. The Guardian's article also contains this relevant quote:

&gt; In January Begg condemned Britain's approach to Syria and the alleged criminalising of those who go out to fight there. He wrote: ""It is not hard to understand why Muslims would want to go out to Syria to help. Scores of them go every month on humanitarian aid missions and face endless questioning at ports by British police under schedule 7 anti-terrorism powers. It is also understandable why people want to go out and fight for what they believe is a just cause, even if the wisdom of them doing so can be questioned.""

As additional information, it might be worth reading CAGE's paper on [The Prevent Strategy](http://cageuk.org/report.pdf), a ""central part of the domestic War on Terror that is impacting
Muslim communities. It is arguably regarded as the leading blueprint for counter-terrorism policy
across the world. CAGE became increasingly alarmed at the absence of due process, the manner in which basic rights are being eroded and the atmosphere of secrecy prevailing amongst many institutions in regard to Muslims."" CAGE describe themselves as ""an independent advocacy organisation working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror. By promoting due process, the vision of the organisation is to see a return to respect for those fundamental norms which transcend religion, societies and political theories.""

As part of setting their investigative priorities in 2006, the Met consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to agree upon a strategy for pursuing the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry. Assistant commissioner John Yates claimed that the Met was guided by advice from the CPS, then headed by Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ken Macdonald, that ""phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.""*

I remember it being even more ill defined than that but certainly if they thought it was not an offence to listen to someones voice mail message unless they had not listened to it yet that's a long way off the current legal position.  What I seem to remember is they were equating the practice with being the same as reading a letter addressed to someone after the recipient had already received and read the letter.

true,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,"&gt; Yeah, and they came from Brittany. Britain derives its name from the Brythons, who came from Brittany, which is exactly what I said.

Wrong. Brittany gets its name from the Britons, who came from Britain. Again, that you know nothing of your own prehistory is astonishing, though I guess it's hardly as glorious for highschool history as the Empire, so if that's where your interest ended, you wouldn't have received it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany#Immigration_of_Britons

&gt; Are you trying to make an argument that the Irish were never 'true' Brythons because they immigrated? So did the ones in Britain (so did EVERYBODY in the 'Isles of Disputed Name)

No, because they never spoke Brythonic. If that's where the name for Britain comes from (and it is, you are mistaken), then how would it apply to Ireland which never had such speakers? Your argument, founded on the idea that the name is external, falls apart when *actual fact* is brought in.

&gt; This was well over 2000 years ago, I think any 'imported' language or culture from back then can safely be considered to be 'at home' in Ireland. What a fucking stupid argument.

Again, missing the point that the Brythonic culture was never imported to Ireland, in fact the opposite: Gaelic culture spread to Britain in Scotland, and was threatening to spread into Wales and Cornwall where Irish lords had lands and Irish raiders made happy hunting grounds. It would be more apt then, to call them the Gaelic Isles, but we don't, because the Saxons (not Brythonics either) arrived.

&gt; Telling us off for using accepted terminology because it has an inbuilt agenda that favours us seems a bit hypocritical given that you guys call yourself 'Ireland/Eire' - A name that specifically carries the agenda of making Ireland seem like a singular body (encouraging the assumption that Northern Ireland is a part of the ROI)

Ireland - The Republic of Ireland - *did* officially, as a constitutional, state-central policy, claim the entirety of the island of Ireland until the Good Friday Agreement of 1999. It has relinquished that claim, but not the name, which is not a problem as far as I can see because:

1. Ireland is a noun, not an adjective. If we were to call it ""The Gaelic Island"" we'd be imposing a cultural identity on a geographic feature. ""Ireland"" means ""The Land of Eiru"", a fertility goddess. Eire is this in our native language, which you seem annoyed at the use of?

2. We call it Ireland in day to day speech as much as you refer to The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as ""Britain"". No-one has ever complained about the usage of ""Republic of Ireland"" in formalities, as the sane amongst us see its use for clarity and the republican-whackjobs don't like to call the 'incomplete' state by a 'complete' name. See also the madness that we don't have an independance day because certain people don't think we're independant yet.

3. ""Southern Ireland"" doesn't make any sense. The **northernmost**, westernmost and southernmost point on the island of Ireland are in the Republic. The easternmost is in NI. 31 of the 37 modern counties in Ireland are in the Republic, with Northern Ireland not even comprising a whole province. Even then, Northern Ireland contains 3  majority ""Irish"" counties -then as now - that were added to it as a buffer because of the very real threat of invasion by the old IVF during/directly after the War of Independance. This deft move by Britain worked so well as to avoid such a confrontation, that it even threw Ireland into Civil War instead about whether anything should be done about it.

4. The name of our state originated in the ""Articles of Agreement for a Treaty Between Great Britain and Ireland"", a treaty agreed between Britain and Ireland (also the first time Britain officially dropped the title of ""Empire"") which placed the entirety of Ireland under the control of the government of Ireland with the addendum that *Northern Ireland could secede within a period of one month*. Thus, Ireland was Ireland, and then there was Northern Ireland. Again, your lack of knowledge on history undermines every argument you make. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty

5. The idea that we retain the name *today* as a political statement is nonsense. 16 years ago the people of our nation voted **94%** in favour of relinquishing that claim as an outdated, between-wars hangover. Again, you display clearly that you have very little understanding of Irish attitudes, politics or culture.

6. ""British Isles"" *was* foisted on a nation with no history as a 'British people'. ""Ireland"" imposes nothing on anyone.

true,Karma9999,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; I'd say it was pretty moral to support a system that has improved the quality of life for so many.

If that was what it had done, then it would be fine. Sadly, it doesn't. Capitalism inherently forces people into a have/have not mentality. If you have, that's great. Of course, if you have, then you want to keep on having. Which means your interests are automatically swayed towards making sure you keep on having, usually but not always at the expense of the have nots. Another word for this is greed. [sidenote, Greed is one of the seven deadly sins, so that can be defined as Not-moral] 

Along with being a ""have"" is accumulating power, to convince others to do what you want them to in order for them to become a have. Again, human nature encourages you to not lose your position, so you try to influence people to think you're a great guy, a really big have, so you accumulate political influence, again at the expense of have-nots. [This is called the Conservative party]

Capitalism in one form or another has been around for a long long LONG time, going way back before New Testament times. It's not for no reason that the money-lenders were driven out of the temple by Jesus, I think that again puts them on the Not-Moral side. 

In my mind, the real problem is that we haven't been able to try any other system. Being a have is so corrosive that whenever anyone suggests another system it's like an antibody reaction, they must be destroyed at all costs. We don't know if communism works, it didn't last long enough to try it. State-capitalism didn't seem to work for the USSR, the opposition was pretty virulent. Maybe the Chinese will do better. 


I agree that we won't get everyone equal, we need to have a system that rewards work. but do we have to do it at the expense of everyone else? I don't mind if you want the latest and greatest sports cars, if you work for them. I'm quite happy with my bike, I don't need a sports car. I do need a bike to survive though, to be able to get to work, get around etc. How about everyone gets a bike, if they want a sports car they can go work for it.

Yesterday Jos√© Mourinho said something very hurtful about his strikers at Chelsea, insinuating that the three of them are about as useful as a stringless tennis racket and saying that he'd rather have Radamel Falcao up front instead, making sure to insult Monaco for good measure as well. The least you can say is that it's never quiet when Mourinho's around. But luckily for The Increasingly Grouchy One, none of his strikers had heard what he had to say anyway. Samuel Eto'o and Fernando Torres were both lying unconscious after accidentally running into each other during shooting practice, Demba Ba had fallen down a mine and Romelu Lukaku, the world's greatest self-publicist, was busy watching DVDs of Chelsea DVDs ‚Äì he's such a big fan. All things considered, it was quite the escape for Mourinho. He might have had some explaining to do otherwise.

One problem, though: Mourinho's comments were never intended for public consumption, the Chelsea manager quite rightly assuming that his off-hand remarks to some irrelevant, starstruck, suited flunky weren't being recorded. Wrong! This, after all, is the digital age. Of course, they were being recorded ‚Äì though while The Fiver, desperate to break its Proper Journalism duck, would like to tell you that Mourinho had become the NSA's latest victim, what actually happened was that he was simply unaware he was being filmed and soon his comments were being broadcast on French television, presumably to the considerable amusement of Ars√®ne Wenger. Clearly Mourinho doesn't watch House of Cards, else he'd know that when you're talking to one person, you're talking to a thousand.

Unfortunately Mourinho doesn't have time to open a Netflix account and sit on the sofa in his grundies all day. He's a busy man. But Mourinho wasn't having it. Furious at being stitched up, he used his press conference before Chelsea's Big Cup tie against Galatasaray to lecture the media on ethics, as assorted hacks looked sheepishly at the floor and promised never to do it again. We're sorry Jos√©, please don't hate us Jos√©, we never meant to upset you Jos√© ‚Äì can we still be friends Jos√©?

""I think you should be embarrassed as a media professional because, from an ethical point of view, I don't think you should be happy ‚Äì not you, but a colleague ‚Äì is able to record a private conversation and make it public,"" Mourinho seethed. ""You should all be a bit embarrassed because it's against the ethics you have in your work. From an ethical point of view, it's a real disgrace. I'm not defending what I'm saying. I'm attacking something that is, I think, fundamental in your professional area.""

If the market is such that most people don't find women funny forcing them to be exposed to comedy they don't like/want is absolutely ridiculous.

your entire argument is basically telling the customer they are wrong, and that they should amend their sense of humour because you want to cater to a specific demographic.

Simply ridiculous in principle and concept. 

In comedy if it works it works and people find it funny if it doesn't that's YOU THE COMEDIAN'S responsibility to tailor your act/talent so it does, not demand the audience change their taste.

One of the huge arguments about money is that it's an incentive to work. Of course, nowadays automation is becoming such a huge thing that people don't really need to work to produce, we can make quite enough to live off, food, clothing and living spaces,  but that's by the by. I was just thinking about innovators, about how someone wouldn't work in their basement for 20 years to make a new improved finangle if they didn't have a moneypot waiting for them at the end of it. 

My thought was, well actually, they would. They wouldn't need to be in their basement, they'd probably be able to do it in nicer circumstances. People enjoy doing things, some people like inventing stuff, me I like helping people, that's why I'm a nurse. I'd still do my job if I didn't have any money worries, maybe slightly less hours, but then again that would mean a little more room for those nurses who can't find work right now. 

Enough about me, back to our intrepid inventor. He might give up, he might not, I suspect people who are interested in that would continue to do it. Now, what about all the others? The innovators, the inventors, the geniuses who were unable through circumstance to devote 20 years to a project, they had a family to feed, student bills to pay, they had to work down at Tescos to make ends meet, so they never got around to coming up with finangle+, new and improved. If they didn't have to work, they could have done what they loved, and enriched society so much more than a bit of shelf-stacking. 

It's my firm belief that capitalism is wasting our talent, inventors et al, our artistry, painters, musicians etc, who have to work to survive instead of making all our lives so much better.

Exactly. Let's go through this step by step shall we?

Writer writes one of these awful ""all grown up"" pieces

DM pays them and publishes it on a web site

Reader reads that and posts it to a sub reddit

The sub reddit mods either don't see it or don't care

Reddit holds this post on their servers which are run by amazon 

Amazon passes that information on through backbone provides to your ISP

Your ISP passes it on to you when you load the page. 

Who exactly is responsible here? Up until we get to reddit hosting the subreddit on which it might be posted every one is making a choice to create, or knowingly pass on that content, from reddit up it's largely a dumb chain of service. If you think this makes reddit as responsible as the DM for the content then fine but that would equally make amazon, the backbone providers and your ISP responsible so you better be willing to boycott those as well.

Yes reddit could make a choice to ban anything remotely like that DM content on it's site but it would simply be unenforceable. So they chose to go mainly with the idea of free speech, one that I happen to think has a lot to recommend it because it really comes down to making *the people* who say things, not where they say them, responsible for what they say. 

They did shut down the jailbate sub because that something that was brought to their attention but there is no way on earth they can have a site as active as this and be able to stop any kind of jailbait like links being posted or discussion had and it's ridiculous to equate that to the DM who *actively* produce and distribute that kind of content.    

You can dismiss me as this made up strawman if you like but I am nothing like you want to discribe me and pretending that I must not question myself or my beliefs because I don't chose to come to the same answer as you is reductive childish nonsense.

Yes, because it's irrelevant.

In this example, the argument is that ""people don't think women are funny"", so unless a female guest is really, *really* good then bookers are less likely to get her on the show because as soon as they're thinking of ""funny people to book"" they mentally dismiss most of the eligible women *because of their own prejudices*, not necessarily because the women they're dismissing are objectively unqualified for the spot.

If I were to criticise this then what I would say is that the object of the name change is to break the association between National Insurance and it's fundamental function of paying for those things that  are part of the UK's social contract, aka unemployment assistance, pensions, health, those things that everybody in life needs to insure against, except perhaps the lucky few who are not reliant upon wider society for these things but are still obligated to the society in which they live. Instead people will see it as a tax on productivity, working hard, and their pay packet- and a second tax separate from income tax that will frankly get their backs up.

I think the reason why he and others want this change is because Gummer is not particularly invested in the idea of the state having to provide this function. The thing is I live in Germany at the moment, and it is so much easier knowing my national insurance covers me and others should bad health strike in the UK, and it is a faff organising the obligatory health insurance with other providers here, plus if you change your mind later you're rather stuck. Plus I don't like that people in Germany can opt out if they earn enough, as I feel it is a good thing for those that have means to help those that are vulnerable. Change the name though and change the function, which I feel this could be the first step towards.

Basically I think he's turning part of the social contract of being a Briton into a potential political football down the road. If the Conservatives think that National Insurance has been abused from its original function then I'd rather they restored the idea of that rather than break the association that you pay it to cover for those times in life when you will be vulnerable.

I moved to Leeds from overseas 18 months ago, and really considered which club to support. After going to a match at Elland Road and watching from some oppressive pubs, I could not get behind the local guys, and I started looking further afield in northern England.

I met a few well-informed Everton supporters and started watching some of the games.  But weird as it sounds, going on this subreddit after losses was really what sealed the deal--lots of posts pulling out the positives and calmly analyzing the failures.

Perfect example was the nice big Osman banner on the title page after his botched backpass to Howard in the Sunderland game--he screwed up, but he is one of our own.

There were a lot of other great reasons why I chose to support Everton, including the style of play and the more traditional finances of the club.  And when people ask why I support Everton, I of course tell them it's because Everton is the best football club.  But having some balanced supporters in evidence here was certainly a factor.

I say, what is the evidence that they are unsustainable.

I would say (as I did in that other link) that compared to GDP, which hasn't been inflation adjusted, the prices are in-line.  Now that is obviously my interpretation.

But the idea of the market is, that if people thought they where overvalued, they would be doing something about it.  You can see a kind of confidence by looking at the options market, depending on the confidence and volatility the strikes been traded will be tighter.

Yes.

&gt; if the public perception is that they don't find women funny, rightly or wrongly it doesn't matter

The assertion, however, is not that audiences will be so turned off by the presence of a single woman on the panel that they will refuse to tune in.  Most people are significantly more attached to the shows they watch than that (and there are plenty of funny female comedians), so it's basically a non-issue.

The assertion is that *despite* the fact audiences won't care (or the presence of female panellists may even improve the show), the *people and organisations responsible for booking the talent* will nevertheless instinctively exclude them.

Again: this position is not claiming that audience's prejudices significantly impact on the selection of female talent, that audiences want men and/or that audiences are wrong.

The position is that audiences *don't care* (or might even *prefer* a more mixed lineup), that even if some of them *don't* think women are funny their prejudice is unlikely to outweigh their loyalty to the other aspects of the show, but that the people and organisations responsible for *selecting* talent are both prejudiced and that their prejudice necessarily biases their selections.

Let's start with the outright untruth - that out of work benefits are stopped when you have ¬£6k of capital. The truth is that ¬£6k is the threshold above which you lose ¬£1 from your benefits per week for every ¬£250 of capital you hold. ¬£16k is the point at which you can't claim out of work benefits.

Also, I find it hard to believe that somebody could save up &gt;¬£6k from 'what he had at the end of the week' on ESA. The basic rate of ESA is ¬£71.70 per week. Let's assume that your friend was placed in the support group and got the highest weekly amount available for ESA claimants which is ¬£106.50 p/w. I'm going to be generous and assume that by 'a couple of years' you mean three whole years. That would mean your friend would have to save ¬£38.46 p/w (without adjusting for annual uprating) just to hit ¬£6k which, let's remember, in itself would have no effect on his benefit.

Now apparently your friend has no money. Remember that even if your friend had to live on his own capital, he would see his benefits paid to him again in full when he had &lt;¬£6k. How on earth did said spendthrift friend who managed to save over 1/3 of his ESA whilst seriously ill manage to burn through it all now on the same income?

I suspect that your friend might have done something more naughty than hold &gt;¬£6k in capital (which would have reduced but not cancelled his benefit).

But he also disregards the fact that we still play 2 of the teams competing with us for fourth. Yes, it's unlikely we drop a heap of points.

But really, who fucking knows? We could drop points, spiral, and finish 5th or 6th. We could lock up fourth, drop points to City/Chelsea, and then have United go on to win the CL and miss out. We could comfortably grab 4th and get nothing more, dropping points to Southampton along the way.

That future was changed. The only ones powerful enough to change such a future, are the Timelords. And they did.

Moffat set up The Name of the Doctor in a way that seemed inescapable. A fixed death point where the 11th Doctor's TARDIS is his grave. How can he write out of this one we all thought? He now has to die here in his Eleventh body because Clara only see's 11 faces (12) in his final timestream. Not to mention his grave is his exact TARDIS exterior, cracked window and all and they'll surly change the TARDIS exterior eventually which would contradict the episode. 

5 months go by and nobody can think of how Moffat can write his way out of this one. The The Day of The Doctor comes out. The Timelords, previously thought to be all dead are now trapped in a another Universe. fast forward to Time of The Doctor and they are trying to break back in through Trenzaore (ultimately being the cause of 11s entire Silence arc). However, they save the day and change the future. 11s TARDIS no longer sits as his grave on Trenzalore. He regenerates and destroys the Daleks and that final battle never happens. That entire story arc is over. We will get a fresh one with 12.

In some countries it makes sense.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"I'm going to take a wild guess and assume you've never actually studied economics. Most of your objections would be covered in an introductory class.

&gt; Capitalism inherently forces people into a have/have not mentality. If you have, that's great. Of course, if you have, then you want to keep on having. Which means your interests are automatically swayed towards making sure you keep on having, usually but not always at the expense of the have nots. Another word for this is greed.

It would be impressive if capitalism had inculcated desire for goods and services into the human race, but actually the relationship is the reverse: capitalism's success is predicated on human's innate desire for more. This doesn't have to be possessions either. I'd assume you want access to more medicine, better food, better education ‚Äì if not for yourself then certainly for others. This might be more altruistic than greed but capitalism doesn't care why you want something, it merely cares whether or not you do want it.

Capitalism is not a zero sum game. In order to buy things one must earn money, and money is only earnt after wealth is created. Wealth is colloquially thought of as money, but in economics wealth is a measure of goods and services. When one goes to work you are in effect selling your labour, a service made of time, effort, knowledge and skills, in effect creating wealth that would not be created if you sat at home eating biscuits. 

Every transaction you engage in is mutually beneficial for both parties, whether or not you believe you are getting a ""fair"" price. Sellers want to sell their goods for as high a price as possible, while buyers want to buy goods for as low a price as possible. Either they reach a compromise which is mutually agreeable, or they don't and they go their separate ways.

For example, if you buy a cup of coffee for ¬£2, that coffee must be worth more to you than the ¬£2 you spent on it, at least at the time. Likewise, the coffee was worth less to the vendor than the ¬£2, otherwise he would not have bothered selling it to you. The trade is mutually beneficial.

&gt; Capitalism in one form or another has been around for a long long LONG time, going way back before New Testament times. It's not for no reason that the money-lenders were driven out of the temple by Jesus, I think that again puts them on the Not-Moral side.

Jesus was the leader of an apocalyptic death cult, so he had every reason not to care about money. But while capitalism has existed for a long time, free market capitalism is a relatively new phenomenon, so much so that Adam Smith was considered a radical for arguing for it in the 18th century. Beforehand most markets had been meddled with by rulers imposing tariffs, protectionism and state sponsored monopolies.

&gt; In my mind, the real problem is that we haven't been able to try any other system. Being a have is so corrosive that whenever anyone suggests another system it's like an antibody reaction, they must be destroyed at all costs. We don't know if communism works, it didn't last long enough to try it. State-capitalism didn't seem to work for the USSR, the opposition was pretty virulent. Maybe the Chinese will do better.

The Chinese have already given up communism after it doomed generations of them to poverty. The centrally planned Indian economy went much the same way. The 20th century amply demonstrated that communism is an unworkable, moronic idea peddled by academics and cranks. The fact is that ""from each according to his ability to each according to his need"" can only be channelled through an autocratic government, which has its own interests that outweigh the interests of the many.

&gt; I don't mind if you want the latest and greatest sports cars, if you work for them. I'm quite happy with my bike, I don't need a sports car. I do need a bike to survive though, to be able to get to work, get around etc. How about everyone gets a bike, if they want a sports car they can go work for it. This is the basis of the minimum income concept going around nowadays, it seems much more moral to me than pure capitalism.

It might seem more moral to you, but that's only because you have almost no understanding of how markets function. Wages are not plucked from thin air, they are the result of supply and demand. That is why Wayne Rooney can demand such a high salary for kicking a ball around the pitch - his skills are in short supply and there is a high demand for them. Unskilled and low-skilled workers are more numerous than the market can absorb in this country, but even without a minimum wage employers still have to make it worth their time and effort.

The minimum wage constitutes an artificial raising of the price of labour beyond that which the market can sustain. Looked at another way the minimum wage makes it illegal for prospective employees to underbid other candidates to make themselves more attractive to employers. While those lucky enough to remain employed will see a boost to their income when the minimum wage is raised, others will find it harder to find employment ‚Äì and these will end up being the most vulnerable, socially immobile people in society. 

&gt; People enjoy doing things, some people like inventing stuff, me I like helping people, that's why I'm a nurse. I'd still do my job if I didn't have any money worries, maybe slightly less hours, but then again that would mean a little more room for those nurses who can't find work right now.

The market has two effects in this regard. It entices people to do work that they do not enjoy. You might not like this, but there are a great deal of unpleasant job provide benefit for humanity. Second, it encourages innovators and businesses to produce things that people want to pay for: in other words, goods and services that people actually want. Whilst people would continue to make useful and enjoyable things if there was no market, it is likely they would make far less as people pursued their own interests as opposed to the interests of others.",0,1393355428,null,0,false,0,cfohik5,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cfohik5,t1_cfodh69,null,1432555767,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Around 50 years ago black people weren't allowed to sit at the front of the bus. They weren't allowed in the same toilets as white people and weren't allowed to drink from the same water fountains as while people. They were paid less, their schools were worse and no one cared about them at all. The ones that spoke out about such hardships ended up dead. 

100 years before that they were banned from learning to read and write.. 

You can't reasonably expect a community of people (forget race for a second) to just pull up their trousers and get over it when they've been downtrodden by their government for generations. It's the job of the government to help get them back on their feet because up until recently they were doing their best to kick them to the ground and keep them there. 

On a case by case basis, no it's not fair that someone who is black and got worse grades gets into a school over a white person with better grades purely based on the colour of their skin. It's bullshit. 

In the bigger picture, it makes complete sense. It's a pretty hard concept to accept because neither the black student nor the white student had any choice in what happened 50, 100, 150 years ago. But we're all a product of our history, and maybe the reason that white girl had better grades was because she was white and had all the innate privilege that came with that.

I'd only written the second paragraph about Drogba (becoming a coach) as it was still very fresh in the news and felt it should be discussed. 
However, I can see your point, as it relates little to the game.

As you may have seen in the final two paragraphs before the line-ups and the line-ups themselves, I have tried to express my thoughts on how Chelsea will play (talking about the 4-3-3 as opposed to the 4-2-3-1) and went into more detail on them than Gala, as this preview was to be intended more for Chelsea fans (this was also why I delved little into Gala as a club). I do however, understand the from your point of you, the need to offer some explanation as to who certain clubs are, esp. in European competition.

Although, I did not feel this was as appropriate as the nature of the article was to be intended as a quick one - short, simple and to the point. This was picked up in the feedback on my previous article on the Everton game. Considering that, I tried my best to not delve into such deep detail and so this is the main reason why I didn't explain much about the Turkish club.

¬£142 doesn't relate directly to any ESA award I can find. It's not close to any combinations of premiums I tried for a single person. The closest I could find is the couple rate of ¬£112.55 plus the support group component which would give a weekly award of ¬£147.35 for both to live on. Given that your friend was claiming for more than a year, they both must have been part of a joint income related claim. You're telling me that they lived on ¬£72.35 p/w (¬£75 disposable income) for several years?

&gt;He was also on DLA, and Housing benefits which I should of made clear, but it was his ESA that was stopped which was why it was mentioned. This is all while he was battling cancer. I'll pass on your message that he is full of shit.

Ok, add in DLA. This could add anywhere between ¬£21 - ¬£134.40 p/w to your friend's income (however for the higher amount he would have to be *significantly* disabled). At any rate, this money is for the extra costs associated with being disabled such as care or transport so it would not add to that high amount of disposable income.

&gt;If you read between the lines you must know that did not mean he has **no** money. Maybe I should of said he can't afford a nice meal out with his wife?

I'm trying to read between the lines mate but this story makes no sense. As I've explained, benefit is not withdrawn but reduced when you have capital over ¬£6k. It's withdrawn when you have over ¬£16k. When his capital went back under ¬£6k (eg. ¬£5999) his ESA would return to the full award. I don't know how your mate can't find a nice meal under ¬£6k.

I'm no fan of ATOS and I think the WCA is a punitive shambles. I don't think inaccurate anecdotes like this help though. Don't tell your mate he's full of shit, that wouldn't be very nice of you as a friend. Just maybe take his stories with a pinch of salt in the future.

For a start the problem with that particular policy is that it ignores the fact that there are a shitload of white people in abject poverty in the US, I bet they don't feel particularly privileged, a white person should be disregarded whilst a black person gets a leg up because the former's ancestors had it better than the latter's? That's ludicrous. If it's a question of metrics, why not target those sorts of policies based on economic situations? Don't you see how crazy it is that a white person in extreme poverty could get zero help and a very privileged black person would get a lot?

I'm only going to reply to this because I think the women in comedy quota is pretty ridiculous. I'm arguing your assertion that all forms of positive discrimination are abhorrent. I'm saying some aren't. 

&gt;For a start the problem with that particular policy is that it ignores the fact that there are a shitload of white people in abject poverty in the US

It doesn't. As far as I know it's not pretending to be an economic program, it's a race based program. Poverty has very little to do with it and culture has a lot more to do with it. They're trying to breed a culture within the black community that education is something to strive towards. Something which was drilled out of their community by centuries of oppression. 

There should be (and almost certainly are) separate programs to help the lower classes of America get an education. But that's neither here, nor there. There doesn't need to be one without the other. 

Some fun statistics on why positive discrimination is needed within the black community in the USA:

* 1 in 3 black people will end up in prison. 

* 3/10 Americans are black, 6/10 American prisoners are black. 

* For the same crimes, black Americans on average receive sentences that are 10% longer than the averages for whites.

true,Karma9999,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"In all of the first post I was arguing about the idea of capitalism being immoral, not how the system is meant to work. 
I'm not debating whether it can work or not, obviously it can, but not to the benefit of all. For every winner, there's a loser. For every millionaire, there are homeless and destitute. The current system cannot benefit all, therefore it's immoral. 

&gt;It would be impressive if capitalism had inculcated desire for goods and services into the human race, but actually the relationship is the reverse: capitalism's success is predicated on human's innate desire for more. 

We are currently producing many times over what we require to live and thrive on. There is an innate connection between capitalism and advertising. When you talk to someone working for minimum wage who insists that she buy her daughter the new iPhone, despite the daughter already having the previous version, then you know that the system is broken. to rephrase, *capitalism's success is predicated on human's greed*. This is about as good an idea as basing our system of living on any other major flaw in our character.

&gt;The 20th century amply demonstrated that communism is an unworkable, moronic idea peddled by academics and cranks. 

People who have that kind of vehement reaction to the idea are usually those who have a vested interest in maintaining the current one. It's possible that communism can't survive the people administering it. It's also possible that it can't survive the influence from capitalist societies around it. That doesn't make it less moral. 

&gt;they are the result of supply and demand.

[quickrant] why does everyone in this kind of discussion feel a need to discuss supply and demand, an extremely simple idea. The point that supply is nowadays massively above and beyond what demand we can place on it seems to escape them. cf. Butter and beef mountains, etc. They seem to ignore the flip side of the concept: ""whatever the market will bear"". ie, how much can people rip other people off. [/quickrant] 

&gt; there are a great deal of unpleasant job provide benefit for humanity.

&gt;I'm a nurse.

I think I know.  I think I covered the innovator argument in my second post.


&gt;Whilst people would continue to make useful and enjoyable things if there was no market, it is likely they would make far less as people pursued their own interests as opposed to the interests of others.

Very probably they would make less. Without the rampant advertising forcing people to consume and buy more, we could quite easily manage with less. Thing is though, there are more and more humans around, all producing stuff of one form or another. If everyone pursued their own interests, then we'd have a more varied, more interesting and definitely more moral society than we have nowadays.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; In all of the first post I was arguing about the idea of capitalism being immoral, not how the system is meant to work. I'm not debating whether it can work or not, obviously it can, but not to the benefit of all. For every winner, there's a loser. For every millionaire, there are homeless and destitute. The current system cannot benefit all, therefore it's immoral.

You've entirely misunderstood. Poverty is natural, and the human race was born into it. The homeless and destitute are not the product of capitalism. The fact that somebody can now be classified as ""in poverty"" and still own an iPhone is the product of capitalism. The fact that central heating, running water and an internet connection are now considered basic amenities is also the product of capitalism.

&gt; We are currently producing many times over what we require to live and thrive on. There is an innate connection between capitalism and advertising. When you talk to someone working for minimum wage who insists that she buy her daughter the new iPhone, despite the daughter already having the previous version, then you know that the system is broken. to rephrase, capitalism's success is predicated on human's greed. This is about as good an idea as basing our system of living on any other major flaw in our character.

Adam Smith had as low an opinion of the character of capitalists as is possible. Indeed what is remarkable about his theory is that it harnessed the rapaciousness of man and put it towards achieving something: namely higher living standards. No economic theory has every claimed to erase the stupidity of a mother who cannot refuse her daughter the new iPhone, and none ever will. The human race will always carry morons with it.

&gt; People who have that kind of vehement reaction to the idea are usually those who have a vested interest in maintaining the current one. It's possible that communism can't survive the people administering it. It's also possible that it can't survive the influence from capitalist societies around it. That doesn't make it less moral.

I do indeed have a vested interest in maintaining a system that has proved time and again to raise people out of poverty and raise living standards. But there's no reason to suspect that communism would fare any better even without the influence of capitalist systems. Russia was quite able to isolate herself and her people from market forces, although clearly there is a disadvantage in hearing that your enemies are doing so much better than you because of your squalid economic policy.

&gt; [quickrant] why does everyone in this kind of discussion feel a need to discuss supply and demand, an extremely simple idea. The point that supply is nowadays massively above and beyond what demand we can place on it seems to escape them. cf. Butter and beef mountains, etc. They seem to ignore the flip side of the concept: ""whatever the market will bear"". ie, how much can people rip other people off. [/quickrant]

Supply and demand is arguably *the* fundamental driver of markets, and it has profound implications on even complex arguments. You wouldn't complain that a scientist kept referring to evolution by natural selection when discussing, say, genetics, or sexual psychology, or plant life or many other facets of nature.

&gt; Very probably they would make less. Without the rampant advertising forcing people to consume and buy more, we could quite easily manage with less. Thing is though, there are more and more humans around, all producing stuff of one form or another. If everyone pursued their own interests, then we'd have a more varied, more interesting and definitely more moral society than we have nowadays.

A society with less medicine is a more moral one? A society with less advanced computers? Many of the advances in technology have enabled more varied behaviour from humans. The sort of communities we see online were far harder to sustain without the internet, which has in large part been driven by commercial interests.

And perhaps I am a man of incredible mental fortitude, but I have never been *forced* to consume anything by advertising.",0,1393359712,null,0,false,0,cfojpto,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cfojpto,t1_cfoiqxi,null,1432556871,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Lennon has the least amount of technical ability of any of those wingers.

&gt; That isn't really Lennon's role in the squad though, nor is it his prime skill set

Well what exactly is his role in the squad? He cant pass, cant cross, cant shoot and his dribbling is that of an average PL winger these days. Such an abstract argument with little detail to hide behind the fact that he isnt up to much.

&gt; but few PL wingers have the experience Lennon has combined with his physical and technical attributes. 

Pretty much all of the wingers named above have the same experience as Lennon and regardless you cant just hide behind the 'experience' argument - such an abstract concept and Lennon certainly doesnt play like an experienced player anyway given his extremely limited skill-set, he isnt a leader and rarely steps up when were in trouble. Andros has shown a brilliant ability to step up when the going gets tough and rise to the occasion. He was completely unfazed making his debut for england in a key qualifying match. Thats the type of attitude I want to see.

Almost every single player in the premier league and Championship have better Technical ability than Lennon.

What exactly are lennons physical attributes? Sure he is fast but is pace isnt what it once was - his dribbling ability is distinctly average these days.

Just to add, the small (but significant) difference with transferring funds to IBWT (via bank wire transfer) is that you are transferring funds to OKPAY, and then with your OKPAY account funded, you are then funding your IBWT account.
