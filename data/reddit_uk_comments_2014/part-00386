Here's something that liberals cannot accept: stereotypes actually exist because a large proportion of the group of people to which they apply actually behave according to the model.

false,Jazzspasm,cnty-expat,"Expat - Yorskshire, then London, currently the Colonies","In all fairness, the reasoning was to encourage small businesses to employe people with less risk to doing so. 

Don't he me wrong, removing employee rights, or rather, having those rights harder to receive is not a good things, but it was a pretty extreme moment when the law was changed.

Regarding tribunals, small businesses are terrified of hiring people who turn out to be a nightmare they can't get rid of. All businesses are. It happens more often than you'd think - employee takes days off or massively underperforms or is profoundly obnoxious to colleagues, and the instant anything is done to address it, they launched a tribunal. Employers were reluctant to hire at a time when hiring people was the biggest issue because the risks had a bigger impact at a fragile time for businesses. That's what this was aimed at addressing. 

Again, I'm not saying reducing employee rights is a good thing, I'm just trying to let people know this law isn't because Tories hate employees, or they were conspiring with big business to ruin everyone's life. They were trying to make sure people got employed.

On a phone. Apologies for spelling

Edit - looking at how /u/ParrotofDoom got nuked for not knowing the figures, I best say I'm head of HR at my company, the figures for spurious tribunals were really high, yes this law reduced the number of legitimate claims also but the massive number of people who put in false claims heavily share the blame for all this. 

I'd much rather people were given jobs that needed them than guard the rights of people that put everyone else's employment in jeopardy. Protecting people from unfair employer decisions is also a big part of my job and I take it very seriously.

Also I won't get the figures as I'm on a phone, sat in the sun in California getting lightly baked and it would be too much like work.

What this article simply suggests is that we should encourage boys to play with pink if they want to ('Pink is up for grabs'). And that we should perhaps do away with the differences in values we teach boys and girls (Girls: meek and mild etc) so we can reach a place where it is more sociably acceptable for men to ask for help (the article quotes the suicide stats but there are other parameters in general with men going to doctors less, etc)

From what I've read, employers are probably more likely to prefer a British candidate because British people know how to persuade British People - something an EU candidate may not be able to do as successfully. There's also a degree of stigma at the moment in relation to the EU which may not help (especially if you're from Eastern Europe), but I doubt this, as the employer could be breaking the law.

You have to understand that British advertising is different to EU advertising; for example, ""Cola Light"" in Spain is called ""Diet Coke"" in the UK - and that's simply because ""Coke"" is British slang for Coca-Cola, and because people in the UK like the idea of ""Diet"" products, as this makes people feel not as bad for drinking what some would describe as an unhealthy drink.

It may also be, like you said, due to you being under-qualified. Obviously I don't know what you're qualifications are, but you may require something equivalent to an A Level in English (although I'm not in the field myself and so do not know).

false,Jazzspasm,cnty-expat,"Expat - Yorskshire, then London, currently the Colonies","Interesting point about recruitment, there. Recruitment standards being tightened reduces the risk of hiring a lemon but it also reduces the opportunity of hiring great talent.

Put it another way, recruitment is largely a matter of risk reduction and can often be so at the expense of hiring great people. Such an occasion, which I think we're all familiar with, is that requirements for candidates become a strict box ticking exercise. 

Here's a grossly exaggerated example: Candidate must have three years experience of using a specific type of machinery specifically in the printed folding widgets manufacturing sector plus job relevant certification *'on spec'*, and *'off spec'*, has big financial obligations (like a mortgage and children) - meaning the candidate has more to lose if it doesn't work out. Dodgy but not yet illegal (and not to my liking).

This then means that someone with great talent who can learn quickly and perhaps doesn't have the same personal background doesn't get the opportunity. That person may have been better for the company in the long run, but is an unknown quantity. Higher risk. Sad but true.

Another factor during the recruitment process is reference checking. Most companies now don't give references or only give very basic ones (time of employment and job title), rather than including reasons for leaving, performance record, whether they'd hire them again, etc. That's because of the risk of litigation from the ex-employee. That means it's harder to know if a candidate put in spurious tribunals, was drunk and hungover most days, massively underperformed or was simply just a complete nightmare. It's really hard to find out.

It's odd how it works out, but a large part of the job of an HR department is to protect the employees from bad company decisions and another large part is protecting the company from bad employee decisions.

But yeah, recruitment get blamed a lot for stuff. That's why I personally think hiring responsibility should be spread around - giving the reporting line managers and heads of department / Directors the final decision. Also, the more people involved in selection, the lower the risk (plus the chance for the candidate to meet more people, get a better feel for things and also select themselves out of the process).",0,1419190228,null,0,false,0,cn1hvot,t3_2pymqk,t1_cn1hvot,t1_cn1h5y2,null,1425284983,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,TOSH2345,null,null,"I regularly hire copywriters on a freelance basis and to be honest your issue, aside from what's already suggested, is that you're competing with many others, there are lots and lots of copywriters out there. The other problem you're facing is to save costs many agencies and companies don't employ copywriters or editors anymore, and just get marketing or other creatives to do the writing, and then contract out bigger pieces on a project basis. So you're competing in an ever decreasing pool of work.

I recently advertised a small project worth a couple of hundred pounds and got over 50 responses. When going through them I went for people I was certain were native speakers and people who have a very extensive portfolio in the subject area I was looking for, if they couldn't demonstrate that I didn't even consider them. I had some responses which were basically 'I'm a native english speaker with xx years of experience and I'm available from Monday so get in touch' - that's not enough for me to form an opinion on whether they could do it. So make sure you tailor your applications to the role, include a huge portfolio and if you have a blog that's a huge plus, so include it or start one! 

Also I'm sure you do this already but please check your spelling/grammar - I had a few responses with spelling mistakes or missing words, or really badly formed sentences which is unforgivable for a copywriter. 

If you're still not having any luck maybe try looking in related fields like technical writing, PR, communications or social media marketing. Being a marketing person who can write as well is a huge plus (because of the reasons above), you can do an online course quite cheaply to get skills in that area which combined with your experience may make you a more attractive applicant.",0,1419190913,null,0,1419238014,0,cn1i8kq,t3_2pzhgg,t1_cn1i8kq,t3_2pzhgg,null,1425284816,11,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,11

Coutinho scored the goal but I feel he needs slapping a little bit, he has that vision to see these fantastic passes but I never see him pull it off, week in and week out. It's just frustrating to watch, is there any stats for the amount of missed key passes x key passes made?

Sakho played well and came into the team well. Always liked him, even if he does look like a new born deer on the ball, still pulls of the passes and defends fairly well, so well done.

Some people start out taking drugs because it's fun or edgy and then things get out of hand and they end up addicted/dependent/committing crimes as a result but I believe there are also huge numbers of people who take drugs and drink alcohol to self-medicate, just in an attempt to live a 'normal' life. We need a much stronger and more supportive mental health care system that takes this into account. Once someone is an addict or an alcoholic their addiction is seen as 'the problem' and the end goal of help offered to them is to get them to stop practicing that behaviour, but if any original deep rooted problem remains undiagnosed they will just slip through the cracks again without the proper kind of help.

We only know that it is a better model than full criminalisation.

Let me remind you that heroin is being prescribed in the UK *today* for a variety of purposes, including treatment of some addicts. The problem remains not because it is not available, but because the criteria for access are far too stringent to outcompete the illegal market.

I'm biased as I'm a student at the University and obviously love it down here, but it's an amazing coastal town. Great countryside and coastal access in the South West and close to many larger places in Cornwall (Newquay, Truro).

A downside would be that the closest 'big' city is Plymouth, 2 hours away. However it has great rail links.

It's a very unique places with a booming arts scene (Falmouth University is rated the best creative university in the UK and the majority of courses are arts and illustration based). It also has some of the best food places I've been to (Gylly Beach Cafe, The Shed, The Meat Counter and a great food van call Bangers with a Twist).

I'm not sure on prices as I am a student and from what I have heard average pay in Cornwall generally is lower than the average living rate. But assuming you can easily find work, I'm sure housing wouldn't be too hard to find.

It's also a tourist hub in the summer and has some pretty amazing events on, such as the Tall Ships Reggata. Similarly a lot of musicians will play the Princess Pavillions before becoming big, if you're into music.

I recommend looking into it or places in Cornwall generally, I've loved my three years here and can't speak any more higher of it (even though I am moving to Bristol).

And to make this abundantly clear to people [here's an article from a year ago about how easy it is to design new legal highs](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/31/drugs-legal-high). 

What's worth noting is the *total lack of any kind of safety testing*. 

Unlike a laundry list of ""classical"" illegal drugs that we know a lot about the safety profile of, and which in most cases are substantially less dangerous than made out, most of the legal highs are still legal exactly because their history is short enough that we *have no clue*. Some of them will turn out to be ok, but many of them are likely to turn out to be quite nasty. 

So the legal regime in effect is turned on its head: The drugs we understand, including some that we know have very low risks of causing much damage, are illegal or severely restricted, while drugs we don't understand, and that might carry substantial risk, are  legal.

SJW is really quite a vague term, and most people doing it never really call themselves that. It's more a term given to them from the outside.

But really, there's this type of political correctness that comes out from time to time. Some group, usually linked to a company or government agency, sits around a table to discuss what offends or irks certain groups whilst not having any members from that group present. There, they decide that this group is offended by one thing and make their decision known.

When it's made known the papers run with it as ""POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD"" and have a big rage. The group in question hears this and collectively go ""Wait, what the fuck, we don't think that"". Eventually, all the anger and rage gets aimed at the groups in question who never actually asked for this get all the shit because somehow they caused it.

Now political correctness exists under a different name, we just call it ""politeness"". It's not Ok to call a black person a nigger, or a gay guy a faggot, that goes without saying.

false,therespoutineinmyear,null,null,"I said in another thread a couple days ago that 3 CBs with Lucas shielding is much more defensively stable than 4 at the back for us. We keep the 3 CBs on a string and they'll shift one out wider depending on which side is being attacked. We don't lose anything defensively since a) I can't remember the last time we actually had both fullbacks back in position to defend and they both did so effectively and b) we don't need our wingbacks to be there all the time like we've been expecting from those fullbacks, so it's a bonus when they can get back. Further, it allows us to have all of our most talented attackers on the pitch, in their best positions (or nearly).

That said, the only player who looks to be struggling in this system is Hendo, out hugging the touchline. I don't think Gerrard is necessarily performing poorly but beyond his set-pieces and leadership, he's been a passenger. When Sturridge is back, I'd love to see

------------------------Mignolet/Jones/Cardboard cutout of Cech------------------------

-----------------Kolo-------------------Skrtel-----------------------Sakho--------------

---Sterling------------------------------Lucas------------------------------Markovic----

----------------Coutinho----------------Hendo-------------Lallana----------------------

---------------------------------------Sturridge-----------------------------------------

Which is just Hendo where Stevie currently is, Sturridge where Raheem is, and Raheem out where Hendo is. I don't like pushing Raheem out wide like that, but he offers a lot more of the pace which is required to be effective in that position than do Coutinho and Lallana who are just so silky smoooooooth in tight spaces. Plus, as we've seen with Marko back there, there's not much actual defending involved, just tracking back. Additionally, it might take some of the pressure off of him and allow him to exploit the space created by the other attackers as he did to perfection last year.

The last point: we've seen the best from Marko, Coutinho, and Lallana in this system and we'd be crazy to throw that away to accommodate Stevie. I love him to death but our attack for the next 10 or so years depends on getting Marko, Coutinho, and Sterling firing together, plus Lallana, Sturridge, and Hendo powering it for the next 5 or 6, and they've shown that they're ready to take over. For the love of god, let's put them in their best positions and them work their magic because all of them are capable of it. If we were in with a shout for the title, I might be inclined to say fuck it, let Stevie have another go, but we're not. If this is a transition season, then let's actually fucking transition.

Food has to be within the use-by date when it is given to the end user and a lot of work is done with rotation to ensure that is always the case. If it cannot be distributed in time then it is passed to the night shelter for cooking, so it is used.

The food distributed is worked out to meet basic nutritional requirements and I have to admit I would struggle to eat some of it but there are also opportunities to work with what's available to make the mix as palatable as possible by using different brands and a few bonus items to stuff the boxes out so they stack properly.

It's amazing how many anti-nuke people don't understand the concept of deterrence. 

The retaliation argument is a complete non starter. Yes, America and Russia has way more than us. But the amount doesn't really mean anything.. You just need enough to ensure a crippling retaliatory strike. 

But, that's not the whole story. The fact of the matter is, they're never ever meant to be launched.  

If we are launched on, the nuclear weapons we own have already failed their job of deterrence. 

That's why in the [letter of last resort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_of_last_resort) three of the four options given to the PM to choose are not an order to fire the weapons. 

They're not an active defence like anti air, fighter jets or tanks. They're passive. All they're meant to do is sit there, not being used. It's the possibility of use which keeps everyone in check.

Proper lager kits are a bit more of a pain in the arse than ales, since lager needs to ferment quite a way below room temperature (and subsequently needs to be stored just above freezing for ages), though a lot of the 'lager' kits are actually just really light ales. Ales are easier as they are more tolerant of temperature variations, so you can more or less shove your bucket on the landing and forget about it for a couple of weeks.

Although... I really didn't like the season finale. Maybe it's because I'm what people refer to as a 'Newhovian', but I don't like The Master. I can understand people liking him because he was such a huge staple of the original show, but all his (or her, now?) appearances in the show's current incarnation are sub-par, at best.

He's come back from his 'final' grave twice now (three times, if you count the 90's film). For all my issues with ""The End of Time"", when the Master redeemed himself by saving the Doctor, banishing the mad Time Lords, and subsequently destroying himself, it felt like closure. We finally knew what made him so mad - and he concurred it! He made the right bloody decision for once in his life!

Now that she's back (changing pronouns, now) it feels like a total cop-out. For no explained reason, she's alive and, it seems, has a new regeneration cycle. She's still mad, despite the fact we've seen her end what was causing that madness. And of course she's now in charge of a planet of Cyber-Men. Because trying to control Cyber-Men [has always turned out well for those who try](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Doctor). AND she gave them Time Lord technology!

Shotguns, Handguns, Rifles. However there are limits on each.

Its pretty simple really. Shotguns are easy. Have permissions to shoot somewhere and buy one. The dealer gives you a receipt and then you send the paper work to the police. If a license is granted then you go pickup the gun.

For rifles / firearms. You need to be a member of a club for a year and have shot that type of gun at least 3 times in the last year. Then it works the same way as the shotgun. Except when you get the gun the police take it from you and take ballistic signatures on file then give it back to you.

Any application normally need to be with multiple references (eg 2). For pistols one must be from a the club secretary.

If you have a criminal record. You will need to declare it. Failure to declare is an offence. You must also give the police access to your medical record and permission for them you write to your doctor about mental health status etc...

Typically take around 4-12 weeks (or longer) and has to be repeated every 5 years.

We've made it here in spite of having only 1 striker and possibly the worst fullbacks in the league. If we can win the games we need to win I think we can battle for 7th.

**Christmas Wishlist:**

- A second source of goals. Whether it comes from a reinvigorated Gomis or a new signing.

- For Monk to unplug the phone. People are going to be calling for Bony, we CANNOT afford sell him.

- A defensive midfielder. With Ki gone especially we have no defensive presence in the midfield outside of Britton.

- Glasses for the Officials. Perhaps we should send these out.

- Some goddamn fucking capable fullbacks fuck. Sorry this is an issue we all saw coming, and god knows how many more points we'd have with quality fullbacks.

- Drawing Cardiff in the FA cup. This would just be fun to watch.

The slow motion of the replay makes one feel like he had a chance..  Look at it in real time and it happened very quickly.  On top of that it was deflected from Skertel s head as well. Skertel should have won the header. full stop!!! 



The second.  Maybe he could have kept his feet closed but world class keepers get beat that way as well.. again the marking was poor..  As Rodgers said there was one man in the box who really had a realistic opportunity to score.  Our defence should have not let him have a free shot. 



Yes Brad Jones is not the greatest and was not great at Manchester  United.  But today he was ok with his shot stopping. 

On the plus side he is better with the ball at his feet than Migs and if u watch the second half carefully,  he played out well from the back.  He was not worried in passing to Lucas and Gerrard instead of just going to the defenders and I can see how that helped Rodgers philosophy. 


Having said that..  I agree with you.  It's a kind of a fuck you from Rodgers to the committee..  But its not at the cost of Liverpool Jones is a better passer than Migs and has helped in the small way towards us dominating Arsenal.

However, if it's a choice between abandoning a system similar to Trident and moving to a different delivery method then I'd choose disarmament as a system similar to Trident is the only one worth having because of the second strike capability; the very aspect that makes it a deterrent. Anything else would be a waste of money. 

The only valid argument I recognise for complete disarmament is saving money but I think the benefits outweigh the costs. 

There is no evidence that a UK disarmament would make the world a safer place as people tend to claim. It wouldn't convince other nations, rouge states or groups that have nuclear weapons to also abandon them, nor would it dissuade other countries from seeking them. 

Likewise the UK is a fully functioning, stable democracy that has no extremist tendencies. It is a permanent member of the UNSC and a recognised nuclear weapons state. If anything I'd argue that removing nuclear weapons from a stable democracy would make the world a less safer place as the balance of power tips towards those nations that have, or seek to have, nuclear weapons that aren't quite as stable.

I almost forgot about the journalist but I believe that the information he had wasn't as tantamount to what was already revealed on screen. If we were to continue the story, Suri would expose the Garrett's pedophilia (through Borgue's story) that links to his political influence in the town. Only using the Olly case as a lead in. They're all connected but Vincent wouldn't really know intimate details as he wasn't directly involved. 

When Alain was telling his story in the hospital, I wanted to think that he was lying, that his brother made him confess. But its most likely true and I prefer it that way. How tragedies in life aren't always about some grand conspiracy, but merely people making bad decisions to escape repercussions of their mistakes. 

The dad had already aged quite a bit and it would make sense that he learned the language when he decided to expand his search to Russia. ~~He'd always be in denial because clinging on to the idea that his son is still alive, gives him a chance to redeem himself for losing him in the first place.~~ 

Edit: It appears I'm wrong. Here's an [article](http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/548091/Answer-to-The-Missing-BBC-TV-drama-Olly-Hughes) explaining why the Russian kid is Olly.

Then the information on the dangerous drugs are passed on to door staff and paramedics.

This, to me, is still not enough. With technology now, you could set up a few screens around the venue â or even the huge screens often seen in larger venues could display information about drugs found to be dangerous. Pill colours, shapes etc or other drugs could be warned of and concerned people could seek medical attention if they feel nervous. There could be a free drugs test, a text message with the results â and drug awareness links sent a long with the message and other things like that.

People will take drugs no matter what the deal is on the doors of the venue, the police or otherwise. Educate and take preventative measures on site so nobody else dies.

related deaths sufficient to achieve a
significant reduction in the coming years?

* Are the policing, prosecution and sentencing
strategies currently pursued, effective in
reducing drug related harm?

* Are we doing enough to protect young
people and to enable them to make
informed decisions around drug use and
involvement in drug markets?

* To what extent does the treatment system
meet the treatment and recovery needs of
the citizens of Brighton &amp; Hove?

If it's not obvious; I support the deployment of drug rooms. 

Using the phrase 'tax heroin' outside of a business context makes no sense. You aren't taxing the use of heroin. There is no way a person with a serious heroin problem is going to be applicable for any tax to treat a medical problem. (except you possibly don't live in the UK. I see why this point may have been lost on some people).

If there was some way to tax heroin say for recreational use.. then that's an entirely different discussion. In which case my argument would be: You surely can't prescribe someone heroin and possibly allow them to fall out of society and then profit off the back of it. It's difficult because I imagine the landscape would be entirely different.",0,1419216972,null,0,1419218653,0,cn1veql,t3_2pyy16,t1_cn1veql,t1_cn1uasy,null,1425278602,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

And might I point out that banning things because they severely damage your health, is itself underpinned by a moral judgement. Morals are not irrelevant here. Should individuals be banned from doing something that *might* be harmful to themselves? Or should they get to make that choice themselves? 

Though your claim that (all) recreational drugs are bad for you is generalising right away. And in what quantity? One normal dose of clean heroin won't usually cause long-term harm. It will likely have quite a therapeutic effect. Which could be beneficial for the individual, to help them relax and relieve stress. It would be a problem if it became an addictive habit. But if it does become a habit, it does not follow that they have to become criminals. Addicts would much rather get a clean fix from a chemists'. They turn to crime, because that is the only way that society allows them.

As a consultant they bear the ultimate responsibility for your operation, they are the ones carrying the can, there is a reason why they managed to get to such a status.

Rather than worrying unduly about staff who want to knock off early, what you might want to ask is what facilities and staff are available in the hospital is there in the very unlikely event of a complication: 

* Are there other specialties actually in the hospital during the operation that the surgeon can call upon if there is a problem or is he going to be ringing around to get another consultant to drive in.

* Do they have an High Dependency Unit or even an Intensive Care Unit or if there is an problem are they going to need to transfer you to an NHS hospital.
* If they do need to transfer you to an NHS hospital:
   * Do they have an private ambulance on standby or are they going to be dialing 999.
   * Does the receiving hospital currently have free HDU and ITU beds

If you're in that area I'd really recommend popping into Cambridge for a day and looking around the colleges. They're beautiful. Don't miss Kings College chapel. Norfolks lovely too, and in the east anglia/essex area there are some lovely old towns. In London there's something for everyone - what sort of thing are you into?

You might hear people saying ""don't make eye contact"" or ""don't talk to anyone"". Most people here are pretty friendly and would be pleased to chat to strangers when theyre not busy. Just don't try and engage people in conversation when they are busy/at work/on public transport.

Things to remember: most British people don't give much of a crap about the Royal family. People will get irritated if you call them or their hometown "" quaint"". 

Are you going to be driving? In London its not that fun but in the countryside it can be lovely (remember we drive on the left and almost all cars are manual). There are regular trains and buses to all towns though. Book trains in advance as they can get pricey.

Ring 999 for all emergencies. Police are unarmed and generally very friendly and helpful so feel free to approach them if you want to ask something. They're not tourist information booths though. Any town/city worth visiting will have a tourist information building you can go get your bearings in.

If you're into fine dining, England (particularly London) has some of the worlds best restaurants, but theres generally affordable and nice places everywhere. Most pubs do half decent food for a reasonable price. 

People usually tip (around 10%) but this is by no means compulsory. If you don't want to tip that's fine (serving staff are paid a living wage by law) and tipping is much more about whether you believe they actually did anything extra to earn it.

Drinks: some English wines are actually pretty good now. But you'll want to try the local ales and ciders.

- Norfolk and Suffolk coastline are largely very beatiful and often fairly deserted. North Norfolk coast (on top of the 'bulge' that is East Anglia) is covered with beautiful little towns and villages - Blakeney, Wells-next-the-Sea, Cromer etc. (As someone else has mentioned avoid Great Yarmouth which is grim). 
- Norwich is a lovely city if you go inland a bit - good mixture of awesome history, good pubs and a good shopping centre. Was England's second city in medieval times, big castle and cathedral both 1000 years old and lots of old winding streets.
- Norfolk Broads are a series of inland waterways and are also very beautiful, although best enjoyed from a boat so probably not something you'll be doing in winter
- Southwold is a very picturesque seaside town in Suffolk. Nice beach, good pubs and the Adnams brewery which does great beer (nice big Adnams shop/cafe in the centre of town, one of my favourite places)
- Most of Suffolk has beeautiful coast and countryside - often considered the most quintessentially English of all English counties
- Essex is more crowded and has a bit of a reputation for naffness - personally I'd avoid, but then I don't really know Essex well other than from dreadful TV programmes which is probably unfair. 
- Further North, Lincolnshire is fairly bleak and under-populated and probably doesn't have much to recommend a special visit, and much of East Yorkshire (aka Humberside) is quite industrial and un-lovely. 
- North of Hull things start to get very beautiful again - Whitby and Filey are both gorgeous little seaside towns (and reputed to serve the best Fish &amp; Chips in the country/world), Robin Hood's Bay is a beautiful little fishing village built around a steep rocky inlet (nothing to do with Robin Hood though). 
- As you get further North than that you get into Northumberland; not an area I know well and again quite industrial in places but Newcastle is a buzzing city with a great nightlife, and there is some lovely scenery along the coast between there and the Scottish border (the North Northumberland Heritage Coast).
- Inland a bit Durham is a very pretty little university town bursting with historic buildings.
- Obviously if you're getting up near Scotland then you might as well pay Edinburgh a visit.

Other EU states charge. Albeit not as much (Netherlands is almost â¬2000), but you don't target them either.

&gt;Because you decided to change the rules, so we had to react to that, change it back if you don't like what we have to do to protect our interests.

So rather than implement the same preferential system as every other EU state does to protect their interests, which would cause absolutely no difference to Scotland's educational financial position... Scotland has opted to use a method which specifically punishes other citizens of its own state for no other reason than ""it works for us"". As reasons go, that is extraordinarily weak.

Nice.

Like I said, and this is the crux of my point which remains unanswered. It was one thing to discriminate against the Home Nations, which is perhaps acceptable in itself. It is another to discriminate against them while simultaneously preferring EU citizens.

false,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; What is welfare? The dictionaries tend to say something about financial support given to those in need.
&gt; In this case, without this support the companies would be fine, some consumers, not fine. Those consumers in expensive to deliver to places, or those unable to pay more, would end up having their power turned off.

So it apparently the companies are in need of this financial support in order to provide an adequate supply. 

&gt; To me this is the simple way of seeing the difference between welfare and funding, the latter is an investment, the former, keeps the person alive, they might contribute to society, they might not, there is no expected return on the investment.

But it isn't really an investment, it's just funding that is given to avoid the consequences of what would happen if free market economics were applied without any support. It's the same with any other form of welfare, it's paid because the consequences of not paying it are far worse.

I am not saying corporate welfare is a bad thing necessarily, but neither is any other form of welfare.

The thing is, I don't think we would ever need a second strike capability.  We wouldn't use it unless we had been nuked.  But Russia (China, etc) would never nuke us:  We'd let them piss about in Europe as much as they liked before we would press the button and they would never nuke us because the only time they might need to would be if they planned to invade, but you don't nuke things you plan to invade.

IMHO, nukes' only use is for our leaders to engage in brinksmanship.  MAD is the reason neither us will ever press the button.  But our leaders can score points by extending that:  ""We will all die if any of us invades the other"" becomes ""We will all die if any of us invades the other or if you try to put missiles in Cuba"".  But all this is, is leaders endangering their populations to score political points.  That's what they do here in the UK:  We have this pretense that there is a special relationship and instead of doing what is best for us, our PMs all suck up to the US and pursue their foreign policy for them.  Nukes just add another level to that:  A level where the downside is to total annihilation of everyone I know and love rather than just a huge waste of money like Iraq 2 was.

I realise there is a lot to disagree with above and it may be a little tortured, but if I had to sum it up, I'd say this:  ""I want our leaders to concentrate on jobs, houses and the NHS, I don't want them playing at world leader and risking an actual nuclear war"".

Poor and inconsistent play is certainly a concern - and trust me, I'm concerned - however, what is even worse is if our players seem like they have their heads down, lost belief, have given up, have been overwhelmed by the expectation of what happened last season and visibly crumble to that pressure.

But battling back like this shows a lot of character and that bodes well for our future and a strong finish to the campaign (and a top 4 finish).

The key, of course, is Daniel Sturridge. And if he is healthy, well, watch out.

Tight-fisted ""students""? I can agree with several of your concerns. But to just needlessly attack students is a little far, no?

Scottish universities have the same academic selection criteria as any other. It is not like a Home Nation applicant can just walk into a University and be accepted on a course.

&gt;Neither way makes any difference to our educational financial position. The only difference is one hurts your poor little feelings.

I am glad you agree that my suggestion does not hurt Scotland. So what remains is now purely one of punishment towards Home Nations.

Please don't confuse my feelings with my reasoning however. I am not a student nor a potential one. This system was implemented after my study. I can however, analyse a situation and objectively evaluate it.

&gt;Again, you are not the same as other EU citizens, your comparisons are pointless.

No. They are apt. Other EU states have similar arrangements and provided the Scottish executive with a working example of how such protectionism could be developed fairly. Scotland, chose to ignore it. Although I disagree they did it because ""it works"". I think they did it to punish Westminster without any regard for remaining British students whatsoever. But that is just conjecture, of course.

&gt;Fuck off with this shite. The union goes both ways, stop making snidey little comments like you carry us.

Chip on your shoulder? I am not making snidey comments.

But the Union has contributed towards Scotland in the past. And Scotland has contributed more than it has taken in the past. Like you say, it goes both ways. However that said, Scottish Universities have benefited from UK students and support in the past. Yet the appreciation for that is to effectively go 'thanks guys, but yeah, we like European students more than you'.

Do you know what system would have been better still? Â£9k/y Vouchers for Scottish students from the Scottish Government to study at any British institution of their choice. As now ""tightfisted"" Scottish students are effectively confined to Scotland which is somewhat unfair on them.

&gt;England didn't need to charge for uni, but it did it anyway.

Is your ultimate reasoning for this policy, an 'eye for an eye'? Because the situations are not comparable. The other Home Nations to not treat Scottish students with any treatment different to their own.

'England' didn't do anything. The UK did. Would I be incorrect in assuming you agitation now is one of English resentment rather than objective reasoning? I get this purely from continual references to 'England'.

And it doesn't matter what the UK did.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by this. A seat taken up by anyone else is a seat a Scottish person can't have.

We'll have to disagree on this and leave it at that, you are not going to change my mind on it.

It's the second time you've referred to the union with the implication we owe you something. 

&gt; Yet the appreciation for that is to effectively go 'thanks guys, but yeah, we like European students more than you'.

Why are you assuming this is done out of spite?

As someone from the shithole that is the east end of Glasgow I sympathise with this thought specifically. 

&gt;Do you know what system would have been better still?

Again, better for your country, it makes no difference to us.

&gt;Is your ultimate reasoning for this policy, an 'eye for an eye'?

No, my reasoning is why the fuck should you be allowed to flood our educational system because your own country has decided to charge. It's protecting our own interests, believe it or not we don't enact policy purely to spite England. 

&gt;Would I be incorrect in assuming you agitation now is one of English resentment rather than objective reasoning? 

English people are the only ones who complain about this, I've never had a Welsh person whine that they can't have their education paid for by Scottish taxpayers. That's why I specifically refer to England and not the UK, England is the only one with a problem.

To quote another post:
&gt;However, a few years ago, my father went into hospital the day before a bank holiday - it was terrible, by the end of the day, there was hardly a soul on the ward, and on the bank holiday itself, due to lack of care, several problems occurred because he wasn't checked on frequently enough, then when the problems were discovered, there was nobody to help!


Once again, I apologise unreservedly, and wish any hospital workers a wonderful Christmas!

No that isn't the case, at all.  They have won the guarantee of supply, this is no more welfare than having say someone in the army but not deployed is welfare.

Again, to me, welfare is payment we give someone, that we get nothing in return.  Harsh as it is, if we stopped all say disability, job seekers, housing, pension benefits.  I'd be better off, also house prices would drop a bit too!  Welfare payments help the recipient, they are not an investment because we don't expect to see anything in return.

The companies have won contracts, which will be paid by us, as we use them.

&gt;But it isn't really an investment, it's just funding that is given to avoid the consequences of what would happen if free market economics were applied without any support. It's the same with any other form of welfare, it's paid because the consequences of not paying it are far worse.

No it's a guarantee at most, the companies would have been fine, they just might not have bothered with it.  Free Market people are often a little bit risk adverse, so they won't bother building a big power plant unless they are sure at least a certain capacity of it will be used.  This also depends on the rules regarding generation (ie Carbon reduction).

This is no more a 'welfare' payment than saying buying an oil future.  It's an auctioned process, where the lowest bidders won.

&gt;I am not saying corporate welfare is a bad thing necessarily, but neither is any other form of welfare.

This is the issue, I think you've got a terrible agenda if you conflate this to welfare, I get it, you think things with money are evil or whatever, but you can't begin to consider an auction welfare, without a massive leap in doublethink.

The word welfare aside, think of it like this, one action results in a service being delivered to a bunch of people, the other, creates at most a consumer, but all that consumption money has come from something (via taxation) meaning it's not a net increase.

&gt;Buy to let also has upwards pressure on rents when house prices rise as the landlords need a return on their investments.

Hmmm.  Landlords would love a high return on their investments -- but they cannot get it unless renters will pay them.  If you are a landlord, the amount you spend buying a flat to let does not affect the amount of rent you can charge. 

The reason rents are so high is that in the UK, everyone needs a box (or part of a box) to live in, especially in winter.  People will pay whatever they have to.  The number of available boxes is hard to change in the short term.  

The effect is that rents rise beyond all reason. 

&gt;when house prices increase, it forces more people into renting than buying as people can't afford a mortgage.

Every box is owned by someone; nearly all the boxes are full of people.  Some of the boxes are owned by the people living inside; other boxes are owned by remote landlords. The fraction of owner-occupiers doesn't much affect rents: same number of boxes, same number of people. 

There's already a crazy building boom. We *can't feasibly solve* the rental problem without limiting immigration -- how much subsidised affordable housing can we build?  If we start a building programme, won't yet more people come, as the problems of the Southern Eurozone seem to be getting worse, not better?

I think it is bizarre and unfortunate that the liberal left - especially people in their 20s - have adopted as a badge of identity the opinion that ""freedom of movement is a basic tenet of the EU, and any opposition to unlimited European immigration is by knuckle-dragging xenophobes"". 

Ironically, high rents are *great* 'for the economy' -- rent is part of GDP! :)
 
But young British renters in London might well wonder whether the small net positive tax balance from EU immigration improves their quality of life. How much to the massively higher rents reduce it? How can this situation change? ....and do they want to go and live in the grand new town near Bicester, or somewhere like it? 

Finally, I completely agree with you that inequality is going to be the defining political and social problem in the decades to come.  If the different wealth strata tend to be of different origins and ethnicities, doesn't the problem become nearly impossible to solve?

Perhaps this revised system will create some positive results for us over the festive season.

And keep in mind that we have only just got Sakho back and let's not forget the contributions of Jon Flanagan (surely his more traditional approach could settle down a back four) and hopefully Sturridge will be the key to unlocking the potential that we have been showing recently.

And some praise for Lallana is due, I think. Yes, the price tag seems big. The unfortunate injury didn't do him any favors. But he looked quite smooth in the Arsenal match.

But this is ok for EU students?

And ""stealing""? Again. Selection Criteria. Although I would have hoped that the people of Scotland valued students from elsewhere in the country as much as their own.

&gt;I'm not sure I understand what you mean by this. A seat taken up by anyone else is a seat a Scottish person can't have.

If this was really the only reasoning, all Scotland would have to do is look at Home Nation students studying in Scotland prior to tuition fees as a percentage of students total, and then ensure that percentage is never breached. As education policy is devolved, I imagine this is perfectly legal.

But again. This is ok for EU students?

&gt;It's the second time you've referred to the union with the implication we owe you something.

I'd disagree that was ""snidey"". However Scotland do owe the UK something. And it owes Scotland. A union ""works both ways"".

Please stop conflating me as an individual with England however. I am not representative of England or its non-existent position. It was the UK which placed fees on England, not England itself.

&gt;Why are you assuming this is done out of spite? Maybe they want to still be able to offer free education to Europeans who would otherwise be completely unable to attain higher education, countries with shit infrastructure and high levels of deprivation. As someone from the shithole that is the east end of Glasgow I sympathise with this thought specifically.

Answering an assumption with an assumption makes this difficult. But given that Scotland has not shown any interest in examples provided by other states so far, I doubt that was the case. More than likely they just couldn't avoid the law. The question is, why punish Home Nation students specifically?

&gt;Again, better for your country, it makes no difference to us.

Actually, it makes more difference to Scottish students than any other Home Nation. Providing vouchers to Scottish students is better than giving them free education in only Scotland itself. As this gives them access to a far larger educational market with far larger opportunities at a larger range of institutions. This is for example, how Wales does it.

&gt;No, my reasoning is why the fuck should you be allowed to flood our educational system because your own country has decided to charge.

""Why the fuck"" should the EU be **allowed** to flood the Scottish educational system? Possible if unlikely, but you are the one using 'allowed'.

&gt;English people are the only ones who complain about this

Would you like to wager with me? ;)

&gt;I've never had a Welsh person whine that they can't have their education paid for by Scottish taxpayers. That's why I specifically refer to England and not the UK, England is the only one with a problem.

So yes. Resentment then. England doesn't have a problem as England isn't an entity with an ability to take a position. English people giving you an opinion should be taken objectively. There are more of them, so it is more likely you are to hear their voices.

&gt;paid for by Scottish taxpayers

Actually. Until such a time Scotland raises and spends its own tax revenue without any sort of balance-transfer from another UK Home Nation, it is not possible to say ""by Scottish taxpayers"" with any degree of accuracy. The education budget is derived from the Scottish devolved budget, which itself is derived from the tax receipts of the entire UK. Although I will concede in times of Scottish surplus it may be possible to think of it in this way.

&gt;A matter of opinion.

That is all either of us have unless a relevant authority has made a statement on the matter.

false,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"Well for a start Orwell hated collectivism (something clear to anyone who's read any of his most popular books) and was fully aware that he was going out to fight fascism, both facts which Brand doesn't seem to understand. Additionally, if you're advocating for revolution, picking one where atrocities on both sides were beyond horrific is probably not the best option. I'm not criticising him for sloppy referencing. I'm criticising him for *fundamentally* misunderstanding the politics of the people he's claiming would love his ideas, and attributing ideas to them that anyone with even a passing knowledge of them would find ludicrous.

The reason it matters is that any argument for revolution has to be built on the authority that its leader knows what the fuck he's talking about. Brand clearly doesn't. It's not nit-picking - he is wrong on the most basic level about much of what he says in the book, demonstrably so. Why should I believe anything he says when he's (or Hari's) done only the most cursory research into everything he's saying? I can get that kind of bone-headed, ignorant analysis down the pub or in the back of a cab. I don't trust his analysis of 'the way things are', and I can't take his ideas of 'alternative ways of doing things' seriously because he hasn't demonstrated any kind of *understanding* of the way things are or how feasible any alternatives are. Would you go into space on the back of research done by a guy who, like, totally digs space but has no idea how spaceflight actually works? Would you willingly go under the knife of a guy whose only experience of surgery was playing *Operation* as a kid? Course you wouldn't. So why would anyone take seriously a guy who has failed to show - in his book, on TV, in any arena - a knowledge and understanding of how the political system works? How are you going to reform anything when you're a guy who, when presented with graphs and statistics, proudly foghorns their deliberate ignorance? He's a fucking joke, and I honestly don't see why people think he's got anything relevant to say.

For a better take on what we should be doing to improve political engagement and reinvigorate the Left why not read something by people who actually know what they're talking about it?

I've had ADSL in the UK and in Australia for about 15 years now and I've dealt with almost every problem situation you can have.  The thing about ADSL is that TalkTalk (or any ADSL provider) don't have much control over the quality of the service. If you've got dodgy copper that isn't under their control, they have to get other people to service it. That takes time, effort and money. 

I've been lucky at my current place that everything has just worked and I get 10M/1M with zero dropouts.

My previous place (6M/750K) had an intermittent dodgy connection somewhere and I had dropouts every 2 months for about 1 week each time. I'd report the problem but, by the time they sent a tech out, the line would have already fixed itself. 

The techs all know about this sort of problem but they can't do anything unless they test the line and it comes up bad. I finally managed to convince the first tech to call another tech to open up a pit and ""test"" the line. Testing the line involves rewiring the connection and that ended up fixing all my problems.

Throughout that ordeal, TalkTalk were very helpful. They send me a replacement modem, they got the tech to replace my wall plate, they replied to all my requests via Twitter and then email, they helped me on the phone, they got the techs to come out on several occasions. I never paid one penny for any of these tech visits.

Like you I wanted to be close to a large body of water, somewhere cheapish and easy access to the countryside.

First thoughts were for Cornwall but it's too far from London, where I'm from, and potential work.

Next in my head was Brighton. Not knowing what prices were like, I was shocked to see they mirrored London.

Next was Hastings. This had always had a bad rep of chavs and wot not, but it was cheap and not too far from The Smoke. So I rented a room in a house for a few months to see if I liked it or not. 

I was working in The City and I didn't like the commute but I did like Hastings. I quit my job, bought a flat here and have spent the last year doing it up.

I've taken up off road running in all of this lovely countryside, I've joined cycling clubs to explore the countryside and I get to to see the English Channel whenever I want. Artists and musicians are moving here from Brighton and London, so there's a good scene here.

There's loads of history here, the South Downs, Rye, Battle, Winchelsea ............ It's a long list of nice things. The people are really nice here, too. Loads of clubs to join, people are politically involved and it's a nice size.

Rail links to London are being improved, the pier is due to be reopened next year, there's massive investment in the road infrastructure and Hastings will join up more eaisly with Ashford and the Euro train.

I'm not sure if the work situation is brilliant down here (not sure what you do) but there is some IT down here and there's a new by-pass being built which will attract businesses along its route. Apparently.

false,theevildjinn,null,null,"Walking back to my mate's flat, after a Saturday night out in Liverpool in 1998. There was a bit of commotion in the chippy on Leece Street, and then some police vans came screaming round the corner. Several officers jumped out and one of them shoved me up against some railings (despite my complete non-involvement), saying not to push him as he'd had a bad night. He even kicked my portion of chips and curry sauce out my hands, which I still haven't forgiven.

The police sent us on our way, and a few minutes later we were nearing my mate's front door on Rodney Street. Heard a shout from behind us, and it was the four guys who'd been causing trouble in the chippy. They'd taken offence at the fact that (a) my mate was French and (b) we were ""moshers"".

They proceeded to kick the living shit out of us individually - I stood with my hands raised above my head pleading with them while they beat my mate unconscious with metal bars, planks of wood and even a fluorescent tube that they'd taken from a nearby skip, which they smashed over his head and back. After he'd been knocked out they kicked him in the head. No idea what happened to me, as they were the only witnesses. I just remember coming to in the street, picking myself up and calling an ambulance from a phone box. Mate was still out for the count.

Despite the fact that even at that time Rodney Street was covered in CCTV cameras, the police were unable to find any footage. If I were a cynic, I'd be inclined to suggest that they did in fact find the footage but it also showed their colleague's poor handling of the situation in the chippy, which had led to us getting the shit kicked out of us (if he'd not stopped us, we would've been home in 2 minutes).

&gt;Seasons Of War is a fiction Anthology and short film.  The  Anthology, written entirely for charity, is the culmative effort of a whole host of talented writers from all over the world (authors from England, Scotland, Wales, the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel, France, Netherlands and Northern Ireland) all coming together to tell tales from the very, very long life of that most fascinating and unknown of Doctors: The War Doctor.
&gt;
&gt;The Unofficial Doctor Who Charity Anthology 'Seasons Of War' is compiled and edited by Declan May with associate editor Warren Frey, creative editor Simon A.Brett and design editor Nicholas Hollands and will be available in January 2015.
&gt;
&gt;The short film is written and directed by Andy Robinson with original music composed and arranged by Timo Peach and will also be released in January 2015.
&gt;
&gt;All of the people who have contributed to this book have done so for free, with the sole intention of raising money for the charity: www.caudwellchildren.com
&gt;
&gt;On a personal note, the book is dedicated to the memory of PAUL SPRAGG who passed away in 2014 and, with whom, the initial idea of the Anthology was discussed. It was Paul who was so very helpful in providing for me contacts, names, numbers and email addresses of those who might like to help out.

false,rubygeek,null,null,"I don't have anything comprehensive handy as I can't find the particular article I'm thinking of, but for some indications on the ability of heroin users to stop, [here's a paper on heroin use in returning Vietnam war veterans who had used heroin in Vietnam](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873239):

&gt;""Only a minority of those who used heroin in Vietnam had ever injected it there. Most smoked or snorted it. After their return, most of the men who had used heroin in Vietnam used it very occasionally or not at all. ""

This in context to [the Robins study of Vietnam veterans that found that 40% had used at 20% were considered addicts](http://jamesclear.com/heroin-habits). But as both the Robins study, and the one linked above found, on returning most Vietnam veterans *just stopped using*, and most didn't relapse, something which is rather inconsistent with the typical image of heroin as a drug most users struggle to stop using. 

This is part of the reason why it is considered an acceptable risk for prescription usage even today (under the medical name ""diamorphine"").
""Technically"" these legal uses are likely to add up to the majority of users of  heroin, but I was thinking of actual recreational use, and I have to concede I can't dig up a reputable source with actual estimates of relatively levels of use at the moment.

Note that none of this, including the studies above, mean that heroin is not drug with a *lot* of abuse potential. For people who are predisposed to get addicted, it is one of the worse alternatives to get addicted to, because withdrawal can be really nasty because of the combination of the physical withdrawal and mental dependence (you end up in lots of pain, with your brain constantly telling you it knows of this *really* easy way out of the pain).

&gt; I have known of people that took heroin 'casually' but not many... The full blown junkies seem to outnumber them by a long shot, though that could just be because full blown junkies are a lot more noticeable.

You hit the nail on the head with the last one. One of the reasons for the successes of injection programmes like the one in Switzerland is that once people have a guaranteed and safe supply, even most serious heroin addicts are able to hold down normal jobs and live relatively normal lives. But it is still stigmatised to an extent that only a few other drugs are. People who will happily talk about their cannabis use in public often still see heroin users as losers. 

The reality is that heroin addiction is similar to being addicted to prescription drugs like Oxycodone or Hydrocodone or any number of other opioids that leaves users mostly functioning relatively normally. Heroin gets the worst rep because injectable heroin is the ""end station"" for many of the worst functioning addicts of other opioids who can no longer afford the pills, and instead end up seriously harming themselves with street grade heroin (in the UK, purity for street heroin can be as low as 30%, with the rest being made up of anything from semi-random cocktails of other drugs to brick dust - as with other drugs, the biggest danger is not the drug itself, but what it's been cut with)

Yes, EU students do not have such easy access, if it was a problem they would be doing something about it. 

&gt;If this was really the only reasoning

It isn't the only reasoning, I've provided you with multiple reasons.

&gt;However Scotland do owe the UK something. And it owes Scotland. A union ""works both ways"".

So when England starts offering free education for Scottish students, England will receive the same treatment from Scotland. Right now Scottish students would be charged to go to English universities, so English people are charged. That's how both ways works. Not we have to pay and you get it free. 

&gt;The question is, why punish Home Nation students specifically?

Because Home Nation students specifically pose a bigger problem.

&gt;Actually, it makes more difference to Scottish students than any other Home Nation. Providing vouchers to Scottish students is better than giving them free education in only Scotland itself. As this gives them access to a far larger educational market with far larger opportunities at a larger range of institutions.

You're really in no position to be telling us what system of free education would be better, you don't even have free education.  

&gt;""Why the fuck"" should the EU be allowed to flood the Scottish educational system?

They're not, the system would be changed if foreign students started outnumbering nationals. 

&gt;Would you like to wager with me?

Okay, English people are the only ones who complain about this *to me*. Better?

&gt;So yes. Resentment then. England doesn't have a problem as England isn't an entity with an ability to take a position.

You're the one who seems resentful, resentful of Scotland's glorious free education. Stop being a pedant, I'm using you/England/English people interchangeably because this is a casual internet conversation and I don't want to put effort into using the correct nouns and pronouns. You know exactly what I mean, you're making a problem where there needn't be one. 

&gt;Although I will concede in times of Scottish surplus it may be possible to think of it in this way.

And I'll assume we have paid our own way since England enacted these educational policies. 

&gt;That is all either of us have unless a relevant authority has made a statement on the matter.

The part I was referring to was stated as objective fact. 

&gt;That however does not change how easy it would be to treat the rest of the UK as an equal without hurting the financial standing of the education budget.

How do you know it would be easy? It would cost time and money, the system works fine and we're in the middle of a shitty time for the economy, so unnecessary expenditures must be kept to an absolute minimum.

Robin Cook?  Whooooooo?  Russell Brand became famous and is now using that fame to speak out against the system.  Who else is doing that?  Should Brand be berated for using his fame to do this?  Do people resonate more with Brand or Cook?  What is more important in inspiring revolutionary ideas - absolute factual accuracy, or a platform, and resonance with the people and the spirit of equality and fairness?  Do academics fulfil the role of scientific accuracy already, which Brand openly acknowledges? Would you rather no one was speaking out about these things?  Is Brand having a negative effect? What about the successes already in helping people in the New Era estate to stay in their houses?  What has Cook done that has resulted in positive change like this? I'm all for academic arguments, but I'll use them in my essays.  You have to understand that the vast majority of the general public are not willing or in some cases able to read academic writings on left ideas.  We need a public spokesperson.  And fuck me if Brand isn't a great public spokesperson.

Those who claim they want change and damn someone for using a platform to talk about it have to seriously question their motives.

There is now an robust argument against the strategic worth of nuclear arms, and deterrence theory has been pretty convincingly ripped apart in the last ten years or so. Some of its most ardent supporters, including Kissinger, have now said that in their view it just doesn't work.

Trident is an extremely expensive thing to keep funding, and the UK's nuclear programme is more expensive still. It seems silly to keep funding something for strategic benefits that we now are pretty sure don't exist, and potentially make things less safe.

That said, our NATO membership is predicated on our armament. I think we are better off remaining a member of NATO right now, so we'd need to find some way of making up our contributions (in the way other non-nuclear members do). Using some of the trident money to invest in improved conventional and operations warfare units seems like a good idea but it would need to be carefully negotiated. Our special forces are already valued highly by our allies so they seem a good place to start.

I really think it should be entirely down to the end user. If anything, ISPs should be doing more to *inform* home owners at installation, not do it for them.

Or, since they're pushing for it, the government should step in - send out advice in a similar way to those old ""Preparing for an emergency"" leaflets. A simple ""what you need to know"" for Internet access. I imagine this including things like:

 * web filters
 * general safety - don't give out addresses, etc
 * malware
 * open access points
 * how to report suspected crime
 * illegal applications
 * tv licence requirements

We're at a stage now where most people can competently navigate a website. ISPs all have tech support on hand if not.

If people want/need porn filters they should be sorting it out themselves. Rather than forcing the responsibility onto ISPs, it needs to go to the customers.

Of course, I didn't think we'd struggle as much as we have. But, of course, I think a lot of that has to do with the time it has taken for Sturridge to recover from his injury.

I realise I'm putting a lot on the shoulders of Daniel Sturridge but if he's fully fit, I think he will deliver. And I don't think he's the sort of player that will shy away from the challenge.

Furthermore, the mere presence of Sturridge will open more space for the likes of Sterling, Lallana, Markovic and will ease the pressure off of the defense as well.

We are only 9 points off of 4th place (currently held by West Ham).

I'd argue that squads like West Ham, Swansea, Newcastle are *overperforming* whilst we are significantly *underperforming*. I feel that as the season goes on, we'll start to see things even out a bit more.

For [legal] example?

&gt;It isn't the only reasoning, I've provided you with multiple reasons.

Well. You've provided me with conjecture. As have I.

&gt;So when England starts offering free education for Scottish students, England will receive the same treatment from Scotland.

I really want to see your reaction to the UK enacting such a measure. Because then you will have the ""flood"" you fear so much at barely any cost to England. But this is a direct contradiction to your earlier suggestion that Scotland would address flooding. So which is it? Offer English students free education if England offers Scottish students likewise, or charge them to address flooding?

&gt;Right now Scottish students would be charged to go to English universities, so English people are charged. That's how both ways works. Not we have to pay and you get it free.

...lol. So you admit that Scotland is punishing England specifically even though it had no need to do so - as alternative fair solutions exist?

&gt;Because Home Nation students specifically pose a bigger problem.

So the response is to punish them in addition to addressing the problem, despite that fairer solutions exist which could benefit Scottish students?

&gt;you know exactly what I mean, you're making a problem where there needn't be one.

Indeed. But it is starting to feel like a personal attack on the English from yourself. Which honestly doesn't bother me at all. But I thought you'd prefer not to come across as prejudiced.

&gt;The part I was referring to was stated as objective fact.

Well. You can state it however you like. But that doesn't necessarily make it factual nor objective.

&gt;And I'll assume we have paid our own way since England enacted these educational policies.

Paid your way? In what sense? Again, England enacted nothing.

&gt;How do you know it would be easy? It would cost time and money, the system works fine and we're in the middle of a shitty time for the economy

For sake of argument, lets say this should have been done when Scotland reacted to the UK measure to charge tuition. Thus incurring no additional costs or time. Wales, I remind you, didn't appear to struggle.

Nukes are not constantly primed, I assume - I think the commander has to give an order for a team-member to insert the detonator, before he can press the button.

I got the impression that you could drop a nuke, or have it fall off a flatbed lorry, and that would not cause it to go off.

Likewise if a submarine carrying nukes sinks, then it'll take years to rust, in which time you can send down divers to salvage it.

- I rate Charlie Colkett quite highly. His intelligence in his movement and ability to pick a pass is quite impressive for a player of his age. I think he could possibly catapult himself into the ""probable"" tier if he continues to play well.

I think that's the whole point... we don't have Suarez *and* we don't have Sturridge. Therefore, opposing squads can push forward and be a bit more aggressive without being scared of being exposed by Suarez and/or Sturridge.

That puts extra pressure on our defence and then, well, you have what we see now.

Ultimately, I think we went into this current season thinking...

* OK, our defence isn't fantastic on its own ...
* But we added Lovern and some exciting new fullbacks ...
* And Sturridge should be able to keep opposing squads honest ...
* Therefore, the likes of Sturridge, Lallana, Markovic, Coutinho, Sterling, etc. should be able to keep the opposition honest ...
* And give the defence some luxury to get it together as the season progresses.

But I think the worst-case scenario happened: The fullbacks and Lovren *didn't* make an instant impact on the defence; Steady defenders like Flanagan have been out for a long time; Lallana started the season injured; Coutinho and Sterling still show their youth are not yet able to take over a game the way Suarez could; Sturridge got injured; Sturridge's injury lasted a long time; etc. etc.

false,tusksrus,,Blairite Marxist | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,"It'd be great if we could *all* give up our nuclear weapons and have some way of ensuring that criminal organizations and rogue governments never get their hands on them. If I believed such a thing were possible, I'd be right there with everyone else campaigning for disarmament. 

Right now, though, unilateral disarmament is an unjustifiable risk for one of the few countries who is allowed to legally own nuclear weapons. We just don't know what the future holds - especially with another nuclear state causing trouble in eastern Ukraine, a rogue government in the far east which may or may not have rudimentary nuclear weapons, and various other governments having developed or in the process of developing their own nuclear programme, to give our own up would be foolish. Disaster partly for this reason.

I used to think well, we're in NATO. Surely if we get nuked, America's got our back? I wouldn't be so sure myself. If we get ourselves into some mess with a nuclear power and we disarmed ourselves, America *might* provide non-nuclear assistance, but ultimately they have their own interests at heart (as they should). I think the cost is justifiable.

Lord Palmerston once said, ""We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies."" The wider quote that that's part of is probably outdated in the 21st century, but that part should hold forever.

We've pissed off a lot of people as our country. I think on balance it's a good thing - though not always. You might guess from my flair that I'm an interventionist, and I believe intervening is part of the role Britain has fallen into in modern global politics. With a nuclear deterrent, our hand is much stronger than without. Disaster partly for this reason.

You could argue it grants us disproportionate power, seats on various global panels which we mostly hold for historic reasons. The P5 is the most obvious example. BRICS countries are probably more entitled today, but three of those don't have nuclear weapons (and the other two are P5 countries). It's probably unfair - but I'm more interested in Britain than fairness. Not sure how much it really has to do with nuclear weapons, but they're often cited as part of the reason by people who probably know more than me.

What?

&gt;I really want to see your reaction to the UK enacting such a measure. Because then you will have the ""flood"" you fear so much at barely any cost to England.

Why would there be a flood? There would be no need to come here if you could be educated in your own country.

&gt;So you admit that Scotland is punishing England specifically even though it had no need to do so - as alternative fair solutions exist?

I don't believe I denied that, although you're phrasing it in a really strange way. How is it punishment? It's called protecting your own interests. The Home Nations are the only ones posing a threat to those interests.

&gt; despite that fairer solutions exist which could benefit Scottish students?

A benefit to individual Scottish students is not a benefit to Scotland as a whole. We'd be far better off focusing on developing proper and respected institutions here instead of handing money out to be given to other countries. 

&gt;Indeed. But it is starting to feel like a personal attack on the English from yourself. 

It feels the same way on this side. It seems like you want to hurt Scotland because of the shitty situation in your own country. You're very focused on what Scotland could do to benefit English students instead of just thinking about making education free in England. As I already said, I'm only referring to England because England is the only country whining about it. *To me*.

&gt;Paid your way? In what sense? 

As in generated enough money to fund our own public spending.

&gt;For sake of argument, lets say this should have been done when Scotland reacted to the UK measure to charge tuition. Thus incurring no additional costs or time. Wales, I remind you, didn't appear to struggle.

Does it cost Wales money to issue these grants to Welsh people? As in are there administrative costs involved in actually sorting out who is owed what? If so, that's more unnecessary financial burden, which would end this argument in its tracks. Feelings have no monetary value. 

&gt;I'm going to just let you off there

Please don't.

Free speech comes with responsibility. Calling upon people to terrorize others is not something people should be doing in a civilized society. Fuck people who say the Holcaust never happend. They can just go to jail for all I care. Germany seems to have gotten it right in that regard - they've made holocaust denial illegal.

If you think there's anywhere on this planet that has true freedom of speech, then you're misguided. America absolutely DOES NOT have freedom of speech. If they did, you'd be able to tell a policeman to fuck off with no fear of reprisal.

'Free speech' is a fallacy that too many people cling to without really thinking about all forms of speech and its implications if applied to ALL forms of speech.

Just consider this. What if Justin Beiber told all the girls in his concert to kill their teachers. Should he be prosecuted when hundreds of teachers are murdered? Yes. Yes he fucking should. But in your cosy world, that would be okay.

Does his dark skin in some way prevent him from playing Bond? Does Bond have some exclusive white power (oooh) we were not aware off? Can black guys not be spies?

Logically it boils down to two possibilities: either all leaders and personnel of nuclear states are reliable and can be trusted to make logical and rational decisions at all times and thus the potential disinclination of retaliation makes them unlikely to launch nukes in very specific circumstances, or leader and personnel are fallible and often irrational and regardless of any other benefits you are introducing weapons of mass destruction to people who might make terrible mistakes leading to theft, accidents or worse *actual use*.

The risk of the former (and I'm fascinated to hear your perspective of when exactly this deterrence kicks in) seems outweighed wildly by the latter, when we know full well that nukes have previously gone missing, been poorly maintained, and illegally traded in high numbers, and that leaders have ordered their use only to be stymied by those implementing the action or bad (good) luck.",0,1419251150,null,0,false,0,cn25he6,t3_2q02b4,t1_cn25he6,t1_cn24x24,null,1425273762,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Which Scotland can do so without treating Home Nation students worse than EU ones. Yet that is how it chose to do it. You state that Scotland charges because England charges. But the non-devolved UK doesn't treat Scottish students differently to EU students. Scotland does. It is a double standard.

&gt;It feels the same way on this side. It seems like you want to hurt Scotland because of the shitty situation in your own country.

My *country* is the UK. I bare no particular allegiance to England over any other Home Nation. I don't believe the situation in England for education is particularly bad despite the cost. But I do appreciate the double standard and think it is worth discussing.

&gt;You're very focused on what Scotland could do to benefit English students instead of just thinking about making education free in England. As I already said, I'm only referring to England because England is the only country whining about it. To me.

I am not focused at all on what benefit Scotland could have for *England* in isolation. However I am somewhat focused on what Scotland could do for the other Home Nations, inclusive of England, without any cost to Scotland itself. Believe me, I would not propose an idea which would hurt Scotland to the benefit of others. I want Scotland to do the best it can, for it is a part of my country.

And with the voucher idea, I am specifically, concerned with the advantage to Scottish students of having level-access to the rest of the UK education system, as the English, Welsh and N.Irish currently do to Scotlands.

I don't believe, like you stipulate, that 'time and cost' is a valid reason for deterring Scottish students from UK universities, especially when neither of these reasons are wholly applicable had they been done at the same time as the current reaction.

&gt;instead of just thinking about making education free in England

Trust me, I believe that should be the case. While I do think a British education is more valuable for the British and probably most the world than a Continental European one in most cases, I don't think that should be a cost borne by students directly.

&gt;Does it cost Wales money to issue these grants to Welsh people? As in are there administrative costs in the logistics of actually sorting out who is owed what? If so, that's more unnecessary financial burden, which would end this argument in its tracks

Yes, of course it costs Wales (and NI). Both the cost of the partial loan/grant and admin/logistics. But the amount is tiny and manageable (and even chargeable on the student themselves). A small price to pay to give Scottish students level-access to the rest of the UK system.

&gt;Please don't. (RE: frivolous spending during a recession)

Reid is damned good, there's no denying that -- but he's not irreplaceable.  You know who **would** be?

Song.  Song, and Jenkinson.  Reid is below them in priority, for me.

Those two fit into our current squad perfectly.  Reid is fantastic at what he does, but a CB is a CB as far as I'm concerned.  There isn't anywhere near as much nuance in that role as there is for a CDM, or an RB.  Case in point, compare Song with Kouyate, or Jenks with Demel.  They provide different focuses to their skill sets, and one is not a like-for-like swap for the other.

Now look at CBs.  Ask anybody that supports any club what their ideal CB is going to be -- a tall, strong, physical defender who can help out on set pieces.  That's not just us that likes that in a CB.  It's not just Chelsea, or Stoke, or Arsenal, or the fuckin' mancs.  It's everybody.

Everybody wants the same things in a CB.  Naturally, this means they *are* pretty difficult to find these days -- but more difficult than people like Song or Jenkinson that fit into our squad so well?  Not a chance -- especially when, assuming worst case scenario and Reid leaves, we're looking for a third to cover for Tomkins and Collins in the event that one of them picks up a knock.

I like Reid.  I want him to re-sign with us.  But at this point, the onus is on him.  The club has made preparations to provide back up -- or replace him if necessary.  That's what they **should** be doing.

The same ones you are advocating being put into place right now. 

&gt;You never predicated that on England giving free tuition to its own students as well.

I honestly can't be arsed with this if you're going to continue slowing it down with pedantic gotchas. Did you really not know what I meant? 

&gt;Which Scotland can do so without treating Home Nation students worse than EU ones.

Did you conveniently miss the part where I said the Home Nations are the only ones who pose a threat to our interests? 

&gt;However I am somewhat focused on what Scotland could do for the other Home Nations, inclusive of England, without any cost to Scotland itself.

You're not asking for *more* for the Home Nations though, you're asking for less for EU students, which is pretty spiteful. You want to slap the cake from the EU students' hands because you're not getting any.

&gt;And with the voucher idea, I am specifically, concerned with the advantage to Scottish students of having level-access to the rest of the UK education system

And an advantage for Scottish students is not necessarily an advantage for Scotland. Imo we'd be much better off focusing on improving our own universities. Giving students public money to run off and spend in already more established universities is detrimental to achieving that. 

&gt;When a country spends money (~13mil) on a referendum which could have been postponed until times were rosier, how is it possible to object to the infinitesimally small amount of cost in dealing with voucher administration?

Because the spirit in the referendum was in the interest of national autonomy, the ability to make decisions to benefit our country that are not possible in a union where we are massively outnumbered, the opportunity to flourish out from under the boot of Westminster.

My understanding is that the subs stay in international waters. There's no need for them to be in the Straits of Hormuz, because their range far exceeds the length of the Gulf - they can nuke half the globe from the comfort of the Indian Ocean.

Likewise they don't need to go through the Suez or Panama canals, because they can round the capes submerged, underneath and unaffected by the storms for which those passages are renowned. 

As I understand it, the whole point of using subs is so that nobody knows where they are - you could launch the missiles from land or ship just as easily, but that allows the enemy to identify your launch-points and bomb or sink them.

false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Hm. I don't agree with that assessment because, first off, you are suggesting that Brendan Rodgers is on thin ice and that he is one poor result away from the sack.

As frustrating and as disappointing this season has been, I don't think Rodgers is in danger of getting the sack this season.

I think the only way Rodgers gets the sack is if it becomes clear to FSG that Rodgers has lost the dressing room. But I don't think he has. Look at the postmatch quotes from Skrtel and Lallana and it is clear that they are still full of belief, they trust in each other, they trust in the boss, etc.

I think people continue pointing to last season and what we achieved but forget that we have played much of the season without the top two goal-scorers last season.

Looking back, I wish we would have finished 1st or 4th. Not 2nd. And certainly not three points away from the title. Our finish last season has created an unrealistic expectation from casual Liverpool supporters and from neutrals. The common argument I see is, ""Well, we/they finished 2nd last season... what is happening *this* season??""

Again, we have been without the services of top two goal-scorers in the Premier League last season. And we have a number of new signings adjusting to a new club, a new manager, a new city, a new home, coupled with the pressure of doing well for a fanbase like ours that expects so much especially after last season.

It's not a comforting answer, we naturally want to point at the figurehead of Liverpool FC - currently Rodgers - and say, ""It's you! *Your* transfers were shit. *Your* tactics are shit. And now look at us.""

But, unfortunately, it's not that easy to say.

The hard truth is that losing Suarez changed the dynamic of our squad and losing Sturridge for as long as we have created the worst-case scenario for us.

The scary part is that at the moment, a lot rides upon the fitness of Daniel Sturridge. And if Sturridge returns and does his job (i.e. score buckets of goals) and we still struggle? Maybe then we start really looking at Rodgers as the problem.

You didn't pull a Godwin's law (that ""as an online discussion goes longer, the more the probability of a comparison to the Nazis/Hitler approach 1""), you pulled a Nuremberg defense (the claim that a person is not guilty because they were only following orders from a superior).

You can be as offended as you like, but the Nuremberg defense is recognised as legal terminology (though is more neutrally referred to as ""Superior orders""). It may have been conceptualised at the Nuremberg trials, but it has since evolved to refer to any occasion where someone claims that they have no responsibility for committing an immoral act since they were just following the orders of their superiors.

The general consensus is that current main fields are dependent on exploration to even hope to maintain output or keep the diminishing returns at a non-calamitously falling level, this is especially true in the North Sea. The shale oil 'glut' is yet to materialise, and the projections of America becoming self-sufficient or even just needing Canadian oil don't take into account that on average shale oil wells don't run for as long as traditional ones

Then you have new fields (Brazil/Venezuela belt/East Africa/West Africa). These are generally offshore and hard to reach either due to deep sea or other reasons. They are often 'heavier' oil (Venezuela) which makes the refining process much more costly. These projects will be sat on because the initial outlay in getting a substantial amount to market is a lot.

Now I've heard a few very important people in the field say that we're at the end of a supercommodity boom driven by recent Asian demand and that we'll see a slump for the forseeable future as commodities are no longer a guaranteed return.

Exactly. And what we're getting to is that we're starting to see the significance of Sturridge's injury.

I think Coutinho has been encouraged by Rodgers to become more of a goal-scorer in the absence of Sturridge - and he certainly has the raw, natural ability to do so - but with that comes the reliance/pressure on the 22-year-old midfielder to deliver goals. And then we see the forced shots from Coutinho and others. And Henderson - at the moment - is much more valuable in the midfield as opposed to a goal-scorer.

It's frustrating all around.

The scary thing is that a lot of success hinges upon the fitness of Sturridge and his ability to perform at a high level for the remainder of the season.

Keeping schtum is *always* the best option. They're not going to de-arrest you because you say ""you've got the wrong chap, guv"". You're going to the station either way.

When you're being questioned in the station it is recorded and you should have a solicitor to advise you on the best course of action. Often, if there is evidence to inspect, the solicitor will advise you to answer ""no comment"" to all questions. Not because you're guilty and trying to get out of it, but because the police might not be able to make anything of that evidence and no charges can result or the evidence may exonerate you completely. However, if you go blurting out your life story in an interview, there is a very high likelihood that you will self-incriminate against a charge that you may not ever have faced.

false,TheSquareMileVampire,null,null,"&gt;the last real oil bear market was 1998 yes (are we excluding the 2008 crash, which was driven by everyone piling out of commodities that they had piled into 6 months prior)?

Why are we excluding it? It was driven more by a huge decrease in demand.

&gt;The shale oil 'glut' is yet to materialise, 

[Really?](http://imgur.com/pdRLZDW)

&gt;Then you have new fields (Brazil/Venezuela belt/East Africa/West Africa). These are generally offshore and hard to reach either due to deep sea or other reasons. They are often 'heavier' oil (Venezuela) which makes the refining process much more costly. *These projects will be sat on because the initial outlay in getting a substantial amount to market is a lot.*

As is North sea production.

The simple fact is that we experienced a once in a lifetime oil/commodities boom led by the rise of Asia that led a to once in a lifetime investment into oil and other commodities. Now that the free market has solved the energy question I see no reason why we wouldn't move back down to long term trends.

[Which is probably around $30 - $50](http://i.imgur.com/ZDmXsE3.png)

If you're an oil company why would you want to produce in the North sea which is expensive, highly taxed, dangerous and miserable when you could produce in any of the other numerous places that have shale. Shale technology is also just getting better and better thus driving prices even lower and lower.

In a somewhat ironic way it could be said that North American shale oil, pretty much the pinnacle of US capitalism, killed off Scottish independence for 50 years.",0,1419254742,null,0,false,0,cn26b9c,t3_2q22w1,t1_cn26b9c,t1_cn264s5,null,1425273375,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Honestly, I can't read your mind. I can only respond to what you state, not what you're thinking.

&gt;Did you conveniently miss the part where I said the Home Nations are the only ones who pose a threat to our interests?

No. But if you stop looking at the UK like a threat, and more of something you can work with, perhaps you wouldn't view it so aggressively. There is still no need to treat rUK students so cackhandledly while disadvantaging Scotlands own.

&gt;You're not asking for more for the Home Nations though, you're asking for less for EU students

I am asking for both. Is Scotlands current policy a double standard, or is it not?

&gt;And an advantage for Scottish students is not necessarily an advantage for Scotland. Imo we'd be much better off focusing on improving our own universities.

Improving the education of Scottish students isn't an advantage to Scotland? What do you know that Wales doesn't?

&gt;Giving students public money to run off and spend in already more established universities is detrimental to achieving that.

Actually. Given the prominence of Scottish Universities, it would increase the number of places available for international students, and cost EU students. Both these things increase revenue which can be poured back into the system.

&gt;Because the spirit in the referendum was in the interest of national autonomy, the ability to make decisions to benefit our country that are not possible in a union where we are massively outnumbered, the opportunity to flourish out from under the boot of Westminster.

Fewer still understand that what's often needed is not writing talent alone, but also experience in the sector that the copywriting would be for.

This is actually the main issue you may face. Do you have specific experience writing in a particular area? Or even a specialism that isn't writing related, that you could write about?

What I would suggest doing would be to tone down your writing experience *slightly* but play up your sector experience, and boost this with a portfolio of previous work.

With a small amount of practice, anyone can write well. Sometimes, this is actually a hindrance, as some business sectors have utterly appalling styles that they adhere to. I've seen press releases and copy from people who earn four times what I do, working as marketing managers for large multi-national companies who do things horrendously. Things like insisting on capitalising job titles and the terms like 'The Customer' as if that makes them more important. But that's just what they do, and what they want. So sometimes you have to learn to play this game a little.

What I'd suggest is to familiarise yourself with a couple of style guides, I suggest the Guardian and the Press Association's ones, as they're fairly decent as a general overview if you're going to be doing any media work. Then soak up a bit of the B2B press and marvel at the horror of the grammar and styles used, but learn from it. Then sort out your portfolio, highlighting specialist areas.

I don't disagree with a lot of what you're saying. Certain countries need oil to be a certain price to break even but Venezuela needs $160/barrel and we've never been there. Certain places in Saudi Arabia can go as cheap as they want. However as places start to shut off demand we'll see the demand increase as industrial output rises and Eu demand increases (ignored in favour of Asia but the EU's continued decline over the last few years has blunted oil price rises)

I agree with you over the North Sea. A few years ago, Sudan was more politically stable to invest in due to constant windfall taxes. However I don't see shale oil as a panacea due to the nature of shale oil wells. Ultravixens is a poster here who knows more about it than me.

Going the long way around the panama canal is a 14,000m round trip.  At 35mph, that's 2.5 weeks.  The Suez canal saves over three weeks to get to the Indian ocean.

Add to this that subs require a lot of maintenance.  As a result, we always have 2 subs at home for refit, training etc.  So a ""first strike"" would wipe out half our firepower without ever having to catch the things at-sea.

And then you have the problem of what the remaining ships can do.  If the captain stops getting responses from London, what does he do?  Is it Moscow he should hit or Beijing or Pyongyang or a terror cell somewhere in Saudi Arabia?

A captain at sea basically has to guess and take into account the vague wishes of the now dead PM.

That shale production in America will increase for a while by the way. A lot of those projects were paid for when Oil was a lot higher and whilst the initial costs for shale are relatively high the running costs are quite low. As such there's probably at least another million barrels per day of production to come online.

Shale production may decline but it will probably take a couple of years and then if prices start to rise it will just mean renewed production/exploration in the countries that have shale.

America's import/export of energy is somewhat complicated. They produce a huge amount of light sweet oil but not much heavy oil. Both of them have different specialist uses. From what I understand light sweet oil is very good for making gasoline whilst heavier oils are better for things like jet fuel (someone may be able to correct me on this as I'm not certain). So they will always import a certain amount but are now likely to start exporting some as well (it was banned).

Yes, this is about legality not morality. 

&gt;Honestly, I can't read your mind. I can only respond to what you state, not what you're thinking.

But the fact you said I hadn't specified indicates you knew what I meant and said it anyway. 

&gt;No. But if you stop looking at the UK like a threat, and more of something you can work with, perhaps you wouldn't view it so aggressively. There is still no need to treat rUK students so cackhandledly while disadvantaging Scotlands own.

Need doesn't enter into this, it's about what's best for our country, you might not agree that with every decision but the country obviously does. It's only a disadvantage to the short-sighted, investing in building up our institutions is much more important than frittering money away in other countries, imo. 

&gt;I am asking for both. Is Scotlands current policy a double standard, or is it not?

It is not, a double standard exists only between similar situations, the situation between rUK and the rest of the EU are very different. 

&gt;Improving the education of Scottish students isn't an advantage to Scotland? What do you know that Wales doesn't?

What does Wales know that we don't? 

&gt;Actually. Given the prominence of Scottish Universities, it would increase the number of places available for international students, and cost EU students.

But it goes against our nation's principles, which is that education is for everyone, not just those who can afford it. Obviously Scots come first, before you say rUK is included in that. 

&gt;So it is ok to spend public money provided you get ""from under the boot of Westminster"", but not ok to spend a much smaller amount of money to improve the educational opportunities of the country, and the prospects of students as a whole?

As much as there are positives about yesterday, you had Lallana Cruyff-turning into a left-footed shot towards the top left corner, you had Lucas trying to squeeze shots in past 3 players closing him down or you had Coutinho's exhilarating runs through the whole Arsenal team and trying his luck when he's off balance at the end of it.

You didn't have people making easy to pick out runs (so Coutinho and others were forcing passes), we weren't getting one v ones with the keeper in 15 yards of space, we weren't getting many open shots from the edge of the box and so on.

Then, last year, Benedict Cumberbatch was cast in the same role. Despite it being far more likely that a British man would end up with the name Khan than a Mexican, much internet rage was had at the casting of a white man in the role.

And that's ignoring the part where the first major African character on American TV was played by an Latina actress who has vaguely dark skin so I guess that'll do.

The question is, why am I asked to be colour blind only when it comes to originally white characters? 

Why, exactly, would the son of a Scotsman from Glencoe and a Swiss woman be black? While not impossible, it's as much of a stretch as Khan being white or Mexican. It makes about as much sense as Hawaii 5-O's two native characters being played by Koreans.

I'm assuming you're being sarcastic there (at least I hope you are)

&gt;Should Brand be berated for using his fame to do this? 

I haven't berated him about using his fame. I'm berating him because his ideology is built on bad interpretations of other people's positions and general waffley nonsense. I wish *more* famous people were engaged in a real, serious way with politics. Brand isn't doing that - his ideas are half-baked and he cares more about his own self-promotion and the rightness of his ideas than the actual issues. If he actually wanted to change anything, he might look at a graph one of these days. 

&gt;What is more important in inspiring revolutionary ideas - absolute factual accuracy, or a platform, and resonance with the people and the spirit of equality and fairness? 

I'm not asking for *absolute* factual accuracy. I'm asking for a basic comprehension of the facts. Even a passing association with them would be better than what Brand's doing currently. Are you seriously saying that if someone is proposing to overturn our society, that it's not important that their views are based on reality?

&gt; Is Brand having a negative effect?

Yes. He is encouraging a shallow, fact-free type of political discussion. For all he lambasts the Mail and the right-wing press, he does exactly what they do - twist reality to fit his own narrative instead of facing up to the world as it is and *then* looking for realistic solutions.

&gt;What has Cook done that has resulted in positive change like this? 

Well there's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0f8NBlmwwE) for starters. Then there's the broadly ethical foreign policy, the reforms of Parliament... everything?! I'm starting to think you weren't joking about not knowing about who Robin Cook was. If so, then you're quite ably demonstrating my point about him damaging the level of debate. Honestly if you think Brand is the pinnacle of revolutionary and progressive thought then you know less than nothing about the last few decades of British political history. There's a rich seam of things to discover there which will leave you embarrassed about Brand. Fuck you could even go for Tony Benn. I don't know where you get the idea that anyone who isn't Brand is somehow some dusty old academic or some grasping politician.

&gt;And fuck me if Brand isn't a great public spokesperson.

Well he's a horrible spokesperson, but I'd rather not fuck you if it's all the same to you. This is a guy who can't do serious debate, who thinks graphs are basically oppressing people, who believes in thinking with your gut instead of the facts or statistics. Every time he goes on TV and fails to say *anything* of substance he makes the whole left look like idiots. Basically, he values truthyness over the truth. He's the other side of the coin to any number of right-wing demagogues you could name (coughBushcough), and in the same stable as George Galloway. He thinks all politicians are grubby, corrupt incompetents, that ""the system"" isn't working etc without knowing anything about either. He's the kind of guy who moans about the Punch &amp; Judy show of PMQs without understanding how small a part of Parliamentary life it is. I would put money on him not knowing the difference between select and standing committees. He's the kind of person who says ""Tony Bliar"" and thinks he's being witty.

&gt;Those who claim they want change and damn someone for using a platform to talk about it have to seriously question their motives.

No, we don't. Because he's not talking about actual practical, likely change. He's not doing anything but self-aggrandising and self-promotion. Anyone serious about making progressive, positive changes in society has to have a grounding in the actual fucking facts. Can't stress that enough. 

I mean, look at his book sleeve:

The point is NOT whether oil is $65 or $73 in May 2016... the point is the **price can fluctuate wildly**, and that means going down as much as it means going up. Banking on the upwards profitability of the industry is incredibly foolish... at the moment the very viability of the industry may get called into question if prices drop as low as $50 a barrel. 

The former head of OPEC has been in the news today saying his view is that the OPEC nations should be prepared to weather as much as 15 years of price depression - because during previous oil price crashes that is how long the price has been depressed for (such as in the 1980s). It's particularly relevant now given that the main driver behind higher prices in the past (OPEC effectively operating a cartel over the majority of the supply) appears to have cracked. The US and areas of Northern Europe may now have sufficient reserves of Shale to prevent middle-eastern oil setting the price globally. 

Anyway, back to Scotland and independence... the point is oil wouldn't have provided the steady income the Scots would have needed for the sort of projects the SNP wanted to spend it on (like tax cuts and welfare spending)... those are things that need steady annual incomes to fund and can't be put on hold during a bad year in the way that say major infrastructure spending can. The Scots would have needed to borrow enormous sums of money to plug those gaps - and the cost of that borrowing would have been incredible.

Bond is born in Scotland to Scottish parents, then privately educated in England and joined the Navy. 

Those three factors have been pretty constant throughout the Bond series as far as I know. Skyfall has bond visiting his abandoned family estate in Scotland. 

It just seems like such an incredibly unlikely back story for a Scottish born black man to have. Black Scottish make up something like 0.1% of Scots. They likely made up even less of the population 45 odd years ago when Bond would have been born if Elba is playing him..

I know liberties have been taken with the character, but I think making him black would purely be a gimmick and it'd certainly be betraying the character.

Is this statement not a bit of revisionism? For my part, and many other fans I know, this season was supposed to be about cementing our status as a top four team, rather than rebuilding from the ground up which has been an excuse (legit or not) employed at least three times since 2010. Yes it was going to be tougher without Suarez and no one particularly expected the attacking magic of last year, but the signings made with the Suarez money were supposed to solidify the areas in which we were poor last year, so instead of relying purely upon SAS magic we could be a more rounded team that wins games as an all-round unit instead of a phenomenal attack backed by medicority in other areas. Instead we've seen most areas of the team just as bad, if not worse than last year, whilst bad luck (Studge) and bad judgement (Lambert, Balo) have seen our attack reduced to a shadow of its former self.

Not to be a negative nancy, but barring a phenomenal run of form in the second half of this season, I can't help but feel that we'll be looking at yet another ""rebuilding"" year in the 15-16 season.",0,1419260679,null,0,false,0,cn288dx,t3_2q2678,t1_cn288dx,t1_cn27i0y,null,1425272479,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I disagree not only with this statement but also the sentiment - When choosing parts, there's GOING to be a bottleneck somewhere, either the CPU or the GPU with modern PC's being what they are (Back in 2005 or so RAM could be a bottleneck too, and throughout the history of PC gaming there's been different things which could be)

Since you're using an established socket (LGA1150) which is relatively easy to upgrade should you need to (all the way to 4790k, which will be the last CPU released on this platform), there's no reason to not get the itx 970 except for price. It's also more power efficient than either of the cards that you have suggested!

I would suggest getting the best part you can afford, and not worrying too much about future releases as what is in the future is in the future, live in the present!!

Sorry, but that's really exactly what I was saying. It's childish, schoolboy attitudes like that, that people like Brand encourage. I'm sorry that politicians don't *speak to you*, but you think they're all the same? You don't know anything about Cook by your own admission but you're just assuming he was some out-of-touch, nose-in-the-trough politician. This is the dumbest argument you can make, while still claiming to be interested in changing the system. What this says to me is:

""I don't know anything about the system, but I know I'm really mad at it!""


I actually agree with a lot of what Brand says in principle (at least, the bits that make sense), but he doesn't base his views on facts and his book is full of mis-interpretations and misquotes. I already mentioned the ones related to Orwell above. Again, exactly what to expect when the book was most likely ghost-written by a journalist disgraced for exactly that. 

Brand is not making a difference. He's causing problems by disseminating false information and stoking people's anger at the same time as their ignorance, instead of trying to educate. ""I don't wanna look at any graphs mate"" - what a rallying call for informed debate!

If we're going to change anything it has to be based on *facts*. What a pity that you can't see that.

It's clear you don't have any idea about what politics is actually like, what MPs and politicians actually do and, most worrying of all, you don't seem to think that it's important that arguments should be fact-based. Given that you seem to think that politicians are all the same, please continue to follow Brand and don't vote next year.

I love reading/discussing the academy and think this has been our problem area ever since Roman took over. 

As far as Charly Musonda goes. I would have agreed on everything if he had stayed at Anderlecht. Now, I'm not sure. I've seen a bunch of youth players develop at several clubs and to be honest, I have no idea why it doesn't seem to work at Chelsea (although my guess is a lack of chances). 

I once saw a behind the scenes interview with the Arsenal reserves from a couple of seasons ago. They were asked who the best player on the team was and who the best player they had ever played was. Most of them said the same thing, Jack Wilshere and Nathaniel Chalobah. The latter is now trying to break into Burnley's first team. 

I remember Ancelotti saying Kakuta was the best youth player he had ever seen (the man can speak with some authority on the subject). McEachran won a u17 European Championship and several of our and his coaches were convinced he was going to make it (Ancelotti, Villas-Boas, Wilkins, Pearce). Bruma and Van Aanholt were top prospects in the Netherlands when we fetched them. Piazon, Feruz, I could go on and on.  

As much as I would like to believe (again) that this is the generation that IS going to make it, I'll wait and see (and cry if we waste the future captain of my NT).

Youth development is a very frustrating aspect of running a club. Other clubs picking your ranks, crippling injuries,... even if everything goes according to plan a fantastic prospect could still not make it. BUT **(tl;dr) if you fail to produce a single long-lasting youth player despite buying prospects from around the globe for nearly a decade, you are doing something wrong.** 

As long as Mourinho is here I can't see this changing (don't get me wrong, I love how he has us playing right now).",0,1419262341,null,0,1419264977,0,cn28x1h,t3_2q24gp,t1_cn28x1h,t3_2q24gp,null,1425272159,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

So to run with the examples that keep coming up in this thread, a lot of people seem angry that laws prohibiting inciting violence, or that forbid racism stiffle free speech. Well that's because there are Human Rights that protect the security of each of other. For example, Article 2, being the Right to Life. If there is verbal or written communication that threatens some ones life, then authorities need to weigh up which needs protecting more. One citizens right to freedom of expression, or the others right to life. I think life wins out here.

We basically all have the right to do and behave as we please, until it starts to interfere with someone else or society as a whole, so swing your arms around all you like, as long as you don't hit anyone, and say what ever you want, so long as it doesn't have a large negative impact on the community.

If you add a goal to each game we've played this season though, we'd have 9 more points and a positive GD.  EDIT: That would have us in 5th, tied on points with 4th place West Ham, but they'd have a GD 4 better than ours.  Would anyone be calling this season a shambles if this was reality?

I'm not trying to say defense isn't the problem because it really is awful, and we really need to do better.  Our attack however, with everyone fit, should be good enough to secure points over our shit defense.  It should also maybe take a little pressure off the defenders and help them get their shit together a bit.  A top keeper would also make an absolutely massive impact on our defense (someone who commands his area and plays aggressively against crosses, will go so far to cutting out the bullshit set piece goals we concede constantly), especially if he's vocal and takes a prominent role in organizing things in front of him.  Mignolet is not a leader at all, and I don't think he could control his box if his life depended on it.  Jones is similar, but much worse at shot stopping.

Due to the conventions of the film and acting world, we suspend our disbelief when a different actor takes over the role (and indeed the whole cast changes).

However, there are limits as to how far the actors can change, before our disbelief un-suspends itself.

Where those limits are is a matter of conjecture and directors have often tested how far they could test them by casting actors whose appearance is very different from how the readers of a play would imagine the lead character to look.

The UK government had to reassure the markets because the markets were concerned debt currently sold by the UK would ultimately end up as part of the debt package transferred to Scotland and become a riskier proposition. Because of that risk the borrowing cost increased.

The UK government acted to reassure the markets that they would guarantee that debt, and eliminate the risk that was affecting the borrowing rates.

It was precisely because the markets believed Scotland *would* take on a share of the debt that the UK government had to act the way it did. 

So to answer your original point.

Clara seems to be a bit of a ""Guardian reader"" stereotype (she was seen toting the paper in one scene) which in the UK has connotations of what you might call a ""straw liberal"" in the USA - she just doesn't understand why a good person might enthusiastically sign up to shoot people. Danny has a scene putting her straight on this.

As for people in the UK being negative against the military, attitudes are subtly different than the USA. In the UK there is a cynicism about the military because of the devastation of the world wars.

If you go ""no comment"", you're not challenging/disputing the evidence. Now that means of the police have evidence pointing at you, you're more likely to get charged. I've known a few suspects act very surprised that they're off to court after not answering questions. 


If you answer the questions you might end up incriminating yourself by saying too much, or you might talk yourself out of being charged. 


A written prepared statement is the middle ground - saying only what you want to (if you can resist the urge to answer questions after that). 


Long story short: speak to a solicitor/legal representative. They'll probably know the best course of action, but bear in mind they can give bad advice. Prior to that, you might be able to talk yourself out of being arrested but if it's too late then stop talking until you get lethal advice.
