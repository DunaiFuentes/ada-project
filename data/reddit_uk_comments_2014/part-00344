To give just one example, in the 1800s Ahmad said that certain clerics are misguided in preaching violent jihad and that if they did not desist it would lead to disaster for the Muslims.

The Doctor hating on children for no particular reason amounted to nothing. No development. No change of heart about them. Nothing. He just still despises children for some reason. The character trait didn't evolve into anything or come to an impasse ever.

Coupled to the fact that every episode was about Clara questioning The Doctor even though he proved himself after episode 4 or 5 that he's changed but still the same inside. She just kept on questioning him for no real reason other than ""I love a guy now, you look like a dick by comparison, why do I like you again aside from being involved in one of the biggest moments in your history out of love for you?""

Missy was both a train wreck and a sight to behold. It wasn't as bad as it *could* have been but it could've been so, so much better. Cybermen becoming the weakest Who villain ever is frustrating for the sake of ""The Doctor &amp; The Master are totally best friends you guys!"" Blah.

The series 8 finale should've been built up as Missy being a completely new Time Lady and the Nethersphere should've been the Time Lord tech that The Valeyard was trapped in. Leading to his release and using Missy as a sacrifice for a new body showing just how twisted that version of The Doctor was. Then we have an old Who villain, another new Time Lord, and a whole bunch of possibilities going forward. It would've been the best of both worlds. And then we could have Series 9 be about The Valeyard seeking out Gallifrey while The Doctor runs around saving people and trying to catch up to him to stop/help him do it.

Also, the whole fact that they left the Nethersphere in a building in the middle of London after the whole situation happened... what the Hell?

false,Paludosa2,null,null,"I've heard of ""Fantasy Football"" but here we have ""Fantasy Politics"".

The EU has rejected an Amendment (Article 48) or New Treaty on changes to Freedom of Movement in the EU.

The logic of the Treaty Structures themselves dictates this not any one fantasy politician:-

* No Change
* Sub-Treaty Change
* Amendment or New Treaty Change
* Secession from Treaties Change

I believe no change is no longer acceptable. I believe the politicians are pretending that Sub-Treaty == Treaty Change to pull a Wilsonian Fudge on the public.

The only honest choice whether or not you want to or do not want to take it concerning our politicians is Secession from Treaties. It achieves everything Mr. Cameron says he wants and maintains everything he says he wants to keep - except EU membership to an ""Ever Closer (political) Union"" which he says he does not want and nor do the public I would guess.

The logic can be looked at in way too as well as above via Treaty Structures:-

The above is ""OPT-OUT"" IN Treaties. Yet any ""opt-outs"" that break the treaties trigger 28 different and disagreeing members to vote on it as well as be endorsed by the EU insitutions themselves. And this is simple politically ""impossible"" otherwise the whole thing unravels.

Yet with Secession it is ""OPT-IN"" OUTSIDE Treaties. And here there really is scope for real change. The current working example in action of this is clearly EEA/EFTA no matter that it is not optimal. It is positive change without disrupting the EU's unstable treaty structures - and provides the UK with what it determines is needed.

It is an odd world we live in where this is never pointed out by those who's job and sworn duty is to perform this function and some random redditor's words are one of the few places you may happen to hear it.

It's all based on the Treaties themselves, as Bruce Lee once said:-

There was an article last week where they referred the House of Lords as an Day Care Centre for old people. These figures were from 2012 (alos not the Lords contains more members than under labour, despite the Govt stating in the elections they wanted to reduce this!!)

&gt;At 11 June 2012, there were 775 peers able to sit in the House of Lords. No party has an overall majority, but Labour is the largest party with 231 peers (30%). Including Members on leave of absence, disqualified from sitting or suspended, total membership was 816.

so 816 Lords (who if the attended) could claim £300 per day.. £244,800 per day £1,224,000 per week.

&gt;There were 180 women in the House of Lords at the end of the 2010-12 session, 22% of the total membership. About half of Members are aged 70 or over.

so of the total amount of people eligible, around 400 were born before or during the 2nd world war...

&gt;At 30 April 2012 the median age of Members of the House of Lords was 69 years. Only one in six peers (16%) is aged under 60, while 18% of peers are aged 80 and over. Crossbench peers tend to be older than peers from the main parties. Liberal Democrat Members tend to be younger than Conservative or Labour Members of the Lords.

Did you patch test those products and introduce them one at a time? The Simply Sensitive wash is a decent basic formulation, but might be unsuitable if it leaves your skin feeling dry or tight, or might be better suited to cleansing only once per day since you don't get 'dirty' overnight. Foaming cleansers and even water can flush out some important components that keep the skin barrier healthy (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out).

Ditto the Sebamed is a good basic formulation although it's largely humectants (water attracting ingredients) with no occlusives (oils, butters, waxes). Don't be frightened of occlusives they are not all pore clogging, some can strengthen the skin barrier. Ingredients like ceramides, cholesterol, high linoleic oils like sunflower seed oil may be beneficial.

When you say different diets, within that do you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle? Any diet should be balanced and varied, too many are restrictive involving cutting out food groups.

I believe and have seen evidence of all of the above, but not to the extent alleged in the 90s, which led to children being taken away from families utterly wrongly.

This is a subject that I know quite a bit about. I had a pint with the UK's most senior satanist once.

The truth is that there have been a few occult groups, in each case not actually satanists though, that were run on cult like lines, where there has been sexual abuse, but they're usually isolated and controlled by a single charismatic individual. There have also been individuals that have used ritualistic elements in abuse and crimes, but usually things they've either made up or got from films.

What has happened *more* frequently, is ostensibly Christian preachers making accusations of possession or witchcraft, and abuse happening as a result of this. It's a far, far greater and genuine problem than any occult or satanic practice.

Exactly right. I'm thankful that at least someone recognises this fact rather than the immediate knee jerk   assumption that all Oxford people are just rich and didn't work hard to get there.

I happened to have a private education and go to Oxford but I worked bloody hard to get there. I knew plenty of rich people at my previous schools who had plenty of money yet did not get into oxbridge, so money was not the deciding factor in their application, it was intelligence that mattered. 

It's true that money can provide opportunity to get a good education and that helped me achieve my potential.

Those of us that have skin barrier issues (can manifest as dryness, eczema/ dermatitis, rosacea, acne vulgaris) may need to help our skin barrier by either supplyng the lipids it needs or ingredients that can encourage synthesis of those lipids.

It may be you need a richer moisturiser in winter or (as you are considering) not a foaming cleanser in winter or try niacinamide to boost ceramide synthesis in the skin (also anti inflammatory, excellent for acne).

Some people had also adopted less common regional accents such as Scottish or Australian, but that is only really acceptable if you spent some time there.

It is not really offensive to adopt a British accent at all - in fact a lot of British people would consider it favourable to the alternatives. The best way to smooth it off is by living in the UK, but imitating British people from movies and TV also helps a lot.

Also i'd not say there's never been something similar on the Catholic/Nationalist side. There were far more parades in the 70's and then going even farther back over the past 100 years. Which I think backs up my idea that the parades are an attempt at preserving heritage and culture as when the Catholic/Nationalist way of life was threatened there were a lot more forward attempts at showing it.

Like for instance, assuming a guy's boyfriend is actually their friend, because 'most people are straight'. yeah you're right statistically, but you may have put out this hypothetical guy a bit. If everyone in a given day did it to them, they'd get the vibe that they weren't in a very understanding place. Not enough to leave, as in your example, but still it's unnecessary.

This comes to the 'cis' title. You shouldn't really assume everyone's straight, especially on the internet- it's used as a support network by a whole bunch of people. Displaying mindfulness of this kind of thing helps in a lot of pretty nonspecific ways.

Addressing someone as a 'he' or 'dude' can put them out, because it's seen as saying that only men make good arguments- which isn't just putting out the hypothetical women, but the confirmation bias of everyone reading the comment chain. You say that you don't think women are interested in reddit- probably because every *other* commenter you see only using male pronouns, so you have no idea how many women's comments you've even read.

I'm not the best student either - i got reasonably good grades, but not extremely good, and it was below what they asked, but I still got in.

I don't know how it'll work for international students however, as I don't know the qualifications in the US.

i'd go on a website called the student room, which is a forum for students in the UK. Theres a lot of trash there, but some people should be able to give you some good advice about this matter and maybe more qualified to assist you.

Mansfield is a town, and not a rich one but ... the folk are generally decent and friendly (except near chucking out time on Friday and Saturday nights but that pretty much goes for anywhere in the UK). There are gyms, bowling alley, multiscreen cinema, you're near a first class golf course (Hollinwell), the little museum gets good reviews and the theatre can get some surprisingly good acts in ... 

If you need a taste of city life then you can get a train or bus (runs every ten minutes) into Nottingham which is very much a city and has much more of a buzz.

You've got it wrong, McDonald wasn't convicted, Evans was. If anything after reading this I find Evans more innocent given that he was arguably unable to grok how drunk the girl was upon his arrival (given she was in the middle of performing intercourse which typically heightens one's senses).  

Personally I find Evan's culpability to be more around the message he received from McDonald:  

&gt; i've got a bird  

did he know the ""techniques"" that McDonald typically used to pick up women? (i.e. wandering around town trying to pick up drunk chicks).  

I think the aspect that makes them both somewhat guilty was the fact they left her alone in the hotel in the morning. Quite frankly they're both dicks and deserve what they get because if they didn't leave her alone in the hotel then I bet you they wouldn't have been prosecuted.  
There is a huge difference between someone waking up alone and not knowing what the fuck happened and waking up in a bed with someone else and thinking:  

&gt; oh god, look at the mistake *I* made  

by leaving her alone they more or less guaranteed their prosecution so that she if anything could figure out what the fuck happened that evening. Perhaps they left because she pissed the bed?

* no suggestion of who's alleging it - is it just the newspaper?

&gt; Investigator Mark Conrad says: “Nick’s account of his decade-long abuse – the trafficking, sexual and physical assaults and murders – and revelations about the status of the men defied belief.
&gt;“Unlike many abuse survivors, Nick has gone on to have a ­successful life. He is intelligent, articulate and strong-minded.
&gt;“His accounts are uncomfortably detailed and consistent.

* VIP Perverts - some shadowy group whom we aren't actually going to describe in any way, because if we did we'd get sued to hell.

&gt; Nick insisted a reporter from Exaro was present at a meeting with detectives when he gave them the name of the MP who allegedly murdered the boy, along with a list of other ­prominent people who he says sexually and ­physically abused him.

Obviously the names can't be reported because this would interfere with an ongoing police investigation.

Cesc is just a small factor in the goals Costa has scored. The reason Costa is so deadly is because of his positioning, technique, power and confidence.

false,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs," A speaker at the memorial service for Alan Henning, the British hostage murdered by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, has posted on social media apparently justifying Isil, promoting al-Qaeda and expressing sympathy for Syrian jihadist “martyrs”.

Majid Freeman, a charity worker from Leicester, was with Mr Henning when he was abducted in Syria last year. He has been quoted in the media as a friend of the aid volunteer and has criticised the Government for “abandoning” him.

On Oct 13, Mr Freeman addressed mourners including Mr Henning’s widow and children at the memorial service in Manchester, describing him as a “beautiful, genuine human being” who “went to Syria to help” at a time when the whole international community “were paying mere lip service”.

However, two weeks later, on his Facebook page, Mr Freeman asked for “dua”, or prayers, for the brothers of a British Isil terrorist, Ifthekar Jaman, who have been charged in connection with an alleged Syrian terrorist plot.

On Oct 19, he posted a link on his Facebook page to a YouTube video by Ghassan Ibn Kamal, which presents Isil as a reasonable response to Western foreign policy. Mr Freeman wrote: “This brother hit the nail on the head.” 

 Mr Freeman has also posted links to an Isil propaganda video made under duress by another of the group’s hostages, John Cantlie.

He has also tweeted: “Britain join war of terror. Drop bombs in populated areas. Innocent civilians lose loved ones = join Isis to get revenge.”

On Oct 22, the day a terrorist gunman killed a soldier in Canada and invaded the country’s parliament, Mr Freeman stated on Twitter: “You can’t go around randomly punching people in the face without expecting a reaction. Same applies to bombing other countries.”

Mr Freeman posted on Facebook and Instagram describing Jaffer Deghayes, an al-Qaeda jihadist from Brighton who died in Syria, as a “shaheed” or martyr who had died “defending the oppressed”. Deghayes, 17, the nephew of a former Guantánamo detainee, was fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.

On Sept 26, Mr Freeman retweeted a statement that “Jabhat al-Nusra, we are with you even if the world fights you” and has tweeted propaganda pictures of members of the group distributing water to residents in Aleppo. 

 On Facebook last week, he said that the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, which was briefly closed by the Israelis at the time, “will be conquered by jihad, not by peace… none will enter it except those who believe in removing the door, not those who search for its key”.

In November last year, Mr Freeman posted a tribute video to Anwar al-Awlaki, the al-Qaeda cleric blamed for inciting a number of terrorist attacks.

He is also promoting an event with the Islamic Education and Research Academy, which sends non-violent extremist preachers to speak at mosques and to Muslim audiences across Britain.

Mr Freeman has been questioned by the police, but not charged with any crime.

The disclosure of Mr Freeman’s apparent views will add to the growing questions about Aid4Syria, the group

he and Mr Henning were travelling with in an aid convoy. The 47-year-old taxi driver from Eccles, Greater Manchester, was seized on Boxing Day last year only half an hour after crossing into Syria. Others in the convoy, including Mr Freeman and a number of other British Muslims, were released. Aid4Syria named a water project and fire engine after Aafia Siddiqi, a convicted al-Qaeda terrorist who is serving an 86-year jail sentence in the US for attempted murder. Isil demanded Siddiqi’s release in exchange for the life of Mr Henning’s fellow hostage James Foley, who was murdered in August.

Aid4Syria has also campaigned for Siddiqi’s release, saying she is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. It has organised a number of events in the UK with extremist speakers. According to the anti-extremist body Stand for Peace, Aid4Syria has also circulated an inflammatory video by Mohammed al-Arifi, an extremist cleric, encouraging Muslims to wage war in Syria. Al-Arifi has been banned from Britain after allegedly grooming the first two British Muslims to appear in an Isil propaganda video.

Aid4Syria’s parent charity, Al Fatiha Global, is under investigation by the Charity Commission for alleged “links [with] individuals purportedly involved in supporting armed or other inappropriate activities in Syria”. The investigation was launched in March after one of its workers, Adeel Ali, was apparently pictured with his arms around two masked men holding rifles. He denies the picture is of him.

Two other charities involved in the aid convoy joined by Mr Henning and Mr Freeman, IHH and Children in Deen, have also been accused of aiding jihadist terrorism in Syria. IHH, a Turkish group, was raided by that country’s police earlier this year. Children in Deen is under investigation by the Charity Commission. The first British suicide bomber in Syria, Abdul Waheed Majeed, travelled to the country in a convoy organised by Children in Deen.

A third charity involved in the aid convoy, One Nation, is the subject of “concerns” by the Charity Commission over its work in Syria. One of its trustees, Arshad Patel, was arrested by police investigating the 7/7 London suicide bombings, but not charged. His sister, Hasina, is the widow of Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the suicide bombers. Mr Freeman is also closely linked to One Nation.

There is no suggestion that Mr Freeman, who described the sight of Mr Henning in an Isil propaganda video as his “worst nightmare”, was personally involved in, or in any way condoned, the hostage’s abduction.

Kasim Jameel, the leader of the Aid4Syria convoy from which he was kidnapped, also denied any connection between the group and Mr Henning’s captors. He said: “No one sold him out – that is just ridiculous. Yes, we have many different people with different views, but that doesn’t make them terrorists.”

Over several days last week, Mr Freeman and his solicitor declined to respond to any questions about his views. ",0,1416171819,null,0,false,0,cm4cfuo,t3_2mgx7l,t1_cm4cfuo,t1_cm4adu8,null,1425994561,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; How much stronger would the lust for power/wealth be if that was the only way of satisfying your primary sexual desire with multiple partners comfortably?

But it couldn't possibly be the only way could it? - secrecy, the quiet life, other countries, more remote areas, jobs where you work with children, there are many other places you could end up where you could engage in such activity ""comfortably"". Money and power bring status and eyes on you (privately and publicly) and would make it far riskier. And you forget that they have to become wealthy and powerful, which would likely take over 30 years as most MPs are middle aged or older. They don't have any advantages of wealth/power until then.

&gt; There are active elite pedo rings in Britain right this moment.

Nice statement with no evidence whatsoever, there are high profile paedophiles from 30-40 years ago being uncovered today.

But I would be very surprised if there were ""active elite rings"" these days, information leaks and circulates too quickly.

My mum spins round in a hurry and asks the woman what on earth she just said, and the woman repeats it. Fanny pack. Mum nearly wets herself laughing, and the roman has no idea what's so funny, so mum tells her that in England, fanny is slang for a ladies front bottom. Woman is very embarrassed and asks what we call a fanny pack?

Mum replies with bum bag, and the woman bursts out laughing and almost has a toilet incident herself.

I've whittled CVs many times, it's brutal to get 50 down to 5 for interviews. Brutal. If I have someone telling me ""hey, I know him, he's a nice guy, pretty smart"" then it counts massively than the other unknowns in the pile.

Yes, it's cynical but it's also real world. Before LinkedIn it was the number one way to get jobs. Now you just have to rack up the experience &amp; let the head hunters come to you. But those first five years can be hard to get break in. 

Anyways, if I am to give you one piece of advice about getting a job it's this: ignore job postings completely. Research your field and write to who you want to work for with a top-notch cover letter. If you get a nibble it won't be you against a couple other applicants, it'll be you and only you. They may be thinking about hiring and the hiring process is a massive pain in the arse so you could save them a lot of time and expense. Also, buy [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Answers-Tough-Interview-Questions/dp/0749435526), ignore the title, the real value is in the advice getting you into the interview.

false,Chapatrap,cnty-uk,United Kingdom (and sometimes Ireland),"I think I'll throw in my two pence concerning Northern Irish politics, which has a bit of a unique position in the UK.

**The Devolved Parliament in Northern Ireland**

The Northern Irish parliament is devolved, which means it has powers concerning internal laws in Northern Ireland but answers to Westminster when it comes to external laws. Its sat in Stormont in Belfast and is called the Northern Irish Assembly. It's members are called MLA's. In a UK-wide general election, Northern Ireland elects 18 MP's, all of whom are from local parties. In a NI Election, 108 MLA's are elected, usually from local parties.

Westminster has the power to dissolve the Stormont Assembly and has done a few times in the past, where Northern Ireland was instead directly ruled from Westminster. As it stands now, the assembly is a big coalition of two nationalist parties, two unionist parties and a neutral party. There is no opposition party but the coalition is full of polite loathing from each party to each other (apart from Alliance, maybe).

The First Minister is basically a local Prime Minister for Northern Ireland and the current First Minister is a man called Peter Robinson of DUP (the biggest party in the Assembly). The Deputy First Minister is a man called Martin McGuiness of Sinn Fein (second biggest party in the Assembly). 

**The Parties**

Northern Ireland has a completely different set of parties that are split on a 'nationalist-unionist' line rather than a 'left-right division.' Supposedly, Unionists are predominately Protestants and Nationalists are predominately Catholic but this division has started blurring in recent years.

The big two parties are the Democratic Unionist Party (unionist, right wing, believe in remaining in the UK, traditionally a Protestant party) and Sinn Fein (nationalist, left wing, believe in uniting Ireland, traditionally a Catholic party). Sinn Fein also sits in the Republic of Ireland's 'Dail Eireann' but refuses to sit in Westminster.

The next two big parties are the Ulster Unionist Party (a more moderate Unionist party) and the Social-Democrat Labour Party (a more moderate Nationalist party who have links with the British Labour Party) They used to be bigger in the past but have recently been overtaken by the more extreme Sinn Fein and the DUP in the elections.

A fifth party exists called the Alliance Party, who claim to be neither Nationalist nor Unionist and instead work for improving relations between both communities after the Troubles. They're basically the guys who meditate arguments that break out between the Unionist and Nationalist parties and tend to lie in the centre of the political spectrum.

Other smaller parties in the Assembly include the Green Party, the Traditional Unionist Voice, NI21, UKIP and non-affiliated independents (they don't sit for any party).

There are 108 seats in the Assembly and they are split like this:

*The Main Parties*
DUP: 38 seats
Sinn Fein: 29 seats
SDLP: 14 seats
UUP: 13 seats
Alliance: 8 seats

*Other Parties*
TUV: 1 seat
Greens: 1 seat
NI21: 1 seat
UKIP: 1 seat
Independents: 2 seats

**The political sitiation in Northern Ireland today**

Northern Ireland went through about 30 years of borderline-civil war between Nationalist groups and Unionist groups called the Troubles, which ran from about 1968 until 1998 at the Good Friday Agreement. The Troubles were a very complicated period of time and one that's very easy to see from one side or another, so I'll just link you to the Wikipedia article and you can form your own opinions without worrying about me being biased to one side.

[3,530 too many.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) 

The Troubles had a profound effect on Northern Ireland and even though things have improved immensely, the effects are still felt today, especially in politics. A lot of leaders of Sinn Fein were in the IRA (although certain -cough-Gerry-cough- ones will deny it) and a lot of leaders in the Unionist camp were in the Orange Order (which was affiliated with various loyalist groups).

The various controversies that blow up today usually have to do with [flegs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_flags_issue) and [parades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parades_in_Northern_Ireland), which result in the government butting heads for months about them and usually one party walking out on talks because the other is so hot-headed about the issue. There's a bit of discontent with the current Assembly because it seems sometimes that nothing gets done when both sides are constantly arguing but hey - they're talking, which is better than the alternative.

&gt;

&gt;__Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Δ17__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) from the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. The character was voiced by [Zoë Wanamaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Wanamaker), and was largely [computer-generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery),  although a physical prop was also used on set.

The idea that the young guys don't fight for their spots is a repeatedly parroted idea to excuse management for not bringing young players through into the first team but it's simply not their fault. Chelsea's turmoil and repeated swapping of managers has made stable progress nearly impossible, no manager could ever rely on being at the club long enough to see development through so they were inclined to ignore it, play the strongest team they could and hope for the best. I hope the implication that Jose will be in the job for the long-term will allow the team to develop and bring in young talent but so far the failure has not been on the part of the players. Maybe one or two players could be put down to issues with their attitude and demand but at a certain point it becomes clear that there is a fundamental problem with the infrastructure of the club rather than with the players within it.

Bertrand never had a chance. He had to compete with Cole and then Azpilicueta who were absolute top quality players and even if he could compete with either he was always much easier to overlook. Players can only become their best with play time, they only get play time at the club if they can fight for it but they can't fight for play time when they're not at their best.

I have a story about a bum bag too. I was on holiday with my parents in Greece, and at this point I'd been secretly smoking for three years. I was swimming in the sea whilst they were sat procrastinating, and I got intense cramp in my leg and kept waving and screaming for help. Of course they just waved back at me, thinking a stroppy teenager was somehow being happy and loving all of a sudden. I manage not to drown and get myself ashore, whereupon my stepfather waves a packet of Silk Cut under my nose and offers me one. 'But I don't smoke' I say. 'Yes you do' he replies; 'I took these out of your bum bag.'

It had taken them a while but they had finally cottoned on that I didn't in fact have a terribly weak bladder, and when I frequently disappeared to the loo whenever we were on long journeys, I was buggering off for a sneaky smoke. 

How they didn't smell it on me in three years is frankly beyond me. Even as a smoker I can smell it a mile off.

false,[deleted],null,null,"I'm not sure this would be a fair description of all of us who have voted or intend to vote for ukip, Karma - as I know you're not suggesting. It's just a question of value judgments - as you allude to, and priorities. My primary reason for voting ukip is to leave the EU, but also because I'd like to use them as a battering ram in order to put direct democracy onto the agenda. In terms of the education comment, well I'd really like to put some grammar schools around the country for when I have children. I went to one of the worst state schools in the country, and it really let be down. A cursory glance at my grammar shows this (I've been working on it for the last month, got my their's, there's, but dyslexia makes me a bit slower to these sorts of things vis-a-vis more conceptual matters). 

I think the most important thing for all of us, too - regardless of our position on each issue, is to not let fools on either side taint our perception of our opponents. I could easily complain about some of the lefty sneering I see on comment boards like the guardian, or on twitter or on reddit; but then, one only needs to look below the line of the telegraph to see stuff which is eerily similar to some sort of white nationalism. The reason for this last point I've just made, was not because I believe you've done any of these things - you most certainly haven't whatsoever in your above comment. It's because, frankly, there will be racists and ignorant people in all camps, in every party and for every position. There are, as you know, many ex BNP and NF members and activists currently serving as Labour party councilors - but this does not say anything about the Labour party, except maybe that it sees no harm in associating with them, or perhaps that it's big on second chances. The same applies to Ukip. It's only natural that racists flock to a party that wants to move towards a point based system for immigration - because common-sense dictates that one ought to take what one can get in terms of policies. But this doesn't mean the party is racist institutionally or in its policies, or even that a significant percentage of its voters or activists will be themselves racists.  I, for example, always find it difficult to comprehend the possession of religious faith by intelligent people; as in a commitment to a specific doctrine. Well, that says more about me than religious people, because one only needs to look at the bloke who came up with the big bang (a Catholic priest, if I recall correctly) to see that I'd be full of shit If I contended that religious people can't be intelligent, or that there is a causation between x and y. Again, want to point out again that I'm not suggesting you've done any of the above - you haven't, and you were mindful to point out that you wouldn't want to generalise. 

My whole point is, whether we be conservatives, socialists, liberals, libertarians, or ecologists or whatever, if we are to win the battle of ideas - we all need to sit up and take each other seriously. We don't need to respect our opponents positions, because those positions will naturally be predicated upon a foundation of value judgments, which we may not personally ascribe to, but we do need to entertain them and treat them with - if nothing else, a cheeky bit of understanding.

They don't have to be - but you have to question the wisdom of agreeing to massive monthly costs just to get a ""free"" phone today, especially the most expensive phones - when there are plenty of cheap and extremely capable phones that you could more easily afford outright? It seems that people are waking up to this with phones like the Moto G, cheap to buy and use on a cheap SIM only contract or PAYG that you can cancel at any time.

It's the same logic as going to BrightHouse and paying their ridiculous prices because you've decided you want a big TV but don't want to save up - is it really better to get it ""today"" if you pay far more overall?

But, my original point (and the one people have missed) was that people will agree to pay something like £120 more over 2 years to save £50 upfront.

that's kind of how nicer better things work..usually. Buying a basic phone isn't nearly as fun, and just means more money spent that you could have put towards a better phone, or covered the first couple of months at minimum on a new contract with. 

And for a lot of people it really is better. When you know you're good for the money down the line but want something, it's far more appealing and not even that much more expensive to pay in increments. In fact most might say it's more manageable to pay more down the line, but smaller controlled payments.



People haven't missed your original point, we all know how contracts work. It's that you seem to be forgetting that you have to pay for the data plans or the top ups separately. It's the convenience of having everything there without having to really do anything. That's one of the key things you're paying for. 


I know to buy my phone outright was around 500-600 at the time it came out. Instead i'm paying 30 a month so I get my phone ""free"", but with all my unlimited usages, and my 2gb of internet. If it runs out it stops working I don't have the choice to go over or pay extra charges. the texts and calls don't and won't run out ever. 

I never have to worry about top ups or anything. I never had to save up. If i was to use pay as you go or something on a cheaper phone, i'd undoubtedly spend more money on top ups and have a phone that is a lot less snazzy. 

**TL;DR:** *we all know how contracts work. It doesn't make you stupid for wanting to pay more down the line for a contract.*

Fans shouldn't be disillusioned and start saying that Davies was a waste of money, or that we've already broken him like we do everybody else. He's 21, he's signed on a 5 year deal, and Danny Rose has made a couple of defensive mistakes in the last few games.

false,Nepene,null,null,"I am saying that it is a bad overview of general and individual politicians, not just that it's limited.

It's not uncomfortable, it's badly written and poorly researched. 

For example.

The modern conservative message isn't really don't interfere with society and social lives, it's that support should be directed to enhance businesses and entrenched social structures. This was a major distinction in the Bush era- Bush did a lot to strengthen medical care, but directed it towards strengthening businesses rather than boosting government medical care. It's why Republicans support school vouchers and Democrats don't. It's why Democrats tend to support things like carbon bans, Republicans things like sharing green technology. This is the mainstream conservative movement that he was writing about, it's important to mention. You can't really understand David Cameron's big society without it. 

Plus, Republicans obviously interfere with gay marriage say. That whole thing is inaccurate. Democrats are hands off in certain respects. 

A community based on ethics? That is very leftist. Both sides have ethics. Left wing people generally support a community boosted by government organizations and new centrally planned ideas, right wing people generally support a community bolstered by citizen organizations and aiding decentralized ideas.

Democrat party. No inclusive, no multicultural, evolving yes. No party is really exclusive. They're not fond of Jews, openly religious people, Asians (Obama really messed up American-Chinese relationships because of this), rural white people- like all groups they have a select clientèle. I'd go for forward thinking, evolving, bureaucratic. They are urban,

Families. Relationships build on trust and morality vs relationships built on fear and strength. No. Just no.

Research shows that there is a tendency for parents who raise their children to obey authority to be right wing and for parents who raise their children to question authority to be left wing. No more. There is no research that shows that an atmosphere of fear vs morality is what varies in such households. Anyone can use fear regardless of their parenting style.

On religion I'd have gone for actual attendance facts- Democrats, lower church attendance, more atheism, more catholic, more jewish. 

On republican jobs, I'd have definitely mentioned doctors, they're a potent powerbase of the Republican party. It's where scientific Republicans tend to go since the religion thing means you have to help people.

&gt;__Space Florida__ was a place visited by the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond. According to the Doctor, the beach had automatic sand which cleaned up any rubbish that had been left on it.
&gt;After flying the Pandorica into the exploding TARDIS, the Doctor's life rewound. He saw younger versions of himself and Amy in the TARDIS, one week earlier, during their journey to Space Florida. The present Doctor called out to the past version of Amy, who turned but did not see him. (TV: *The Big Bang*)

Filtering through traffic is legal yes

Ah yes...etc that gives us an advantage in traffic like using bus lanes, having special traffic lights and what not which is totally unfair since you paid road tax and all! (/s)


&gt;and generally be detrimental to the traffic flow in the city

Perhaps you'd like to become more informed as to what is detrimental to traffic flow in cities (I'll give you a hint, you see big queues of them all over the place at rush hour)

&gt; but still have the audacity to complain as much as they do.

How audacious of me to request that you take my personal well being seriously. 

&gt; Shit goes both ways

While this is true, one type of road user pilots a large vehicle weighing in at a tonne+ of metal and safety equipment which can be accelerated to high speeds quite rapidly and without much effort or thought while the other is on a smaller device with little protective equipment which is typically piloted at speeds of under 20mph. So who should be more accountable and careful in that scenario? 

&gt; if you over take me at a red light to get to the front of the queue, hell yea im gonna take you over straight away.

Again, perhaps you'd like to inform yourself about why cyclists do that. The roads service didn't just happen to have some free time and spare green paint to paint those advanced stop lines for the craic, there is science and statistics backing them up. Regardless of that, if I personally have filtered to a set of traffic lights past you it's because I know 9/10 I will not be slowing you down in the slightest by doing this. 

If you just overtake people blindly without thinking ""will I have to stop soon after"" etc then you are an absolute fool and shouldn't have a driving license.

&gt; (and probably will again) take the piss a bit when I get nutty sounding replies from kippers on here.

There's no shame in this. I certainly do the same. It's just human nature really. The thing about humans is, we hold on our opinions because we believe that they're correct - either factually or morally, or both. I imagine it's a product of our evolution. So, if somebody in the real world outside of the internet is aggressive, we just can't help ourselves a lot of the time - it's all chemical, it's a process. A lot of people on reddit especially can be very self-righteous and condescending, and it really does make one respond in kind eventually. So don't let nasty kippers or conservatives or whatever push you around and treat you like a fool just because you happen to disagree with them, because none of us are under any obligations to assume the role of a doormat, even if it was within our power to transcend our evolutionary programming at the time. Not to be too pretentious, but I think Aristotle contended something like we're rational animals? I'm reading a fascinating book right now called 'The Righteous mind' (or ""a"" rather than ""the"", can't be bothered to boot my kindle), which is all about working out the psychology of people in relation to their political positions (it's written by an American, so the dichotomy is liberal and conservative, so the lefty and rightist to you and I, presumably). But the point is - we're probably not rational animals. We're emotional animals whom post-rationalise our thoughts and feelings at the time and try to justify them. I happen to think we can transcend a lot of this a lot of the time - I think the fact that you and I are able to chat politely shows that. But it's certainly something to mindful of when talking to other people regarding matters of politics who.. may not be so understanding. The nutters who send you nasty shit think their on the side of what's right or on the side of history, so they feel vindicated in being arseholes. Whilst you and I shouldn't allow partisans to take the mickey and be abusive, we should be mindful not to let arseholes cloud our perception of others. I think that may actually be one of the areas where British politics has gone so wrong - I think a lot of the time (and honestly, I'm an imperfect beast so I fall victim to this a couple of times a week, before I knock some sense into myself) we allow the wounds of the battle to scar us, and to shape our perceptions of those we want to win over to our perceived side. A bit melodramatic, but I think the rising xenophobia in Britain can be a testament to this, If we allow ourselves to be a bit contrived for the purpose of elucidating abstract jibber jabber from yours truly. But yes, it's very, very refreshing to get your message - and I just wanted to disavow you of any notion that I think you should take the default position of taking abuse from people, because you most certainly never should - and I certainly don't bloody intend on starting, either! Haha.

&gt; You are a perfect example of how to engage with an opposing view, 

I'm nothing if not perfect! /s

&gt; I also failed in school, but going back to get GCSEs at 40, I was amazed at how engaging my teacher was and how much I actually wanted to learn and to prove that I was capable of this stuff. Came out with an A too, after getting a U at school 25 years ago, the ultimate fail grade.

Well done for this, I can't commend you enough. I don't think I'd have the confidence (read: balls) to get GCSE's later in life (I'm 21). Probably a confidence issue on my part - but I think it's one most people would share. So you must hold onto the fact that you've put yourself out there in situations most of us are too weak to. It's a remarkable sign of character - and the A, bloody well done. 

Cheers for the chat, mate.

If any of these things are a factor, there's simply no competition. If you want to create access points between devices, that's something android still can't do. If you want support for you device for more than around 6 months, that's something you will not get on android, simply because of the sales channels behind it.

Soldado looks energetic and eager, and his movement and passing is far better than Ade's on the year. And unlike Ade, he's got a couple years left. Ade looks to be on the decline already. As for the argument that Ade fits our system, how does that explain how much more effective our chance creation is with Soldado?  There was a post on here showing how the team creates far more shots when Soldado is on the pitch than when he isn't. And he's not the one taking them. And prior transfer fee shouldn't mean a thing. Literally the only thing in favor of selling Soldado is the fact that wed get more money for selling him instead of Ade. The rest is all a matter of opinion and assumption on both sides.

You know, I suffered from social anxiety for a good year, up until about four or five months ago. It's tough. Something I've been trying to drum into a friend of mind who has it pretty bad at the moment is, anxiety is all about thinking too much about things and about how others perceive you. It's like, if you spend your life seeing as yourself as little more than an object in somebody else's universe, sooner or later that's all you'll be. It's one of those things where you just have to persevere, which it seems you did - and you certainly got the rewards for it.

Dude, I'm in my last year of university. Besides the fact that I'm entirely bored with philosophy, because I feel like we spend too much time discussing concepts which we haven't justified the supposed existence of, or because I think reason alone is a silly reason to believe anything and that a pretty little argument written out by some clever cloggs proves nothing (without empirically verified information, one can't reason one's way towards ascertaining the density of a star, for example), the primary reason for me looking forward to leaving university (even in the knowledge that I'm likely to go onto JSA for a bit before I get some luck) is that I won't have to use a bloody pen for more than a few minutes here and there ever again.

false,Radius86,null,null,"Let me introduce you to what that looks like. It's not as easy as looking through Reed, picking out jobs and setting up interviews. If you're a non-UK/non-EU graduate, post 2011, this is what you do: 

1) Look for companies that have Highly Trusted Sponsors status as evidenced from a PDF document that the Home Office is supposed to update every now and then. Hope and pray that they have vacancies. They don't? You can't stay in the UK. 

2) OK, so somehow you found a company on the sponsor list. Now it's just the interview right? Wrong. You need to have a job with them that is full time and earns at least £20,500 per year. This number fluctuates around that mark depending on the industry. You can't get that salary? You can't stay in the UK. 

3) OK, so let's say I go to a company and try and convince them to be a Highly Trusted Sponsor. Surely, that's in their best interests and yours, to retain good talent? Yup. All they need to do is to apply for it, by paying £1500. It's around £400 for smaller companies (less than 10 people), so that figure covers most companies you'd want to work for. Oh, and any candidates they wish to sponsor? Pay £200 for each potential candidate to secure a 'Certificate of Sponsorship'. You can't get this secure in time? You can't stay in the UK. 

4) OK fine, fuck it! I've found a company, it's a HTS, they're willing to sponsor me. Now can I stay? Well, not quite. There's still the matter of the £600 (approximately) you need to shell out for the visa application cost. Not to mention the fact that you need financial funds of at least £800 for the last three months. Oh, you can't secure that? You can't stay in the UK. 

5) OK, fine! I'm a rich mofo anyway or luckily an aunt died and left me some cash. I've got the money. But hang on, I made a slight mistake in my form. Nothing serious. I didn't put the wrong name or anything. But the address of my university is different on my application form, because they've shut it for refurbishment and moved campus temporarily. This didn't match up to their records, so they've denied my visa. So then, I can't stay in the UK. But wait, surely I can appeal that? Well, if I'm not in the UK, I have the right to appeal. But any money I gave as part of the application is NON REFUNDABLE. And If I was in the UK, I have no right to appeal, so nope, I cannot stay in the UK. 

6) OK, I get it! So everything went rosy, and I have my visa and my job! It lasts a maximum of 3 years. Yay! But somewhere in the middle of that, I get an offer for a better role somewhere else. I can join that company right? Wrong. Are they a HTS? Any of the processes from points 1-5 not ok? No? You can't stay in the UK. 

7) So what happens in three years? What if there's a new government and the rules change altogether? Well, keep an eye out for it. Because if you don't toe the line the way the Home Office wants, you can't stay in the UK. 



So yes, if you can secure a good job, you can stay. You're the 'best and the brightest', as Theresa May likes to call people like you. 

But there's a lot that defines what a 'good job' is. Factor in all of that guff up there, *then* factor in what a graduate today goes through emotionally and mentally in terms of trying to secure a regular interview for a regular job, as though he were a UK citizen, and you scratch the surface of what it's like to be a non-UK/non-EU tax-paying, non-benefits-applicable, totally legal and by-the-book person looking for a job in the UK.

Of course. Just find yourself a closet bi-polar partner! 

&gt;Story time?

1999: husband to be's 30th. He got:

- One record player

- Eight David Bowie LPs (which were bloody expensive for re-prints - damn you Tower records)

- One bottle of 30 year old armagnac (from Selfridge's)

- Eight or so cigars from Selfridge's cigar room

- A solid silver (or silver-plated, I cannae recall) cigar cutter 

And maybe some other bits I have forgotten.

The whole lot came to £400; I'd been accumulating the bits for a while. When he opened the record player and Bowie records he sobbed like a teenager trying to get their first love out of their system. It was adorable. I think he'd lost his entire Bowie collection in a messy relationship split you see. And this was pre-internet/streaming/downloads, and I don't recall even having Bowie CDs around the place. 

But then what happened was: we got married, moved into a new house and he would sit in his den listening to Bowie on repeat and would sob for hours at a time over his best friend from college (a huge Bowie fan) who had died in a car crash aged 18, 12 years prior. Aaaaand that's when he started drinking vodka in pint glasses disguised as blackcurrant juice and became an alcoholic. He always drank like a fish (correction: we did *together* - but I never got so pissed that I would wet the bed) but now he was on the voddie during the day and hiding it from me. 

So maybe the record player wasn't a good idea! But I did come away with it with a new, deep love for Bowie, so some good came out of it after all. And the armagnac was very bloody lovely.

He was lucky not to just get an evil look for his 30th after the pile of crap he bought me on my 21st. We had a massive row about it and I launched the bottle of perfume he'd bought me into the partition wall during it. It was really satisfying: it was a perfectly round bottle you see, and it lodged itself halfway in at eye level. Aesthetically it was really quite pleasing to look at.

Bristol it goes without saying is a good city and has some great areas and culture and is far more picturesque than Southampton, but it can feel a little gentrified and pretentious.

false,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"If you give, say, £1000 a month to 64m Brits, you get an annual UBI cost of just under £800bn. That alone is 5x the current state welfare bill, and nobody's quite explained how that would be paid for. 

If you offer £1000 a month to everyone legally able to live in the UK, you provide a massive incentive for a flood of immigrants, particularly from fellow EU states. Immigrants at the moment are generally a fairly positive thing as far as the economy, businesses, and financially secure people are concerned. With a UBI of a reasonable amount though, you'd be looking at a situation where there would be tens of millions of people who could come to this country and do literally nothing, and still be given several times what they'd earn working full-time back in their native countries. It could be absolutely disastrous. Unless you only give UBI to certain people, in which case, heavy inequality. 

On that point, how would UBI work for children and parents? Give the £1k a month to the parents, and you basically create an economy where the easiest way to be wealthy is to have as many children as possible. Give it to the kids, and that money won't be recirculated, they'll just be insanely wealthy once they're able to spend. Give them nothing until they hit a certain age, and you end up with a system where someone aged 28  maybe has the best part of £100k more than an 18 year old. Good luck getting on the housing ladder then. 

But then, this is just one set of flaws in just one possible implementation of UBI. As I say though, I'm yet to see a proposal that actually checks out logically. It's not ideologies you have to counter, it's the fact that UBI just wouldn't work, unless you tuned the numbers to be so low as to be meaningless, in which case it'd barely be worth changing the existing sytems to.

Like I said in my op, there is no issue if you come from a working class background or if you come from a public school background. The issue is referring to yourself as ordinary when you are not. Also, this isn't just about Farage, as he is not the only key individual in the UKIP party.

They seem to be basing this view on the treasuries official estimates and figures as to the efficacy of higher taxes, something Labour accepted during the 13 years when it ran taxes at 40% and when it initially made the 50p rate temporary as a short term tax would not be worth relocating over while a permanent one might.

The argument, as made by the American President, John F Kennedy, is as follows:

&gt;Our tax system still siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power and reduces the incentive for risk, investment and effort--thereby aborting our recoveries and stifling our national growth rate.

&gt;A tax cut means higher family income and higher business profits and a balanced federal budget. Every tax payer and his family will have more money left over after taxes for a new car, a new home, new conveniences, education and investment.

Alright, I'm an American. We're not hip to whole rich people suck thing nor do we really care so much what your background is because really the only thing we care about is the rags to riches story. Mobility is expected at Farage's level and I sense he made it to the top level while enjoying the regular things the common folks have done along the way like a pub, who doesn't like a pub anyway? Why is this a big deal to you guys. He's not lying he likes that stuff. He seems ordinary because he was in the industry along the way as a broker doing pubs and stuff and still does that.

If anything the film producers are insecure about money if that's who you mean, and the people who flip their shit at men kissing are just a product of their environment

You go your whole life being told cucumbers are the most disgusting thing in the world over and over again without ever actually seeing cucumbers because the film companies censor cucumbers since people find them disgusting and cucumbers censor themselves on the street or in your presence and I bet you'd go ""ewwww"" at the rare sight of a cucumber like you do two guys kissin

People who go ""ewww"" at the sight of male homosexuality (but not female homosexuality, funnily enough) are simply a product of their environment and culture, not insecure in their own sexuality.

How many times have you seen male homosexuality throughout your entire life VS. how many times you've been told it's gross and weird? 

You think your aversion is some natural thing because you don't like men? Why don't gay people freak at the sight of heterosexuality then? Why don't gay men doubly freak at the sight of two women? 

If it was about your own person sexual tastes it would reflect that and the reactions to heterosexuality, female homosexuality and male homosexuality wouldn't be so starkly different 

 The knee jerk reaction to male homosexuality is a testament to the extreme psychological aversion we are conditioned into and the true extent of our homophobic society. 

It speaks volumes about how we are raised to view homosexuality between men and homosexuality between women when the mere sight of a kiss can launch someone into a frenzy of discomfort and disgust but the latter provokes an opposite reaction of pure celebration and delight. 

You're just programmed into thinking lesbians are awesome and gay men are gross and never have the opportunity to think otherwise, and to avoid acknowledging people are brainwashed into their homophobia and the sheer magnitude of societies oppression towards male homosexuality they like to think it's some hard wired ""natural"" biological thing that they freak out at men kissing in a bad way but have the opposite reaction to lesbians, even though if this was true gay people would have a similar reaction to them but don't because they're completely desensitised to heterosexuality before they even hit puberty, and don't have it drilled into them constantly that heterosexuality is disgusting and weird

&gt;

&gt;The Latin phrase ___civis romanus sum___ (*cīvis rōmānus sum*) (Classical Latin: [ˈkiːwɪs roːˈmaːnʊs ˈsʊm], *I am a Roman citizen*) is a phrase used in [Cicero's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero) *[In Verrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem)* as a plea for the legal rights of [a Roman citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizenship). 

&gt;In the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament), [Paul the Apostle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle), when imprisoned and on trial, claimed his right as a Roman citizen to be tried before [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(title\)), and the judicial process had to be suspended until he was brought to Rome.  

&gt;The [locution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech) was [quoted](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston) by [Lord Palmerston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston#Don_Pacifico_Affair:_Parliament_and_the_Queen.2C_1850) when called to explain his decision to blockade [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) during the [Don Pacifico Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Pacifico_Affair). In his speech in the Houses of Parliament on June 25, 1850 he claimed that every [British subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_subject) in the world should be protected by the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) like a Roman citizen in the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire).

You fucking did have a right to stay, and you shouldn't have left. 

This is the second time I've seen you write about this, and it infuriates me that you accept your situation so readily.

Everything you write shows clearly that you'd built a life with your boyfriend - you would have won, had you only stayed and challenged your deportation, on the grounds that doing so infringed in the ""right to a private and family life"" of you both.

I appreciate you agreed when you came here that you'd have to leave at the end of it, and I appreciate that the state told you you had to leave. And I appreciate you didn't know you had the right to stay - I'm not blaming you.

But I wish you'd taken legal advice before leaving the UK, because I don't see how you'd lose a ""right to a private and family life"" appeal when convicted murderers and rapists manage to win theirs.

It sounds to me as if for all intents and purposes they're regarded as living in the house as far as the UK authorities are concerned. If that's the case then you are likely lodgers rather than tenants- the fact that you rent your individual rooms would suggest this too. Under those circumstances your landlord has much more right of access to the property than if you were tenants, but check your contract to make sure.

Can you get in touch with your landlord and discuss the situation with them? Doesn't sound like they can be too bad if you live with them for two months of the year. Also, who cut the second key- the landlord or the landlord's friend?

Bear in mind that to a great extent you are doing your landlord a service. Not only are you providing them with income, you are also looking after their house in the UK while they are not there. As someone currently living between two countries with properties in both, I can assure you that's a major concern.

If the barmen in my local never earn more than minimum wage then we may end up writing off their student loans. Their training in graphic design and town planning was only a cost to us all.

The financial perspective of this does not come down to individual business cases if the government pulls its socks up and intervenes.

NHS hospitals will not employ foreign doctors if we tell them ""sorry, you won't be getting any more visas"". They might have to pay their staff a little more, but that will make nursing a more desirable occupation for young people.

Obviously this transition cannot take place overnight, but we also need the government to accept that we've been living on quick-fixes since Blair came into power, and that free-market higher education has failed, at least in this area.

It's understandable that people should want to study subjects that interest them, so the government needs to tell universities that they'll no longer be approving student loans for certain courses, those whose graduates are all unemployed. 

Likewise it needs government intervention to expand the teaching hospitals - they probably need subsidising for this, since they haven't already expanded of their own accord. 

Doctoring and nursing are valuable careers which are in demand worldwide - add the government's duty to its people, and that means that British people should not only have first crack at these jobs, but they should have the opportunity of the training they need to build better lives for themselves.

That's true. I'm not trying to argue with you or be rude, but I hope you don't mind if I explain why we disagree with them. 

1- We believe that there is strong evidence from the Quran, hadith and logic that Jesus passed away roughly 1900 years ago. 

2- We believe it is against the laws created by God, as explained in the Quran, for any being to physically ascend or descend from heaven.

3- The Quran and Bible both state Jesus' mission was only to the Jews and never to the Muslims. He never even read the Quran, so how could he be a prophet for the Muslims anyway? And if someone was to return, is Muhammad (sa) not more appropriate? How can Muhammad (sa) be dead while Jesus lives?

4- The Quran (and religious prophecies in general) is full of parables and metaphors. One famous example is when Joseph's friend sees a dream of seven fat cows eating seven thin cows. This prophecy didn't literally refer to cows, it referred to seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in Egypt. On another occasion, Abraham sees a dream of him slaughtering his son before God explains it is a metaphor - he only need slaughter a lamb. Then from the Old Testament we have the prophecy that Elijah will will return from heaven to make way for the messiah (sound familiar?) but when we read the New Testament and the disbelievers ask Jesus, where is Elijah?, he replies that the prophecy was only a metaphor that someone will come who is similar in personality and spiritual level to Elijah and this has already been fulfilled in the person of John the Baptist. Similarly, when Muhammad (sa) foretold Jesus will return, we believe it was a metaphor meaning a prophet will come who will be spiritually similar to Jesus. 

5- If Jesus is alive and is to literally physically fly down from heaven, where is he? Don't the Muslims need him, like, now? Aren't the prophecised era of his return very clearly here? Aren't all the signs in place? So where is he...

&gt;So basically you believe that your Ahmad is the second coming of Christ?

In a nutshell, yes. However, he is completely subordinate to Muhammad (sa). The Quran unchanged as our book, our source of religious law. Ahmad's prophetood is a sort of shadow prophethood and in no way supersedes his master, Muhammad (sa) or the status of Muhammad (sa).

The same argument extends to homosexuality - if you didn't like it, you don't have to be it.

false,q_pop,null,null,"To build on /u/Caprylate 's points;

There is not necessarily any ""interest"", but there is compounding (as long as you don't spend your income).

An equity portfolio will typically produce 2-4% dividend income, and fixed-interest securities will produce coupon interest. With most S&amp;S ISAs you can have this income purchase more shares/units (or by buying ""Accumulation"" funds this happens automatically within the fund, and the income adds to the unit price).

For example, you buy an equity portfolio yielding 3% with £10,000. For the sake of argument let's say this buys you 10,000 units in XYZ Fund's Income units at £1 per unit. The capital value of the portfolio remains constant, meaning that at the end of year one you still have 10,000 units worth £1. Now, though, you have received £300 income, which you could choose to spend or reinvest.

Let's say you reinvest the £300 and 300 more units are bought. The fund is still yielding 3%, and you now have 10,300 units, meaning that by the end of the second year you have received dividends of £309.

In addition to this, the fact that you have bought more assets with the income means you have a two-fold compounding effect. Say at the end of year 2 you re-invested your £309 into more units and the capital value is the same, you now have 10,609 units.

If in year 3 the capital value of the fund appreciates by 5%, and the yield is still 3%, your 10,609 units have become worth £11,139.45 and you have received dividend income of £334.19.

By the end of year 3 your imaginary £10,000 investment is now worth £11,473.64 - nearly 15% growth in three years, thanks to compounding. If there were no compounding the growth would have been £10,000 + £300 + £300 + £500 + £300 = £11,400.

In this example the difference isn't much, because there was no capital growth for 2 years, but extrapolate these kind of figures over 20 years and the benefits of compound interest are huge.",0,1416214396,null,0,false,0,cm4uutn,t3_2mjbpl,t1_cm4uutn,t3_2mjbpl,null,1425985839,8,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,8

Essentially what you did there is the equivalent of my going to Poland and announcing, well, ""Everything is so cheap here.""  The average income in I've seen the average Australian income anywhere from 150% to 200% higher than the UK figures.  When you adjust for income the UK has a pretty high cost of living. London far more than the rest of the country.

This influences some of your other points. Your quoted house prices are in line with the difference in income, but what you get for your money is better. Go look at a new build, they're practically built from cardboard.

""Afro-British people should support UKIP in order for mother Africa to separately negotiate and conclude new amicable trade and foreign policy agreements with an independent United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.

Under the current arrangements, the European Union is not only imposing punitive tariffs on Africa’s nascent industrial and agricultural products while flooding African markets with cheap EU goods, stifling local businesses. The EU is also substituting aid for trade; thus entrenching a culture of dependency and discouraging sustainable development efforts.  For example, thousands of European NGOs are effectively taking over state responsibilities across Africa and providing basic health, education, clean water and food.

To make matters worse, the EU often uses aid as a political tool to impose its will as we are seeing in Eritrea, Sudan and Zimbabwe, causing unspeakable suffering on the most vulnerable people.

Just as the British people are looking to trade to get them out of the current economic crisis, African countries have for years been calling for fair trade, not aid, to get their people out of extreme poverty. Only an independent Britain can help the two peoples to realise their mutual interests in economic and social development through trade.""

At the time HBO had Deadwood and Rome both running and both shows were hugely expensive enterprises given the need to build entire worlds and populate them with entire costumed citizens. The accountants basically said one of em has to go or will will go broke.

 It was never actually canceled, it was put on the back burner for reformatting. The idea was to replace season 4 with some made for TV movies, and then for it to be done with a different run times and season numbers, but while all this discussion was going on and time went by, most of the principle actors who were without contracts had to move on to other stuff to avoid unemployment.

So about three or four years later Deadwood was unofficially declared dead by its main actors, writers and director. Pity really it was a brilliant show. Rome was also brilliant, but also ended abruptly for the same reasons. massive costs that could not be justified by merely 'pretty good' ratings. 

Of course Game of Thrones has made that leap from just pretty good ratings to global megastar which has made the idea of ruinously expensive TV a possibility once more.

But all that is beside the point here. Utopia is a contemporary show so you can use real streets and rental cars as background and extras can wear their own clothes. So the costs are not anything like a concern.

The main trouble I see for the US reboot is it has no reason to exist. The UK original while no one might have heard of the director had a great grand vision and a wonderful visual style.

 I cant see even the great Mr Fincher being able to do anything similar thats not just aping it like a colour by numbers book. But of course since hes an artist he wont do that, which leads me again to 'why bother?' Since hes an artist and every one has total faith in him, why not just let him make some fresh original TV?

And then even if they get the visual tone of the show via some miraculous accident spot on with out being a total copy, how will it work as a US property? its a very British show. Lee works because of his extremely polite and reserved British demeanor. As does Wilson Wilson. 

The two female leads are also vastly different as characters and actresses. I don't want to prejudge the casting but I bet you any money both will be extremely generically attractive American women playing 'sassy yet sexy' with a touch of 'vulnerable yet strong willed'. I make this guess because that the only actress you see on US TV. One will be blonde and the other brunette so as to help us an an audience tell the difference.

For us I'd propose a land value tax. There's an enormous amount of wealth locked up in UK land and the tax might ease the housing bubble we're in.

Regarding children many schemes pay children at a reduced rate. But remember this is pretty basic money, it's unlikely to be £12k. The idea is that it covers one's essential costs and that people will generally want to work to top it up.

Regarding that one of the traps for poor people is the means tested benefit system. Once someone is claiming it's hard for them to do anything for fear of being cut off. And people don't understand the system well enough to take advantage of the little income they are safe to earn, eg Earned Income Disregard.

There is a huge demand for places at our medical schools, which require top A-level grades, and I don't think it reflects poorly on those who don't quite scrape in.

I also don't think that A-level grades alone are likely to be a good determinant of a doctor's ability - it's only in the last few years, for example, that we've required [clinical aptitude tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioMedical_Admissions_Test).

I believe that in the past we've allowed people to become surgeons, irrespective of how clumsy-fingered they are, just on the basis of their ability to pass exams.

So it's quite evident that it's possible to maintain and improve standards, and that training itself can produce better doctors.

The British climate is pretty miserable as it can rain any day of the year, and it's not particularly consistent either.

A mild [continental climate]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate) trumps it. Summers are long but not scorching. Rain is minimal but it snows well in the winter without getting unbearably cold either.

First Liverpool. A fairly large, port city; built on the money from slave trade and the Americas. You'll get a lot of culture here, Liverpool was the European City of Culture just a few years back. There's both Liverpool and Everton football clubs and enough Beatles memorabilia to last a lifetime. Seriously, they love the Beatles up there. Liverpool isn't a beautiful city though. But it's rough around the edges and suffers from a lot of unemployment. The joke around the country is that if you park in Liverpool your car will be up on bricks when you get back. I can attest that I've had kids offer to ""watch my car for a fiver"" whilst there. As some have said, it's comparable to Detroit but not as bad as that. 

After you've explored Liverpool you can venture out. Nearby is Manchester, another industrialised city that owes a lot of its success to the industrial revolution. It's the birthplace of Britpop and again has two famous football teams. 

Just north of Liverpool is the Lake District. A beautiful area famed for rolling hills and expanses of water. A lot of people holiday here because of its natural beauty and you'd be silly to miss it out. Lakeside towns such as Windermere are popular with British tourists and are full of typical cafés, art galleries and pubs. 

I'd recommend getting across to York as well. It's a beautiful city and not too far from Liverpool. It's ancient, with many buildings older than anything you'll have seen and was even the place a Roman Emperor was crowned (Constantine the Great who converted Rome to Christianity). You'll find plenty to do there and you'll fill your camera taking pictures.

The most notable thing, with me being brought up in Gwent, is the bards story or 'myth' created by a Hungarian poet during their war of independence. They saw our culture and our fight against the English and used it as a beacon of hope. 

[Here](http://youtu.be/9-2Rc_oKE24)

I am proud of Wales because it is my home. Oh we have some difficulties (we're a poor nation, the borders between English and Welsh speaking still exist after 800 years etc.) But its home. I will live and die in this country and be brought back to Gwent to be buried I expect. *shrug* other things like our mythology, the fact that we mention king Arthur and myrddin first and our red dragon is also reminiscent to a fantasy land that someone like Tolkien made up but is in fact there. I suggest you read up. 

Tbh, because of the disconnect between north and south, things like food get really muddled. You also can't read ally call one recipe entirely Welsh because we've been influence by so many other cultures (we've been trading with mainland Europe for millennia). There are many things however, especially ingredients, that are uniquely welsh. Take lavabread for example. Mix oats with a local type of seaweed and have it as part of your bacon, egg and beans breakfast. It may sound disgusting, but it is packed full of iron and helped coal miners massively with their lack of sunlight. 

Cockles are also a big thing here, as are desserts and cakes. Bakestones for example are a cake that is a mix between a scone and a biscuit. Another is a biscuit from Ynys Mon that is shaped from a shell. 

Movie wise no. No one cares to create a movie about us because everything that is our culture is assumed to be English. People forget Wales even exists for example. 

No common form of clothing for us however of flannel can be can be considered to be welsh. I personally have a heather coloured scarf made from flannel. Not many people do this though because of lack of knowledge on where to get it. I had to look ages to find that flannel. 

Other things:

Music is extremely, extremely important to welsh people. Whether it is folk, welsh speaking or normal it is very important. [This](http://youtu.be/fOyjdu2dls8) as far as I'm aware, is a modern rendition of an extremely old piece of welsh music. If you notice, its very similar to Breton music. Why? Well we have had a good alliance to the country for centuries. [This](http://youtu.be/aqb3fyzEKZg) I think is about a lad from Brecon going to fight in the Great War. Here's the lyrics in a general translation of the first two verses:

Ears whistle to the drums
And now the tone is changing.
The day is here,
To leave your mother country.
Bring all you need to start,
For the journal will not end 
Until long miles have been traveled,
Over rough seas and lands.

While a heavy heart is normal,
We have to keep moving;
To leave the country of our fathers,
Heartbreak is expected;
To leave Wales, our home,
Violating what we have been given,
Our people full of hope,
Their cheerful virtue never dying. ",0,1416216909,null,0,false,0,cm4vbhe,t3_2mj3rc,t1_cm4vbhe,t3_2mj3rc,null,1425985624,5,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,5

The reason you think modern buildings are ""made from cardboard"" is that they contain lots of insulation. Often the surfaces sound hollow when rapped, because they are just a thin layer of render or plasterboard over thick insulation - the structural stuff is deep inside.

The one thing that *is* really bad about many modern new builds is the room sizings.

&gt; In Australia and the US, the ground is pretty hard and dusty with patches of brownish-green grass.

Depends where you live - grass is pretty damn green here in south coast NSW, but I take your point - UK green is a whole other green.

&gt;  In Australia, there's 5 minutes of adverts every 5 minutes and the ""news"" are mostly infomercials.

I haven't watched terrestrial TV for well over a decade. With excellent DNS services and VPNs I can watch streaming TV from anywhere on the planet - I have a Netflix US account and a great (cheap) DNS service that gets me BBC and ITV live or on-demand in HD. 

&gt; Everything is so cheap here.

Depends what you earn, surely? And what your out-goings are and how much council tax you pay and what your car costs to run. Yes, there's the Australia tax, but 'cheap' is a relative term.

&gt;  In Australia, friendships are more of a group thing and conversations are mostly small-talk about sport or consumerism

Definitely not my experience at all. Sounds like you live a city - maybe it's a city thing. 

&gt; In Australia, the entry price is much higher (at least £750,000) but you get a larger house within 10 miles of the city centre and next to the beach with great nearby amenities.

Entry price is certainly nowhere close to £750,000 down here - more like £220,000 in fact. Yes there's more work in the city, but you don't have to live there. I live 90 minutes south of Sydney and have had no trouble getting good jobs in IT.

You are apart of the family, we are all a family and that is why Liverpool Football Club stands out amongst all others. You ask any player/manager, when one experiences the crowd at Anfield you can only be moved by the sheer togetherness of our fans.      

I've said this a few times on the Sub before.. I'm a Indian, British born fan and whenever I've gone to Anfield, me and my family are treated as locals - when I was really little me and my family came out of a game v Middlesbrough, as it ended 0-0 I was balling my eyes out and a big scouser came up to me, put his arm around me and said ""cheer up mate, we'll get em next time!"" From that day on I realised there is something really really special about our club.

Instead I think the issue is a lack of understanding about the diversity of African economies and those in other developing regions. It's insulting to talk about Africa as if the entire continent were in need of extreme poverty-level charity because in many areas there are now comfortable burgeoning middle classes. By the same token it's a mistake to think that nowhere in Asia requires assistance because, despite the enormous growth of middle classes there, there are still areas which experience poverty levels comparable to the worst found in Africa. We really need to be talking about individual nations and regions, not entire continents. We also need to understand that charity alone won't solve systemic problems and we need to use it in a multi faceted approach along with carrots and sticks for good governance from governments and reform of our own trade relationships so that we're not exploiting poorer, less powerful nations. 

Most importantly we need to understand that the people who know best where the needs lie are those experiencing them, so we need to use empowerment tools such as micro-loans as much as possible, rather than giving hand-outs which don't improve people's economic prospects and so don't solve long term problems.

false,Kitchner,null,null,"&gt;1 - What would you like to tell me about Montgomeryshire?

Probably nothing that wikipedia couldn't tell you! 

It's close to the border with England so depending on how close your ancestors lived to that border, it's possible they didn't consider themselves Welsh!

It's also in North Wales so it will be hilly, rural, and they will hate everyone from South Wales (plus the English of course).

&gt;2 - What are you most proud about being from Wales? 

It's going to sound weird but I'm proud of the fact that Welsh people maintain their cultural identity. 

This is very different from patriotism in the US, which is very much like ""This is my country, right or wrong"". Wales was conquered by England, reduced to the official status of a principality (i.e. part of a country not a separate country), and the English even tried to ban the Welsh language.

Despite all this Welsh people have retained their own separate identity, their own separate culture and history. People from Wales are proud to be Welsh for a variety of reasons, but they are all *Welsh* reasons.

&gt;3 - What is the most ""Wales specific"" food or dish?

Lava bread  or Welsh Cakes are probably the best ""traditional"" Welsh dishes to try, but no-one really eats lava bread anymore. Cockles are quite popular, as are fish and chips, so is  lamb. There's not a huge amount of unique Welsh dishes.

The recipe for lava bread is basically: Get some lava seaweed, boil it in water for like 4 hours until it's soft. Then you get your seaweed and put it in a pan that is frying some bacon so the seaweed is sort of fried with the bacon fat. 

What you end up with is a sort of green slop that actually provides plenty of energy. Miners used to eat it for breakfast (lava bread, bacon, mushrooms).

As for Welsh cakes they are amazing but you need to get a good recipe and practice a lot. My nan makes amazing welsh cakes, I do not. 

&gt;4 - Is there a movie that really captures the heart and soul of Wales?

Not really, Wales isn't really a country you tend to make movies about, unless it involves swords and dragons and stuff as a lot of King Arthur type legends come from Wales (Merlin's actual name was ""Emrys"", which was Welsh).

&gt;5 - Is there a very ""Wales like"" piece of winter clothing (like a specific type of coat or hat) that is common there?

Welsh people are immune to the cold. 

There's no specific winter uniform though, walk through Cardiff on a cold winter's day and people will be dressed similarly to you would.

I suppose you could get a scarf with the Welsh rugby logo and stuff on though, that's a pretty Welsh thing to wear.

&gt; 6 - What else? Tell me things.

Learn to like rugby. Also learn to shout at rugby when it's on the TV.

Even friendly looking old women in Wales will shout bloody murder at the TV when Wales are playing.

It's a common thing that when two British people meet they will grumble about something before having any kind of in-depth social interaction. Almost anything will do, the bad weather, their house, the high fuel tax, the weather etc. 

All British people will understand this and understand that it isn't really a proper complaint about society. It's a shared comradeship in a bitter life that favours nobody in the end. It's a social lubrication. A shared misery that finds common ground and a place from which to build a friendship.

Australians just don't seem to get this. 

Brit - 'Fuck me, it's hot here today'

Australian - 'What are you complaining about? It's fucking beautiful. What's the weather like in the Uk right now?'

Brit - 'Uh, yeah. I guess you are right'

Australian - 'Whinging pom, eh?'

Brit - 'Yeah, the weather is great here. You are right'

British people use shared misery and grumbling, whether real or perceived, in order to form social bonds. This doesn't really exist in the same way in Australia. British people are rather socially retarded on the whole so shutting off their one shared mechanism for social interaction is a great hindrance.

It's also why China and India both saw their rate of development collapse starting in the 1980s when they began to open their economies to world markets. / sarc

Ghana was considerably richer per capita in 1957 when it got independence than Malaysia.  In 2014, It seems almost unbelievable just to write it down, but it's a fact. The reason is largely trade and being open to the world, rather than trying to develop internally.

Trade is not a zero sum game, both parties benefit because they get things that they want in exchange for things that they have a surplus of. It also creates a virtuous circle, since it provides an incentive to produce more goods to trade, in order to get more of what they want.

Meanwhile, Tanzania, closed to trade, filled with NGOs, and the darling of social democratic governments in the west, thus receiving massive aid, remains one of the poorest countries in Africa.

Aid and NGOs no doubt help sometimes, but if a country is to improve/develop it is largely up to the people in that country, which happens best if they have the right environment for that to happen: stability, rule of law, and access to world markets.

In my opinion that is what aid should focus on: emergency aid (like famine relief) when necessary, and helping provide an environment where the people in these countries can prosper and grow their country themselves.

Far too much aid is (a) spent on things that do not enough long term good (a British doctor who goes to Africa can help his patients, but when he comes back to the UK, the community in Africa lacks a doctor), or (b) help people remain sustainably poor in a slightly better or more photogenic way, and of course (c) is outright stolen by corrupt officials in third world countries.

As for Tesco's ""defense"", they simply said that as they were being investigated by the serious fraud office, any statement they made might be prejudicial and may be considered misleading either to the police or the market (both of which would be criminal, right?).  They also said that they could not investigate anonymous claims which is again fair since how do you investigate the 1000s of contracts with 1000s of suppliers.  Since neither of the ""witnesses"" do business with Tesco anymore, why not come clean?  I think their response is fair.  How would you answer if you were accused of stealing but the police refused to tell you what you stole or when or from whom?  You can't prove a negative, you can only disprove an accusation and an accusation needs times, places, names and details.

For the paper trail, of course there is a paper trail!  If a seller makes a payment, agreed not to receive payment from Tesco or otherwise gave them beneficial terms then that will be reported in at least three places.  It will be in Tesco's books as payment received or not made.  It will be in the suppliers books as payment not received or made to Tesco (effectively in the wrong direction).  It will also be in the banks used for payments record of payments and in the records reported to HMRC.  

Not reporting payments or reporting payments that did not in fact happen would be fraud in all three cases.  That would be ""slam-dunk"" for people looking for dirt on either Tesco or particular buyers at Tesco.  It would also be self defeating since if Tesco boosts it's profit by these means but can't report the higher profit, it may as well not have bothered.  Am I missing something?  Why didn't these people break out their own accounts, their tax statements, their bank statements?  They would not even need do so publicly, they could have just handed them to the BBC and asked HMRC to confirm that those were the accounts filed.

Don't get me wrong, Tesco leans hard on suppliers.  But how hard is too hard and how hard is a retailer doing it's job is a pretty fuzzy line and when you have 1000s of buyers and millions of products, mistakes are likely made all the time.

On Bale and the 'magnificent 7' - I think ppl are forgetting how dependent we were on Bale in 12/13 - last season despite being a complete mess with two coaches and the complete tonkings at the hands of the top 4 we got 69 points, a delta of -3. The team had definitely improved at the expense of one really good individual. A comment I commonly make to Liverpool fans, I'm happy to bet them now, they won't come within 3pts of their last year total.

In the terms of the signings themselves, I just don't believe that anyone of them have had a run in a settled side/system. Who would be surprised if Soldado returned to Spain and hit 30 goals. I wouldn't his all round game is good yet everytime he looks like he's about to get going someone else has hopped in his spot. Paulinho, only had the confidence of AVB, since then he's been only used sporadically and not approaching properly - I would not be surprised to see an orderly queue form for his signature and for him to be the next player we let go too soon. Lamela, Chadli and Capoue despite the chaos are all showing their talent now. Chadli and Capoue were great signings made at a great price. Apart from the mess that was Sherwood, Capoue has figured highly for both AVB and Poch. The problem has been finding a good partner for him at the base. Chadli, after being doubted the first season has definitely proven he's worth the £8m we paid for him. On Vlad, I just don't know - he desperately needs games. He's short and slow. But his positioning and distribution is excellent. He's had a shocker recently but I'm guessing, games would help enormously.

false,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"The specific amount a UBI would be is down to politics, but the actual mechanics of it, whether its done via a cheque in the post (figuratively), or as a negative income tax are pretty solid.

For instance, if you were to allocate £1,000 to every person (a hugely over generous figure - but it's a nice round number), you would also re-assess the income tax rates and thresholds. You could set the rate of income tax to 25% for every £1 earned (no tax-free amount). Those who earned £4,000 would be UBI neutral.

In reality you wouldn't set it at £1,000. Something more like JSA (~£250/month) and LHA (~£250/month) combined to make about £500. For £500/month to be net-neutral for the majority of tax payers, you'd have to remove the tax-free threshold and increase the rate of income tax somewhat. The treasury would still pay out the same, more-or-less, as they do now, but the perverse incentives to stay *out* of work would be removed. There's no new benefit really, you just have fewer (or none) forms to fill in.

Other thoughts could be setting the UBI at, say £500, but only giving you a percentage based on your age, with the 100% target at around the state retirement age. Maybe 50% starting point at 18, increasing 1% a year until you retire some time just before you're 70. This would actually be a reduction in welfare payments, and there could be riots in the streets.

With that said, this looks like a complete hierarchical mess waiting to happen.

* Levy, in the past, was very involved in transfer business. Does this finally completely remove him from the equation except to rubber stamp decisions made by Mitchell and Baldini? Perhaps, but I doubt it.

* Mitchell will apparently not impact the role of Baldini. But the article also says that Mitchell will also not be answerable to Baldini. These two factors surely cannot be mutually exclusive. Are we to believe that Baldini, as Technical Director, had absolutely no role in identifying talent? It was Baldini that nearly signed Tin Jedvaj and Alen Halilovic from Dinamo Zagreb. This appears to have significantly curtailed Baldini's role at the club, just one year after he was poached from Roma. I doubt he's as pleased with this hiring as the article suggests- much like how AVB who was ""very pleased"" with Baldini's appointment wasn't pleased at all, after his negative remarks about his dissatisfaction with the players we acquired under this reign.

* And how does Pochettino fit in? It's funny that the article talks about how Pochettino has been dissatisfied with Spurs' recent transfers and has identified a number of his targets, while at the same time talks about how this hiring is a good thing for Poche. When in fact, the hiring of Mitchell just puts another person in the way of Poche having the freedom to buy the players he wants.

Don't get me wrong, I think Mitchell's track record speaks for itself.

Is she wrong? It's worth pointing out that you're getting extremely wound up about the fact that women *might* get preferential treatment in a prison that *might not* ever be built. Now, the idea of such a prison isn't inherently stupid - something akin to the minimum security efforts they have over the pond - but they shouldn't only exist for one gender.

Internet radfems made noise over a shirt. Nobody else cared. But why on earth would you hear anything about this on the 6 o clock news? It's not some feminist conspiracy that nobody would give over a chunk of prime time news coverage to a bloody hypothetical prison.

&gt; The production of easily-got sweet, cheap oil from onshore and offshore fields is declining at over 6% per annum as the fields get older----and new discoveries are only being made at around one-sixth the rate of depletion of reserves.

&gt; In the past few years that decline has been counterbalanced by increasing the washing of tar sand and by 'fracking' shales----but those are very expensive methods of producing oil and can no longer grow at the rate that easy-cheap is declining.

&gt; Also the oil-exporting countries are using more of their production for themselves----so exporting oil is going to be a much smaller shipping market.

&gt; The decline in oil availability will bring efforts to substitute gas where possible and the combination will have big effects on monocrop agri-businesses that depend on gas for their inorganic fertiliser and oil for machinery, and for pesticides and herbicides production.

But to me, even better is a Walker’s pork pie from Leicester itself (yes, that was originally the same Walkers that makes the crisps! The story is that during World War 2 pork was rationed so they had a meeting to work out what they could make with their idle equipment. Apparently potatoes were not rationed at that time, and it was possible to make potato crisps, and so they diversified. Later crisp production came to utterly dwarf pork pie production.) My parents tell stories of queuing up on christmas eve to buy a pork pie for christmas day from the Leicester shop. A Walkers pie has a little more seasoning in the crust which really makes it.

You should be able to buy a Dickinson &amp; Morris Meltow Mowbray pork pies or Walkers pork pies in any large supermarket. My local Tesco (Askham Bar South of York) sells Walkers pies on the deli counter. I will be buying one for christmas.

Notice that the VAT is applied to the combined price and duty - they're levying a tax on a tax. Additionally, the last time oil prices were at $80 a barrel, petrol was just under £1/litre.

If the government were smart, they'd cut fuel duty, lowering the costs of transport, which would in turn lower the costs of acquiring goods. This would benefit businesses and people alike, with the poorest gaining the most relative to their incomes. With more disposable income/retained profits left over, the economy will see a boost as businesses invest more and consumers spend more. The tax revenue lost by a duty cut would be easily recouped with a boost in VAT, capital gains tax and corporation tax revenues that arise from a healthier economy.

Society is conditioned to see women as victims and so whenever they are to blame for their actions people try to find someone else to shift that blame onto.

This is most evident in our justice system where women are more likely to;

* have charges dropped / not filed.
* found not guilty by a jury.
* receive more lenient sentences from the judge.

We have been teachers for about 10 years, and have worked in China, Poland, France, Portugal, Iraq, and the UK.

We don't have any students that speak Mandarin yet, and I'm guessing that we won't have any in the near future either.   The reason for this is that you need to have British Council accreditation in order for students from outside the EU to study in your school.    We are planning on getting this, but you need to have at least 12 months in business before applying.

What I would suggest is getting in touch with someone from one of the universities, as the majority of the Chinese students are studying in these rather than language schools. It is just the kind of thing that they are keen to encourage, too.

There are many advocates for this as research seems to suggest that prisons in the current state are not effective for the rehabilitation of women offenders, yet seems to be better for male offenders. 

Now, there is something in that. If research suggests a certain thing, it should be discussed and considered - especially in a system where prison is set up to rehabilitate offenders. In my brief time studying offender rehabilitation it seems as though there are a few issues with the current format of prisons in the UK. 

A male prison will have hundreds of offenders, while a female one with only have a handful. some even have under 10 offenders. Even here we can see that there is a massive opportunity for socialising afforded to men and not women. The way prison inspectors and guards have described this to me is that it is as close to being in isolation (Solitary confinement) as you can get without actually being in it.

Now there are a few ways this can be tackled. You could move women offenders to a more central prison. This has its own inadequacies as you would be moving a large amount of the population away from their friends and family. In the UK we keep offenders close to where they live to ensure they have access to family for visitation. By moving women far away, you may deprive them of visitation. 

Alternatively, you could alter the way a prison works for a female offender. This is what is being discussed and researched. Prison, the way it currently stands is not effective for rehabilitating women in the same way as men.

false,Kitchner,null,null,"&gt;Is it possible to simply negotiate the better price directly with the phone provider?

As someone who has worked in the phone industry for the last 5 years, yes it is possible BUT only in certain circumstances.

You basically have to negotiate with the people on the phone. The guys in the stores usually can't offer anything that isn't standard, and the website certainly won't. If you're due for an upgrade, you'll stand a much better chance of getting good discounts.

However, that being said 3rd party retailers ALWAYS offer the best deals, the reason is thus:

Network A has a tariff for £30 per month, let's say that tariff runs for 20 months.

If Network A sells you that tariff they will make £600. However, they need to take off the cost of the phone (let's say £200) plus the cost of running the network (let's say £50). This leaves them with, for the sake of argument, £350.

If you buy from Retailer B though, the retailer will get about half of what the network earns in commission.

So the Network gets £600, but gives half of that to Retailer B. The network gives half of that to the Retailer and keeps the other half (minus the cost of running the network) for themselves. The retailer makes £300, minus the cost of the handset (£250) leaving them with £50.

Now here's why it's always cheaper, the retailer knows you wont use them unless they are cheaper. So the retailer uses half of that £50 they have left over and offers it as cashback, so you're £25 better off.

This gets even better when the network agrees to pay half of the cost of the handset (which they sometimes do) as the retailer can offer even more cash. 

So basically you're never going to get a deal cheaper from the network than from a retailer, but if you use a retailer (like you have done) you have to put up with their bullshit cashback rules.

* Grass - I never appreciated grass til I lived abroad, its soft and dense and springy.  A pleasure to run and walk on, though my 3 year old son freaked out at first.  Though Japan is green in a way Australia isn't its different, like the difference between bamboo  green and oak leaf green.  Hard to quantify.

* TV - I watch very little over here, [Veetle](http://veetle.com/index.php/listing/index/shows) and other sources but the quantity of good quality TV in the UK is good, there's almost always something watch-able on the main channels.  More than that, the radio good, there is real variety and not too much talking when you listen to music and Radio 4 is the best talk radio in the world.

* Food cost - about the same, lose on some gain on others - potatoes are cheap there but rice is cheap here.  Meat is more expensive here but quality is better.  The selection of everyday food is better here, all the different kinds of mushrooms and foods.  UK has identikit fresh produce sections at every supermarket with little variety, though there are ""world"" sections where you can buy different stuff. 

* Cars - Everyone's cars are about the same, but everyone drives really fast and aggressive in Europe and less so in the UK.  Basically the speed limits are lower here but everyone is really polite driving too and there's no rage (except in our car).  You have to prove to the police you can park your car before you're allowed to buy one.

* Cars II - the smallest car engine you get as standard is about 1300 - here they have so called K cars which can go on the motorway and you pay much less tax for them but the engines seem much smaller, they are used really often for small business white vans, I think the UK could use them.

* Development - compared to here, even in the cities I can see so much sky!  It goes forever! There are hardly any buildings over 5 stories, considering we live on the 8th of 10 in a small building.  Redevelopment here is probably even faster so maybe not a good comparison. 

* Fashion - Indeed everyone does wear the same thing in the UK, they do here too but there are many more factions here.

* Chatting - You can talk to someone, in a casual way in the UK, a barmaid, a shoe salesperson and have a real conversation back and forth and its genuinely enjoyable.  Here its get served and go away.  Plus there is some deep seated racism here where once in a while you will receive pretty short shrift, in the UK I would say you have generally lower service levels but very rarely is it aggressive or refused at all.

* Houses - are huge in the UK, we live in a 80 sq m apartment which is thought of as large round here.  Apartments/houses here are way to expensive for our meagre income.  People often have to save until they are deep into middle age to get a place of their own.  Or live a loooooong way from work.

* Old buildings - Nothing here is older than 50 years, things which weren't destroyed in the war, are destroyed by earthquakes or renewal.  Even things which don't appear that old are scrapped to be updated for new safety code.  The UK has some fantastic architecture, I miss those old red brick buildings.

false,AboveAllBeKind,null,null,"Right, long comment, in case it's useful for anyone struggling with mental health issues at the moment. 

I was diagnosed with depression back in 2004, and whilst I wasn't suicidal, I wanted to be hit by a bus to be put in a coma for a month or so, just to make it all stop for a while. Awful place to be in ('the abyss', it felt like) - and the most shocking thing was, when I opened up to a few friends about the depression, I found out that some of them had had it and been on anti-depressants, and never shared it. 

I was referred to a cognitive behavioural therapist, who did not understand CBT; she asked me questions about my lifestyle and hobbies, and when I told her I didn't smoke, didn't drink much, did yoga, ran the ladies' football at work, was on a few committees, was learning to drive and was taking an Italian GCSE night class, said 'I don't know what to tell you!' CBT, in fact, is about looking at the stories you've created about different things in your life that are causing prolonged moods (in my case, my big story was 'I'm trapped in an IT job and up to my eyeballs in debt and can't move careers and this is my life forever', as well as some story about my social life shrinking - friends leaving, just been dumped - and not being loveable enough to be in a relationship - my mood was, understandably, depressed). My sister, whose friend is a therapist, recommended the book 'Mind Over Mood' which is a CBT book - kindle version [here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RLT4?btkr=10) - it has photocopiable worksheets in it, and is fantastic. I used it, read a tonne of self-development and philosophy-type books, applied the ideas, got a promotion, saved to buy a house, quit, started a business and basically put a lot of demons to rest. I *did* later end up back at the doctor's stressed out because of work, and he said it sounded more like depression - I was all 'oh no, I've had that, back when I'd no clue how I was going to change my life, I've been making changes now, it's not that'. But then walked out of the doctor's surgery and burst into tears and went back in and took the prescription for antidepressants. I was put on a low (10mg) dose of cytalopram for a month, then 5g a month, then alternating between 5g one day, nothing next day for a month. That was all I needed - and in my case it was because I'd already worked on my thinking habits, and the drugs mopped up the 'chemical spill' left in my brain from the depression.

I'm not immune to stress but have learned how to manage it; I'm not sabotaging myself any more with unhealthy stories (especially ones about being a failure) and I trust that there'll always be help, support and info for any issue I face. This idea of recognising that our reality is shaped by the stories we tell ourselves (and others) about our lives is so simple yet so effective. I really, really recommend that book - and if your local library doesn't have it, they can order it in for you. (A client of mine found it in Waterstone's, if you like to buy locally instead of ordering of Amazon!)

Also, I use some of the ideas from CBT, positive psychology and neuroscience (on a basic level) in writings about wellbeing - am just about to upload Week 10 of a '10 Weeks to Wellbeing' series I wrote for a wellbeing column. I didn't have a very big word count (tho' I managed to get a 2-page spread some weeks), but I did try to get a lot of useful ideas into each, linking off to scientific studies, where relevant. Different themes were: taking an overall view of your life at present, your ideas about/relationship with yourself, health, hobbies &amp; learning, love life, career, family and social, community and environment and then making change stick (the one I'm about to upload - will take a while to format but be up soon). [Read the articles/linked studies here.](http://dreamdolove.com/category/wellbeing) I hope there are ideas in there of use to anyone feeling lost, because they worked for me! 

Also, as soon as I've uploaded it, I've to submit a piece on the science of sleep - lack of sleep was a big contributing factor to my depression; partly through 'rumination' (going over and over negative things in my mind during the day that meant heavy, emotional dreams instead of restorative sleep at night), partly through lifestyle. Ongoing lack of sleep can cause depression so don't neglect it! I still haven't licked the sleep habit - have gathered a load of research on it that I'm writing up today, and need to use that for myself - I'll be sharing on the same blog I linked to above for whoever's interested. One top tip is to install [flux](https://justgetflux.com) on your computer - it drains the blue light out of your display as you're approaching sundown; blue light interferes with your circadian rhythms and disrupts your sleep. Also, get as much daylight in your face as possible, for the other half of the equation! I'm in Scandinavia now and it's dark already, and my partner and I are about to order a daylight bulb for half an hour's light therapy a day - guzzling vitamin D (with folic acid for absorption) as well. Norn Irn's not a kick in the arse behind sundown, I don't think, but it feels a lot darker! Read [this guy's experiment on cutting out artificial light for a month and how it improved his sleep](http://jdmoyer.com/2010/03/04/sleep-experiment-a-month-with-no-artificial-light/). 

Finally: If things are really acute, please contact Lifeline or Samaritans. I look back on that time of my life (and the years leading up to it of having ropey self-esteem and worrying too much about what other people think) and am shocked at how bad it was and how normal it seemed. (Because we don't talk about mental health much!) But once you admit you need help and talk to people you realise how 'normal' struggling with mental health is, and learn all the ways you can improve it.

Sometimes, people are oblivious to what's going on with you, and will rally round when they finally know you need them. And even if you don't get the help and support you need from the specific people you thought would help, there'll always be other humans there for you. Kindness of strangers is a beautiful thing.

Edit: For rumination, just look out for it and notice when you're doing it, and change the mental subject when you catch yourself doing it. Thinking of a stop sign, saying stop out loud (usually when alone!), reading fiction, watching comedy, whatever. You can also 'ping' an elastic band or hair elastic around your wrist - purely from a 'distract from your mind by focusing on your body' point of view, but is absolutely not meant to be a punishment/self-harm thing. So not for everyone. Exercise is critically beneficial of course, and mindfulness meditation is amazing for mental wellbeing - I've got links to YouTube videos in those wellbeing articles and [here](http://soulambition.com/tv). I use an app called 'Mindfulness' on the iPhone (couple of quid) as well as the free YouTube vids. I know people who say mindfulness alone has changed their life, and I believe them!

In the 1970s, the quality of new buildings was shocking - badly designed, poorly spec'd, no insulation, shoddily constructed. Today, things are orders of magnitude better by every measure.
&gt; The reason you think modern buildings are ""made from cardboard"" is that they contain lots of insulation.

My experience is mostly with flats. I've lived in both custom built and building conversations and have found the same issues:

a. Often proper central heating is missing and electric convection heaters are installed, rather than radiators and actual central heating.

b. The dividing walls between flats in two cases were basically just stud walls with wire cables run through them as the sole measure which would give even an illusion of security.

c. The floors are invariably covered with extremely low quality (low cost) laminate flooring.

d. The last section of plumbing is invariably white plastic and flexible piping. If I'm honest I don't know what the life expectancy of that is, but relative to copper piping it makes me a little nervous. My personal experience is having two issues due to leaks (one of which came from the flat above and resulted in water pouring through the light socket).",0,1416233882,null,0,false,0,cm4yzon,t3_2mjhtn,t1_cm4yzon,t1_cm4vbky,null,1425983900,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Actually, these schemes are bad for consumers and good for the supermarkets in the long run.

Traditionally, the 4-6 big supermarkets all compete each others' prices down. If Tesco charge too much, they lose customers. Ideally, all the supermarkets would say to each other 'let's all raise our prices by 10%, the customers will have no option but to pay' but this is explicit collusion and that's illegal, so they don't.

They could raise their prices and just trust each other not to undercut, but that's unsustainable because sooner or later one of the supermarkets will launch a big price-cut fuck you and steal all the customers, the incentive to do so is just too great.

Price matching schemes allow the supermarkets to all raise prices without a) being illegal and b) worrying about the incentive for one supermarkets to defect. With a price matching scheme, Tesco can raise their prices and not lose customers (it won't make much extra money as it's paying you the difference.) 

However, Sainsbury's and Morrisons then also have incentive to raise prices and increase profits, they don't have to worry about losing customers as they also have price matching schemes. None of them have incentive to suddenly slash prices because the customers won't leave their favourite supermarket for a cheaper one if they're being refunded the difference anyway. Suddenly everyone's prices are higher, they're staying that way, and you're not getting that nice little refund any more as the 'cheaper elsewhere' no longer exists.

Netflix works down to very low bitrates - it is after all also intended to be used on mobile broadband.

But that's not my point - it's not as if having ""only"" 3Mbps is going to cause your internet to stop working or your computer to catch fire. Is it a great experience? No, but it has hardly comparable to an electricity supply and the two don't need to be provisioned in the same way. Especially when people want to pay the minimum for internet access (like TalkTalk's latest wheeze of £1.50 a month plus line rental) and not towards investment in making things better.

&gt; This is exactly how electricity does work, in fact. The difference is that the power distribution system is mature and designed to minimise voltage losses by doing long range transmission at higher voltage. This is analogous to FTTN/FTTC.

But you can presumably be miles from a substation in the back of beyond, and still get the same voltage as anyone else, which is not true with broadband. If you wanted to be pedantic, the high voltage transmission networks are analogous to the fibre links between exchanges and BT's core network, FTTC would be equivalent to sticking a substation in every street - which isn't what the electricity companies do",0,1416234363,null,0,1416234704,0,cm4z5qt,t3_2mjx8w,t1_cm4z5qt,t1_cm4ysrp,null,1425983821,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Our workers are increasingly less productive than our competitors even though we work longer hours. We have higher levels of personal debt, we have higher levels of public debt than almost all other western countries.
We have a massive crisis with the pensioners and baby boomers retiring and placing a humongous strain on the welfare state during an age of austerity and public spending cuts, the cuts have not even begun really. The Tories planned to make most of their austerity budget cuts *AFTER* the next election.
We already have a huge deficit and even bigger national debt, within a couple of years the debt interest payments on the national debt will reach £70-80 billion per year!  that is almost as much as the entire defence and education budget and will be added to the deficit.

The State pension currently costs around £100 billion per year, by far one of the single biggest bills in the budget, 2nd only to the NHS at around £113 billion per year. With all these oldies retiring, by 2040 that state pension bill will be £237 billion per year! and the NHS will be not far off it.
With out a massive increase in taxpayers to fund the welfare state and fund the massive numbers of retirees whom outnumber the taxpayers, we're going to see a huge changes to this country.

If I'm honest I don't know what the life expectancy of that is, but relative to copper piping it makes me a little nervous. My personal experience is having two issues due to leaks (one of which came from the flat above and resulted in water pouring through the light socket).

The white plastic piping is just as good as copper, although they have different strengths &amp; weaknessness. Plastic *looks* rubbish mainly because it's very hard to get it precisely straight, so if it's on show, it should be at least copper. On the plus side, the plastic is much quicker &amp; simpler to install, so when you need modifications or maintenance, it should be a lot quicker &amp; therefore cheaper. On the minus side, mice have been known to nibble through the plastic, so you have to keep vermin under control. They both cost about the same, and they are both very reliable.

Yes we benefit from reddit traffic. As do most sites submitted here :)

But we hope that we can add some value to this community with our news, reviews and such.

Perhaps this is a good opportunity for you guys to tell us what you want to hear about :)

who re-offended at a rate of 19.0%, and, as shown in Figure 2, both rates have remained broadly stable since 2000. Between 2000 and 2011, the proven re-offending rate for male offenders decreased by 1.0 percentage point, and, over the same period, the rate for female offenders saw a slightly larger decrease of 1.4 percentage points
