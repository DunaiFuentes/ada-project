But anyway, my point was that all our attacking mids are still growing. None of them are ""match winners"" like Lampard, Robben, Duff or Drogba. Costa could be as good as Drogs but we'll have to wait and see. Hazard and Oscar are still very inconsistent. I hope I'm wrong, but if Hazard is to have anywhere near the same impact on games then he'll have to start scoring at least 1 goal every 2 matches on average. Same goes for Oscar. Schurrle is still a little further behind those two. I am also expecting Willian to break out of his shell this season. Whether that will happen or not is still a mystery. Hence my skepticism on whether we will actually win the league. There are still way too many variable components within the team that could not work as we are hoping they might.

And a base on the North Sea would make no sense because you'd have to go around to get to the Atlantic anyway.

Historically, it was also right on the route used by Soviet subs leaving the Northern Fleet bases on the Barents Sea.",0,1408132691,null,0,false,0,cjraw5m,t3_2dis0e,t1_cjraw5m,t1_cjq57qo,null,1435256164,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Chelsea have released an official ticket exchange on the website, where you can purchase a seat from a season ticket member or normal member who can't attend the game. You pay face value for the ticket, and you collect it from the ticket office before the game. I paid £47 for a ticket in MHL yesterday. 

http://www.chelseafc.com/tickets-membership/general-ticket-info/the-ticket-exchange.html

Don't get ripped off mate, and make sure you get a ticket. This is the safest and cheapest way of purchasing one-off tickets. Enjoy. Any questions, feel free to ask.

First of all, the headline unemployment rate has *always* been based on the Labour Force Survey; this is *required* by the EU and is recognized by the ILO. It isn't some Tory plot to ""massage"" the figures - that's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. How on earth did he think it was determined before? Secondly, 41,000 is an *extremely large* sample size and is sufficient to give an estimate of the unemployment rate that we can say, with 95% certainty, is the ""true"" (population) value, plus or minus 2 percentage points. This is assuming the sample is random, which it is (it's a random sample of the Postcode Address File); here is the [methodology](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/labour-market/quality-and-methodology-information-for-the-labour-force-survey--lfs-.pdf).

The Welsh *tywysog* literally means ""leader"", from the verb *tywys* ""to lead"". 

The adoption of the title Prince / Tywysog by certain native rulers of Wales in the Middle Ages did not reflect a reduction in status but an elevation; Wales was glutted with kings at the time, so much so that the title had become devalued. The use of the title ""prince"" was an attempt to set themselves apart from the other native Welsh rulers and establish their claims to overlordship over all (or a significant part) of Wales.

We have too many players. We have BAE earning lots without playing a game, have done nothing with Naughton except keep him on but giving him less time to play, Dawson has been in the corridor of uncertainty as to what is happening; he should either have been sold ruthlessly or kept.

Still paying Friedal tons and now he won't even be playing. 

As to wingers, we have Lennon, Chadli, Townsend, Lamela. Lamela is finally looking alright, but we still only have one left wing and they are top half quality at best. We are left with two young players who need games and Lennon, who isn't up to scratch.

But the real clusterfuck is the centre mid where we have twice as many as we need but are planning to spend another 20 mill on another. Sandro sounds like he is leaving for well below his value, we have far too many of all the same quality and some are just going to be expensive benchwarmers. The result is that our two hyped up youngsters have no chance of getting a game but hey, can't loan em out...

As to strikers, Kane might have a name which is useful for writing headlines but he has never shown himself to be anything other than a mediocre premier league player and rather than getting the game time to improve he is going to be our third choice for another year. Adebayor is expensive and inferior to any of the first choice strikers for the rest of the top 6. Soldado has not shown himself to be anything other than a dud and hoping he comes good is nice and all, but it isn't really a strategy.

So, who do we buy? A new backup goalie! Yay! He's also old and expensive but why pay for one when we can pay for 2! Then a random American who isn't even arriving till January. Yay! He misses the time when we have lost our first choice right back!

That leaves us with Davies. A replacement as good as the guy we have, costing ten million. At the risk of sounding like a cynic, I have little faith he will turn into the next bale considering the people who owned him were willing to trade him for Siggy who was older and not champions league quality.

We need a striker incase Kane turns out to be shit, Ade goes on a pouting spree and Soldado continues his Torres impression. We need a left wing to replace Bale. We need to reduce our wage budget.

I ended up with one of those telematics insurance deals, which has cost me 1.7k per annum, which isn't terrible in comparison, but still. I think this whole story about ""young drivers being such a high risk etc. etc."" is mostly bullshit. I don't believe that they (or we) are costing anywhere near as much money as they are charging us, and for example my policy is rigged with extra fees based purely on my age which is just plain bullshit.

In terms of the gender difference, yeah there used to be a difference based on gender but some law brought by the EU abolished it.  
  
The point is: I appreciate that being inexperienced brings higher risks, thus higher costs to the insurer, so a 20 year old will pay more than a 25 year old, but the differences in premiums are beyond ridiculous.

true,Joe56780,lfc68,,"It depends what tier of players you are comparing him to, the only thing he needs is another 20 goal season to be rated among top end players (even though he has been consistent since day 1 for us) but that goes for everyone, important goals while being 20+ to be rated world class.  

By tiers I mean something like this:

Suarez

World Class: Falcao, Cavani?, Ibra, RvP

Top, top players: Aguero,  Rooney 

Top players: Benzema

Top young forwards (which Chelsea totally didn't need): Lukaku, Sturridge (24 but being played as a winger has stalled his recognition as a Striker)

Something like that? I reckon most fans would rate him a top Striker but moving him among the top of the world game he'll need one more season of 20+ goals without Suarez to be put there and RvP-esque stats (18,30,26 goals over 3 seasons) to be a worldie.

http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=437n

It's pretty much right in the middle of 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3, hence the mixed views. The key being Henderson, whose work rate and constant pressing make sense for him to play in a deeper midfield role, but techicality and desire for forward runs to play wide forward; But really, he was both. Sterling, conversely, played both wide forward/ drifting into striker because of his pace and slightly better finishing touch. Coutinho played a 10 essentially, but perhaps just sitting slightly right ways, because it allows for a better channel for diagonal through balls to Sterling(3rd goal BvB game), yet also wide of defensive midfielders so that he can play a more square through ball through a high-lined defense to a pacey run from Sturridge in behind defenses (1st goal BvB). Lastly, Can is deeper than Hendo, which explains why the Can/Johnson overlap happened with more frequency than a Sterling/Johnson overlap, and also allowed Emre to help Johnson out defensively so he could make his inevitable solo runs forward. Can's positioning helped Stevie play slightly right-sided as well to allow him to play more on his favored foot and to provide space for his long diagonal balls to Sterling and through balls to a more forward placed Henderson. Lastly, This allowed Manquillo to show off his pace straight off the bat, as his overlaps with Hendo allowed him to get forward, yet he also put in a strong defensive shift so Stevie wasn't left to constantly cover him (hence that gif of Stevie yelling out ""Get in! Make the tackle!"" on Manquillos great slide tackle from a recovering run"".)

Sherwood was a breath of fresh air relative to the situation we were in under AVB. Life wasn't perfect, and I'm glad we have Poch now, but people saying Sherwood is a bad coach are frankly talking shit. 

He's served this club for a long time, and was able to do great things with our youth team. He took a step up, he won a lot of games. Sure, he subjected us to some terrible results, nothing we haven't seen before under previous managers, and with the competition in the prem being as it is it will happen again. 

The football we played under Tim was fairly good, the humour and the gilets related banter he provided us with were funny whilst they lasted.

I get the impression that most people here wanted him gone, fine. But do respect what he did for this club over the years, and what he did when he was in charge. The way some people talk about him here you'd think he got us relegated, when the reality is he delivered us to more or less the same position we've been in for the last few seasons.

I also have an extended cousin, Peter Skapetis, who has recently transfered to the dark side in Mark Hughe's Stoke. 

What i love about following the R's is that i am in a country full of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal supporters who have to justify why they aren't a bandwagonners, but when they ask me, they just think i am crazy when i tell them i follow QPR, the best team known to man.

I'm also in my final year of High School.

They covered how objects are layed out in memory? And stuff like the difference between static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, packing, differences between addressing modes on different architectures, etc?

Cos that would be a really big turnaround from completely ignoring the mechanics of languages.

What about type theory, did they do any of the foundational stuff like bottom, top, unit types etc? Or did they just teach about subtype polymorphism? How about parametric polymorphism, duck typing, type inference, ADTs, destructuring etc. Was there any mention of the typed or untyped llambda calculus beyond ""it's equivalent to a turing machine""?

What about memory management strategies, manual vs automatic, RC vs GC implemented as RC + cycle detection vs Conservative GC versus Precise GCs?

What about optimisation strategies so that you can reason about code performance characteristics. Things like constant propagation, function inlining, loop vectorisation, TCO, stuff that can have a dramatic effect on your code...

There's so much utterly foundational stuff like I listed above that is absolutely necessary to be able to reason scientifically about even trivial programs... And they just left it all out of the course I did.

Edit: I remember the one that really pissed me off: There was never any mention of the differences between stack and heap allocation... I mean seriously.

Also, absolutely _nothing_ about how actual computers are implemented these days. We got taught the largely useless 
idea that a computer is a machine with a cpu that read instructions from memory and executed 1 by one in sequence. And taught that memory is a single large, shared, uniformly addressable, array of bytes. Which is all obviously a lie...

CPUs don't execute your instructions one at a time, they don't execute them in order, memory isn't a single large block, accessing one location certainly isn't guaranteed to take the same length of time as accessing another address (it may even take several orders of magnitude more time to access a RAM location and that's before we get into.swapping...).

true,rosaspinanglica,null,null,"If your friend can bear it he needs to start keeping a diary of all the incidences of noise.  This sort of written record is accepted as evidence as long as he doesn't exaggerate or embellish it in an easily disproven way.
The local authority (council) has a statutory duty to investigate complaints of noise and other nuisance, they often have a team working over night that will drop by at short notice or arrangement to witness noise for themselves.  I'm also wondering if your friend has any other 'official' visitors, district nurse, key worker etc who might be willing to write a letter corroborating what your he is saying.
How obvious is the drug dealing/taking?  If, for instance the hallway reeks of weed your friend could call the police and say that and that he believes they are dealing, he doesn't have to give his name.  Even if the police don't come out every time they have to log every call/complaint and higher officers will eventually escalate it - perhaps to a satisfying, dawn door down kicking raid! If they are done for dealing they may well lose their tenancy automatically (my council social housing has this policy) it is certainly evidence of antisocial behaviour.  Does the Housing association have a website?  Check on their codes of practice on how to deal with antisocial behaviour and support vulnerable tenants, it sounds like they would be failing on both of those and it should be pointed out to them.
Lastly and probably most important, if you are worried that your friend might be suicidal or close to it please ask him about it.  It is a fallacy that asking a depressed person if they feel suicidal precipitates suicidal behaviour.  It is often a relief for them to be able to express how they are feeling to someone supportive and non judgmental, they may also be able to put your mind at rest that they don't feel like that at all.

true,bottomlines,null,null,"&gt;In light of recent developments

Nope. Things are not new, or suddenly worse for YOU. Every generation of young people has had a difficult time in one way or another. There has always been some challenges. But right now, in 2014, things are better than they have EVER been. 

&gt;I for example am just about to turn 21,live in Northern part of England. I'm in the middle of stem degree in a mediocre university. 

What's bad about that? You're 21. Just a kid really (sorry). You're living in one of the cheapest parts of the UK, you're doing a degree and you have some job prospects. That already puts you ahead of a large % who don't have a degree, or they live down south where prices are 50-200% higher.

You're 21. You've maybe worked 1-2 years maximum. So far, you have been nothing but a drain and consumer of resources, sucking up free education, free healthcare and now you've even taken a loan for your degree. And that's fine - every young person is in the same situation. But instead of moaning, try to consider how lucky you are.

&gt;I'm currently terrified of the future

To some degree, so is everybody. Nobody KNOWS what is going to happen, and even well-laid plans can be turned upside down by problems with family, health or legal problems that you have no control over. But again, instead of feeling all down about it, consider how lucky you are. You're in the UK - one of the best countries in the entire world. There's really nowhere you could have been born where you'd be significantly better off.

&gt;I'm scared of getting financially ruined by my young drivers car insurance policy. 

Yeah, it's expensive, but it gets cheaper. Instead of worrying and getting all worked up about the ""injustice"" of it all, just soldier on, get a shit car and insure it as cheaply as possible like every other 21yr old. 

It won't financially ""ruin"" you, and in the scheme of your life a couple grand of insurance in your early 20's will have absolutely no effect on anything, I guarantee.

&gt;I shouldn't have to worry about not being able to afford medical care.

You don't have to. This is a completely ridiculous and unnecessary worry to have. The NHS will always be free at the point of use. And if you do happen to be poor, unemployed or whatever, there are 100's of exemptions from things you do pay towards like prescription fee charges too.

&gt;but being just a little bit younger doesn't justify the harshness of the living costs

But what do you expect? Like I said - you're young and you've done nothing but take for at least 18 years. You've consumed £100,000's of education, healthcare and resources. You have no meaningful work experience and very few skills. Why SHOULD you be paid as much as an older person?

&gt;people with whom I work generally don't care and are completely passive about anything that has happened

Good. You should do what they do. Just deal with it, keep working and things get better.

&gt;or is about to happen which I believe is a big problem

As the current top post says, get a grip. And seriously, stop reading the Guardian and all this depressing bullshit. I'm not even joking. It seems like you are primarily worried about fucking pointless stuff like not being able to afford healthcare. That is retarded.

The Guardian are pandering to people like you. Their target demographic is left wing uni students and recent graduates, and they do nothing but constantly moan about how bad it is. I'm 10 years older than you, and things are fine. As you work, things get better.

So basically, stop worrying, stop being entitled and start considering how lucky you are and thinking how to take advantage of your privileged position.",1,1408153004,null,0,false,0,cjrk84p,t3_2do3jo,t1_cjrk84p,t3_2do3jo,null,1435260766,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

It's small but it's a quiet area, walking distance to QUB and town and within budget.


Areas: Avoid the donegall road area. Houses are dirt cheap for a reason. 
Botanic/ Stranmillis is student central. Convenient location but noisier and lower quality accomadation.
Ravenhill road is quieter whilst still walking distance to uni and town.


Honestly if you only have £400 max and need to have internet thrown in then you will be needing shared accomadation. I'd say find a houseshare with a working professional or post grad and avoid the obvious student areas.  2 people sharing can easily get a nice house, in a nice location.

With mail-order, and for the last 10 years or so IIRC, it's their responsibility to either collect the item or at least (with your agreement) to pay for you to post it back.

Small claims court is much cheaper and easier than you may realise and probably covers this (depending on the price of the laptop) - once a retailer believes you're willing to take them to small claims, they'll almost certainly change their story.

In case I've got some details confused, though, [check the citizens advice page on consumer rights](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/consumer_e.htm) - in particular [faulty goods - if you want your money back](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/consumer_e/consumer_common_problems_with_products_e/consumer_what_you_can_do_about_faulty_goods_e/faulty_goods_-_if_you_want_your_money_back.htm).

The bit about ""accepting the goods"" is an example of why it's important to know something about your consumer rights. If you're clear however that the main delay after the fault developed was due to the retailer lying to you, I imagine you should be OK.

Do you even watch the show?

 &gt;   I'm sure a lot of the female fans would appreciate at least one regeneration being dedicated to a Female Doctor.

I think you'd be shocked at how many people (men and ***women***) relate to the Doctor as a father figure, often in place of an absent or abusive one. They look to him to teach them lessons their own father's never did.  That would be lost if the Doctor ever regenerated as a woman. It's not the kind of thing ""you just give a try."" Too many people are too invested in this aspect of the character.

&gt; My idea for the list was to compile things that people think might happen at some point in the future of the show and would be pleasantly surprised if and when they finally did. 

A female Doctor would not be a pleasant surprise for many who watch the show for the reason I have given.

Edit: Generally speaking, anything that messes with the Doctor's identity, beyond normal character growth, is a really bad idea.

Edit 2:  A strong female partner for the Doctor would be a welcome edition.  Clara seems to be growing into that role.

I like trees and recognise the importance of preserving the countryside, but I also like progress.  If it's a question of preserving a 200 year old wood or building a new high speed rail link that will benefit people for the next 200 years then I'm all for calling Eugene in with his axe (while also stipulating that new woodland areas should be created to replace any that are cut down).

History is important but we must also look forward to the future.

Obviously I hope they don't decide to build a rail link through my back yard.  But I like to think that if they did, I would be able to see past my own self-interest and see the benefit to the whole country and not just my little corner of the countryside.

&gt;Aussie who has been following the issues here, I lived in the UK for a while. I'll put the case against our bright-eyed wee OP of the SNP.

&gt;The first and deepest mark against Scotish independents is that they don't have the balls to say they will have their own currency. It's just ridiculous to see them say they will continue using the pound and at the same time as having quite a large financial industry. Although it's not big by London standards it's still reasonably sized and they will presumably try to promote it against London with tax and regulatory incentives like Ireland has done. What happens if one of those banks goes bust and Scotland needs a bailout but doesn't control their own currency? What if the economy needs stimulus? Salmond and the rest will continue to blame things on London if they keep the pound. It's so weak and obvious it makes me want to slap that trout-faced bastard. He's like Joe Hockey, a jolly fat man with a pretend competence that melts away the minute he opens his mouth. He's just briming with confidence, except he isn't confident enough to have his own money. Can you imagine, an independence movement afraid to have their own currency! Some independence. Here in Australia we regulate the banks, better than the US, the UK or EU I might add, but we also run our own currency. We run both and we take responsibility for both. Salmond is really just saying he doesn't have the mental capacity to run a real country. And the way he stamps his feet threatening this and that if he doesn't get his way. What a complete farce.

&gt;The second mark against the Scotish independents is that they are completely delusional about the power they will have in the European Union. The EU is moving to majority rule on a lot of things, and plans to do so in the future on almost everything. Scotland will have no say in all this, Germany takes shits bigger than Scotland. What kind of independence is that? The days of small states playing the game carefully and getting a lot of kickbacks are over. Most EU policy is set in by technocrats and lobbyists in Berlin, Brussels or Paris. The idea that removing some ""malign influence of London"" will lead to some glorious Scottish renewal is complete bullshit, they will be governed like a colony from Brussels.

&gt;London is just a rubber stamp on a lot of things anyway, more than half of their legislation comes as non-negotiable directives from Brussels. With ""independence"" those directives will just land on Salmond's desk, but they'll remain just as non-negotiable. This cannot be compared in any way to our foreign policy connection to the USA, this is almost every policy area from employment to the sizes and shapes of the vegetables the SNP have stuck up their butts. So again it's an ""independence"" movement proposing to get most of their legislation from somewhere else, an independence movement to be ruled by fiat from outside the country. Why is it Australia can govern itself and make it's own laws but poor old Salmond can't and needs to have everything sent in from Brussels? Some independence.

&gt;The Scots have devolution anyway, what comes from London, that isn't really from Brussels, is mainly the money and foreign policy. The money they propose to keep and last year I saw someone crowing about sharing embassies with the UK. An independence movement without its own money sharing embassies with the UK. What exactly will be different? Some tartan cringe ceremonies? Airforce one jet for Salmond to prance about on the world stage? And they are proposing to kick the British naval bases out, and yet assume they can unilaterally use British money and British facilities around the world after they leave. The nerve of this kind of talk is incredible and if it pisses me off just hearing about it I can only imagine it's building up severe resentment outside of Scotland in the UK. We share embassies with Canada in some cases but we came to a mutually beneficial agreement, we didn't just prance up to them and say ""we're using your embassies now"".

&gt;This is no independence movement, it's based largely on resentment. Listening to Scots nationalists talking about the English is terrible. If you think the New Zealanders have a chip on their shoulder regarding how superior Australia is to New Zealand in every way then just listen to a SNP true believer talk about England, which isn't superior to Scotland in every way. And the sad thing is that many Scots don't buy into this hatred and will be torn apart from their UK bretheren by the forces of hatred in the SNP.

&gt;Salmond is a conman, a Joe Hockey with a worn out VHS of Braveheart. I feel kind of sorry for Scots nationalists, but if they want to be taken seriously they will have to harden up and propose a real country with real money and real sovereignty, not a tartan theme park tax haven with a long list of other people to blame if anything goes wrong.

&gt; I think this whole story about ""young drivers being such a high risk etc. etc."" is mostly bullshit. I don't believe that they (or we) are costing anywhere near as 

That'll be from your years of extensive experience as an actuary then? Here are some facts,

&gt;The single biggest cause of accidental death of young people aged 15-24 is road accident.

&gt;40% of 17 year old males have an accident in their first six months of driving.

&gt;One in eight drivers is under 25, but they account for a third of people who die on UK roads.

&gt;18-year-old driver is three times more likely to be involved in a crash than a 48 year-old driver.

&gt;The average claim size for a male driver aged 17-19 is £4,473, compared with £1,450 for a man aged 30-50.

Young drivers crash cars more often and have bigger claims, so they get charged more for insurance, it's not rocket science. If anything else happened then older drivers would be getting shafted.

&gt;The point that I'm really trying to make is the fact that car insurance is overpriced in general. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that they are running an oligopoly.

This is coming from your years of experience working as an industry regulator I assume? I know a lot of actuaries and insurance underwriters and you know what, the margins on car insurance are paper thin, most I know won't touch it because it's boring and you can't make any money, competition is insane there are least 10 providers out there.

Your just throwing words around with no evidence or understanding because your 'don't think it's fair', as others have said, get a grip.

Trying to move is often the easier answer. Record *every* single incident, complain each time to the council, police and housing association.

I think this is a case where you have to ask exactly the right questions - worded in exactly the right way - to get any further forward.

The HA isn't going to volunteer information for how to compile appropriate evidence - or for that matter what constitutes adequate evidence - for a number of reasons:

 - It could be seen as them helping get this problem tenant evicted. Which might cause a problem for the people who deal with them further down the line.
 - It'll force them to deal with the problem rather than pretend it doesn't exist.

Personally, I wouldn't let the conversation end with ""that's not enough evidence"". I would explicitly start asking the difficult questions like ""So what would be enough evidence?"", ""What form would the evidence take?"" - and if they won't be specific, your friend has to be with suggestions like ""Would keeping a diary be adequate?"".  

Once they start answering these, you push the conversation forward with ""Okay, so if I were to present a diary/a sound recording/a video - would that be sufficient to instigate proceedings?"". If the answer to this is ""No"", ask what would be sufficient and when told, repeat the previous ""so that would be sufficient?"" question. Repeat this until you get a ""Yes"".


I wonder if it'd help if a meeting could be arranged between your friend and a HA rep at their place - and ensure that you are there when the HA arrive. When they arrive, your friend explicitly involves you in the discussion - simply saying something like ""This is my friend Stamido, s/he's been helping me deal with this issue and will be joining us in this discussion."" .

Note that this is not worded as a question, as in 'can Stamido join in?', it's worded as a statement: 'Stamido is joining in'.

Never before has the British people been so torn over an issue, which never seemed like a real issue in the first place and rather a target of vainglorious ambition rather than dealing with the extant political reality, which is that policies change the quality of living, not political earthquakes and uprooting the status quo.

Hopefully this campaign and Alex Salmond will fade into British political history as the mere anecdotes they really are.

Variable rates are quite a bit lower at the moment, but as noted elsewhere you can get about 1.5% ([Nationwide](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/instant-isa-saver/features-and-benefits) and the [West Bromwich Building Society] (http://www.westbrom.co.uk/savings/online/websaver-isa) also have products at this rate). It's likely that rates will rise next year, but you should bear in mind that there's no guarantee that the rate on your account will go up by the same amount as Base Rate does - each bank/building society will make their own decision about how much of the rate rise to pass on.

true,TheJediJew,lfc12,,"One thing that is often overlooked when it comes to transfer spending is amortisation.

A quick summary of amortisation for those who don't know: At the start of a contract a player is worth the money that was paid to acquire them. At the end of the contract that same player is worth nothing and can leave on a free transfer. In between that change in value has to be written off as a fixed percentage for every year of their contract - 25% per year on a 5 year contract for example.

Suarez started at a value of 22.8m on a five and a half year contract. That means we wrote off 4.15m in value per year in addition to his transfer fee and wages. 

After one and a half years he signed a new contract with his value now at 16.6m. This value would then be written off over the course of his new contract. Unfortunately the length of neither this contract or his final one were released. We can expect his value at the point of sale to be around half what we originally paid however - 11.4m. If this is true we would have been writing off around 2.85m per year for Suarez (assuming a 4 year contract).

We then sold him for 75m and a book profit of around 63.6m. And brought in 100m worth of talent to replace him. This 100m now has to be amortised over the course of their contracts. That's 25m a year assuming four year contracts for all of the players in addition to their transfer fees and wages.

Our net spend may have been 20m, but our annual costs will have risen by around 22m as well. 

I still think the business we've done is very good, but it's not as straightforward financially as just net spend and wages. 

Incidentally academy players also carry either zero amortisation or very little which explains why we are so keen to get our production line going.",0,1408182524,null,0,false,0,cjrt1sj,t3_2dpk2q,t1_cjrt1sj,t3_2dpk2q,null,1435264814,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Well it's not bullshit, it's risk based pricing.

You might not be a bad driver and you might not know any your age that are, but there are sufficient numbers out there that are a danger not only to themselves but to every other road user and that's what pushes prices up.

&gt; They seriously pull those numbers out of their arse in my opinion. I didn't do any calculations, I could be wrong

No they didn't pull them out of their arse and yes you are wrong - there are legions of actuaries, statisticians and risk analysts that can prove these facts.

Put it this way - if it was all a scam then it would only take just one new entrant to underprice and steal all the business, causing the whole house of cards to collapse. The fact that it hasn't happened strongly implies that new and younger drivers really are a risk and that their premiums really are priced accordingly.

Have you looked into shared homeownership? That should be easier than going it alone and help you build some capital. Don't borrow too much on a mortgage that you'll be living in poverty, do it so you can still go out once a month, buy a game once a month etc. otherwise you'll be miserable. 

Even if that means a longer term on your mortgage, although you'll pay more for the money in the long run if you do the full term, you can always remortgage or do what we're planning to do and over pay on the mortgage in a year or so when we have more money available to us again to bring down the length of the term.

Is little old Scotland with 10% of the population really going to cause the UK such massive unrest and fall from the world stage. How would a UK-sans Scotland be a bonus for  ""not friends of freedom""

I had no idea Scotland is threatening world peace.

If independence gives such a boost for evil forces, shouldn't Australia be incorporated into a Greater United Kingdom? 

At the end of the day, Scots should be voting for what is best for them, not for the interests of other countries.

It's fair enough if you're actually Christian, but if a lot of people who aren't still choose that option it paints a false picture of what the UK is really like. i.e. to the government we look like a more religious country which could impact some of the decisions that are made.

There seems to be a move to dehumanise prisoners by the mainstay of the press and by a huge chunk of population.

We must prove we're better than them. Hating on them blindly and violating their rights just feeds into their ideology of being persecuted and under attack, and gives ammunition to their argument that the West talks big on human rights but is truly hypocritical.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"kinda a dubious article, there are legitimate reasons such things might be asked especially if they're linked to other enquiries or studies - the dragon attack for example might be a loon scared of dragons or it might be someone that's got a legitimate reason to believe someone in Wigan Council is doing one of the most common forms of corruption at local council level paying themselves to spend time on their hobby; maybe someone might have been using local council money to purchase books on defending against dragons or some such nonsense, maybe the person who filed this request was interesting in proving this book could not be for official use... or maybe they were looking for another common form of corruption and one which is probably what the pet possession person was worried about, people using tax money to pay for pointless services which they supply...   
  
also despite what the text of the article says the request was for 
  
&gt;How many times has the council paid for the services of an exorcist, psychic or religious healer? Were the services performed on an adult, child, pet or building? (Rossendale Council)  
  
which basically means 'are you wasting money on scams?' 
  
while questions like 'How many bodies are there in mortuaries that have been unclaimed for 10 years?' could very well relate to comments some idiot has made, maybe a budding Borris Johnson is trying to push through some nonsense on the basis that the morgues are full of unclaimed bodies that've been over a decade - maybe someone is simply trying to prove if this is or isn't the case.  
  
&gt;How many people in the town have a licence to keep a tiger, lion, leopard, lynx or panther as a pet?  
  
this could be a local business doing market research which is actually one of the things the information request system was set up to facilitate or it could be an animal rights group keen to expose the rare-breed menageries of Scarborough but it's most likely because they're working on a story detailing the [black cat sightings in Scalby Mills](http://bigcatsatlarge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/black-panther-sighting-scarborough-area.html)  
  
and the how many Southend care home kids have been microchiped is a very good question, the town did talk about microchipping the elderly for example - the person sending that request was most likely working on a book about the surveillance state, possibly this one http://www.amazon.com/The-Road-Southend-Pier-surveillance/dp/1905641443  
  
There is not a single thing on that list that does have a plausable reason which would make it a compelling question - these might all be from nutters but they might not be, if they're even considering suggesting for a second that they should be allowed to throw out requests they deem as 'silly' then they can fuck right off.

true,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"I think it's fair to say that British politics is suffering in places, sure. While a complete overhaul is unlikely (and probably unnecessary) we could go some ways to patching it up. The key factor for me is transparency. MPs rarely declare a conflict of interest.

Working within the pharmaceutical industry I read a lot of scientific papers. It's commonplace to read one paper that says, oh I dunno: ""Daily Mail causes cancer and fall in house prices"" and then a minute later pubmed shows up with ""Daily Mail **cures** cancer and raises house prices"". The point is at the bottom of the page one study will say ""the authors recieved a grant from GMG"" and the other will say ""kind donations from Lord Rothermere..."" You get my point.

So let's say somebody in Defra says that they aren't going to ban neonicotinoid pesticides. Why, when all the evidence suggests they're really bad? To answer that you need to find out who they've been talking to, and lo! Monsanto happen to have made a donation to the party. But such information is rarely made available, even when the MP in question is clearly not acting in the best interests of the environment or the farming industry.

So transparency is the answer. The sort of thing that makes it clear who's lobbying whom. Who is claiming expenses for what? Who had lunch with which party donor? What has the whip been telling the party MPs?

It wouldn't fix everything, but it would clear up a lot of the dirty politics that we've been subjected to.

I'd also contest whether this guy would be a proper prisoner of war anyway. I'm not an expert in international law but ISIS aren't a ""real"" organisation, and they aren't representing any state. Nor do they seem to be following any sort of war conventions themselves by executing civilians left, right and centre.

Consider what the US did to Bin Laden. They executed him, dumped his body in the sea and stopped talking about it. If they had put him on trial, they'd spread his message to people who were open to hearing it. If they buried him properly, they'd make him some sort of martyr.

In the grand scheme of things, independence is non sensical. The world is getting smaller and the players bigger. People already question the influence that the UK has these days - do independence advocates actually think Scotland can be an influential player on the current international stage?

hmmmm. That sounds like an incredibly arrogant opinion.

I think it's for each society to decide their own laws and requirements.

I'm not saying we should have absolute democracy or rule of the majority. But after all, the whole police/court/defence/prison/appeal etc service is designed to protect the general public from criminals, to punish them and to remove them from society. We even have a jury so that you are tried by your peers. Thus, the system is there to serve the general public, so if you had 99% support for something (which would be pretty much unprecedented for any debate ever), I think it would be shocking to NOT introduce it when the demand is that strong.

IMO, there is no such thing as absolute ethics. If the general public in country A are strong supporters of the death penalty, they should be able to have it. And if the public in country B find it abhorrent, they should be allowed to get rid of the death penalty. If someone said 99% of the country supported gay marriage, I assume you wouldn't like the government to say ""nah, because two dudes bopping each other conflicts with our ethical beliefs""",1,1408188615,null,0,false,0,cjru1vb,t3_2dpld9,t1_cjru1vb,t1_cjrttcj,null,1435265286,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

It requires the acquiescence of another partner, and is therefore something to be thrashed out on the negotiating table.

The founding of Israel was a mistake. The Balfour declaration in 1918 was made when only 8% of the population of Mandatory Palestine was Jewish. Later, before Israel was founded and the Jewish population had risen through immigration to almost reach parity, the area was still relatively free of ethnic and religious tension, conflict being mostly directed at the British administration. The infantile desire for an ethnically and religiously pure, exclusive Jewish state, which is inescapably what Israel was founded to be, is the ultimate problem. If Israel starts treating Palestinians like human beings instead of slaughtering civilians in the thousands, including children, progress could finally be made. They could start by ending the blockade and delivering aid to the Palestinians.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"**Up &amp; Coming**: *Can*: I think little was expected of him upon his signing but I expect him to surprise people and have a very effective season.

**Underdog**: *Enrique*: Even with the Moreno signing I think Enrique will have a role to play this year and will do well. Lucas was my other choice here.

**Goalscorer**: *Sturridge*.

**Assists**: *Coutinho or Stevie*. Probably *Coutinho* though. I expect a breakout season from him where he raises game to a different level and becomes a Brazil regular. 10 goals, 15 assists should be his aim.

**Underperformer**: *Mignolet or Lambert* though hopefully neither. Mignolet is a bit overrated on this sub. Yes he made many great saves last year but he also made far too many individual errors costing us goals, his distribution is still as bad as ever and he still looks uncomfortable leaving his 6 yd box. I am backing him to improve his all round game and have a much better season but if he doesn't improve I'm certain we will be signing a new GK next summer.

Lambert is past his peak, has looked over-awed, off the pace and sloppy in pre-season and is an obvious candidate for a (albeit cheap) flop. I will reserve judgement until he's played a few comp games for us though. His poor play may be down to nerves at lining up for his boyhood club. All we want is for him to be an impact sub and a solid performer in his limited starts. That's not too much to ask of a guy as experienced as he.

Again, so what? She's had one now, hasn't she. She's clearly a danger to others.

*She has a psychiatric condition:* 

I'll give you that in terms of a possible negating factor, but perhaps she would be better off in a secure mental facility in that case. She's still clearly dangerous - protecting the public should come before being PC about mental issues that make people violent.

The fact is, this is incident number 18, and it was clearly a vicious attack using a weapon. It should have been tried as attempted murder in my view (but then the verdict would no doubt have been not guilty so there is clearly a reason for being tried for assault). She should have had a custodial sentence at the very least. You don't just go around assaulting people and remain a free member of society.

It's strange to think perhaps the only thing that Indian, Bengali and Pakistani historians can agree on, is how poorly the British drew the border and decided on the timing of announcing that border (two days after each nation had gained independence IIRC). The huge haste of trying to get onto the right side of the border in hugely populated, diverse and now divided provinces such as Punjab and Bengal lead to millions of death. This was furthered by the British already withdrawing from the subcontinent, given India and Pakistan were now independent but strangely without a border, so the whole process basically occurred  unpoliced. There were 10+ million bodies suddenly transferring between the two nations, in regions where tribal and religious tensions were already huge and what followed was probably one of the darkest chapters in South Asian history.

I'm not saying the British were totally to blame, the violence itself was caused by tribal and religious fractions already present in that region, but to exonerate us is equally stupid.

A few quick points to get started - I'm sure others will add more:


*Manager*

- Jose Mourinho, the manager, is one of the more colourful characters in the league. Revered at Chelsea for the success he brought us in the three seasons he was previously here (2004/5, 5/6, 6/7) where we won two Premier League titles, two league cups and the FA cup. Known for his tactical prowess and off-pitch mind games.

*Rivals:* 

Well, the biggest rivalry would be with Tottenham Hotspur (""Spurs""). A North London club who typically finish 5th or 6th in the league. They did finish 4th in 2012, which would usually qualify them for the Champions League (the biggest club competition), but Chelsea won the CL trophy in 2012, thereby denying them a place.

Arsenal (another London club) are also major rivals, and there is little love lost between Jose Mourinho and the Arsenal manager - Arsene Wenger. Watch out for the two managers sniping at each other with snide comments throughout the season.


*Legendary players:*

- John Terry, central defender. Has been with the club since his early teens. Has been one of the best central defenders in the world for over a decade, but at 33 there are concerns how much longer he can go on for. Chelsea through to the core, and our current captain.

- Didier Drogba, centre-forward (""striker""). One of Mourinho's first buys when he came to Chelsea in 2004, and arguably Chelsea's most legendary striker. Consistent scorer for 8 seasons. Scored the winning goal in the 2012 Champions League final vs Bayern Munich, and also the winning penalty in the resulting shootout. Left Chelsea after the CL final, and returned this year at the age of 36 as a backup striker.

- Frank Lampard, midfielder. Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, highly intelligent and articulate, amazing at strikes from outside the penalty area. Has been a mainstay of the Chelsea squad since 2001, until he left Chelsea at the end of last season at the age of 36.

The current 'star' player is probably Hazard (who it seems you're already familiar with!). New players to watch out for would be Diego Costa - a highly promising striker bought this summer from Atletico Madrid, a Cesc Fabregas - a former Arsenal midfield player bought this summer from Barcelona.


Finally, I suppose I should mention Fernando Torres. A former Liverpool striker, and one of the best players in the world for several seasons at Liverpool, he was bought for a club record £50m (about $80m) at the end of 2011, and has been a gigantic flop at Chelsea. Difficult to sell due to his high wages, he's something of a controversial presence in the squad.

[The truth is there is a lot to criticise the British for when it came to the India/Pakistan divide, and which helped lead to the death of millions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Line).

It's strange to think perhaps the only thing that Indian, Bengali and Pakistani historians can agree on, is how poorly the British drew the border and decided on the timing of announcing that border (two days after each nation had gained independence IIRC). The huge haste of trying to get onto the right side of the border in hugely populated, diverse and now divided provinces such as Punjab and Bengal lead to millions of death. This was furthered by the British already withdrawing from the subcontinent, given India and Pakistan were now independent but strangely without a border, so the whole process basically occurred  unpoliced. There were 10+ million bodies suddenly transferring between the two nations, in regions where tribal and religious tensions were already huge and what followed was probably one of the darkest chapters in South Asian history.

I'm not saying the British were totally to blame, the violence itself was caused by tribal and religious fractions already present in that region, but to exonerate us is equally stupid. We did a lot of things wrong when dividing the border, either through naivety or incompetence which had very real consequences for the people living there.",0,1408192921,null,0,false,0,cjrux5f,t3_2dmu1r,t1_cjrux5f,t1_cjr36fo,null,1435265695,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;  What few signs there are of improvement are welcome, but policy is set, as ever, to get rid of what of works and build on what doesn't.

&gt;The Willow Unit, an ""essential, effective"" psychologically-informed resource for boys with the most complex problems, is facing having its funding taken away. ""It was a vital service that kept some of the most vulnerable boys safe and in my view, closure of the Willow Unit would be a reckless and dangerous development,"" Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, found.

&gt;In a move which baffled child safety experts and penal reform groups, the institution, which previously held only 16- to 18-year-olds, started admitting young adults between the ages of 18 to 21. During the inspection it was announced the number of young adults was to increase significantly. ""In my view there was a real risk that this would detract attention from the safe management of the very vulnerable and challenging younger boys that the establishment held,"" the chief inspector found.

**TL;DR:** If we treat prisoners like animals, they will be released and act like animals.  Plus staff have to deal with all the fallout.

This sound very similar to my family who work in the prison service.

Lots of cuts and it's really created a toxic environment (you might be an idiot that thinks prisoners should be treated like shit, but guess what, Prison Officers have to spend most of their life in the same buildings).

There's been an increase in violence.  One was lucky enough not to be hit with the boiling water / sugar combo someone chucked in a PO face.  Protests on roof / dirty protests.  More fighting and general violence.  

5 staff now look after large wings.  They can't cope with the amount of work and each activity knocks onto the next (dinner is 10 minutes late because mail wasn't sorted quick enough, that means visits are cut by 10 minutes or something like rec time . . . then prisoners get pissed off and frustrated).

Thankfully one of my family can retire at any moment, the other is very stressed at the moment but still has a few years left.  Genuine stress, but there are bills to pay.   Can't wait till they're both out, but deeply feel for those left dealing with various cuts.",0,1408193001,null,0,false,0,cjruxtu,t3_2dpnct,t1_cjruxtu,t3_2dpnct,null,1435265704,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm yet to see a source for this, but if it is true then that is pretty inexcusable behavior. The Union has a right to not stock whatever items it pleases, but it does not have the right to control what people are eating. 

That said, I think the claim is very dubious. It somehow suggests that the guy brought in a sandwich and was then subject to spot inspection for Israeli produce; a situation I think is very unlikely. Like I say, a source for this would be nice.

&gt;

&gt;__Cú Chulainn__, also spelt __Cú Chulaind__ or __Cúchulainn__ ([kuːˈxʊlˠɪnʲ] ; [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) for ""[Culann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culann)'s Hound"") and sometimes known in English as __Cuhullin__ /kəˈhʊlɨn/,  is an [Irish mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_mythology) hero who appears in the stories of the [Ulster Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Cycle), as well as in [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_folklore) and [Manx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man) folklore.  The son of the god [Lugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugh) and [Deichtine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deichtine) (sister of [Conchobar mac Nessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchobar_mac_Nessa)), his childhood name was __Sétanta__.

&gt;He gained his better-known name as a child after he killed Culann's fierce guard-dog in self-defence and offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single-handedly against the armies of queen [Medb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb) of [Connacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connacht) in the epic *[Táin Bó Cúailnge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1in_B%C3%B3_C%C3%BAailnge)* (""Cattle Raid of [Cooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley_peninsula)""). It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but that his life would be a short one. For this reason he is compared to the Greek hero [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles). He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, or *ríastrad*  (translated by [Thomas Kinsella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinsella) as ""warp spasm""  and by [Ciaran Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Carson) as ""torque"" ), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer [Láeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1eg) and drawn by his horses, [Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liath_Macha_and_Dub_Sainglend). In more modern times, Cú Chulainn is often referred to as the ""Hound of Ulster"". 

&gt;Cú Chulainn shows striking similarities to the Persian epic hero [Rostam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostam), as well as to the Germanic [Lay of Hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_of_Hildebrand) and the labours of the Greek epic hero [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules), suggesting a common [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European) origin,  but lacking in linguistic, anthropological and archaeological material.

Fair enough. But are you saying there isn't a single person or fan who wants to see a Female Doctor? Because that's why I included both of those entries.

Sorry if it seems stupid or not something you and a lot of people would be interested in. I don't really care either way. I like the show in its current format. But I had to write from a certain perspective for the sake of the article and so, while it may seem like I was pushing for each entry to happen, I was just positing an idea. Clearly, from the responses I've been getting, I should've chosen other aspects or theories to consider and analyze but it's too late for me to make changes. 

I agree, messing too much with The Doctor is a bad thing since there are reasons people like him the way that they do. And changing any or too much of those characteristics makes him far too different from the way we've come to know him.

Continuing using the pound would not require a new central bank. Panama for example uses the US dollar without a central bank, it experiences lower inflation than the US and is also the only country in Latin America that has not experienced a financial collapse or a currency crisis since its independence. It should also be noted that because Panama has no central bank, it has meant its banking industry keeps a lot of capital, making them less likely to default and incredibly robust. There is no deposit insurance and no lender of last resort, so banks have to act in a responsible manner. This has allowed local financial institutions to thrive during world recessions.

Ireland created a currency board which is much more constrained than
the central bank, and these constraints help ensure that the fixed parity is maintained with the pound, when they created the Irish Pound - which they kept for 70 years before moving to the Euro.

in fact sometimes they're not even profitable for them, and i've seen patients who had to be switched to a TEVA branded generic from a Sandoz branded generic simply because they no longer made it, which is unfortunate for the patient when the Sandoz brand gave them less side effects.

Dunno, lots of people do though.

But I'd worry more about the streets you walk in and the amount of shit motor vehicles are pumping out, for mostly very very short drives in the case of cars.

The shoddy kicking is what irks me most. Not so many years back 95% of goalies would either hoof the ball long or throw it out to a defender. David James was the first I can remember to develop a great 'throw out' wherein he would hurl it to a striker/attacker as far as the half way line. That was an oddity back then.

Nowadays most top keepers are as good with the ball at feet as the defenders in front of them and can pass the ball out of defence like a sweeper or nonchalantly chip a 40yd ball to a fullback on the flank. See Neuer, Reina, Valdes, Ter Stegen, Courtois, Bravo, Casillas, etc, etc.

Mignolet is nowhere near that level. It winds me up every time he tries to chip a ball out to Johnson or Flanagan (for example) it ends up sailing into touch and conceding possession. In today's game that is inexcusable. There is no reason why he can't work with a goalkeeping coach on that facet of his game and bring it up to the same standard as some of the others I named. It's up to him to develop his skills and put the time in.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"I agree with your sentiment, though I think importance in preventative medicine has less to do with transport policy and more to do with strict education on the leading causes of mortality that are preventable: smoking and diet.

It's not just about stopping people from smoking in public, but preventing them from beginning smoking in the first place, and stronger encouragement in helping people to quit. Warnings on cigarette packets aren't enough, we need to push informative education in schools, and this has been helping, but not enough.

The same goes for diet. Be strict with kids, and equally parents. We need to ensure people have good access to dietary advice, whether in school or from their GPs. They need to be specific offering example meals or low cost alternatives that are simple so parents aren't left thinking it will be time consuming and expensive. So many kids are overweight or obese because their parents are, and that's not genetics: that's being fed a crappy diet by a parent who's eaten like that their whole life.

These are the big killers, and complications of these are what is causing so many problems in our NHS. How many operations do we carry out a year for complications resulting from obesity or smoking? Not to mention that both those act as independent co-morbidities even for unrelated surgeries. People aren't getting enough support early on to help prevent this from happening.

&gt;

&gt;__H2O Networks__ was a [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications) company who were supposed to be rolling out [Fibrecity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrecity) around the UK. They were formally part of the i3 Group.

&gt;H2O networks in their Fibrecity (Bournemouth) and Fibrecity (Dundee) guises ceased their builds in October 2010 stating that there would be a short delay due to company restructuring. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Their installation contractors in both cities were laid off. As of January 2011 works have still not recommenced. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;In January 2011 it was announced that there had been a management buy-out of the H2O Networks part of the i3 business, including Fibrecity, by the ex i3 Group CCO Greg Mesch, the new company is to be called City Fibre Holdings.

As someone who works professionally with UAVs, and constantly runs up against the CAA regulations, I find it worth reminding myself that I am flying basically flying a 2-7 kilo blender, and when things go wrong it can do a lot of damage.

The rules can be irritating, but the guys at the CAA who are responsible for UAV regs aren't actively trying to ruin our day, they're just trying to reduce the chance of someone getting hurt as much as possible.

If rule of the majority isn't ""just"", then we need something more - but at what percentage support does it become enough; 75%, 90%, 99%? The only fixed value is 100%. Anything else is a compromise, and some people would say that you shouldn't compromise on fundamental rights.

When it comes to the death penalty, I think that killing people is fundamentally wrong (which may be overly naive), and should only be acceptable when necessary and proportionate to achieve some benefit to society. And I fail to see when capital punishment would ever be strictly necessary. Because of that, I would be fundamentally opposed to introducing it even with majority support.

Ethics are complicated, I don't pretend to have the right answer nor do I know if there are any.

That said; the purpose of the criminal justice system is debatable. It is worth remembering that something like 95% of cases never involve a jury, and only a small number of convicted criminals end up in prison.

Montero looks like he could become a real threat this season. He is not only pacey, but has so much flair on the ball. He is going to be fun to watch.

Sigurdsson looked good upfront and against weaker opposition when we can be more methodical going forward he'll definitely shine.

Gomis looked great out there. Despite being isolated he was a constant threat and almost put away a Sigurdsson's beautiful pass.

On the other end though, we NEED a Right Back. We have no depth and I'm not confident in Angel Rangel as our first choice. Federico Fernandez would also give me comfort. Also, outside of Ash our set piece defence was suspect at best.

I'm so excited by the win though. In Monk I trust!",0,1408201251,null,0,false,0,cjrxcs3,t3_2dpzid,t1_cjrxcs3,t3_2dpzid,null,1435267343,4,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,4

We basically did what I wanted, actually.  Lennon got a load more defensive duties, Capoue shifted back, and Eriksen dropped deeper as well.  So I think you can fuck off about that.

At half, I say pull Ade for Daws.  Let Capoue move back to the midfield.  Dier can sit back as a very defensive right back.  Either that, or Davies.  Whichever Poch prefers.

We are not looking to dethrone Celtic, we are looking to get second place, but losing 6-1 was painful to watch. We haven't beaten Celtic at Parkhead in more than two decades and that doesn't look like it is going to change anytime soon.

Negatives:
- Rado: our keeper. Our new Polish lad is going to have to make the step up now or Rado is going to have to lose his bad habits
- Our defence is all new; tall, powerful and commanding and they were supposed to prevent us losing goals from set pieces and corners like we did last season. Not clear if this is true yet, certainly not against Celtic
- We still can't beat Celtic away

Positives:
- We're finally debt free
- We can likely expect more income from transferred players and their associated add-ons: Gauld, Robertson and Russell in the future
- Great talent in the squad
- More youth players coming through
- Playing great football (usually) and we are a joy to watch

Why? Because when the pressure is on and everything that means anything is on the line, we now know that we can count on Andre. He performs the same whether its against a burnley friendly or against Argentina in a world cup final. What you see is what you get. And everything we see is GREAT. All of those break aways, play readings, passes, assists, and goals arnt just ""right place right time"" they are what Andre bring to the table when he steps on the pitch and thats an amazing attribute... hes a stone cold player.. its almost as if he isnt effected by ""form"".. Not only that, he is humble, he never boasts, he is greatful to play for our club, our manager is his biggest football icon, he loves london, he loves the fans, hes active on social media with the fans, he is a grade A chelsea student. I read an article about Ballack basically dragging Andre to london and showing him the whole city. Ballack knew from the start that Andre could be perfect for us and he did everything in his power to make sure it would go through.

(aside form the final) Low put him on the right side of the pitch to alleviate the work Lahm was doing when going forward. He played it flawlessly. When he came on, he was tearing the opposition's midfield and defense in half.. he destroyed and sort of marking and rhythm that they tried to adhere to.. Andre Schurrle is the Joker in the deck of cards... there are VERY FEW players who offer that.. its set in stone now, there is not a single LB or RB in the sport who wouldnt worry about going head to head with Andre. I cant say the same for Willian. Most of the time Willian gets to the final third and does one of the trademark Ivanovic crosses... its useless..

ISIS have little to nothing to do with Gaza and would wipe out Palestinians quicker than the IDF could ever hope to achieve. Palestinians are fairly westernised in their outlook in comparison to most of Iraq, considering quite a few also live in Israel and are exposed to that way of life. No LAD-arseholery about what I said. But as we learnt in good ol' NI, when you treat people like shit, they take up arms and their views become extreme. Israel created the conditions for Hamas to flourish. Notice how they're not exactly welcome in the slightly-more-open West Bank?

Like I've already mentioned, the concentration on Israel-Palestine is because Israel is a sovereign state with diplomatic links to virtually every western country. ISIS do not have this nor will they. Who would you be protesting to, exactly? 

Hamas? Hamas have votes. Lots of votes. Or did you forget about that little bit of information? Ofcourse when the Israelis and Americans didn't like the outcome of that election they blew it off (or up, rather), it doesn't make Hamas any less legitimate. 

""We"" (who's this we? not in my name) intervened to depose one dictator who ran a fairly stable country that wasn't a hotbed of jihad insurgency, for all his faults. ""We"" armed that genocidal dictatorship not that long ago. Like you said, if only the world were so black and white. Do you think ISIS would be sprawling across Iraq if Saddam Hussein was still around? Would they fuck.

If you believe the 2003 invasion of Iraq was for the good of the Iraqi people then you're either deluded or haven't done your reading.

At the moment the Bank of England will use it's powers depending on whether or not it is believed to have a net benefit to the UK as a whole, that means that the only time it will do the things that Scotland requires is when those requirements align with the whole UK's requirements which is as it should be, when those interests do not align then so be it, they will happen in line with what will benefit the whole UK even if it is detrimental to Scotland specifically.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The death penalty is a pointless penalty on several levels.

The purpose of a punishment is to have someone suffer on some level for their crime or crimes. Now if you believe in hell or punishment in an afterlife then the death penalty makes sense because said person will suffer there, however lets drop the supernatural guff and look at this logically.

Do the dead suffer: No. You can only suffer in life. Once you are dead you cannot feel, think, experience or have any consciousness at all, why? *Because they are dead*. If they cannot suffer then it is not a punishment.

Will it prevent or stop crimes: No. You often hear the claim the death penalty is a deterrent, as if someone in the heat of an argument with someone will pick up the knife off the kitchen counter , raise it and stop just short thinking ""oh wait, if I kill this person, I will be put to death. Silly me, I'm glad I never actually stabbed my wife for having that affair!"" *This never happens and never will happen and you have to be naive on a debilitating level or an idiot to believe this.* The majority of murders aren't pre-planned by psychopathic artisan murderers months or years in advance. The majority of murders are spur of the moment things done in an argument or a quarrel, or hell, even during a botched robbery. The majority of murders are not committed by serial killers or mass murderers or career assassins where they had time to stop and not commit the murder. The vast majority of murders will *not* be prevented by fear of death.

The only way you could make the death penalty a punishment is to kill someone in a long and drawn out way that causes the person endless amounts of pain before death. The person will suffer before death and I suppose have their punishment, however how many people would advocate this. We hear about ""painless death penalties"" but painless death penalties are frankly pointless as they don't have the suffering essential to a punishment. The only way capital punishment can be a punishment is to have that painful element that causes suffering, preferably for a long time. So something on the level of cruxifiction, a punishment more of a torture method than anything else, would be appropriate. Don't let Jesus's ""six hour death"" fool you, people would take days or sometimes weeks to die, slowly and struggling to breath.

So what is the point of the death penalty? Well I think it's revenge. The people who advocate it either have lost someone to murder and want revenge and those who haven't are so enraged by high profile cases that they want to see someone hang out of sheer hatred. It's not punishment they want, they want to kill the people who kill, they want revenge. The justice system isn't about revenge. It's about punishment and reformation. If someone steals a car stereo and is arrested, we want them reformed so once released, they can repay their debt. If it was about ""revenge"", we'd see the death penalty dealt out to any and all offenses, as long as the anger is there.

Want an alternative? Life sentences keep the real bad ones off the streets and prevents them from murdering. For the murderers we do release, let's amputate a hand. And before you say ""OMG ISLAMIC COUNTRIES DO THAT IT'S TERRIBLE AND EVIL AND BLARG"", just because islamic theocracies do it, does that make a bad idea? It cripples the person, reminds them constantly what they have done, takes something they took for granted away and makes life hard for them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"African American is an ethnic descriptor. I wonder why a lot of people on Reddit seem to make such a massive deal out of it.

Day to the day the average African American never uses the term. They are black. They are American. These are the usual relevant descriptors in their lives.

Three black men in New York, one from Jamaica, one from Nigeria and one from Brooklyn. They are not the same. One is Jamaican, one is Nigerian and one is African American. It differentiates him not only from other Americans, but more crucially from other black people of African descent.

African immigrants to the US have the [highest academic achievement of all ethnic groups](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2c5iqr/til_african_immigrants_have_the_highest_academic/). Nigerians in particular [do very well academically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_American#Education).

It serves no one to then lump all black people into one group when you have to tackle issues that clearly disproportionally affects one specific ethnic group. 

The notion that people are somehow best served by pretending there are no differences between them is just wrong headed foolishness. Data has to be collected. For that clear disambiguations between specific groups has to be established. Not collecting data doesn't help anyone, in fact it simply makes it easy to ignore and sweep away problems. Look at the story linked;

&gt;Unlike in the UK, there is no database of police shootings in the US.

How do you tackle a problem when you don't even know it exists? How do you tackle the problem of [white working class boys low academic attainment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20898608) if you decide all lah-di-dah like to simply call everyone British and forget separating them?

You may not think this is important for some reason, but it is.

The irony of it is you do this while proudly sporting the Cornish flag and motto by your username. Presumably your ethnic heritage is important to you, yet African Americans should drop theirs for some reason.

I presume you'd correct me were I to refer to you as Welsh or Scottish. The fact we're all British and none of the ethnic descriptors appear on our passport or important documentation never stops it from being important to the person for whom their heritage is in question.",0,1408204323,null,0,false,0,cjryhif,t3_2dobue,t1_cjryhif,t1_cjrugjw,null,1435452620,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Privatisation was the best thing that ever happened to British Telecom and our insanely competitive broadband market with it's low barrier of entry is the envy of other countries.

There is absolutely no way that LLU or the spin-off of BT Openreach would have happened as quick as it did, if at all, had BT remained under the ownership of the state.

The way it should happen in theory is that a preferred supplier is approached for a specific service - if they can't supply it, then they open the work up to the market for any company to bid. What actually happens is the preferred suppler says ""Yes, we can do that..."", charge premium rates, then goes out and looks for a company that can actually do the work because they have no idea how to do it!

So the customer is charged £2000 p/day for a consultant - the actual 3rd party consultant they are paying for is being paid £300-600 a day.

The second half... we looked shaky. Our defense seemed to fall apart and they were able to get away with chances that they shouldn't have.

Was disappointed by Lukaku's showing. He was covered tightly though and he didn't have much opportunity to do much, but he looked rusty too. Not quite in the form I would have hoped to see him in.

If Fergie still had a significant say in things, Moyes would still have been manager. 

The LvG quote is taken out of context. He was asked again and again about transfers and this list he allegedly handed to Ed Woodward upon arrival. He merely said that he wanted to give the current players 4 weeks before making any new signings. 

LvG always keeps a person with a lot of club knowledge around. He did it in Barca and he did it in Munich and I am pretty sure Giggs is more than happy to learn from LvG. Even if LvG got fired after this season, Giggs wouldn't be named permanent manager so I don't see how he would benefit from getting LvG fired. 

To answer your question, no, I am not laughing now, but I don't have unrealistic expectations for this season so it's not the end of the world that we lost this game.

&gt;3) Why was Kane brought on over Soldado?

**I think Kane was the better choice. He offers good long shots and we were being forced to shoot from outside the box often.** 

**Soldado could have contributed more to build up play, but at times it looked like were were over-cooking it outside the box.** 

**Essentially we wanted someone who would shoot early, hard, and could do so from a distance. Kane was the better option.**

I thought Capoue had a phenomenal game in the middle before moving over to CB, and Rose had a great game as well. Im not sure if the Davies acquisition has lit a fire under his bum, but he seemed better defensively and smarter going forward. Kaboul had an awful awful game. 

It was interesting to see how Poch balanced his high pressure high energy system with 10 men on the pitch. He did it quite nicely but as the commentators stated over and over again, we were helped by West Ham's inability to commit players forward.

THERE ARE ALREADY TWO OTHER PREMIER LEAGUE TEAMS WEARING CLARET AND BLUE, ASSHOLES. I say we have a Claret And Blue Cup, and West Ham are forced into relegation while Villa and Burnley get to stay up.  God I fucking hate West Ham.

Eric Dier looked confident and strong, and to score a cheeky striker's goal (""ON HIS PREMIER LEAGUE DEBUT!!!"") has got to be such a dream come true for him.  I'm really looking forward to seeing him come into his own.  Like Bentaleb, I think he's a young player with a *very* high ceiling, one which he's nowhere near hitting yet.

I'll admit to be a bit puzzled at some of Poch's lineup choices.  Ade instead of Soldado to start (Soldado earned a starting position after that strong preseason), Eriksen starting on the left with Lamela at CAM (instead of the other way around), two strikers on the bench (could have used one of those seats for another midfield sub, which would have at least been a nice option for cover), and then Kane coming on instead of Soldado?  Curious choices.  We got the 3 points, and I'm happy, but I'd love it if someone could shine some light on Poch's logic for me.

Chris Foy is a twat.  There is no universe in which that is a red card offense.  A handball, yes technically, and therefore a penalty - while harsh - I can understand.  But a fucking straight red?  Not in a million fucking years.

Spursy as fuck to start the season, naturally, but I can start pushing my heart back down my throat now.  Yeesh.

Dier amazing. So composed, filled in at RB, goal. What more can I say? 

Kaboul looked a bit off the pace, bulled by Cole at times. 

Townsend, for all the hate I gave him - did what he does. Runs at players, actually takes shots which shows a bit of initiative. 

Eriksen, quiet. But quite easily could have been the best player on the pitch had some of his ideas actually worked. Excited to see him in the next game. 

Rose, let Downing cut inside too much, HOWEVER he was arguably our best defender in the opening parts of the game. 

Lloris, I love you and I would give you my blessing to marry my girlfriend. That save was fucking incredible. 

Lamela, like Eriksen - tbh. Quiet, but did his job, looked VERY hungry out there pressing and winning stuff back but things just didn't pan out. I think this is his year for sure though. 

Capoue, solid. Kept Downing onside IIRC for their big chance but again, it's early in the season and I think he'll grow into a massively key player for us.

If the NHS is more efficient than private healthcare (which it is) then if I have £x available to give towards healthcare in this country then I'm going to be better off giving it to the NHS than spending any on private healthcare for myself.

Making some numbers up, say I can get completely private health care for £400 per year, then, since they are:

a) Making a profit
and
b) Providing me more than the NHS would by lower wait time, more expensive drugs, or my own room (therefore being less efficent)

then the proportion of my £1000 taxes towards to NHS that will, on average, actually be spent on me will be below £400, say £250 instead.

This means if I up my contribution to the NHS to £1400 the benefit to others is £1150.

If I leave my contribution to the NHS at £1000, and spend that £400 on private then I've spent the same, but the benefit to others is now only £1000.

If they can trace their father to a specific village in Kenya, no that's not the group they are part of.

&gt;That seems illogical to me. The descendants of Polish who came to America are Polish-American, Europeans can call themselves European-American, surely it follows the descendents of Africans who came to America are African-American.

Poland is a country. It has a language and flag and history. Those American Poles could probably even find the Ellis Island log book entry of their ancestors coming in! African Americans can't. I'm not sure if you know the history of slavery but I can assure you an Ancestry.com account would be pretty useless for most of them.

African American has a very specific meaning. Black Americans whose families were transported to the USA during the transatlantic slave trade. Simple.

&gt;I think you wrote a clearly argued post with a lot of good points, nonetheless, the way the term is used is incoherent and denies a name to the children of recent African immigrants.

No it doesn't! They don't *want* to be African-American! My cousins who live in Boston and were born there know they're Nigerian. They are proud to be Nigerian...they are proud to be American.

Borini has done so, the problem is that the club has developed aswell, in a quicker pace than he has, wich means we can choose to keep him and hope he becomes better, or replace him whit someone who is already good enough, hes position is a touchy one, noone wants to take chances on a striker, i personaly realy likes hes aditude and i think hes a good guy, all of that makes me think we should give him a chance.

The individual players clearly wanted the win and they showed that by how much they fought for it and how close they came to snatching it.

As I said, Noble, Downing, Cresswell and Kouyate all looked fantastic and were unlucky not to have won the game for us. 

Unfortunately I don't think that thirst for victory was really shared by the manager and he let them down by keeping Nolan on when Zarate was sat fresh on the bench and when Cole was failing to make an impact I'd have given Valencia a full half hour, definitely not bringing him on in the last 10 minutes. What kind of premier league debut is that? He looked great, was wrestiling with defenders and winning us corners but he wasn't given the service by the manager he really deserved. BFS seemed content to just play for the draw while his players were out there fighting for the fans and to keep him in his job.

Dier: He was such a giant this game he was on my shortlist before he scored the goal and afterward he was the only choice, my god he showed such maturity. Naughton being sloppy, Dier covered. Kaboul being careless got that too. Bentaleb losing the ball, Dier there to take it back!

Capoue: He was so good today. This is exactly why he was bought in. Safe on the ball, and just godlike when it came to make a threatening ball safe. I really like where this is going. Capoue is a starter no doubt.

Lloris: Did what he was supposed to do, and made one real monster save. Good job Lloris!

The questionsmark
Bentaleb: Was horrendous untill the red card one of the worst players on the pitch. He lost balls, he wasted balls and gone was the old safe Bentaleb and was replaced by a jittery teenager. Then suddenly after the red, old bentaleb was back.

The bad
Adebayor: I really hope there is some deal that Soldado starts the next game hence why he wasn't brought on for this one. Adebayor was atrocious he was so bad.

Er, isn't that an argument for intervention against IS before the IDF?

&gt;No LAD-arseholery about what I said. 
Don't play to that gallery then. If you can argue against a viewpoint without immature slurs don't bother with it.

&gt;But as we learnt in good ol' NI, when you treat people like shit, they take up arms and their views become extreme. Israel created the conditions for Hamas to flourish. Notice how they're not exactly welcome in the slightly-more-open West Bank?

Sure, but two wrongs didn't make a right in NI either.

&gt;Like I've already mentioned, the concentration on Israel-Palestine is because Israel is a sovereign state with diplomatic links to virtually every western country. ISIS do not have this nor will they. Who would you be protesting to, exactly? 

I did not say protest. Lobby/raise awareness, etc. All legitimate methods ignored by the it's all-about-Gaza crowd.

&gt;Hamas? Hamas have votes. Lots of votes. Or did you forget about that little bit of information? Ofcourse when the Israelis and Americans didn't like the outcome of that election they blew it off (or up, rather), it doesn't make Hamas any less legitimate. 

Hamas violate the Geneva convention, votes or not. Whatever the political battles - which protestors should not be concentrating on but are, giving away their real interest - their continued presence adds to the humanitarian trouble instead of detracting from it.

&gt;""We"" (who's this we? not in my name) intervened to depose one dictator who ran a fairly stable country that wasn't a hotbed of jihad insurgency, for all his faults. ""We"" armed that genocidal dictatorship not that long ago. Like you said, if only the world were so black and white. Do you think ISIS would be sprawling across Iraq if Saddam Hussein was still around? Would they fuck.

We being the UK. Disassociate/stick your head in the sand over our actions if you want, not going to change the fact we have a responsibility. To what degree, up for debate.

&gt;If you believe the 2003 invasion of Iraq was for the good of the Iraqi people then you're either deluded or haven't done your reading. Do you also believe that George Bush heard God speak to him (hearing voices, a well known sign of insanity) to invade Iraq? 
The reason I supported it at the time was to depose a dictator and help stabilise a strategic part of the world. Make fun of Bush all you like.

These rules can override the styling information provided by the website.

Being a CSS solution, it is completely innocuous, and can only change the visual appearance of the page.

The rules I wrote are only active on the bbc website and they look for hyper links that point to pages containing certain bits of text in the url.
In this case it's matching the magazine and trending pages.

Due to the nature of how CSS rules work, and the layout of the page structure, I am unable to hide the orphaned pieces of text.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Why should knowing what specific village your ancestors came from either way change your right to call yourself a hyphenated-American?

Nothing *stops* from doing it, not one *wants* to! Why is that hard to get? If you can trace your family heritage why would you really like to be part of a group who literally can't? It's bizarre.

This all hinges on your erroneous belief that African immigrants *want* to be refered to as African American. Trust me, there is *no* such desire. They are very distinct groups with their own internal [issues and tensions](http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/04/why-the-all-ivy-league-story-stirs-up-tensions-between-african-immigrants-and-black-americans/359978/).

[There are real tensions between Africans and African Americans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SxL67x6nss). In some circles [African Americans believe Africans look down on them!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kiqA3xysz8).

You need to get it out of your head that if you were in America and met a guy from Jamaica and called him an African-American he'd be happy with you. It's the same if I called a Scottish person English. Why can white people *get* that but not black people and our cultural and national heritage?

&gt;But using African American this way is misleading, inaccurate, and denies the proper word to people who actually need it to describe themselves accurately.

Okay, then what do YOU think it should be? Go ahead. Come up with something that is both accurate and allows you to keep collecting the vital data that is currently collected.

true,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,"I thought we played pretty well today on the whole. I am okay with the starting squad, with the exception of two poor challenges from Ginge and Nolan's momentary vanishing acts the starters all pulled their weight.

Grades (1-10):

Adrian / 5.5 / He wasn't really challenged all that much in the first half and made only a few saves all game long. Unfortunately could have come off his line a little sooner to try and stop the winner, but Manuel Neuer he ain't.

Cresswell / 7 / Linked really well with the attack. Looked dangerous on crosses. Picked up a bit of a knock but showed great toughness to play through it.

Reid / 6 / Didn't really do anything poorly, but wasn't really doing anything exceedingly well. Didn't hear his name called much, which can be a good thing for a CB.

Collins / 4.5 / Played pretty well, save two absolutely dreadful challenges in a span of 20 minutes. That second yellow in particular was a bad angle and a bad choice, especially already on a booking.

O'Brien / 5 / He was okay going forward but I saw a few pretty suspect first touches. Contained the Spud wingers pretty well defensively.

Kouyate / 7.5 / God I love his game. Superb effort, showed up everywhere on the pitch, ran people down, looked great defensively and threatening on the attack. Very solid.

Noble / 5.5 / Outstanding in the open field, intercepted passes, made key tackles, found space, found open men. But that penalty, Mark. You missed the target by a half yard. Jesus.

Nolan / 5.5 / Wasn't a howler from him. Disappeared for stretches but forced a penalty and had a cheeky backheel to give Downing his goal opportunity in the closing stages.

Downing / 7.5 / Looked both determined and purposeful. Played like he was gonna score. Probably should have if not for a bit of brilliance from Lloris.

Vaz Te / 7 / Looked fully fit for the first time in months. Dangerous in attack, as always. Created more chances than anyone, save maybe Downing.

Cole / 5.5 / Had a few moments, but largely seemed ineffective against the Spuds back four/three and could have established himself more. Lacked service at times, which is frustrating when playing a man up.

SUBS:

Demel / 4 / Let the Spud remain onside for the last second winner. Didn't add anything to the attack. Didn't defend particularly well, either.

Valencia / 6.5 / Immediately established himself offensively. Won a couple corners, made some great runs. Lost possession once in a 1-on-1 situation, which was a little disappointing.

Diame / 5 / Looked okay defensively but played really selfishly in the attack. Took what was far and away the worst shot of the day: a slow dribbler 10 yards wide from 30 out.

MANAGEMENT

Allardyce / 4.5 / Really should have put two up top once we went up a man. Could have dominated all three areas if he'd done so. Instead seemed okay with playing defensively. The substitutions and the timing of them seemed poorly thought out, too (Demel for O'Brien in a 0-0 game and up a man?).",0,1408208408,null,0,false,0,cjs04a6,t3_2dqaxo,t1_cjs04a6,t3_2dqaxo,null,1435268612,6,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,6

Ash got MOTM today but the real top boy was Monk. We absolutely did not play our normal game today. We completely sacrificed possession, perhaps because he anticipated the high line and pressing play to be expected from a Van Gaal team. As a result, we looked a bit crap from our own eyes because to us, a good performance looks calm, collected and patient. Instead, when we got on the ball we shoved it forward as quickly as possible.

To give further credit to Monk, his substitutions were absolutely spot on and Van Gaal was out-tacticked in this department. When Januzaj started going down on our left, Taylor was getting murdered - this is why they scored, I don't hold Rangel responsible for it personally. What does he do? He brings on Tiendalli, who I struggle to justify as a squad member at times but not for the first time absolutely shut down Man Utd's wingplay (I remember him cancelling out Rooney in a home game two years ago). Excellent sub and Januzaj disappeared.

Next, starting with Dyer and bringing on Montero late. I think we all expected a Montero start, but the fact remains that he tries to take on the world and is all about the pace. Dyer had a solid game, but once the Man Utd defence adjusted, bringing on Montero completely fresh caused havoc, and it's why we got our lead back.

In short, we looked a bit dodgy because it was part of the gameplan, and while it has to be mentioned that key Man Utd players were out today, Monk won the manager battle with Van Gaal today and that's why we won. I don't think it was down to any individual performances (although everyone did very well).",0,1408208517,null,0,false,0,cjs05t1,t3_2dpzid,t1_cjs05t1,t1_cjrwyih,null,1435268618,6,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,6

I'm not engaging with EVERY point because, like I said the main thrust ALL hinges on the single premiss, which when dismissed invalidates all the rest. Africans and Caribbean *don't* want to be lumped in with African Americans. Every other point you make, even the ones about white South Africans hinge on this one flawed bit of thinking.

&gt;""slave descended black""

Are you serious?! Again, this would be one of those moments where it's not important to go into the minutia of every point if I can't at all articulate how silly it would be to suggest to black Americans their ethnic descriptor *includes* the word slave!!!

&gt;If he was from Jamaica he'd be Jamaican.

You're telling me you're not aware of the process of gaining citizenship then? I mean some guy is on the front page at least once a week showing off their certificate and telling their story. He'd be American, but he'd never want to forget he's from Jamaica.

&gt;If his parents were Jamaican and he was from New York of course he'd be African American, and it's bizarre that you claim he wouldn't be.

Again...go back to my first post. Data showed these immigrant groups and their descendants fared better than African Americans and in some cases all other Americans. Who does it serve to skew this data by lumping it all together? The immigrant group and their descendants continue to do well while the problems in the African American population are now hidden because *everyone* is African American! It's stupid.

&gt;Here is one African immigrant who does want to be referred to as African American.

No, here's a troll trying his best to be a dick. He's taking a pop at affirmative action schemes he believe are no longer needed or are inherently racist because system racism isn't a thing any more and everyone would ""get over it"" and equality means literally treating everyone the same.

true,grelch,null,null,"I speaking dispassionately so I don't want to be accused of being negative. 

This loss is on Sam. Firstly, he reverted to his comfortable 433 which meant that there would be few if no attempts on goal and most if not all of those would be from the head off of crosses. We had some clean opportunities from crosses, but we don't have a finisher so those were going to go begging. As mentioned already Sam didn't go for the jugular when we were man up. Spurs looked a fairly ordinary side, we could have and should have put a couple past them during that spell. Sam's substitutions continue to be a mystery. I don't have as much of an issue with bringing Demel on as some, but logic would have dictated that he come on for Creswell and not O'Brien. At that point, who knew whether Creswell's knee wasn't going to seize up on him. Had he needed to come off we hd no cover. Diame on is fine, but why for Vaz? I grant that Nolan had a better match than Vaz, but Nolan was done at that point, and I'm fairly sure he was asking to come off. Valencia for Carlton happened too late and in any case we will never be able to stick Valenci up top alone as the target man. It will never work. He needs to work in the hole with a counter part. Complete and utter failure on the tactical and match managements fronts. 

The positive things to come from this match are many. Kouyate was very impressive. If he can develop a little touch on passing the ball and if we use a better system, he's going to put a lot of pressure on opposing sides. Creswell had the odd miscue, but he looks a tidy, quick and progressive player. Downing attacked Rose and was very effective. If he gets proper support he could have a very good season. Diame is a good player when he wants to be and he looked up for it today. He's good off the bench but if he can maintain consistency he deserves to play (As always, Nolan is the man who should give way). By and large we defended well. There were two moments where they slipped. One at the beginning of the second half when Ginge decided he'd try to break pressure by dribbling the ball out which naturally resulted in a turn over a near goal and a period of sustained pressure. Ginge is a decent steady back but he reliably has one clanger per match, and it's always a question of whether it costs us a goal or not. The second was the Totts goal. What an excellent time to turn off their brains. The last positive for me was the support, especially after Spurs scored. Rather than moaning and booing we chose to drown their support with Bubbles instead. That's what support is. You cheer the side on you don't complain.

Overall there were positives than negatives. It looks like we have some decent players who are up for playing. It's up to you Sam.

Alright, now I've got that out of my system...

Our new signings are looking good. Cresswell had had a fairly game, Kouyate was very good in midfield and defended well when he was moved back. Valencia only played 10 minutes but he put in a good shift, his workrate looks good and I'm optimistic about him this season.

Other notable performances: I though Downing was quite good, delivered a fee dangerous crosses and was always a presence in attack. Noble as always bossed the midfield and passed well, but missing the penalty takes away from his performance. Adrian was solid as always but wasn't tested too much.

Kevin Nolan was invisible except for that backheel which was actually quite clever and led to one of our best chances. Vaz Te looked like he was trying to make things happen but Diame was much better than him when subbed on (we all hate that Sam sticks Diame on the wing but actually he could make a decent inverted winger in my opinion). Cole wasn't horrible but tired out quickly and should've been taken off earlier.

All in all, a match we should've won. Had we brought on Zarate for Vaz Te or Valencia for Cole at half time, we could've taken control of the game and attacked more. Instead Sam brought on Demel. We failed to make the most of the opportunities we had and it came back to bite us in the end.",0,1408208768,null,0,false,0,cjs09o2,t3_2dqaxo,t1_cjs09o2,t3_2dqaxo,null,1435268644,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

Kaboul was mostly bad.  He had some good moments, but he easily could have given up 2 or 3 goals.  

Capoue was okay, but nothing special.  

Bentaleb was up and down.  He absolutely missed two tackles that could have become goals, but he did have some really good plays and was solid most of the game. 

Danny Rose was surprisingly good.  I would rather see Ben Davies there, but Rose has earned the right to continue starting.

Townsend is better than Lennon full stop.  

I wish Poch kept Lamela in longer, but I understand the need to bring Holtby's energy with a man down.  It wasn't a good performance, but I was happy with Lamela's performance all things considering.  

Ade was okay and aside from the winning pass, I would rate Kane's performance the same.  Both seem to suffer a bad first touch and problems dealing with physical play.  

Lloris was amazing. MOTM for me.

Eriksen didn't play well in my opinion.  He missed a lot of passes and didn't really look like he was our best player.  I'm a little weary of his position.

A suspended sentence for this violent dangerous woman is a joke and makes a mockery of the justice system.

If it was a first offence, I could understand. But *seventeen previous offences*? 

I find it bizarre to think that our system allows a woman to commit this amount of criminal acts and still allows her to walk free.

Interesting to think that you or I can likely manage to go 4 years without violently assaulting someone, then another 4 years, and another, ad infinitum, yet I should for some reason be lenient on this woman because she's managed to not assault anyone in 4 years? 

What we have here is a combination of young, attractive, and female. The ultimate recipe for getting out of trouble. And it shouldn't be so. Money is money, there are many ways to lose it, but her actions should cost her her freedom.

true,KeepCalmMakeCoffee,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt;But where did the money come from?

Quite simply, tax payers.
The Department of Health put in a bid for the system. It was successful, and the funds came from the government. They have many 'pots' that different departments can bid for. This stands true for everything from the Department of Health, to the Department of Defense.

The NHS budget is entirely separate to these.

&gt;What would it have been spent on if not on that scheme?

Impossible to say - you'd have to see what else was bid for (and failed).

&gt;This is surely money that could have been spent on the NHS if it wasn't spent on that pointless vanity project.

It's not a simple case of it being money that the NHS could have had, as it could have been used for many other things. Sure, something in the NHS might have benefited from the cash, but hindsight is a great thing. The money might have been spent on defense for all we know. It's an easy trap to fall into thinking that any money could be spent on the NHS directly for patients.

To be fair, this was way more than a vanity project. The idea was actually very, very good. It could have saved lives, cut costs, helped safety and made the NHS better for everyone involved (from patients to staff). It was just massively mismanaged and money wasted. The idea itself was fairly sound.
Ironically, it will probably have to happen. There is simply no way that the current system can continue long term. There are too many inefficiencies in it. In some cases, paper documents are still being passed around as opposed to a digital version.

Yes, because he's demonstrating that he has no understanding of statistics, despite using them to throw around his silly accusations. I suppose he could just be a partisan hack, but that's not much better.  
  
&gt;he is saying the data is insufficient and paints an incorrect picture,  
  
He said that a sample of ""just 41,000"" is ""statistically meaningless"". This is demonstrably false. A sample of that size *is* sufficient to give an estimate of the true unemployment rate, plus or minus two percentage points. This estimate *does* paint a correct picture because it is from a random sample, and so the resulting sample unemployment rate is an unbiased estimator of the population unemployment rate. In other words, the Labour Force Survey methodology does not result in ""massaging"" the unemployment rate figures. As I said, this is basic statistics, which he has demonstrated that he does not understand. How else do you explain his statement?

&gt;it doesn't really matter if ""that's how they've always done it""  
  
Of course it does. He suggested that the Tories ""massaged the headline unemployment rate by basing it on a sample of just 41,000"". As pointed out above, this method produces an unbiased estimate, so there is no massaging. Moreover, it has always been the case. He was implying that it was a Tory innovation to make themselves look better.  
  
&gt;it isn't really about the raw statistics imo.  
  
Somebody who has no understanding of statistics is likely to have such an attitude.  
  
&gt;What good would 100% employment be if everyone was making £1 an hour and only doing 3 hours work a week? I suggest you look into what kinds of jobs these people have, how many hours, pay etc and then you will see why the figures are 'massaged'

In terms of narrowing it down, Cavendish actually just resell Fidelity's platform under a white label so you'd be going for Fidelity either way.

They didn't know much about British culture, apart from having served in Iraq with some of our guys when they were in the Marine Corps. They showed me their Harleys and talked about their love for bikes, we talked about Afghanistan as I was going back there a few weeks later and then gun culture came up. 

These three massive former Marines couldn't see how this country could survive without guns, so I did my best to tell them about this country and how the people are here and our general attitudes to things, plus I mentioned that we're so much smaller and I my opinion, because of that our law enforcement is generally more efficient. After listening to me and asking a few questions they could actually see how it works in our country. After listening to them talking about their country I could see their points too and found myself thinking that if we in the UK had the gun laws the US has, we'd be a fucking mess, but if the US had our gun laws, they'd be a fucking mess too. 

We talked about it for ages and the best we could do was come to an agreement that there really was little point comparing our two countries, because we're just so very different both in size and in our cultures and attitudes.

I disagree, and I would expect her to face the same punishment as anyone else in the circumstances, which would easily be prison time if it were not an attractive young female with a supposed mental disorder.

Consistency, not the harshest punishment, is what I desire. I think we both know that neither of us could have violently assaulted people on 18 occasions and not face prison.

Assuming it is this supposed mental issue that is the cause of the violence (which we don't actually know, I would point out) I wouldn't exactly call glassing someone ""pretty well controlled"". 

4 Years, sure. But it still happened, she glassed someone. Mental issue or not. If she lives to be 80 that's another 14 incidents to look forward to if she can manage to keep her shit together for 4 years at a time.

For that, and the 17 previous offences, she should at the very least be taken from society for the benefit of the rest of us. Not necessarily prison, but as I said before, perhaps a secure hospital where she can get some help for her violence problem.

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","To everyone saying ""pussy pass"" and the like, is there comparable examples for men? (warning, daily mail links). 

Firstly, and most damning of all, is the [statistics](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2625841/Fury-soft-justice-courts-suspend-jail-terms-Explosion-use-2002-means-45-000-criminals-received-sentences-year.html).

&gt; Some 11,670 cases in 2012/13 involved criminals getting a suspended prison sentence despite more than ten previous cautions or convictions.  
And 9,052 had their sentence suspended despite 15 or more previous convictions.

&gt; In 2012/13, the last figures which are available, suspended jail terms were given to more than 7,200 violent thugs, 2,600 burglars, 555 robbers and 488 sexual offenders.

All women I assume? 

Before you moan about the quality of the daily mail, or the mitigating factors, I'm going to assume  
A) You don't read the Bournemouth Echo, so don't know if it's any better or worse than the Mail  
B) There may be mitigating factors that weren't mentioned in every single one of those stories (including OPs link)  
C) if any of those other stories I've linked below involved women, **you'd assume that was the main reason they weren't in prison**, not because of anything else. These are men who got away with it too. 

[Man gets 20 months after leaving a disabled man with serious enough injuries he's now fed through a tube](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2617589/Thug-left-college-student-wheelchair-half-head-missing-flooring-single-punch-mouthy-jailed-two-years.html)
&gt; Field had **previous convictions for assault and battery including a suspended sentence for causing actual body harm**. 

Yes, he got a prison sentence, but 20 months for life altering injuries, whereas it sound like this woman has caused no long term issues.

or - [Man who attacks two men while already serving a suspended sentence doesn't get sent to jail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2142977/Thug-attacked-men-unprovoked-assault-spared-jail-married-honeymoon.html)

definitely /r/pussypass material

[bloke smashes up taxi with hammer to attack passengers](http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hammer-wielding-thug-smashes-taxi-window-attempt/story-20814929-detail/story.html)

&gt; He had chalked up 36 previous convictions, including burglary and violence since 2004, the court heard.

&gt; Sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years

[Man beats up girlfriend (again, whilst already serving a suspended sentence) doesn't go to jail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2293284/Toby-Hayden-spared-jail-beating-Loretta-Butterworth-card-declined-cash-machine.html)

&gt; But despite being on a suspended sentence for a previous violent crime, magistrates sentenced him to an 18-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to complete an anger management course.

&gt; When police arrived to arrest Hayden, he spat in the face of one officer and tried to gouge out the eyes of another.

Imagine any of those being a women. Each and every one would have been on /r/pussypass 

I'm not saying this women shouldn't be in prison. I'm saying the fact she isn't isn't some vast conspiracy against men. Hell, I'm not even saying pussy pass is a total myth, I don't know.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt;is it possible to say to what degree charity money was used to create them?

I think it is virtually impossible to come up with any degree of value in terms of what publicly funded research has done to support them, for the very simple reason that there is a very wide amount of basic and translational science that underpins the way these biological therapies work. Without knowing the involvement of the oestrogen receptor her2/neu in the development of breast cancer, for instance, drugs like herceptin wouldn't have ever been developed as molecular targets.

The problem is that scientific research is so wide in scope and practice, that it is difficult to quantify which ones were the 'most important' in leading to the development of a biological drug. And so many people over the globe are involved in research of the fundamentally science that has little to do with patients at that stage, ascribing value is just not possible. And most scientists do not care, because they carry out research for the sake of science, and not to lord it over anyone, including pharmaceutical companies.

&gt;If it is a case of having a 'recipe' for something then we should be making generics, the same as we should be making and washing linen inside the NHS system.

But making a drug is far different to washing linen. The practice, costs and equipment involved in the latter are far less, and inferior, to the former. As much as the NHS needs to be made more efficient, there are just too many drugs, and too many people to treat, to be able to decide that the NHS should make it all themselves. If food taste bad, or linen is shredded in the machinery, little is lost. If a drug kills someone, and people sue, the outcome could severely negate the small margin we were looking to save.

Not to mention, for patented drugs like the expensive biological therapies for some cancers, the NHS would be legally prohibited from even trying to make it themselves.",0,1408212036,null,0,false,0,cjs1mpg,t3_2dpoat,t1_cjs1mpg,t1_cjs1bhh,null,1435269197,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"&gt; attacks the notion of a single homogenous Irish identity

There never has been a single homogenous Irish identity and there isn't one now; much like any country, national identity or ethnic grouping in the world. Táin Bó Cúailnge is part of the mythical saga; The Ulster Cycle speaks of interwoven warring factions in ireland, essentially about cattle raids as that was the measure of ones wealth rather than land acquisition.

&gt; Traditionally set in the 1st century AD in an essentially pre-Christian heroic age, the Táin is the central text of a group of tales known as the Ulster Cycle. It survives in three written versions or ""recensions"" in manuscripts of the 12th and later centuries, the first a compilation largely written in Old Irish, the second a more consistent work in Middle Irish, and the third an Early Modern Irish version.
&gt; 

It wasn't a simple North/South dynamic either there was multiple fluctuating alliances, over a cattle deal gone bad. 

&gt; Medb determines to get the equally potent Donn Cuailnge from Cooley to equal her wealth with her husband. She successfully negotiates with the bull's owner, Dáire mac Fiachna, to rent the animal for a year until her messengers, drunk, reveal that they would have taken the bull by force even if they had not been allowed to borrow it. The deal breaks down, and Medb raises an army, including Ulster exiles led by Fergus mac Róich and other allies, and sets out to capture Donn Cuailnge.

Co-opting Irish mythology into the loyalist narrative is akin to American's co-opting Native American culture. I guess they seek to delve into a bizarre world of [fantasy](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=274159282789030&amp;set=vb.167750270096599&amp;type=2&amp;theater) rather than face [reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster). The use of Táin Bó Cúailnge in a false origin narrative speaks more to the [fractured conspiratorial identity](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8322.00147/abstract;jsessionid=B76729AEC27EF81055AEFD61942D0AD2.f02t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) of  certain sections of ulster loyalism.

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"&gt; Fair enough. But are you saying there isn't a single person or fan who wants to see a Female Doctor?

No, I'm saying that a large portion of the fan base is dead set against it.  There is a small, but vocal group of fans that would like it.  But they seem to want it for reasons other than it being a good story.  They (not all, but many of them) also resort to shaming tactics, cries of sexism and  misogyny, whenever  someone suggests that it's a bad idea because the Doctor is an inherently male character (god forbid you actually reference [scientific studies that show real gender differences](http://samanthakatepsychology.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/david-reimer-possibly-the-most-unethical-study-in-psychological-history/)).  For that reason it is generally an unwelcome topic of discussion here.  The standard response to people who bring it up now is ""use the search function.""

&gt;Clearly, from the responses I've been getting, I should've chosen other aspects or theories to consider and analyze but it's too late for me to make changes. 

Focus on the father aspect of the character.  It is something that is under discussed and people seem to respond well when it is brought to their attention.  While there are a lot of fans that view the Doctor as a non-sexual being they do still appreciate the Doctor as an archetypal father figure.    

Something else to consider, if you have watched the old show, there is a big difference between the classic male and modern male companions.  Compare Ian to Mickey and Jack (when we first meet them).  Why do they all feel authentic, but the modern ones seem like boys, not men (Mickey is very weak and Jack is very self centered), while Ian and Steven do present themselves as men?  My guess is the [increase in fatherlessness](http://www.heritage.org/static/reportimages/FD3CE4FCBA3DEB6FC858CBC2267846B0.gif/) that has taken place over the last 50 years.

SNP have played a fairly good P.R game, allowing them to even get to what 41% at one point.

So unless we have a mod who works directly with the clubs ticket office it's impossible to verify tickets by just looking at a picture someone has sent you. Fraudsters are so good at making faking tickets that it's almost impossible to tell the difference between a real and fake ticket.

If someone from, let's say Australia was travelling to Liverpool to watch Liverpool FC play at Anfield and needed a ticket so decided to buy one from someone on this sub who turns out to be a fraudster, can you imagine what it would feel like to turn up to Anfield, inserting your ticket into the turnstile for it to then reject it because it's fake? That would be heart breaking.

It's best for people to just buy a ticket from the club directly or a travel agency.

If you're a Commonwealth citizen with grandparents born in the UK (so not if they immigrated themselves and naturalised, otherwise I imagine many more people would be eligible) you can get an ancestry visa. But most Commonwealth citizens will not have a British grandparent. It's benefitting mostly the grandchildren of the likes of ""10 pound poms"". Actually it'd be interesting to see the data as to where applications from this come from. I'd hazard a guess on it mostly being Australia, Canada and New Zealand and maybe a few from South Africa and Zimbabwe. 

People from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Hong Kong can get a youth mobility visa, but this is largely based on reciprocal arrangements rather than a direct result of being in the Commonwealth. Citizens of other countries can get this visa too, but the list is only 8 countries overall so it isn't big.

Then obviously people from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus can move to the UK with no visa issues at all because of the EU.

But this is only covering a very small number of Commonwealth citizens.

A big reason why Indians come now is the historical links. A lot of them will come on tier 4 student visas because this country is seen as good for education. For some Indian families sending their children abroad for education is a very prestigious thing in their communities. Many will know family and friends who made the move years earlier so they hear stories, and also any educated Indian speaks English to a pretty good level. Some Indians even prefer speaking English and can speak it better than their native Indian language. Moving to an English speaking country is an obvious option, especially the country that ruled their country for so long and left a pretty big mark (even if it has been covered up fairly well).

Meanwhile, 90% of them are off target and what could have been a fantastic opportunity is completely stopped dead while the guy he passed to regathers.... which quite a bit of the time is a defender that he passed it right to. 

I love Rom, but he HAS to figure out how to make the short pass more consistently. He puts himself in such a great position to create fantastic opportunities, and flounders them away too often because he misses his man. And I see it happen so often you have to think that we are missing out on invaluable goal opportunities because of it.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;There never has been a single homogenous Irish identity and there isn't one now; 

So why can loyalism have no attachment to the mythology? Who made up the Gaels? Where did they live? Who did the planters descend from?

&gt;It wasn't a simple North/South dynamic either there was multiple fluctuating alliances, over a cattle deal gone bad. 

Yet the North/South divide is a recurring theme.

&gt;Co-opting Irish mythology into the loyalist narrative is akin to American's co-opting Native American culture. I guess they seek to delve into a bizarre world of fantasy.

Irish mythology *is* fantasy...

The comparison with native America doesn't hold because the European settlers arriving did not share a common background the way many planters would have had with the 'natives'. 

Still, it's probably the first time I've read an Irish nationalist try to argue that their version of fantasy is more realistic than someone else's. A first, not a surprising one, and filled with a predictable arrogance culminating in your closing link.

Undoubtedly Irish Gaelic mythology is a small part of loyalist symbolism, but it will always have a place. Dismissing it because it doesn't fit with the 'loyalists were invented in 1690' element within Irish nationalism doesn't advance any cause.

true,nzxth2,smith,Smith,"I am not an expert, but I will try to answer your questions. (Beware of name/day/time of the doctor spoilers)  
1.) They don't want to kill all civilians, but they will blow up the planet if the doctor speaks his name, to prevent war. So the doctor doesn't stay to protect the planet from the church (since he doesn't plan to say his name) but rather to protect them from all the aliens who are trying to invade the planet because of the signal.  
2.) I guess they=aliens flying around trenzalore? The time lords were at war with the daleks before the time war ended, so if they came back at Trenzalore, they would be instantly confronted with tons of aliens, including daleks. You think they won't start the time war anew?  
3.) Thats a tricky one and there is no real answer to this. Maybe his tardis can't carry a whole town or even a planet. Who knows? Maybe it would be impossible to convince all people to step into his tardis (he was a stranger to them at the beginning).

That is correct.

&gt; So if Scotland becomes an independent nation, they will not be able to discriminate against the rest of the UK students as they have done since the introduction of tuition fees.

That is incorrect.

Scotland would be able to charge all students the same fee and award a residency-based grant to students who had lived in Scotland for N years previously (effectively subsidising higher education for students permanently living Scotland, irrespective of their citizenship).

&gt; This may eventually require Scotland to introduce tuition fees for all students since rest of UK students provide a healthy subsidy.

This season expect Matic (Serbian terror #2) to be a stalwart defensive midfielder and Fabregas to act as a deep-lying playmaker. 

Hazard is our left winger as you probably already know. Oscar will play in the hole. The final right wing position is up for grabs between Willian and Schuerrle. They are both excellent, so healthy competition will suit the club. 

Diego Costa will lead the line as our lone striker. He's a monster.

I just don't like to see some little old lady miss out on paying less for more stuff.  I won't mention it if it's more, even its a great deal as they might be like me, shopping on a tight budget and I don't want to draw attention to it.

I do think however, most of the time it's just there's an offer on, and I don't think it's a malicious, planned fraud attempt by the corporations, it's just an offer.

I'm a bit more annoyed about Poundland so proudly selling Warburtons sliced bread for £1, but quietly keeping the '600g' fact in small print at the bottom.  Most people will just buy it thinking it's a full size loaf, but you can go to any supermarket and nearly all loaves are 800g, Poundland just has the buying power to have smaller packs made to fit their price point.

However, they do also have a big rance of 'Belkin' branded USB3 and HMDI cables, so I'm willing to let them off, as they're often a fiver or more online.

I don't think arming the Kurds is a good solution. Our NATO allies Turkey wouldn't like it for one. It's a complex situation but doesn't mean we should be hamstrung.

&gt;What lobbying can people do? I'm interested to hear this.

&gt;Israel have done this many times with actual proof and many of their actions right now can be legally considered genocide. 

I've no interest in whattaboutery between those two sides, I've no real interest in either of them. But clearly the actions of IS are having a far worse impact than the two of them put together.

&gt;I'm yet to see proof that Hamas are using Palestinians as human shields, but go ahead and provide some proof and I'm happy enough to be corrected on that.

&gt;Stop blockading 1.8 million people and you'll see Hamas disappear fairly quickly. 

Catholics have had full rights for a good few decades here in NI, still waiting on the convicted murderers to disappear from the political scene.

&gt;Desposing of Saddam Hussein was not your responsibility nor the responsibility of the west. 

We did it though, so we have a degree of responsibility in the future direction of the country. Anything else would be living in denial.

&gt;It was *never* about Hussein, 

If they had a democratically elected, non-genocidal leader do you think we would still have had the 2nd gulf war?

&gt;it was about oil money and spheres of influence. 

That's what I meant when I said strategic...
