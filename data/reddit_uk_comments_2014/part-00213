[and talking about Reid and Ravel.](http://talksport.com/football/video-absolute-genius-ex-man-united-striker-140721102844)

And people wonder why I think we may be in for a serious relegation scrap. Sullivan voluntarily calls into a late night Talksport show and more or less throws Sam under the bus. He questions Sam's judgement publicly,  and goes on to say, and I paraphrase, 'but we back our managers because that's what we do. Sam makes the calls...'. 

Ergo, we start the season with Half pint Dave picking the scab on the anti Sam brigade's just healed wound, he has expressed middling to low confidence in Sam's judgement across the board,  the manager begins the season under obvious pressure from management but now from the fans as well who will begin the season stressed out before a ball is kicked, and he's made it clear that Sam and the board have clear and important disagreements on how the team should be run. I ask myself, why didn't they sack him then? Just so that they can say we're not the sacking types? Because he's clearly got the noose around Sam's neck. If they intend to hang him, it would have been better to start with a clean slate before the season starts.

This is also a good way to get scholarships if you applied to university and didn't receive any, and can't otherwise afford college.

The real difference between institutes with good academically challenging courses and tedious baby sitting is whether or not the student body can handle a difficult course. If a lecturer can teach a challenging course, they almost always will - because it's more fun to watch your students improve.

true,iamaravind,lfc12,,"Rodgers has done well to invest the Suarez cash into a squad approach rather than into one or two marquee signings. Buying big name stars for big amounts does add proven quality to the team, but it puts tremendous pressure on them to succeed, and makes it almost a guarantee that they'll have to be one of the first names on the team sheet to justify the large outlay. Some cope well with it (Ronaldo, Bale, Aguero), while others fail under the pressure to succeed, failing to adapt, leading to the detriment of the team (Carrol, Torres, Shevshenko).

By spreading the investment throughout the sqaud, we're signing players that are yes, not world class, but those who have talent and have the potential to be. It strengthens the overall team, and has existing players, like Sterling, Sakho and Coutinho, under scrutiny to earn their place in the team. Of all the signings we have made, not one is a guaranteed starter, safe for Lallana maybe, and that means every single player in the squad has a chance to make it into the starting 11. Big motivation for a player, knowing that if they perform well in training and put in some, good hard work to impress the gaffer, they earn themselves the opportunity to start. This translates to having the best, most hungriest players starting, with some solid options off the bench. much more collective talent then we ever had last year.

Pretty shrewd work by Rodgers, and I'm hoping to see it pay off. Also I'm stoked to see that Raheem has matured well after his early problems, and isn't getting all caught up in his newfound fame, unlike a certain Jack at Arsenal. After giving the most exciting perfomance by a English youngster in a world cup since Owen in '98, he's straight back to work aiming to stake his place in the lineup.

Boots Oxford St (the one near HMV) is best for drugstore brands, along with the Superdrug down by Selfridges. Superdrug is good for **MUA and Makeup Revolution** (if it's made it instore by the time you get here). Both shops sell the usual range of **Loreal, Maybelline, Revlon, Rimmel, Barry M, Models Own, Sleek etc.** Boots also have **17 and No 7**.

The massive Topshop at Oxford Circus is a bit like the seventh circle of hell, but on the ground floor they have a massive selection of **Topshop brand makeup** (it's good stuff). They also have a Beauty Mart concession but that stuff is all horribly overpriced.

Try John Lewis for **Lipstick Queen, mid range brands like Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, Benefit and Japonesque**. Debenhams and House of Fraser stock the usual mid range brands, that's where you need to go for **Urban Decay**.

Next on oxford st stocks **NYX** though it's a reduced range, the stand is usually half empty and a mess, and it's quite expensive.

Then hit Selfridges (on Oxford st down towards marble arch) for **Illamasqua, Mac, Charlotte Tilbury, Shu Uemura (sp??), NARS and other mid to high end brands**. As well as the beauty room there's the Beauty Workshop which sells stuff like OCC, and some lovely skincare brands. 

If you are after the pricier stuff like **By Terry, Diptique and Chantecaille**, try Space NK on South Molton St near Boots.

For **Inglot** you'll have to head out to Westfield Shepherds Bush.

What exactly is the concern here? That people will doxx you to your boss? The fact that you were concerned people would go out of their way to ruin your life *before you even made the post* indicates that you already knew it would raise hackles.

Plus anybody who was determined enough could doxx you anyway. All they'd need to do would be to feign interest via PM and get the details.

I suspect that's largely down to your original posting. You acknowledge that you dislike seeing posts like this on Reddit, but then continued to give yourself an exception and posted it anyway.

You said:
&gt;bad science

These are taken from the scientific articles I posted much earlier on. Which you have clearly just disregarded:
&gt;**There was an increased risk of any psychotic outcome in individuals who had ever used cannabis** (pooled adjusted odds ratio=1·41, 95% CI 1·20—1·65). Findings were consistent with a dose-response effect, with greater risk in people who used cannabis most frequently (2·09, 1·54—2·84).

.
&gt;Some 60% of participants had used cannabis by the age of 20; 7% were daily users at that point. Daily use in young women was **associated with an over fivefold increase in the odds of reporting a state of depression and anxiety** after adjustment for intercurrent use of other substances (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 12). **Weekly or more frequent cannabis use in teenagers predicted an approximately twofold increase in risk for later depression and anxiety (1.9, 1.1 to 3.3)** after adjustment for potential baseline confounders.

.

&gt;Frequent cannabis use in teenage girls **predicts later depression and anxiety, with daily users carrying the highest risk.** Given recent increasing levels of cannabis use, measures to reduce frequent and heavy recreational use seem warranted.

I am not just saying all of this stuff to be contrary, there is a genuine risk there. It seems like you won't acknowledge that fact. If you're going to keep smoking, at least look into it a little bit and make an informed decision about weather you want to risk negative effects in later life.",0,1406275545,null,0,false,0,cj7a8ob,t3_2bkksg,t1_cj7a8ob,t1_cj6u1ew,null,1434890484,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However, I'm going to go ahead and place it here. First, I'm all for equal rights and freedom of choice and accepting responsibility for our decisions. 

In my opinion, the single biggest problem with feminism, is the name ""feminism"". I'm for equal rights, but I'd never call myself a feminist. Language is incredibly important - it's the universal way of communicating our ideas, thoughts and opinions. 

Using the word ""feminism"" to communicate the idea of equal rights and gender equality is equivalent to using the term ""carrotism"" in advocacy of equal rights for vegetables - it's got inherent bias from the outset. The [etymology of the word feminism](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feminism#Etymology) shows that it's derived from the Latin for ""woman"". That's not very equal or unbiased.

Language is commonly the first impression of an idea. People can say all they want that *""feminism isn't just about women being angry at men, or women needing protection, or men needing equal rights, it's about gender equality and neutrality""*. However, if that *truly* is the case, and they are for gender equality in all contexts and on all levels, then, in my opinion, they've fallen at the first hurdle of picking a suitable name. 

I'll always be a supporter of equal rights, but I simply refuse to associate with feminism because it has gender bias in it's name. I believe it shows a total lack of understanding of the importance of language, and I'm sceptical of joining any cause that doesn't subscribe to the basic concepts of communication (e.g. pick words that actually represent what you're trying to convey).

Asian people don't lack the genes, in fact they often contain more copies or mutated higher effieicny versions of alcohol dehydrogenase, which results in alcohol metabolizing into acetaldehyde faster than in Europeans.

Also you are arguing effects of doseage, without bother into looking into it. You just say ""it effects you more than alcohol"". Marijuana can have quite high effects over a shorter period than alcohol, that is true. It is also more transitory, where you come back down to a more normal level far more quickly than with alcohol.

Its not fair to equate people who are heavily inebriated on one drug, with an unquantified amount of inebriation with another drug. You are fucking joking if you think drink driving is any better than stoned driving. You are right in that neither should be done though.

I agree with you about the importance of language use. Like everything else, feminism has to be called something - we need to know what we are talking about. Whatever it is called will quickly become a pejorative in some peoples' understandings. More to the point people need to be better educated especially about their own interests beyond the limited understandings of popularist politics.

For what it's worth, in my view many of the gender constructs and their effects in our society do not work in the best interests of men nor anyone other than vested economic interests.

That all said, I hope he's given a chance. I'd feel like an asshole writing him off without seeing him have a proper fair crack at it (which I would argue he hasn't really, yet).

I think if we persist with the 3-5-2, he is going to struggle, though. Can he do a similar job to Bacuna on the other flank? Do we really want to play wingers on both sides and effectively risk constantly exposing our defenders? Hard to say. Against some opposition, it seems like a good shout maybe. Teams with slow/no wingers, or not very good midfield presence... we can probably make it work.

For me, N'Zogbia seems to do better in a wide midfield/forward role where he has less defensive responsibility (think how Bent does well with adequate support around him, but struggles when given the responsibility to drop off and get the ball etc etc). So he'd fare better in a 4-5-1/4-3-3 imo, out on the left. However, you could argue his strengths are mostly related to his direct running, and he'd benefit from a deeper starting position. Overall, I think he might suffer from the same issue Albrighton (and to a lesser extent, Bent) did, in the sense that they are good enough to get into the team, but might not really fit Lambert's preferred system because of playing style.

I think it's also fair to say we haven't seen the best of him in a Villa shirt. We know he can do better. Whether or not he will... the jury is out. I'm willing to give him he benefit of the doubt though. Because frankly, we're gonna need all the contributions we can get from players like N'Zogbia/Bent etc. Those talented guys we have in the squad who just haven't really delivered under Lambert for whatever reason (mostly tactical reasons, imo, but what do I know, right?)

To me it sounds like its a bunch of kids with irresponsible parents. Don't stoop to their level and definitely don't shout or have a go at them, it'll only egg them on. Any interaction needs to be dealt solely with their parents. 

An alternative is to try and get on the friendly side of the parents, if they are here for the long run these sorts of things could drag out for months, if not years, even with police / council intervention.

Thanks, I really appreciate you accept that, assuming you label yourself a feminist, I hope you can accept that not all ""feminists"" are as accepting of the other side as you (although, admittedly, a lot are).

&gt;  agree with you about the importance of language use. Like everything else, feminism has to be called something - we need to know what we are talking about.

I agree entirely, but using the word ""feminism"" has connotations of favouring women. Without being able to read each others minds, all we have to go on is what language means. We can't just take already established words like ""femin*"" and then say ""okay, this is now going to mean equally men and women"" and expect it not to cause problems. The word ""feminism"" is incredibly controversial, and in the context of gender equality, rightly so in my opinion (for the reasons in my original post).

You're right, it does  have to be called something, so why not call it ""equal rights for genders"" or ""genderism""?

I think people who label themselves feminists are fighting an uphill battle, and they'd make life far easier for themselves, their advocates, and their opponents, if they just dropped the name.

&gt; For what it's worth, in my view many of the gender constructs and their effects in our society do not work in the best interests of men nor anyone other than vested economic interests.

Hmmm. I don't know much about the wage gap issue. But my view is that people should be paid according to their work. If, for example, they're not working because they chose to go have a baby, or look after their baby, they should be paid accordingly - regardless of gender. If they can't offer the same level of experience or practice at a job because they've spent the last few months looking after a baby, then they should be paid accordingly - guy or girl. If, for whatever reason, in e.g. a manual labour job, there's certain roles and jobs they can't do for physiological reason (I suppose some might call them ""biotruths"") then they should be paid accordingly. People shouldn't be set back in life because of their gender, but they shouldn't be allowed a free ride ether.

I really appreciate you seem pretty open minded and diplomatic about these things though, so kudos for that.",0,1406278440,null,0,false,0,cj7aukn,t3_2bo6cx,t1_cj7aukn,t1_cj7amgc,null,1434890755,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Women want equal pay? They should have it.  As long as they're doing an equal job.

E.g if I work in a bar and can lift a 50lb keg, if a woman wants my job she should be able to do the same.

I'm 100% for equality. But it's a bit daft when women complain that they're confined to 'pink collar' jobs and  being a cleaner or caterer when the male counterpart is being a binman or hard manual labour.

Go to any established forum with experienced bikers (presumably above the average age on here) and they'll tell you the same.

1. Don't get a new 125 on finance, you'll want a big bike within 6 months and you'll be lumped with paying for a depreciating bike. 

2. I don't understand this subreddits obsession with Chinese bikes. Logically why would you pay £1500 for something that will be worth 200 in scrap in 12 months. People say they're either good or awful. No, they're all awful. You'll find people defending them barely ride them and/or are under 18 and trying to defend their regretful purchase (didn't we all at that age). 

3. Do not look at review sites as you'll find a lot of reviews are simply people trying to defend their purchase. Look on forums for discussions and negative comments, especially regarding Chinese bikes. Saying that, any major brand jap bike, cg125, ybr125 etc is a steadfast purchase.

Example. Within the past 3 years me and my friends have bought 5 jap bikes all under £1000. Every single one of these has made us money when sold. Now unless you're willing to buy a set of basic tools and a Haynes manual, I don't recommend going £300-£800 but there a huge amount of £800-£1500 bikes in almost new condition that will hold if not appreciate in price. Bikes that are run in and actually ready to ride. pppphhh's point about fitting an alarm is spot on too, a small alarm tucked under the seat along with a couple of locks and chains are a must for commuting.

Given that women have been largely invisible throughout history I find no problem with this, no more than I would have with any other forms of affirmative action (nor come to that with providing wheelchair bound people with ramps in shopping centres etc).

&gt;I don't know much about the wage gap issue.

It's well-worth researching that one (causes and effects).

Many jobs/careers remain gendered perhaps partly because women remain largely responsible for child caring and rearing. (And of course biology makes the issue of choosing to have children complex).

Lots of manual jobs are now open to women (like driving big trucks power assisted brakes and so on) I think it's the well paying jobs/careers that show up the pay gap - there are apparently only three areas which show no pay discrimination

But the main thing is that it can act as a gateway into well-paid careers in industry and business.

The fact is that women are _choosing_ not to study these subjects. It is absolutely immoral to enforce some kind of wage control just because people want to make easier choices.

[Pleased to meet you] (http://69.161.156.57/aboutme/index.html)

&gt; Apologies to the whole sub if it raised hackles as you say, but it's what I do and I'm going to do it.

But do you have to do it *here* and do you have to do it *in that way*? That's what people are asking you to think about . I was going to use that bloke who kept using this sub to promote his club nights as an example, but I can't see any of the posts anymore, so I think the mods may have deleted them as spam. 

Posting about companies and events you're personally involved with is a bit like editing your own Wikipedia article. It's not forbidden, but it's discouraged by the community because it's harder to be objective. For example, despite working in events marketing, I've never posted about my own projects here, because I don't want to accidentally cross that line. (Although I do always do a little victory dance when stuff I've been working on makes it to this sub independently.)

&gt; People use Reddit to search for work and search for employees all the time without posting personal / company details in the thread they're posting

Not in this sub as a general rule. We're /r/brum, not /r/UKjobs. You have to tailor the message to the audience.

&gt; Perhaps, but then at least I could look into them in return.

I doubt anybody who was *that* invested in being a dickhead would give you legit details.

&gt; Well yes they do - I haven't asked for any money.

The thing you have to remember is that the type of scam we're talking about *don't* ask for money up front. They bang on about how great the workplace is, while carefully not listing any experience or qualification requirements for the role so as to cast the broadest possible net. They then engage with interested parties one-on-one, getting them more and more optimistic and invested in the possibility of the role. Then when the mark has got to the point of telling their family that this new job is nearly in the bag and maybe they can go on holiday this year after all, that's when the scammer mentions that the candidate will need to take a entry test at home which requires them buying some specialised software. Or that a background check is required which the candidate must pay for. Or that they need your bank details before you sign a contract so that they can speed things up with Payroll.  Or that they need to purchase training materials. The list of variations is endless.

These type of scams are a massive and predatory industry and they tend to target people via things like Craigslist and Gumtree. The thought of them trying to use local subreddit isn't much of a stretch. Honestly the thing that makes me think you're for real isn't the content of your post, but your *spelling*.

&gt; There's one thing I've learned from all this though - in future postings I will specify there will be no charges to apply for the role or work at the company ever.

Or just give enough details about the role and company that nobody jumps to conclusions in the first place. :) 

&gt; fair point - but that's an awful lot of work

I'd say it would have been *less* work. It would have been quicker to type than your initial post and would have provided greater long-term value to everybody on the sub.

&gt; I feel it'd be better explained over a pint, face to face.

Well, that's what meet-ups are for, assuming you're happy letting us know who you are IRL.

Research is usually grant funded or commercially funded, but most grants won't cover things like the power or water used over the course of a project or any of the maintenance of the buildings/locations used (even when they are pure used for a specific project). All of that has to come from the tuition fee pot as well. Not to mention all the administrative staff required to keep the place running. 

This means that many universities, in spite of charging 3x the amount to the student are actually considerably worse off financially.

The only thing stopping you supporting feminism is the *name*?

I always thought feminism was called that because ""feminine"" ways of thinking and acting were looked down on and scorned, including guys who supported equal rights or those who opted out of the accepted gender roles. I also think the name ""feminism"" reflects the fact that historically it has been a hell of a lot better to be a man. It just recognises that the movement is inextricably linked to women.

I mean, look at how often a discussion on women's issues gets derailed by guys comparing it to guy things instead of discussing the issue at hand (and it happens a lot outside of reddit too). Like saying we shouldn't call it feminism, cause then girls are getting attention. Calling it feminism keeps the focus on those issues and expresses a rejection of patriarchal ideals for both men and women. Giving it a different name assumes we are already equal, and while there are issues for both genders guys still have it a lot better *IN GENERAL*.

Absolutely not, for the vast majority of people, the Scottish system is better.

&gt; but for some specialised subject areas you really need to go to England and then you'll get hit with the full whack.

But 99% of people will want to study the standard stuff like languages and science, so it's hardly a great idea for everyone to pay 3,500, so that a select group of people can study an esoteric subject in England. Besides, the top unis like Edinburgh and St. Andrews have some pretty specialised courses as well..

&gt; Also it's good to get away from home when you're 18.

Scotland is not a city, you can go pretty far away if you want to.

All in all, free education &gt;&gt;&gt; capped fee education. But yeah, the English are getting fucked pretty hard, the Welsh system definitely sounds more appealing than the current state of affairs.

true,Thanateros,null,null,"&gt;Dear Thanateros

&gt;Thank you for writing to me regarding the government’s emergency legislation on communication data and interception; I understand your concern at the rushed nature of the proposals.

&gt;As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse.

&gt;In order to prevent this, UK legislation needs to change to be compliant with EU law. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer. The House is only due to sit this week and Monday and Tuesday next week before it rises for the summer recess. As such the Government has come forward with emergency legislation; in considering the Government’s proposals, Labour believe it is essential to maintain the security of our citizens and also ensure people’s privacy is protected.

&gt;Serious criminal investigations and counter terrorism intelligence operations must not be jeopardised. That is why I support this emergency legislation which I accept is designed solely to protect existing capabilities.

&gt;However, given the limited Parliamentary time to discuss emergency legislation Labour has ensured that the Government’s legislation is temporary and it will expire in 2016. This will require the Government and Parliament to properly consult on and consider longer term proposals next year.

&gt;Labour has also now secured agreement to our proposal for a major independent review of the legal framework governing data access and interception (the RIPA review we called for earlier this year) in the light of the huge changes in technology.

&gt;This review will enable longer term questions and concerns to be properly dealt with and debated in time for new legislation. Changes will then follow. Labour has also called for and secured further safeguards to restrict the ways in which communications data and intercept can be used to prevent misuse.

&gt;As it happens I will not be voting tomorrow. My sister is gravely ill and I am in Gloucestershire with my family.

&gt;Best wishes

&gt;Rt Hon Dame Joan Ruddock MP

All the problems that men face are a result of the patriarchy.  Because society has a negative view on femininity and female gender roles, when a man takes on aspects of femininity, they are looked down upon. 

 If a man isn't being a full-blown aggressive alpha male, then they are ""being a pussy"".  The whole ""only men can commit rape"" thing is an example of that - no-one can believe that a woman raped a man, because the idea of a woman overpowering a man is apparently laughable (and also why male sexual assault victims are less likely to report it).

In that sense feminism is inseparable from its etymology because the reality is that society is male-centric, and all problems stem from the fact that the system sees women as the lesser sex..

There's only three reasons a business opens an office/factory/whatever in a country:

* 1) It has to by law in order to sell
* 2) It gains tax benefits by doing so
* 3) It can access cheap/good value labour
* 4) It accesses specialist knowledge unrivaled elsewhere

Blair's and New Labour's strategy was basically to do 2 and 4. By making it beneficial in terms of tax, by ensuring the country has a good level of education and by making labour laws relatively relaxed it means there's a good reason for companies to open shop in the UK.

They probably wont open huge manufacturing plants here, but they will open up financial centres, offices for designers and engineers, test centres, drugs companies, head office builds etc.

Basically any type of job that values quality over quantity in it's staff.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; The only thing stopping you supporting feminism is the name?

No, the only thing stopping me identifying with or labelling myself as a feminist is the name. As I said, I support most of what equal rights feminists say.

I'm very much of the view that we don't resolve issues by finger pointing, blaming or playing the victim. We discuss things in a neutral and diplomatic way, being respectful and avoiding antagonising the other side, adopting principles of charity and humanity.

Favouring one gender instantly puts the other gender on the defensive, and in my opinion, rightly so. If we accept females are oppressed, the logical conclusion is that males are the oppressors. That is a blanket statement which forces all those males who don't oppress (and those who, through their own ignorance, don't realise they oppress) into a defensive position.

&gt; look at how often a discussion on women's issues gets derailed by guys comparing it to guy things instead of discussing the issue at hand

That happens because the choice of ""feminism"" for an equal rights movement implies that women need it more, so are the victim, and if you're a man, you're an oppressor. If I were to pick out a random Muslim, and call him a terrorist because he's a Muslim and some terrorists are Muslim, I would expect him to get irate and defensive. So why, when accusing innocent men of being oppressors, simply because they are men and some oppressors are men, would you expect them to behave in a non defensive way?

Whataboutism is a Tu quotue logical fallacy, so I'm not saying guys derailing those arguments are accurate or right, but I think it's entirely understandable and expected they would feel the need to defend themselves. So given that it's expected and semi-understandable that a particular approach will lead to a negative and defensive stance, what is there to gain by sticking with that approach?

My point is, perhaps the cause of ""equal rights for genders"" would achieve more with a label other than feminism because:

a) ""feminism"" has literal and historical meaning that directly contradicts it's modern cause of for equal rights.

b) ""feminism"" implicitly assigns roles to individuals based on their gender, again, contradicting the underlying cause.

b) ""feminism"" has become a loaded term adopted by other causes, muddying the identification of feminism as an equal rights movement, leading to more arguments.",0,1406283207,null,0,false,0,cj7br9e,t3_2bo6cx,t1_cj7br9e,t1_cj7b9y6,null,1434891185,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

Perhaps if you read some Germaine Greer or Gloria Steinem you may feel less like this.

Sorry if that sounds like I'm being a dick about it - but the argument that that loud voices drown out other information doesn't wash - your education is your own responsibility.

Also the idea that some people can represent the whole of one gender or another kind of reenforces the idea that there's some difference there.

What we have is some *people* who are dicks - we already knew that, so lets ignore them just the same as we do with relious zealots and racists and that and move on to a more adult dialog.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"A few points, largely because I'm extremely pessimistic about the 'recovery' anyway, and also because I largely think that both economists and the mainstream press are morons who are completely missing the bigger picture.

*  GDP per capita (I think GDP is a fucking useless measure, but this at least puts it a bit into perspective) is still quite far behind it's peak.  I'd be willing to take bets that it won't hit that peak again by, say, 2030.  Or ever.

*  The rest of the developed nations on this [list](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtUcRENCUAARyKY.jpg) are doing relatively badly.  Even Germany with it's much lauded export economy.  Why are we doing so well?  Why are we different?  I would suggest that it's because our economy is dominated by the service industry, and the service industry in particular is dominated by retail, finance and property.  Given that asset prices are presently sky high thanks to insanely low interest rates/QE in the states, I would expect that there's been significant growth in finance and property industry largely driven by this.  Retail also appears to have grown, in tandem with consumer debt.

*  The fact that the rest of the developed world is still in a slump is not good.  There's really no such thing as the 'British Economy'.  Everything is too tightly integrated and networked, so much of what we do here is dependant on microchips being manufactured in China, or ore mined in Brazil or what have you.  There is only the global economy, which has a local expression in Britain.  The global economy, as a whole, is still in a mess (witness market tremors over some obscure bank in portugal missing a bond payment).  Therefore we are in a mess.

*  George Osborne is *not* in control of the economy.  Nobody is, since it's a complex adaptive system that basically appeared by itself.  We may have built it, but there were no plans and we do **not** understand it.  Saying he's responsible for the recovery is like saying labour were responsible for either the boom years in the late 90's or the crash in the early 2000's, a nice illusion but nothing more.  At best government policy is probably a second order effect, I think the US Fed's policies have much more influence on our economy than those of the BofE.

*  The big picture is that oil is now likely supply constrained, China is outbidding the EU and US for oil since they can afford a higher marginal cost than we can, the high prices required for sources like shale oil and ultra deep water oil are likely around the area that will drive advanced economies back into recession.  Economies can't pay unlimited prices for oil, much as economists seem to think they can, and we're quite close to the demand destruction threshold now (just like the oil price crash after 2009).  Passing that threshold will play merry hell with global energy production and the economy, since energy fundamentally drives the economy.  Shale oil will likely be a victim of this, since the cashflows in the US shale industry are pretty bad and they're laden with debt.  Without shale oil, global oil production has basically peaked and will start declining.

*  Globally, we're probably in another bubble.  If it should violently pop at some point in the next few years, the results are very likely to be utterly catastrophic due to the highly interlinked and unstable nature of the system we are now firmly embedded in.

So while we might get a few quarters of growth here and there in various places, I don't take particular comfort in them, because the entire system is one giant rube goldberg machine which is liable to blow up in our face any time now.",0,1406284219,null,0,false,0,cj7byfh,t3_2blqkp,t1_cj7byfh,t3_2blqkp,null,1434891278,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

See, if I own the printing press for a currency, let's call it TMD (TheMania Dollar), there is **no one** that is a safer entity to loan TMDs to than me. This is because no matter what I do with the printing press it'll affect you all the same *no matter who* you loan to, everyone else may default in addition to that risk, therefore for any given interest rate you'd sooner lend to me than anyone else.

Now the Bank of England ensures that banks are loaning to people at an interest rate of its choosing, currently ~0% for short term debt. Therefore, if the government wants to borrow on a short term basis, it too can borrow at 0% interest. Therefore it never needs to print. It can simply fund itself by selling short term bonds, there'll be no shortage of people willing to buy them. How can there be? Loaning pounds to the UK government is the *safest possible thing* you can do with them.

As it's assured of lenders, the UK government never actually has to print currency. It can simply fund itself by printing bonds instead, just as it's always done.

&gt; Despite the rounds of QE since 2008 most UK bonds are still held by private investors and overseas funds so the UK could still be vulnerable to a 'sovereign debt crisis' if confidence collapsed.

&gt;Also, spending time at a consistent high-speed, even with all the additional drag, is often more efficient than lots of energy-wasting decelerating and accelerating; many people get better fuel consumption on motorways than the do on smaller and more stop-start roads.

This paragraph needs to be clarified. Operating at a constant high speed is more efficient than stop-start operation. 

Operating at a high speed A for long periods, which is higher than high speed B, is less efficient than operating at high speed B for long periods.

I've never said men are oppressors, I'll always say that men are *favoured* though. I'm not sure I've seen many regular feminists refer to being oppressed. Again, the name choice reflects the fact that men are favoured in society.

&gt;If I were to pick out a random Muslim, and call him a terrorist because he's a Muslim and some terrorists are Muslim, I would expect him to get irate and defensive. So why, when accusing innocent men of being oppressors, simply because they are men and some oppressors are men, would you expect them to behave in a non defensive way?

Who is accusing all men of being oppressors? Nobody does this. As i said, men are *favoured* and recognising that just shows a bit of sensitivity. It's like when a discussion on rape or something comes up and *so many* guys are quick to point out that not all men are rapists. Why?? *We know*. The point is that there's an issue here but for some reason these guys take it personally, even when it's specifically made clear that not all men are the target.

It honestly baffles me why so many guys think they are suspected rapists/mysogynists/violent, and feel the need to point out the fact that they're not at the slightest opportunity. It reminds me of ""Nice Guys"".

&gt; but I think it's entirely understandable and expected they would feel the need to defend themselves

Derails regularly happen in discussions where no man is being accused of anything. I honestly think a lot of guys are threatened by feminism or think it's some kind of zero-sum game where if a minority gains a right then men have to lose one.

I guess you can call it what you want if you're pro-equality, but in my experience people who decide to call it something else are trying to be smartasses. If someone asks me if im a feminist I'll say ""yeah, why not"" and outline what I believe, and discussion is what's important i guess.

&gt;How can an intelligent discourse between a moderate man and a moderate feminist take place, whilst a third shrieking feminist is constantly accusing that man of rape / patriachy / oppression at every turn?

Simple - you ignore them - the choice to give that voice any credence is yours and yours alone.

&gt;  I don't think the idiot feminists are feminism 

Agreed... so why do you then consider them to have any place or validity in the debate at all and to colour your opinion on the subject - surely they're irrelevant?

&gt; I believe in the cause - but it's not my responsibility to do anything.

Again, sorry to be a dick - but this is exactly what's wrong with our political discourse:

A general philosophy, oh dear protect the children! I doubt it would change that much at all, those who want to smoke it already do anyway.

&gt;I don't see how legalising it is going to add an age limit.

Simply, you put it in licensed shops and you have to show ID to buy it. I'm not claiming that it will end under-age drug use, nothing *ever* will. But trust me, it is much easier to buy cannabis off the street as a teenager than it is alcohol or cigarettes. Legalisation would improve the situation, not cure it or make it worse.

&gt;I don't understand the freeing prison space up argument, should we also release other people who've done non-violent crimes for the benefit of society?

It depends on the crime, for possessing small amounts of drugs I say, yes of course. How would you feel if you were vilified and punished for drinking a beer at home?

&gt; The benefit of putting people in prison is that it deters people from using drugs, which is a benefit to society.

It really doesn't deter people though does it? Look at alcohol prohibition in America, alcohol consumption (and deaths from poisoning) actually rose once it was banned. Drug use in the west has steadily risen since the war on drugs began; prohibition simply doesn't work.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt; Personally I think that the potential victims should absolutely be warned of the possible dangers and advised as to what they themselves can do to minimise the risk.

Nothing at all wrong with pointing out that being drunk makes you vulnerable. I really don't think this poster is actually serving that purpose though. It just provides a statistic and leaves you to draw your own conclusions. 

The problem with making the victims feel guilty is that they are much less likely to report or seek conviction as they will believe that they are to blame or that they will not be taken seriously if they go to the police. It also instils the idea in the minds of the public (including potential jurors) that victims of rape who have been drinking are somehow less legitimate than those who haven't.

You have to make it clear that there are things you can do to reduce the risk, but at the same time that if you fail to protect yourself, you are not responsible for the act and the person who is needs to be brought to justice. Bear in mind that, in all likelihood, a sober woman is unlikely to be much of a match for a determined rapist anyway. After all, according to the poster 2 out of 3 rapes occur when the victim hasn't even been drinking. 

Rapists aren't a force of nature. They are people who know exactly what they are doing and are doing it on purpose.

This reductionist way of thinking about things as vast and complex about different waves of feminism/post-feminism/feminist-theory/gender-theory, etc is a bit silly. 

Often reddit-users go around calling people shitlords, cis-scum, and other buzzwords as a way of high-fiving themselves for being on an in-joke about feminism, but this whole view of feminism they're mocking is taking from places like Tumblr instead of actual academic discourse on the matter.

&gt;These tumblr shits are claiming a different definition for what it means to be a feminist than the mainstream.

You see, this is where I disagree. I don't think they actually are doing this, and I think you'd struggle to find any definition made by someone from Tumblr that is in any way taken seriously by anyone in academia. I think that certain tumblr-users are often engaging others provocatively in debates around certain structuralist ideas in a very shallow way, and I do think that this provocation often gets people riled up and upset. 

For example, this is the top post of all time from /r/tumblrinaction

http://i.imgur.com/JDhMnr2.jpg

and it's someone with a 'brilliant comeback' to someone's observation that these four Disney princesses, who are supposed to be representing the four seasons, are all white. The comeback essentially talks about how these Disney princesses are all based on fairytales with caucasian protaganists. Well, obviously. But that isn't the point really is it? The actual overreaching issue is the lack of diversity in Disney princesses who often serve as role-models for young girls. Of course there are princesses like Pocahontas and Jasmine, but these princesses bring their own issues about depictions of race, which have been debated and discussed extensively in the world of academia (and especially feminist academia). Richard M. Breaux is one author who has written a fair about about depictions of race in Disney, and there are others such as Sarita Gregory and Richard King who all write accessible, interesting, and intelligent essays on the subject.

Of course the 'brilliant comeback' misses the whole actual point of the original posters observation about the whiteness of the princesses and the lack of racial minority princesses, and instead boils their observation to an imagined slip-of-the-mind by the posted, who obviously must not have understood that the princesses themselves are from white countries! Hah! What an idiot eh?

This might seem like its gone on a bit of a tangent, but the point is that people, and especially redditors, are projecting their own idea of what they want/think a 'tumblr feminist' should be, and then they're attacking that, instead of actually thinking about what they're saying and attempting to engage with it in a critical way. It's very easy to do this, especially online, and especially in a place like Reddit where minority opinions are often effectively silenced due to the voting system. 

People look at images such as 'I need feminism because...' and attack the actual sentence on the card itself, instead of engaging with the ideas behind it.

I think redditors often congratulate themselves by calling themselves 'eglaitarian' or 'humanist', saying they ignore gender now, and that they look past it because they're above such petty things. But in reality? Gender, sex, and depictions of both in media are huge issues which change the way to interact with media all the time. And I think these issues need to be thought about, studies, discussed, and debated, so that we may have a better understanding on the issue itself.

&gt;The problem being that from an objective standpoint you have to accept both definitions as they both call themselves feminists.

Do we? Do we have the accept both definitions really? I mean, the issue here is that I don't think anyone actually could give me a definition of 'tumblr-feminism' that a majority of people would accept and agree upon, whereas 'feminsim' itself has a pretty clear-cut definition that many MANY people agree upon. One movement may attempt to differentiate itself by saying it's a certain 'wave' of feminism, but I think that this classification of 'tumblr-feminists' as a different type of feminism comes from them discussing difficult ideas in a provocative way, which they often have a loose-grasping of, and which, in-turn, people find easy to attack because the idea itself seems so silly/convoluted, that you don't feel the need to engage with it fully.


&gt;Edit: To go with your example, it's like if one person from Germany is a lovely person and there's another person (the prick) from another place called Germany. They're both German and neither one can say the other isn't. It's just two different Germany's

Let's say that one person is from a town in England which happens to be called Germany. Although they can come out and say they're Germany and blah blah blah, the other Germans (from the country) can still criticise their claim to being 'German' because of society's shared understanding about what being a German entails. Society understand what feminism means, and if someone comes along and claims they're a feminist who believes men are inferior to women, it doesn't actually matter if they say they're feminist or not. Society understands that their claims have little grounding or validity, because their core-ideals differ from the actual definition of that which they're claiming to be.


Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble.

False analogy ;) This a debate, not a movie theatre - no-one is physically impeding anyone else's dialog here.

&gt;Simple really - my opinion on feminism doesn't have any influence on the topic at large. I'm not a recognised authority on anything.

""Recognition"" is irrelevant - you silence idiot voices by overwhelming them with even more, much more sensible ones - everyone counts here, because this is *exctly* how Hegelian dialectics works.

&gt; What responsibility do you think I should have?

In my opinion (and it's just that) merely ""not doing bad"" isn't enough. 
It's a great start - but if a person genuinely claims to care about a thing, but isn't prepared to actually exert any effort to helping fix that - then (again in my opinion) that person is like a passive child. 

Fixing the world is all of our responsibility or it is no-ones.

Obviously its very difficult to pick and choose from all the causes in the world - and I'm by no means saying this is one you should take up.

I for instance have written on the subject and been actively involved in a local community initiatives surrounding education and safety (in an area where sexual violence is very high) - but only because this is a subject I happen to feel strongly about.

The point is that if you feel strongly about at thing, I believe you should back those feelings up with actions or it's just whining, you know?

After around 3 months of this, we went down the enviromentel  health route, we had sound devices set up in our house for 7 days, to record the noise levels of the neighbors, the problem with this was that the neighbors had a letter sent to their house, explaining that we had the equipment for a week, during that week, they did not turn on their stereo once, they clearly knew what they were doing, the day after the guy came to pick the equipment back up for it to go to noise testing, they turned their stereo back on again, it was a horrible situation to be in, I work shifts, so it was very hard to get a decent night/day sleep, so I finally decided to put my house on the market, it was on the market for 2 months until my neighbors decided to move out, we have new neighbors now and are very quiet, excuse this wall of text, I just felt like telling my story and to assure people in similar positions that they are not alone, the laws in this country need to change when it comes to stuff like this.

&gt; But what's shocking is that these studies find that women who do have STEM degrees are being paid less than men who have the same qualifications.

Not really shocking, most men have been in the industry significantly longer and so have built up higher salaries (ideological studies don't take account of this).

true,beavis07,null,null,"&gt; But my gripe with the extreme feminists is that they're the ones influencing policy, that song was banned in student unions.

Not in any serious way they're not - laws are not changing.

&gt; Whilst I'm neither a student nor a fan of Robin Thicke (I'd be lying if I want a fan of the video though...) but I find it abhorrent that the song was banned.

It was only ""banned"" in the sense that certain groups of people decided it was offensive and didn't want to play it in their establishments. If they decided a song was racist they would act the same, surely?

It's ""banned"" in my house too - cause it's shit! The rest of the world is free to listen to it to it's heart's content is it not?

Definitely agree with Mr Fry on ""offence"" - but that is not the point here.

This argument seems to revolve around the idea that serious public policy is effected by extreme-feminism, which is just categorically isn't.

The *only* power this small minority has in people like us giving them more credence than they deserve - so let's just stop doing that?

true,slowly_over,null,null,"The response I received was less encouraging, it read as follows...

Thank you for contacting me about communications data and lawful interception.
 
The Data Protection and Investigatory Powers Bill has now received Royal Assent.
 
The interception of communications is of critical importance to the preservation of national security. Since 2010, the majority of the Security Service’s top priority UK counter-terrorism investigations have used intercept capabilities in some form to identify, understand or disrupt plots seeking to harm the UK and its citizens. 
 
The European Court of Justice judgment of 8 April declared the EU Data Retention Directive (2006) invalid.  Following the judgment, our domestic Data Retention (EC Directive) Regulations 2009, which transposed the Directive, remain in force.  However, legislation is needed to maintain an effective mandatory communications data retention framework, and to address the ruling unambiguously and immediately. 
 
If companies could no longer be required to retain communications data, law enforcement’s capability to prevent and detect crime and protect the public would be severely degraded; many investigations would be delayed and some would cease entirely.
 
The second component of the Act will put beyond doubt that companies providing communication services to customers in the UK must comply with lawful requests under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 irrespective of where those companies are located.    A number of overseas communication service providers have questioned whether they are required to comply with obligations under the Act in relation to the interception of communications.
 
With the increasing globalisation of communications, any decrease in cooperation from overseas providers could have a devastating impact on national security.  If we lose visibility of what terrorists are saying to each other, we will lose the ability to understand and mitigate the threat that they pose.
 
Please find a link to start of the debate for the 2nd reading of the bill, where you will be able to see the Government’s response.

You might now say that how can someone who believes in equality use that to spew hatred; mostly what it comes down to is different ideas of what equality means.

Answer? It fits an existing, slightly sexist stereotype which allows people to denigrate feminism without actually making any kind of argument against it.

Just because idiots claim to be feminists doesn't make them so.

&gt;I'll always be a supporter of equal rights, but I simply refuse to associate with feminism because it has gender bias in it's name. I believe it shows a total lack of understanding of the importance of language, and I'm sceptical of joining any cause that doesn't subscribe to the basic concepts of communication

I think you're being unfair there, it's not like feminism was created by committee a couple of years ago and they picked a stupid name.  Think about where it came from, forming the roots of an equal rights movement for women was so difficult, it's no surprise the name reflects a strong advocacy for women's rights - an assertion had to be made in tough times; times in which women had no rights and no claims to equality.

OP was saying that she is screaming at the kids, so that means she has lost control now and likely won't get it back. You just have to hope that when they become young men they find a productive path, otherwise they will cause themselves and others trouble. When it gets to the point that you scream at your children all the time, then the kids have tested boundaries and effectively won the battle. 

With my own two kids, my wife and I have at least 3-4 more stages of escalation that we have in reserve. Currently my wife can just give our kids 'the look' and they know not to push it anymore.

No, I don't - my particular belief system is completely unrepresented by our political framework. However, even if you do believe in our form of parliamentary democracy, it's still very naive to believe that any major party is working in the interests of the actual people they seek to represent.

&gt;Again, because these are the people who shout loudest. 

My only real point was that being loud only gains validity when people choose to listen. So when someone make an argument about feminism with reference first to these people I believe that *that* is the harmful action - more even than the idiots shrieking in the first place.

As I say, in the same way that climate sceptics are only considered a prominent voice in the debate because people keep assigning their (massively unrepresentative) views far more value than they deserve.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"I guess I have concerns primarily about housing, credit, and the effect of wage depression on the wider economy. I'm also worried about the lack of investment both in infrastructure and industry. Essentially, we have large problems that no politician is doing much about but act collectively to make our economy incredibly fragile and prone to boom-bust cycles.

Housing is a huge concern. Absolutely gigantic. The market has exploded in the last year but things were already pretty bad before that. I'm really worried about the express action that the bank of england has had to take in order to arrest its ballooning. As far as I know this is uncharacteristically interventionist on the part of the BOE to get involved and specifically name a sector as being particularly worrisome. 

The interest rate has been held low to promote investment and borrowing, but its now been held so low for so long that people are starting to borrow unreasonably large amounts of money. An interest rate rise could easily fuck over a lot of people not only connected to housing but also simple personal loans that make them unable to afford the repayments. In the event of a housing crash this means that people who have recently bought a house at a massively inflated price are truly boned. They have a massive mortgage on an asset whose value is now miles less than they are obligated to pay for, while continuing to pay that massive mortgage at an increased rate of interest. As we saw in 2008 that kind of problem has an incredibly chilling effect as money goes out of circulation towards paying down debt.

Credit is linked to this as I mentioned. [The UK has a massive amount of personal debt](http://themoneycharity.org.uk/media/Debt-Stats-Full-January-2014.pdf). Most of it is tied up in mortgages, but we basically have loans to the hilt in order to afford things that we otherwise couldnt because of part three - wage depression. In the event of an interest rate rise, this results in more money going out of the economy to pay down those debts.

Inflation and Wage Depression go hand in hand. Most people have seen only token pay rises in the last six years that have been outstripped by inflation in general but really damaged by rising household bills. Again, we link back to that money circulation thing. Money spent on compulsory spending (mortgage, household bills, food) is money that doesnt go towards, well, everything else. 

Wage depression is a big problem. Our unemployment rate, while lower now than it has been for a very long time is still pretty high, which has a restricting effect on wages. In addition, there has been a large and malicious exploitation of government schemes to get productive workers for free (or very little). The Apprenticeships scheme, once earmarked for technical roles requiring a certain amount of on the job training (electrical and mechanical trades for example) is now rife with exploitative examples. How much training does one guy need to be an office worker photocopying things, or a tourist gude, for example? These schemes allow employers to make an absolute killing because the wage is set at £2.65 an hour for an apprentice instead of the £6.80 or so for a NMW employee. 

And thats before we get onto workfare where companies get completely free labour to do their work because the government ""pays"" people money they already paid into through their NI contributions. In the meantime, however, we have executives who are awarding themselves absolutely massive salaries. I digress. If everyone was earning a decent wage instead of these pittances (apprenticeships) or obligated free labour (theres another word for that!) then there would be more money floating around in the economy. Its another chilling effect that nobody seems that fussed about taking on because apparently corporations are king instead of thinking about the people that make up those corporations that have bills to pay and kids to feed.

The final part of this is investment. It appears to me that unless investment provides massive, obvious benefits then employers will be quite content to either chuck more people at a problem (because wages are cheaper than equipment) instead of spending money to make money through equipment modernisation.  Short-termism is the name of the game instead of laying groundwork for long term benefits. A lot of the time this is evident in staffing, bringing in expensive contractors on a short term basis instead of employing people to properly solve problems. Again, this is money that simply goes nowhere instead of creating something productive in the long term.

This also extends to the national, government level. The long term trends that anybody can see are the requirement for a well educated, technically competent national workforce. In order to get this workforce a certain amount of investment and policy should be directed towards schools and universities to make those technically oriented career roles attractive and at the same time promote that kind of industry to be set up in the UK. There has been preciously little on both counts, instead making technical degrees more expensive and salaries vastly underpaid compared to those in finance. I know two guys who studied engineering with me. One went to jaguar landrover on 35k as a transmission specialist. The other went to work fiddling with spreadsheets for a finance giant in the City, where he was being paid 50k. Me, personally, I'm looking abroad and seeing a 20-30% higher salary than the equivalent role in the UK.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"Any discussion on gender rights is inherently dichotomous. It splits the world into 2 sides, male and female.

""Femin"" implies woman, or the focus being on women. So feminism, in the context of gender equality, creates a dichotomy where women are unique or special somehow compared to men.

There is a strong focus on women being oppressed in the context of feminism.

In a dichotomy, where one side is oppressed, unless we assume women are oppressing themselves, then the only logical oppressor is the other side, male.

I'm not saying feminists go around saying all men are oppressors, I'm not even necessarily saying it's implied, just that with a dichotomy of men and women, saying women are oppressed, it's a logical inference that men are the oppressors - that is the nature of a dichotomy, and the term ""feminism"".

&gt; It honestly baffles me why so many guys think they are suspected rapists/mysogynists/violent, and feel the need to point out the fact that they're not at the slightest opportunity. It reminds me of ""Nice Guys"".

If I were to say ""I think men are smart"", could you perceive how some women might infer from that ""women aren't as smart?"" and take it personally?

In a debate about gender equality, if I were to say, as a male, ""well we have to be surrounded by morons all the time"", could you see how the other group in the discussion, females, might feel this was targeted at them, and how even the ones who were objectively not morons might take offence?

When rape comes up in gender inequality discussions, in some cases, it comes across feminist women saying ""well we have to be raped all the time"" - could you see how guys might take that personally?

In gender equality discussion, the entire population is simplified down into 2 groups, men and women. Everyone belongs in one group, either men or women. Therefore, anything that discredits one group, also discredits the members of that group.


But this is straying away from my original point:

*a particular word ""feminism"", I believe, causes a big problem and lots of controversy to the extent it harms the underlying cause. Yet people continue using it in favour of alternatives that would be less controversial and most likely allow a more constructive debate. If we accept ""feminism"" is a polarizing and loaded term, and we accept polarizing and loaded terms are not productive in a civil debate, then it seems totally illogical to continue using that word if our aim is a civil debate.*

The arguments in support seem to be along the lines of ""well women had it tough in the past"" or ""actually feminism is about patriarchy which also effects men"". But what's the point to feminism - is it to remind us who's most oppressed, or who the oppressor is, or the historical context? Or is it to try and reduce inequality, and have a civil, unbiased and open debate on gender equality? Unless the intention is to polarize and cause controversy, I don't understand why or how people justify using that word for it.

p.s. sorry for the wall of text - again, I'm not complaining about you, I really appreciate and value your input and debate, I'm genuinely trying to understand the flaw in my own views, so thanks for the input.

You're correct, when I posted that last paragraph, I considered removing it, because it was a little bit too assertive really, sorry about that.

I agree there's history to it. But now that history and language is holding the debate back. As I said in other posts - I think it would be useful to reassess the purpose of modern feminism and pick a new word for it, because ""feminism"". The connotations and polarizing effects of the word ""feminism"" in the modern day hinders debate on gender equality, turning into more a men vs women shouting match of whataboutisms.

EDIT: An example, because why not. We have a government minister for ""women and equalities"". Think about that for a moment.

We have a huge constant drive to rid the country of ""violence against women"" - it's apparently the most important and prevalent thing in the world. **Don't get me wrong, it is important.** But, two thirds of violence in the UK is against a male victim. 

And, dare I say it? The whole FGM thing. Why just FGM? It's a consent issue, that is not gendered. It's ok for an adult woman to cut her own genitals, so it's not the act itself that is wrong, it's the context of it not being her choice. This is identical to the reason male circumcision is wrong - but vaginas are more important. **We need to stop FGM.** We also need to stop circumcision of baby boys for non-medical reasons.

It's not about the ideology anymore, it's about practicing it. And we live in a country that wants so much to be pro equality that it's leaving half of us behind and not even noticing.

true,HRHSirGideonOsborne,null,null,"&gt; In a dichotomy, where one side is oppressed, unless we assume women are oppressing themselves, then the only logical oppressor is the other side, male.

It's the system in place, rather than men that does the oppressing. This is how patriarchy hurts men too. I see where you're coming from, but overall it's a system that generally favours men, but only those who play by the rules. A lot of guys don't buy into it, and an awful lot more are pressured into it.

&gt;If I were to say ""I think men are smart"", could you perceive how some women might infer from that ""women aren't as smart?"" and take it personally?

Sorry, I'm not sure how this relates to men being on the defensive and assuming they are being accused of rape or expected to be a rapist. 

&gt;When rape comes up in gender inequality discussions, in some cases, it comes across feminist women saying ""well we have to be raped all the time"" - could you see how guys might take that personally?

Sure, I'd be a bit concerned but I wouldn't say I'd take it personally. I'd wonder what happened to make that person have such an irrational viewpoint.

&gt;The arguments in support seem to be along the lines of ""well women had it tough in the past"" or ""actually feminism is about patriarchy which also effects men"". But what's the point to feminism - is it to remind us who's most oppressed, or who the oppressor is, or the historical context?

I think the title should be both a historical reminder and one that reflects that feminist ideals are based in women's issues and that it is opposed to male-leaning attitudes. As I've said, feminism reflects that women still have steps to take and all it asks is that people listen, rather than clouding the issue with semantics (like we are!).

 I don't have much time to finish here, but if i said that whoever decided to change feminism from ""feminism"" to ""equalism"" or some other name was guy would that make sense? That's my feeling anyway and I'm glad you appreciate the discussion- so do I :)

Even if they aren't the absolute majority they remain the force that drives and steers feminism because they are the zealots and activists.

People who denigrate feminism seem to know an awful lot more about it than those who defend it in my experience and this is supported by the evidence whenever the forces of feminism and those against it intersect (now there is an interesting choice of word). The glass ceiling, the wage gap, the male gaze, rape culture, etc. it's all nothing to do with sexism, discrimination or oppression and entirely a result of different biological preferences for the two sexes.

First thing to know about me:  [I research things to death](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/kyfhk/and_this_is_why_im_not_allowed_to_help_with/).  So I started with the /r/PremierLeague guide for new fans.  [West Ham](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1jwbtb/premier_league_201314_team_preview_1120_west_ham/) was on the short list after the initial round of cuts.  I liked the kits.  I liked that the club started as Thames Ironworks and the nickname the Hammers.  I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the U.S.; The Steel City.  It's a hardworking place, and our sports fans are generally enthusiastic.  West Ham felt familiar.

I also loved the Boylen Ground.  I was a little jarred to find out about the move to Olympic, but I've made peace with that.  I don't usually pick a team that seems to buy high finishes.  I like a hard-working team that will grind out wins.  This put West Ham at the forefront.

I also stopped by each team that I was considering's subreddit.  I wanted to get a feel for the supporters, especially on reddit since I will spend a lot of time there.  This was another point in West Ham's favor.

The final consideration was [relegation history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_records_and_statistics#mediaviewer/File:92-14_prem_history.png).  I didn't want to pick a team, only to find out that they spend most of their time out of the Premier League.  West Ham fit the bill there as well.  When they were relegated, they bounced back quickly.

All in all, West Ham was a natural fit for me.  It was an easier and more comfortable choice than the MLS for me, believe it or not.",0,1406291467,null,0,false,0,cj7dm4n,t3_2bona1,t1_cj7dm4n,t3_2bona1,null,1434892060,5,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,5

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;&gt; Councils and social landlords run their own allocation processes based on the local housing need

&gt; This would be fine if we were starting from scratch, but we aren't. Many people have had rooms they haven't needed for extended period with no incentive to do anything about it.

So what about localism? The government argues that the LAs and charities are best equipped to make decisions and allocate their own resources, and yet in this they undermine that autonomy. I can tell you that social landlords and council housing departments are effectively unanimous in condemning this scheme as the wrong answer. It has increased their arrears, which has made it more difficult for them to provide housing. It has removed the security of the homes of many thousands of people. If those people lose their homes and move to the private sector, then the Housing Benefit for them will be much more expensive then it is now. It was also condemned by all the housing charities and advocacy groups I  can think of, and I am a housing professional myself.

&gt;&gt;
The bedroom tax affects established tenants, who might have been at the property all their lives, not just new tenants.

&gt;This is a good thing. No one should be entitled to more than they need when other people have needs and are going without so that others can have more.

What are you, a communist? :P We are talking about a pretty small amount of expenditure in the scheme of things. I don't see any harm in those at the bottom having a small advantage, such as more storage space or the option to take a lodger. (I do mean the option, as the policy has completely failed to actually prompt anyone to do this - its not quite right evidently).

As I mentioned, the landlord cannot allocate 2 strangers to a 2-bed flat. That would take a bigger change in policy and the type of tenancies which are legally appropriate. Maybe that would have been a better idea? Also the Housing Benefit regulations already include £20 income disregard for claimants who do take lodgers. This disregard could be increased to increase the incentive for tenants to do that. I don't in general agree that poor people should be made to share homes with strangers. That is a backward step toward workhouse conditions, and probably is not going to improve the outlook for those economic groups.

I don't know if you are aware, but disabled people are not exempt from the policy, and so given the supply of disabled-suitable housing being a minority, it simply makes it more difficult to find a home for a disabled person. There just is not the supply to always be able to give them a place of the exact size. Also, disabled people often need a spare room for carers or equipment. This is not taken into account by this policy.

Pensioners on the other hand, are the largest group with spare rooms, and are all exempt.

&gt;it discourages the spare room subsidy.

The policy is actually called the 'size criteria restriction in social-sector tenancies'. As this is not a catchy name it began to be called the 'bedroom tax' by housing staff. After this the DWP coined the phrase 'ending the spare room subsidy' Don't be fooled by this. There never was a component of Housing benefit called Spare Room Subsidy. It does not bring the social sector in line with private tenancies, as has been claimed. The benefit calculation for those operates in an entirely different way (and pays considerably higher HB awards).

Lastly, the DWP foolishly neglected to actually define what a bedroom is in the regulations. This means inevitably that The Tribunals service is now stuffed with potentially meritorious appeals based on rooms being too small, or used for other purposes etc. That is extraordinarily messy and was predicted by everybody in the field.

You keep saying this, but what repercussions are they experiencing for annoying you on a regular basis.

Honestly though it just seems like bored kids with bad parents. From what you've said they may be paying so little attention that they don't realise the kids are throwing things over so much. Personally I would knock on the door, politely tell them that their kids are still throwing things into your garden and you want them to stop. See what their reaction is. Do it every time something else gets thrown over.

One of three things will happen. 1. They'll deal with it and be responsible, or 2. They'll carry on ignoring it, or 3. They'll get a bit aggressive.

If either 2 or 3 happen report it to your council.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Politics and modern history degree and a newspaper journalism degree. Your pithy little statement about Israel does not take in the historical nuances of the situation (except the plight of the Palestinians). That's why I said you were talking shite yerself, after accusing her of doing so. Especially the bit about the numbers of people who hate Jews and the media thing. Both totally made up by you.   

And asking someone to not read something but take your word for it; and then form an opinion of their own and slabbering about shitty journalism when its an opinion piece. Grinds my gears when people can't separate the two.  

We can deal in wooly ideal morals. Or we can deal with how people will realistically spin situations. The innocent Palestinian man or woman is living in probably the closest thing to ""hell"" there is on earth. Even Israelis admit that. That's the fault of Israel, the International Community, Hamas, and their Arab benefactors. 

I totally agree with you on the fact Israel is bombing towns, bulldozing, et al. War crimes have been commited. By the IDF and by Hamas and by whomever is supplying Hamas. 

That won't stop Israeli propaganda stating that thousands of rockets (they may not harm anyone but there is the potential for death) are being fired at them and tunnels are being dug into their territory with the specific purpose of murdering innocent Israelis (made from concrete brought in in a small lift of the draconian blockade). Stating that Hamas is a terrorist organisation that has killed Israelis and PLO members in Palestine. Stating that Hamas hide behind civilians and are being supplied with ordinance by Arab states that want them all fucking dead. Stating that they are sorry for the innocent civilian casualties but they can do nothing else. Hell: ""We're not using white phosphorus any more guys!"" They are also supported by their people in their sovereign nation-state so in reality they are doing the ""right thing"". 

This is a long war; a war that started within days of Israel being set up as a state. Israel has always been on a war footing and does not give a flying fuck about killing a few Palestinians. The reason? Arab states still want the region called Palestine to be an Arab nation. But Israel has since 48, had a bigger fucking stick than the rest of them and isn't backing down. 

Not to mention the population of the refugee camps has more than doubled since ""The catastrophe"". So there's more than twice as many of the ""Other"" in the same sized area as there was during its inception. 

A world away I feel really fucking sorry for the innocent Palestinian who is living in a ghetto refugee camp. Its a horrible thing to watch a military repeat the mistakes the USA and UK did in Iraq by bombing soft targets that minutes ago Hamas were firing from but now are just schools/houses/hospitals but I don't think Israel gives a fuck. 

They watched us blow up Dresden, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

They've been nearly annhiliated by the Romans, shat on by the Ottomans, holocausted by zee Germans, and as soon as they were granted some of their ancient territory back they were attacked by Arabs again. It is little fucking wonder they are sociopathic in the defense (offensive into Gaza to strengthen their position) of their nation-state.

It is the only Jewish state on the face of the planet. And they're looking out watching people from nation states that have the blood of millions on their hands historically tutting because they've committed a few war crimes. 

Taking all the history out of it: there isn't going to be any kind of cease-fire until the tunnels are destroyed and the rockets stop. Israel isn't going to lift any embargos because when they let a lot of concrete in the Palestinians didn't use it to build schools or hospitals or houses, they used it to tunnel. Israel's not going to let trade between the West Bank and Gaza start up again because; more terrorist activity. And Hamas isn't going to stop firing rockets until the embargos lifted. 

It's a catch-22.

'The Zodiac' is a Babylonian method of describing arcs of the sky, hence why there are 12 [0].  As a menomic, they used star signs that were as close as possible to the 12 distinct points, in order to be able to have references.

The 12 is therefore a construct of man - if the constellations themselves had any meaning [1] then there should be 13 unevenly distributed points.

-----------------------------

At city you have known goal scoring quality in Agüero/Negredo/Džeko. Chelsea sort of have to hope that Costa comes off if they are to keep up. I feel he will be less than impressive in Chelsea's system in comparison to Atlético's.

1  City

2 Chelsea

No Suarez in addition to European football to contend with should see Liverpool slip from the lofty heights of last time around, I don't think they will be in the mix come the business end of the season. Instead my prediction is that both Chelsea and Arsenal will overtake them.

3 Arsenal

Not excessively confident on this one, lack strength in depth to compete with the big boys and I am assuming that Wenger brings in either a first choice DM or striker with my prediction here. I can see them making one more quality signing this summer and that should solidify a lonely third spot.

4/5 Liverpool/United

Can't split them, I see Liverpool dropping for aforementioned reasons and I think the Utd clean out will surely see them rise. How far Liverpool drop and how high Utd go is too hard to predict, I expect one to round out the top 4 and one to miss out.

6 Spurs

Loss of Lukaku and having Europe to contend with should hamstring Everton (I don't trust Martinez to rotate well), couple that with a spurs squad that should improve on last seasons form and I can see spurs pipping Everton. Unfortunately Van Gaal + ££ - Moyes should see Utd leap frog both.

Been there, done that.  I think a lot depends on the corporate culture,  In my last-but-one job it was understood that sometime you had to take a short lunch or stay on a bit longer, but conversely it was OK to leave at 4:45 if your desk was clear and your job queue empty.  

My last employer on the other hand expected us to be at our desks 30 minutes before our contracted start time for a daily teleconference and to just keep working (for free...) to get the queues empty, even if the senior management had rolled in at 11:00 and fucked off home at 3:00.  Although it was never mentioned directly in my appraisals it was obvious that they weren't impressed with my 'Well, it's 5:30, see you suckers in the morning!' attitude.  

In case that makes me look like a dick, I'd have been perfectly happy to give them a few extra hours if they a) paid me for them like my contract stated they would and b) had a bit of give with all the take.

true,MrClevver,null,null,"The source for my claim is the book The Mask of Sanity by Hervey Cleckley, which can be downloaded in full as a pdf here: http://www.quantumfuture.net/store/sanity_1.PdF


It was Cleckley who first made the claim that suicide among psychopaths is fairly rare, although he did admit that suicide threats and false attempts for the purposes of manipulation were more commonplace.


A key point to remember is that Cleckley's book, however brilliant, is describing the psychopathic personality before the advent of the PCL-R, which is the current gold standard for identifying psychopathy.  The PCL-R can actually be broken down into two factors which appear to be measuring two different personality constructs - PCL-R Factor 1 relates to traits dealing with the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy (i.e. shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) whereas factor 2 relates to antisocial behaviour (i.e 
criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behavioural controls, and juvenile delinquency)


The patients described in Cleckley's book were psychopaths who predominantly demonstrated traits relating to Factor 1.  Watkins also appears to demonstrate a lot of Factor 1 traits - superficially charming, glib (that megalolz comment!) and highly manipulative.  People who score high on Factor 1 traits also tend to have low levels of anxiety, neuroticism and stress reaction, probably making them relatively immune to suicide triggers. 


A paper from 2001 (Verona &amp; Patrick, *Psychopathy, Antisocial Personality and Suicide Risk*, full paper available as a PDF if you google it) looked at the relationship between suicidality and psychopathy, and found that contrary to Cleckley's claim, there is actually a positive correlation between antisocial deviance and suicidal behaviour.  However, when broken down by factor it appeared that suicidality was only related to *Factor 2,* while Factor 1 had no relationship with suicide.  This makes sense, since people scoring high on Factor 2 are more likely to have grown up in abusive environments, have extensive histories of criminal behaviour, have poor/disrupted education and employment records, and generally have chaotic lives and fail to achieve high social status - in marked contrast to people who score high on Factor 1.


The authors also say that their study did not distinguish between completed suicides, genuine suicide attempts, and false attempts for purpose of manipulation (thinking about it though, it would be pretty fucking hard to design a study which does distinguish - if someone successfully commits suicide it's difficult to administer psychological 
tests to them retrospectively.  The only other alternative would be a massive scale longitudinal study in which all prisoners/patients are given the full battery of tests, and then you check in every ten years or so to see which of them have topped themselves.  Good luck getting funding for that one...)  They also concede that psychopaths who score high on Factor 1 tend to have other psychological features which are likely to protect them from suicide, such as narcissism, social potency, low anxiety and so on.  So, it appears that Cleckley's claim that psychopaths rarely kill themselves might still hold true, as long as we're talking about the more manipulative but less impulsive and erratic Factor 1 type.  Either way, it sounds like there is still a lot of room for research there.


Anyway, you should read Cleckley's book if you are at all interested in psychopathy, it's full of really fascinating case studies that do a great job of capturing what psychopaths are really like to deal with on a day-to-day basis.  I've worked with psychopaths, and they really do take the fucking piss with their arrogance, entitlement and fucking relentless moaning.  On the other hand, they can be quite funny and easy to have a good conversation with.

Liverpool will be super interesting to me - I think Rodgers is a blowhard and the fans are obnoxious so I'd love to see them fail post-Suarez, but they could really end anywhere from 6th to 2nd in my mind.

United are going to be scary this season. I think everyone knows that they massively underachieved - even for a team that was too old and just not that good they've still got 2 of the best goal-scorers in the Prem, and with Van Gaal in charge and Herrera pulling the strings they could pretty easily jump back into the top 3 (especially with another 1 or 2 marquee signings).

true,sprinke,null,null,"There's a lot to address here and I’m not sure I can do it all. I'm concerned about household debt issue but the others not so much, together they do pose significant risks to UK recovery, but many are already being addressed or have been completely over hyped over the past year or so. The problem lies within possibly needing a rate rise to slow-down bubbles in the housing market, but that very rate rise causing problems with repayments on household debt. 




Firstly it’s showing signs of slowing down, with news out today. This slowdown is also coming before the BOE’s intervention has really even done anything to address UK buyers, with the main limits coming in October this year to deflate possible problems. The housing market is extremely skewed by London and the South East, where a huge proportion of those buying new homes are Cash buyers from abroad. This is good in the sense that any shock to prices in such an area isn’t then end of the world as they can sit on these losses without crashing the UK economy as they have financed themselves from abroad. I think we could see sharp changes in London house prices, but the rest of UK just experiencing a small slowdown. Not the end of the world crash this thread predicts, and not continued rises in perpetuity, the BOE are not overly concerned by the house price levels but instead by household debt. This is probably why we won’t see rate rises until Q1 2015, as long as Housing doesn’t take a turn for the worse. I also think many people except and are preparing for such rises.




The BOE have also stated that rates are NOT going to go back to pre-recession highs for decades, but more likely to sit at new levels of around 2.5%, this should mean when rates rise families have enough slack to pay for it. With regards to rate rises do you have a source for people taking out large loans because of low rates? I think people have had long enough to prepare for such rises and expect them, the BOE will decide when it’s safe enough to do them.



You said you were worried about investment in the UK which is weird as its doing really well right now. Business investment has expanded for over a year on the trot now and at the fastest rate in over 2 years in Q1. You talk of government doing nothing to address such issues but the last budget was primarily focused on dealing with investment problems. The government unveiled its seeking 15bn of infrastructure investments last week , which you said you were worried about. While foreign investment it at record highs for the UK. I don’t see this as a problem at all, the Tories are doing everything they can to help this and look to be succeeding so I can’t be bothered to comment more on it.



Wage depression is primarily because of a large slack in the labour market post crisis, which is being augmented by large levels of EU immigration at the moment, taking your costa type jobs by the bucket load. The recent fall in wage growth to 0.7% is partly from bonus payments but is worrying, but not in a growth sense. Slow wage growth is not a huge concern for economic growth, it’s a concern is discussing living standards but not so much here. As more and more of the increases in employment are being taken up by full time jobs (which they are btw) this should get better, and as the slack comes to a close with the ever decreasing unemployment levels, our low inflation levels give us a good platform for ok wage growth. Productivity is also predicted to start increasing next year. I don’t know enough about labour schemes so I will leave it here, plus I have a dog to walk.

I think that it seems obvious that the wage gap has something to do with women being primary child carers and men being 'providers' (as well as a lot of other stuff like differing interests and priorities etc) but imo it's not proven that women don't favour being the primary child carer. I remember that in Norway and Sweden, where they have mandated parental leave that the father has to take (I think), there were proposals to equalise the leave that would essentially be state mandated equality in in child rearing, in opinion polls a majority of men were in favour of this but majority of women were against it. The Fawcett society also opposed similar, weaker legislation in the UK because it would cut into women's maternity leave. 

Also I agree that it's obvious personalities play a role in the type of subject you favour at school and in the type of job you eventually get and that there are obviously gendered personality differences, but, there seems to be evidence (maybe non random sample size was a problem though) that [performance of exercises that are supposed to be suggestive of general mathematical ability might be inversely correlated with gender equality](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/fr/GDP1/papers/lippa10.pdf) 
&gt;UN gender development and empowerment
indices and life expectancy were significantly correlated with
sex differences in mental rotation performance, with higher
levels of gender equality and economic development asso-
ciated with larger sex differences.

and that what kids find interesting may seems to be different in poorer countries where people have  different ideas about jobs

There is an [interesting article](http://eng.kifinfo.no/c62967/nyhet/vis.html?tid=62538) I saw a ages ago about this kind of thing. The gender gap (in interest in subjects in schools) is much wider in rich countries than in poor countries (the example given is Ghana). There isn't a big difference between boys and girls interests in different subjects in Ghana, but obviously there is in the US.                                                                                     Relevant quote...
&gt;""The pupils in Uganda and Ghana show great interest in science studies and technology. One possible explanation may be that youth in these countries see knowledge as the road to a better life,"" says Jensen.

&gt;When it comes to the gender differences he points to the fact that youth in Western countries to a larger degree can choose their own identity. Gender seems to be an important factor in this process. In other countries, however, factors like parents and family background are a bigger part of a person’s identity.

&gt;""In Western countries, self-realisation and developing one’s own identity is important. But in poorer countries a career within the natural sciences and technology can be a way out of poverty. Other needs come first, and that might cause boys and girls to respond more similarly,"" Ullah adds.


This suggests it's not so much sexism or misogyny, but general gender rolls (and/or gendered interests) that is a key factor in the under representation of women in some subjects/jobs/fields and the under representation of men in others.",0,1406295615,null,0,false,0,cj7f0y3,t3_2bo6cx,t1_cj7f0y3,t1_cj7ayi0,null,1434892832,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Arse look strong but i think they are a step back from CFC and City, a signing of a proper DM and another striker i think would solidify that 3rd slot.

LFC and United are tough for me to predict, on paper LFC have various parts that make them look very strong but as we saw massive changes that look good on paper don't always translate.  United are even harder for me....they are stripping down the defence but thus far haven't back filled beyond Shaw and the current squad seems ill-suited to a LVG setup...but they are going to bring in some high end talent sometime this summer and LVG is certainly capable of getting the best out of a squad. I really think they will end up being better than last season but i have no clue how much better.

&gt; Loss of Lukaku and having Europe to contend with should hamstring Everton (I don't trust Martinez to rotate well)

This makes sense, but i think it will have less to do with Martinez rotating well as much as it will be Martinez will not be able to rotate well as i don't see Everton being able to truly bring in enough depth to allow for consistent rotation and at some point injuries will catch up to them.

I think we project at that 6th spot, but i think that we will fall into that are where while we won't be a threat to the top 3 we will never truly be out of contention for the top 4 (a seemingly annual occurrence for us) and should be in the hunt for anything from 4-7 meaning that while i think we are most likely to finish in 6th a rash of injuries or poor form by the teams ahead of us and will find ourselves in contention for a better finishing position......but that is reliant on other teams and for us to perform at our best which are just as hard to project as anything else.",0,1406295890,null,0,false,0,cj7f4v6,t3_2bosge,t1_cj7f4v6,t1_cj7efyp,null,1434892874,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

I mean, the push for net neutrality alone should be enough to win over reddit but ""OHMAGERD TUITION FEES"" seems to be an easier scapegoat. Even more hypocritically, people that give this criticism are often those that will vote for Labour, the party that requested the Browne Review.

Well, to start with, [Bitters and Twisted] (http://www.bittersntwisted.co.uk/) is a chain, but it's a local chain with an indie vibe and the Rose Villa Tavern in particular is very nice since it's been renovated. Cherry Reds on John Bright Street opposite Turtle Bay is also very nice. Again it's a mini-chain, they started out in King's Heath in a shoebox of a place, but they expanded. (if you're used to King's Heath, the city centre venue's much bigger. So don't forget that there's extra seating upstairs if it's chocka.)

For food, the Pickled Piglet on Gas Street hasn't managed to hit the mainstream yet, despite always having done me proud for both food and service. I suspect it's because of the awful side-road location, which means there's no foot traffic.

The little cafe on the canalside just down from the Tap and Spile is also fun, although its name escapes me at present. Food service is ridiculously slow, but the venue is quirky and adorable. They serve both alcohol and all-day breakfasts.

Post Office Vaults on New Street specialises in unusual imported beers, but you need to time your visit because there's so little seating that it's not worth visiting during busy periods. Then by the same team there's the Wellington on Bennett's Hill which was renovated not too long ago to add an upper floor with a roof terrace. I can't say enough good things about the Welly. They've just got really brilliant customer service. They keep reading glasses at the bar in case you forgot yours and wanted to read the paper. They have a complimentary box of tampons in the women's loos in case you're caught short, where most venues force you to buy them from an unreliable vending machine at £1 a pop. They don't serve food, but if you want to bring your own, they'll provide you with cutlery and condiments. There's a pub cat. I bloody love the Welly!

Coffee shop wise, there's 6/8 Kafe by Pigeon Park, another venue which looks tiny until you go inside properly. The basement's nice and spacious, but you'd never know it from just looking through the window. Urban Coffee Company (both city centre and JQ) and the Saint Caffe (St Paul's Square) have a similar vibe.",0,1406296326,null,0,false,0,cj7fb62,t3_2bmhbp,t1_cj7fb62,t1_cj7bulu,null,1434892944,2,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,2

Imagine if we used both Vidal and Can as both physical and technical midfielders to not only defend the midfield, but move the ball forward with Gerrard sitting behind them as the quarterback making the plays.

true,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; No, the only thing stopping me identifying with or labelling myself as a feminist is the name. As I said, I support most of what equal rights feminists say.

Honestly, that's pretty strange. Feminism is a really diverse movement, ranging from [pants-on-head crazy people](http://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway4587212) to semi-conservative women who want to see a re-emphasis on the family. Picking on the name in particular is just intellectually clunky.

Some quick points on the name other people haven't pointed out:

One of the most important reasons why ""feminism"" is kept as a term is it establishes historical continuity between those activists who fought for women's rights in the past and those of today. We're the intellectual heirs of the suffragettes, the women who for civil equality, and those who fought for sexual equality. To mark a break and say ""These people were feminists - we are not feminists"" is both untrue and would have been disappointing to earlier generations had they ever seen us do such a thing.

""Egalitarianism"" as a movement doesn't exist. It just doesn't. This is because it doesn't really mean anything - it's like calling a movement ""Betterism"" or saying you're a ""Goodist"". Ofc being equal is seen as a good thing, but feminism's focus on the oppression against women - which has been greater historically and I think also today - serves as a lightning rod and torch for the movement.",0,1406296905,null,0,false,0,cj7fjvj,t3_2bo6cx,t1_cj7fjvj,t1_cj7ajhu,null,1434893078,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

There was a stat in the Netherlands some time ago that showed that van Ginkel was among the players with the most fouls in the league, but receiving strikingly few yellow/red cards from it. Like 1 yellow per 20 or even 25 fouls. Only at the end of his Eredivisie career people finally started to take notice of this and refs as well. Not only the quantity, but also the fact that he can tackle really hard.  

I think his sweet boy appearance has saved him from many yellow and even red cards and by that, suspensions for his club. Van Ginkel is a wolf in sheep cloths and I highly recommend that he does not start thinking about looking tougher or even taking tattoo's.

&gt;___Mulholland Drive___ is a 2001 American [neo-noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-noir) film, written and directed by [David Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch) and starring [Naomi Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Watts), [Laura Harring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Harring), and [Justin Theroux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux). It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), California, who meets and befriends an [amnesiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia) woman (Harring) hiding in an apartment that belongs to Elms's aunt. The story includes several other seemingly unrelated [vignettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(literature\)) that eventually connect in various ways, as well as some surreal scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative.

&gt;They see their dad work his entire life to get his 20K a year wage as a supervisor in a small local business and see that is all thats avilable to them in life.

Do children make that connection? I had no clue about money and the costs on life until I was about 17. I doubt it is due to lack of aspiration, rather it might be down to a lack of, again understanding and education about what is out there for them.

&gt;They see their poor exam results in subjects like English and Science and feel it means they aren't as smart as the other kids. That they will never be able to compete.

But why do they see these results? I can assure you it is not because they are not capable, it is because they do not apply themselves. 


I agree we need to diversify our education system and provide a real alternative to university education for those less academically inlined. Before we do that however we need to focus on fixing children's attitude to learning.

I moved in around 2006 and the street while being town centre was a lot quieter than streets deeper into town. Families, couples, retirees. The council was planning on doing some regeneration on the areas a bit closer to town and spent a while acquiring all the houses ready to knock them down and build new affordable housing to replace the shabby Victorian terraces, many of which hadn't been cared for.

By about 2009 they'd acquired most of what they wanted, but now no-one wanted to build particularly cheap housing in the north they'd only be able to sell for a sensible, so those areas turned into an abandoned slum full of boarded up houses. The last couple of years they've actually started demolishing them, but there's still no sign of anything going up in their place so they sit there as empty brownfield sites.

Meanwhile all those evicted/moved out were rehoused in other accommodation, particularly other areas with cheap housing i.e. near me. Most occupier owners used the chance to move to a nicer area. So as contracts came up here, council tenants were moved in. People who owned moved on and more houses became rentals. 

Now most houses have people sat outside them all day in pyjamas drinking cheap cider while their kids run wild. Things are never quiet. They are friendly enough, and chatty when we are out and about. There's been two murders on the street though. And house prices have dropped to about 2/3 of what I paid, leaving me in negative equity, and stuck here for the forseeable future living in a house i work hard for while most of my neighbours sit around and drink all day.

**PSV Eindhoven – 64.862** vs. St. Pölten

**Viktoria Plzen – 40.870** vs. Petrolul Ploiești

**Club Brugge – 32.260** vs. Brøndby

**CFR Cluj - 25.451** vs. Dinamo Minsk

Starting with next week’s third round, Champions League losers will drop down to the Europa League. We want the teams with higher coefficients than Everton to stay in the Champions League to avoid bumping the Blues further into Pot 3. There are eight teams we should support during their fixtures on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Zenit St. Petersburg	73.899

FC Salzburg		46.185

Lille OSC			45.300

Steaua Bucuresti		39.451

APOEL Nicosia		37.650

Celtic			36.813

BATE Borisov		33.725

Besiktas			32.840

Sparta Prague		28.870

Of course the government holds the balance of power, they hold the majority of seats after all, but on many issues MPs are given a free vote – and, again, I would argue it's far too few, but that's another matter again.

They don't have a big prescence yet they sponsor the Barclays Center.

And apart from having their offices and admin in the UK, there are many other British companies that don't do much here. Big miners like Anglo American and Rio Tinto being good examples.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The fact is that image DOES matter.  Not just to get elected, but *once* you get elected.  Body language, persuasion skills, how you come across physically, stature etc.. are all incredibly important when negotiating with foreign leaders.

The Prime Minister doesn't run the country himself.  Numerous people in numerous government departments crunch statistics and manage things on a day to day basis.   It is the Prime Minister's job to inspire and convince both his own party, his own people, and foreign leaders and peoples, that siding/dealing/trading with Britain is good for all of us.   The Prime Minister's job is largely to market our country to the world, and to influence and persuade other leaders to support us and agree with us on the world stage.  It is also to help lead the country in times of crisis, which is why a strong public image is extremely important.  

The fact is, the PM is not a job like a programmer or a financial analyst or a research scientist at an arctic station.  It is a job in which image is extremely important, both before you are elected and after.  Look at Ronald Reagan for example- not the brightest of bulbs by all accounts- but he projected the image of American strength and sincerity, and achieved a lot for it.  Now, of course I'm not saying Miliband's *policies* should be like Reagan's, but a PM should need the same outward strength.

If a foreign leader meets Ed and thinks 'this guy is a joke who looks like a cartoon character and speaks like someone with a blocked nose', then that actually damages his impression of the strength and importance of our country in general, and we might be taken less seriously as a result.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"First of all I don't think I've fallen back on the same trite arguments.  Whilst *both* illegal Marijuana and Illegal alcohol *could* be tainted by harmful additives all the real world evidence points to only illegal alcohol being tainted with dangerous additives ( Anti-freeze, solvents etc ).  If we make alcohol illegal we increase the risk to a large portion of the population. If we legalise marijuana there is no evidence that the smaller portion of the population that smoke marijuana would be consuming a safer drug. that's the difference. This might change - Tainted marijuana might show up in the drug chain and make it safer to legalise that keep illegal tainted marijuana BUT tainted marijuana hasn't appeared yet in any significant quantities AFAIK.

&gt; Would you consider changing your view if there were other countries that made Marijuana legal, so we could use them as a test case after x amount of years

My argument would be what's the hurry?  If you are going to see how it goes in another country you have to make sure you have the right metrics.  One metric would be cost to the tax payer? You simply add up tax revenue, enforcement costs vs cost of consumption. Another metric might be health, social withdrawal, addiction, people living a ""pot smoker"" lifestyle effect on overall drug use. A lot of these metrics are hard to measure, take time to materialise AND they have to be measured by foreign governments. 

The second  problem with taking a direct foreign comparison is that they don't always equate. For instance we extended drinking hours to try and promote a more continental ""cafe culture"" towards drinking in britian. The effect was that instead of becoming more continental the prevalence of binge drinking increased. I met a lot of dutch people on my travels ( mostly they were 18-20 )  and when we ask them about marijuana cafes they all thought it was something for the tourists - it's like it didn't even enter their minds to go there. this is a fundamentally different attitude that to Britain. 

 The other problem is that marijuana lobby in america is very well funded ( mostly by multi-billionaire George Soros).  They are a one sided organisation that has the funds to promote and measure the positives. What we need when assessing both benefit and harm is a neutral agency that look into and accurately measure different areas of possible harm and benefit not a one sided agency that only promotes benefits and pretends harms don't exist. 

When it comes to overall harm to society I don't think legalising marijuana would make a whole heap of difference to ""drug related crime"". Where I live heroin addicts cause the biggest problems stealing to feed their habit ( not the dealers) .  I don't think legalising marijuana would change the drug crime problem.

In the article the author says that the creature is just acting out of survival instincts, but I don't think that's true. As the solo traveler is convincing the rest to throw the Doctor out, she's smiling; smug about what the others are about to do. She's about to win. Sure, the humans are evil in this case as well, but we don't know exactly how this creature was affecting the rest of them, aside from the fact that it was clearly joyful as they were about to commit murder. It could be the creature was, in a small way, affecting their moods and bringing out the worst in them. Or maybe not, but it definitely was not just acting on survival instincts. The author tries to make that out to mean that humans are the monsters, and not the creature. To quote Star Wars, who is more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? The same can be said here. One may be more evil than the other, but they are both definitely evil. Let's stop trying to pull the blame away from whatever this creature was.

His words.
The Doctor's best weapon, the thing that gets him through the worst situations, the most powerful enemies, the most evil forces is how he talks and communicates.  He can be without his TARDIS, his Sonic Screwdriver, his companions, anything, but none of that is his true weapon.  He can talk, and has talked his way out of the worst of any situation. 
In ""Midnight"", he starts with causally talking to other people, getting them loose and having fun, but ends with his best, most powerful, and his most relied upon ""weapon"" back fire and used against him.

Nov 2013 - [Benefit sanctions soar under tougher regime](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/06/benefits-sanctions-jobseekers-allowance)

&gt;There have been repeated claims that jobcentre staff are given weekly or monthly targets for the number of benefits sanction decisions they need to take. The DWP denied this, describing the numbers as management information but not a target.

Jul 2014 - [Mentally ill hounded in Britain](http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/07/09/370489/mentally-ill-hounded-in-britain/)

&gt;Neglect of the mentally ill is bad enough, but now consider how the Department for Work and Pensions deliberately torments them. I just met a job centre manager. It had to be in secret, in a Midlands hotel, several train stops away from where she works. She told me how the sick are treated and what harsh targets she is under to push them off benefits. A high proportion on employment and support allowance have mental illnesses or learning difficulties. **The department denies there are targets, but she showed me a printed sheet of what are called ""spinning plates"", red for missed, green for hit. They just missed their 50.5% target for ""off flows"", getting people off ESA. They have been told to ""disrupt and upset"" them – in other words, bullying.** That's officially described, in Orwellian fashion, as ""offering further support"". As all ESA claimants approach the target deadline of 65 weeks on benefits – advisers are told to report them all to the fraud department for maximum pressure. In this manager's area 16% are ""sanctioned"" or cut off benefits.

ESA is the jobseekers equivalent of what used to be Incapacity Benefit. People who are ill yet pressured to return to work.

Then that is at least a conditional maybe, which is better than just irrationally saying no, never.

One big fear with decriminalisation, which is something that you have mentioned, is the idea of this pot smoker lifestyle taking over with everyone becoming lazy feckless wastrels smoking weed all day. It would be interesting to know what would actually happen, because as far as I know with the Dutch, cannabis use amongst teens is slightly lower than the European average. I've seen several explanations, such as coffeeshops being very strict about selling to underage people, and the system having shut down the street trade.

I agree that the effect on mental health re schizophrenia should be studied more, before any definite decision could be reached.

just for the record the first (albeit a failure) union movement in the UK was spearheaded by a factory owner that actually gave a shit about his workers. I forget his name but he sounded like a very interesting individual. I'm just stating that there are exceptions that cross partisan lines that break the rule.  
Another issue with your statement is that the rights of children to not work (age limit on work) didn't come from socialism but more religious pressure.

Lallana had 2 less assists all season but his team didn't have the top 2 goal scorers in it. 

Secondly he has more of an engine on him. Why not start him while everyone has fresh legs and bring Coutinho on when midfielders and defenders start to get tired legs? We might need his work effort early. I think of him as an overall upgrade to Coutinho.

true,Max2tehPower,MX,mexico,"I think Lukaku might be shipped out. I wrote this long rant on Facebook to a friend who asked about Lukaku (I'm not gonna format):  

*This is a mistake people keep making. Lukaku wasn't 'shipped out on loan' last year: he was expected to fight for his place and he didn't want to, so he asked for a loan.*

*He would have made his way into the starting 11 if he'd been willing to work for it, and it wouldn't have taken much work. You can't just throw a 20 year old with less than a year's PL experience straight in the team ahead of Torres and Eto'o without upsetting people.*

*You can see how Lampard and Cole started the season as first choice and then were phased out by Mourinho as other players like Azpilicueta (also a fine bargain) showed themselves to be better.*

*It's not like Lukaku is some incredible world-class talent who has to be guaranteed a starting place at any club - he's a decent young striker who still has a lot to learn.*

*Some people can look at it on the positive way that Lukaku knows that and he prefers to take a step down and get guaranteed playtime instead of staying at Chelsea and being benched for Diego Costa and/or Torres.*

*There are arguments that he didn't expect to play for his spot; of course he was, if he showed himself to be better than Torres and Eto'o he would have started ahead of them, no question. There were a couple of games where Mourinho was so dissatisfied with the two that he actually played without a recognised striker like Schurrle against United.*

*Lukaku also has a sloppy first touch a la Chicharito, and bad control. He loses the ball a lot but has excellent hold up play and can be a lethal finisher. Of concern is his ability to go invisible in some big matches. I don't mind him returning, but he should fight for his right to start rather than expect to automatically start, since he doesn't really have experience playing for a big team.*

Again, this is my opinion, if you disagree just say so. But if Lukaku feels he can take a place in the bench and fight for his place, I don't see why he would go on loan again. Otherwise, four strikers: Costa, Lukaku, Torres, and Drogba (placed in order of importance because even though I'm smiling in happiness, Drogba is passed his prime as seen in his time with Galatasaray and his final year at Chelsea), seems like a great option for Chelsea at the moment: each one specializing in different aspects, with Lukaku used for against the lower side teams, Torres against the bigger teams (don't deny that that's were he has thrived and gotten us points while at Chelsea), an unknown but potentially good player in Costa, and the experienced one in Drogba.",1,1406305635,null,0,1406305979,0,cj7js5n,t3_2bp9he,t1_cj7js5n,t1_cj7j7hg,null,1434895048,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

Not quite so. Feminists such as Ti Grace Atkinson, and Florynce Kennedy heralded Solanas as a ""heroine and spokesperson"" of the feminist movement, and her book ""The Scum Manifesto"" became a ""foundation text"" of radical feminist theory. Radical Feminism is the branch of feminism from which we get such ideas as Patriarchy Theory, Male Privilege, and Rape Culture, so to claim Solonas was to feminism what Eliot Rodgers is to the MRHM is pretty disingenuous. Nobody in the MRHM applauds and endorses Rodgers the way feminist applauded and endorsed Solanas.

Ilori seems okay, and will still only be 22 at the end of this season (2 years younger than Kelly is currently, mind you). He could potentially go on loan to a PL side or abroad for another year to see if he can continue to improve.

Kelly... I'm not sure about him. I think his chance will be at fullback in a back 4 or potentially as RCB in a back 3, if we move to that system due to injuries. I think he is a decent player, but he can't be considered much better than Ilori or Wisdom at this point, and they can't/won't get games this year.

As for Skrtel, I think Lovren is better than Skrtel (I know that may be controversial), since individual errors that Skrtel is prone to really hurt us in a high line and play-out-of-the-back system. If Skrtel didn't have the pressure to play the ball, I think his errors would go mostly unnoticed. 

Agger, at his best, is as good as any defender in the world, for me. The problem is he hasn't been at his best for a while, and when he starts looking like recovering his form, he gets injured.

In summation, this is a good buy, in my opinion, as Skrtel and Agger will both be 30 in December (their birthdays are 2 days apart, ha) and Lovren just turned 25. Lovren and Sakho are a potential long-term pairing that would replace Skrtel and Agger.",0,1406307778,null,0,false,0,cj7kwz7,t3_2bp6ga,t1_cj7kwz7,t1_cj7k4gm,null,1434895583,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2
true,ZFree2013,null,null,"I watched the Milan game last night, and they were terrible. They looked like a team who were really struggling to decide how to play as a team, were they counter attacking? attack the wings? go through the middle? whatever they did, they did it reasonably poorly, every attack ended up broken down, and whilst they did have dangerous attacks they paled in comparison to the attacking threat on the opposite side. 

But in my opinion Olympiakos were not as superb as the result dictated really, they won, and rightly so, but they also scored the first two goals thanks to poor defending. All goals were superb do not get me wrong, especially the first and third, but it came as a side effect of just how poor Milan were, In the first goal, the defenders completely peeled away from the striker allowing him space move into and to control the ball and smash it in. The second goal came because Milan were completely open at the back, allowing a incisive pass and a skilful touch to make it 2-0. 

I think we have to be weary of Olympiakos no doubt, but I think we will be able to attack more than Milan did for large parts of that game and ultimately I think we have enough to see them off. 

Of course this is pre-season though, so none of the teams are assured to play their first XI, and in general mistakes can happen, so its not completely straight down the line, also whilst maybe a little insignificant given the way Milan played as a whole last night, Ballo will probably be in the team at some point, and Honda will come to the fore front, lets not also forget that the manager will be feeling the pressure to get the result, as even though it is pre-season the pressure seems to be on him.

So I'd say Yes- we have a good chance if you think logically. But football rarely follows binary logic so I cant say you would definitely not end up seeing City V Milan/Olympiakos in the final . 

But In my view Liverpool can beat these teams. City will be the big test I think. ",0,1406307789,null,0,false,0,cj7kx5w,t3_2bp6nb,t1_cj7kx5w,t3_2bp6nb,null,1434895586,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Her problem was that she could hear us going up and down our stairs, so we'd take our shoes off when we did, it was still a problem for her. We mentioned that we can hear her on her phone from morning to midnight and that we both just have give some leeway considering we're living on a terraced street.

Then she started shining torches through my housemates bedroom window at night and every time she went on her phone, she'd sit in her bathroom which was opposite my housemates bedroom, she'd spend hours sitting there badmouthing us and making up all kinds of shit.

We got broken into one night, the ps3 was taken but the intruders were disturbed before they could take more. We didn't even file a police report, as we knew it wouldn't get us anywhere.

A couple of days later and this woman is on her phone in her bathroom, accusing of us pulling an insurance scam and breaking into our own house. This is the kind of shit she'd make up.

Eventually we got into a council battle. We contacted the council, they wrote a letter to her, and she put in her own complaints. She's a single mother with 2 children. We're 3 lads, aged 24 - 30. We weren't winning that one. We ended up just moving out, which cost us each an extra £120 in admin fees that month. 


We only moved around 4 streets over. On popping to the shop a couple of months ago, we noticed a new family had moved into our old house, they had kids swarming around their front door.

The carbon thing is the opposite: the wheelbase is very short, so the front forks are steep, the front wheel does interfere with the pedals and the rear wheel is pressed against the seat tube.

They did some of the earliest strikes but got shut down hard. Unions came a fair bit later on.

I'd disagree. We don't yet have a news service that deliberately seeks to mis-inform like Fox News (ignoring the tabloids). That's not to say there isn't mis-information but its more by accident and derives from goodwill as opposed to the inherent desire to manipulate (Fox News).  

To be fair if we're seeking political reform here then the blame is soley at the hands of the people. We have the votes, if we had the will to directly engage with democracy, read up more and try and vote for a different party than the same shower of cunts we've had for the past century then we'd enact change.

He might even be one of the morons who saw the endowment wasn't going to make him rich and cashed it in and think it's fine for the bank not to be paid.

What puzzles me about this case is how far it went. Not only has the bank gone down the repossession route, but a judge has sided with the bank. That means this guy has stubbornly refused to do anything to fix the situation.

I'm not often involved in cases like these, but if a customer is receptive to workout out a solution I've always found one.

In this case I expect it would be if he'd read any one of the dozens of letters he was sent and contacted his bank ahead of time. He could have arranged to either downsize, or to repay as much of the money before retirement as possible and see how things turned out afterwards.

I was involved in the overall project to deal with the current book of customers who are on some kind of interest only mortgage, and they fell into two main categories. One category who were responsible and would work towards a solution. The second were idiots who stubbornly refused to deal with what they saw as not their problem, or when faced with the prospect of dialling back on their current spending or just plain denial they chose denial.

No, I'm an Atleti fan, I just watch all the big leagues, and in the states, none of my friends watch La Liga, which I have been following since 2010. So, in effort to not sit there and circljerk about La Liga and Atleti all the time to my friends, I started watching the PL. And Liverpool, since Dalglish was managing, has been the one that I enjoyed watching the most, speaking to the fans the most, etc etc.

I also love the Uruguayan national team, and Forlan because of Atleti, so after the 2010 WC, I followed Suarez very closely. Once he moved to Liverpool, that's when I started flipping on all the games.


I'm thick and through an Atleti fan, but I'll never lie about the soft spot I have for Liverpool. Some people thinks that makes me a bandwagon, but I started watching both of these clubs when they were in mid-table obscurity.. so I'm happy to defend the fuck out of both on their way back to the top.

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; I generally think we pay too much benefits but purposefully stitching people up in order to get the numbers down is not the right way to go about things.

We do pay out too much in benefits, but not to the unemployed. The unemployed account for a tiny minority of the benefits bill. Pensioners and disability benefits account for most of it, and those last two are the benefits that are not means tested, whereas unemployment benefits are means tested. 

So if you have over £6,000 in your bank account and you're unemployed, you get slightly less money. With a sliding scale giving you less money, stopping altogether if you have over £16,000. 

If you work and earn £50,000 a year, you can still claim disability. If you have millions in the bank you can still claim disability and a state pension. 

If you live abroad in Spain you can still claim your winter fuel allowance.

There are roughly 2.5million unemployed. There are 11.6million people claiming a state pension, with another 11.6 claiming some form of disability benefit. (Figures from 2012, and will be slightly higher now.)

These are the kinds of cuts we should be making to benefits. Cutting unemployment benefits is a drop in the ocean compared to the waste that goes on elsewhere. But the problem is that old people vote. 

Benefits are supposed to be there as a safety net for the poorest of society, not to top up the pockets of people who don't need it. 

We should be means testing all benefits. 

And if anyone wants to reply with ""well they're entitled to it"", well so are companies that use loopholes to avoid paying tax, but that doesn't make it right. ",0,1406311204,null,0,false,0,cj7mrkx,t3_2boovv,t1_cj7mrkx,t1_cj7io8w,null,1434896525,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

So the real question is about Kagawa's defensive workrate, about which there seems to be some disagreement in this thread.  I only really saw him last year with United, and he seemed a bit lazy/sluggish, but that season was pretty wretched for that whole team and especially for Kagawa, so it's not particular useful for assessing him.  But if Kagawa would put in the defensive work, he' be great alongside Christian and Coco.

I'm with you on Chadli, he shows moments of creativity, of scoring ability, and power.  And then he disappears for whole games at a time.  But he definitely puts in the work defensively.  He also has seemed to thrive best when he was interchanging with the other attacking MFs, so if Poch can get some consistency out of him, he could work really well with Eriksen and Lamela.

Lallana asked to move on to a bigger club after devoting his whole career to them. They now despise him. Lovren was given assurances about competing for Europe, keeping their core together, etc. These promises were then broken so he asked to leave. They now despise him too. 

We overpaid for Lallana. No doubt in my mind about that. But £16m for Lovren is a great deal. He was one of the top 3-4 CB's in the league last year playing for an average team and has his best years ahead of him. Yet the Soton fans are crowing about how much we've overpaid and 'thanks for the £45m', etc. 

They won't be crowing when they're fighting relegation this season. A team that doesn't belong in the bottom 3 always seem to get dragged in while one of the bottom 3 goes on a late run (Sunderland last season) and escapes the drop. If Koeman doesn't bring in quality replacements they will be in trouble.

They don't want our pity but I will still feel sorry for them when they're desperate for points in April and May.

Also look at the fees being paid for CB's this summer. Barca paid £17m for 30/31 yr old Mathieu. PSG pay £50m for Luiz.

true,Doc_Dish,null,null,"The gears change the ratio of the engine revolutions to wheel revolutions. If you have a bike with gears, you'll notice that there's different size cogs on the back wheel and crank joined by a chain. Using a smaller cog on the back makes it harder to pedal, but makes the bike faster while a larger cog makes the bike slower but easier to pedal.

This is because the ratio of the number of teeth on the front cog to the number on the back defines how many turns of the back wheel you'll get from a turn of the crank. For example if your front cog has thirty teeth and your back has fifteen, that's a ratio of 2:1 and you'll get two turns of the back wheel from one turn of the crank. A lower ratio, such as 1:1 (where both cogs have the same number of teeth) will give you one turn of the wheel from one turn of the crank, so the wheel turns slower *but you're putting the same amount of force into the crank from your legs*. So the wheel turns more slowly, but with more power.

The same principal applies when you change gear in a car. A lower gear equals more power and less speed, so you start the car moving in first gear, as it's stationary. As it starts to move, it has momentum so you need less power to keep it moving and can change gear to increase the speed.

As you get faster, you change up the gears to use your engine efficiently. If you wanted to increase the speed without changing gear, you'd need to increase the speed of the engine by applying more gas*, which would cost you more as well as increasing the stress on the engine.

Just because Lukaku chose to go out on loan last season doesn't mean he doesn't have the balls to fight for a starting spot. Maybe he just didn't have any interest starting behind a line of flops and a winger.

People say Lukaku can't expect to just be granted a first team spot but why not? Has Torres proven himself worthy of starting? No. Has Ba? No. Eto'o? Was the best of the three but still, no. Torres has been nothing but a disappointment since the second he came to the club, yet he's been our first choice striker since before Drogba even left and still hasn't proven himself. Why should Lukaku need to wait for his chance behind them lot when he knows and we all know, he's better. 

Torres and Ba started the opening two games of the season, Shurrle the third and it was against United, the team Lukaku had bagged a hat-trick against, all with Eto'o injured.

I'm all for Lukaku earning his spot as long as the people he's competing against for it have earn't it too, which wasn't the case last season.

I'm not saying it's a bad episode. In fact, it is easily one of my favorites, but due to the Doctor barely being in the episode, I don't feel like it can be truly appreciated. It seems more like an episode of some random Sci Fi show, in which the Doctor has a cameo. Personally, I like to refer people to The Girl in the Fireplace as a good place to watch one single episode (although there are definitely 2-parters that I like more, I thing that particular episode showcases almost everything Doctor Who has to offer in one sitting).

It is not representative of a lot of episodes, but despite the episodic nature of the show, there are still bits and pieces of background knowledge one is expected to have coming into it.  So despite the fact I think there are other good examples of the writing, and a few even better examples than Blink, an outside watcher would be too bogged down by their lack of knowledge of the story to appreciate it fully.  Plus..well...spoilers.

So I like to show off Blink, because it's quite good.  It shows how good the show can be, and since the story takes place from the view of an outsider then it's easy for others to follow along.

Women are less likely to be involved in violent crimes for rather obvious reasons, and therefore violent women offenders make up a smaller percentage of the women prison population than their male counterparts.

You need to compare sentencing for the same crime for people with similar criminal records and class. Not using blanket statistics.

I don't understand how you can believe women get harsher sentences for the same crime. People in general have more sympathy towards women, only edge cases like infanticide generate the opposite response. 

Next you'll be telling me that women get paid less than a man for the exact same roles. You can't take a huge nationwide statistic for 2 vastly different cohorts and say ""one is being discriminated against"". It's just completely devoid of any sense and nuance.

You cannot legally be penalised for not opting out, however many employers can make life a little harder if it's in the contract and you refuse (but they can do that for anything really).

If you go over the average, most companies with a half decent HR will simply inform you and ask you to drop back under. There is no requirement to pay overtime for this work if it isn't contractually stated (i.e. it's expected there will be occasions where extra hours will be needed to complete work but no compensation will be forthcoming)

Opting in is immediate. Opting out is 3 months notice. If you don't have a good reason to opt in (a second job would be a good reason to opt in for example) then don't. There is speculation this opt out may disappear at some point in the future, it's an EU derived law so there's that aspect to consider too depending on who is in power after the next election.

Even if you don't opt-out, the 48-hour week is an average over seventeen weeks (or sometimes 52 weeks for some reason).  Holidays, illness, etc. count as zero weeks, so you need quite a sustained period of overtime to get near a 48-hour average.

So it's not like this is a border between good-job and bad-job.  You'll get pissed off/burnt-out if you have enough ""extra-ordinary"" weeks before you hit the limit.

And you can opt back in at anytime.  No employer can punish you for opting-in, but if you work for a bone-fide slave-driver they can legitimately mark you down against your colleagues in performance reviews for getting less done.

The law is irrelevant essentially.  If you work in a hell-hole that requires massive-hours, it won't protect you.  If you have a decent working environment that recognises the need for free-time and good planning, then you won't be going anywhere near the 48-hour average, even if you do the odd week of extra work.

It's also worth pointing out that there are other aspects of the Working Time Directive that cannot be opted out of:

* You must have at least eleven hours of consecutive rest in any 24-hour period.  The maximum working day is thirteen hours, no exceptions.

* You must have either: a) one period of 24-hours consecutive rest in each 7-day period; or b) one period of 48-hours consecutive rest in each 14-day period.",0,1406317133,null,0,false,0,cj7pyv4,t3_2bpb1q,t1_cj7pyv4,t3_2bpb1q,null,1434898036,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,KaoticKarma,lfc12,,"&gt; specifically how you think the teams style will evolve or if it will?

Well, we have yet to finish our summer transfer window, but so far I don't think the team will go through any heavy ""transformation"" per say.

&gt; I know AM fans could probably give two fucks about that if you are successful but do you think it will affect your playstyle in the long term or will is this Simeone's style fullstop?

This is how I look at it. There's no way Simeone's style will stop here. It's ingrained into his personality and DNA, this robust, and efficient style of play. The way Atleti play now, is the way Simeone played and won trophies in his hayday. Lots of pressing, strength in the midfield, everyone more or less tracks back, attacking FBs, etc. His style is one that is very tactically astute, and moves like a well oiled machine. 

As well, a lot of peoples judged Simeone off his tactics in the CL. Where as in the league, he played less rigid football, and more attacking, which people think we seem to be missing. It's not that we're missing that extra bite or attacking edge, don't get me wrong our strengths definitely lie in our defense, but in La Liga the quality of the defenses is far worse as compared to the CL. Meaning that, in La Liga, with our already limited squad, we took more of a risk going forward than we ever thought of doing in the CL. Which is fine, we accepted we didn't individually have the quality to challenge most of the sides we met after the group stages, but as long as we played as a team, we had the quality to continue.

Simeone went into both competitions understanding, we'd have to build confidence with our results in the league, then go into our CL games with our tactics finely tuned, and hoping we get the extra bit of luck any winning side has to progress. To much of everyones surprise, that gamble paid off. 

To continue on the success, and bit of luck we had last year, Simeone is definitely going to have to reinforce, which he has been. Siqueira for Filipe, Mandzukic for Costa, Oblak for Courtois, we signed Tiago back for two years, and there's lots of rumors we're still in for another second striker (Cerci has been our #1 target) and a winger. With these two added signings, I think we'll have more than enough depth to improve where we lacked last year. I just hope we actually land Cerci. 

As well, might I add, Siqueira, while not as good as Filipe, is very close and in many Atletico fans opinions is better going forward, just not as great as Filipe was at defending. Mandzukic, is definitely the better striker out of Costa and him. While Costa is a talented player, and scored a lot last season, much of that had to do with how we setup our system around him to play to his strengths, while Mandzukic on the other hand more of fits our system, rather than us needing to cater to his strengths. Then Oblak, while he is no Courtois, shows tremendous ability and potential for such a young keeper. And, if our track record is anything to by in recent years (i.e. De Gea, then Courtois) Oblak will most likely flourish under Simeone.

All in all, I'm very, very excited about this upcoming season. We've kept the core of defense, and with all the scary attacking options Real and Barca have brought in this summer, Simeone has done a great job of making us feel like we'll still be able to compete. I truly think we can challenge again for the title, as far as CL goes though? Shoot, I hope we get as lucky with our draws again, we seemed to play all the right teams at the right time.

Hope this answers your question, mate. :).",0,1406317473,null,0,false,0,cj7q5e1,t3_2bpiyx,t1_cj7q5e1,t1_cj7paz3,null,1434898133,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Not all feminists are man haters, but there are, unfortunately, some, yes. Most feminists, however, are unaware of their own privilege, seeing only men's privilege and working towards ending that whilst leaving their own intact - inadvertently working towards greater inequality between the sexes whilst holding the laudable aim of doing the opposite.

Few academics study the subject as it is widely recognised in all fields other than feminist theory that feminist theory is a crock and it doesn't need disproving because it hasn't been proved and having not been proved no one takes it seriously.

true,TophatJesterII,,The barmaid.,"Three great games on my rotation lately: *Dark Souls 2*, *Dragon's Dogma* and *Football Manager 2014*.

Dark Souls 2 is much, much more playable and gamey than the first. The first though, imo, takes a big steamy dump on the sequel. The mechanics are less refined, and some sections are barely playable but the whole world, story, characters, weapons, and almost everything else is way better. Dark Souls 2 is still worth a play though, I've finished it three times.

Dragon's Dogma is just insanely fun and absorbing. Lose an hour to that on the blink of an eye! I'd not played it for months and returned to it knowing sod all still. Like a party-based rpg with a massive, massive world to fuck around in. Climbing up cyclops to gouge out their eyes and cool shit like that!

Football Manager...well I keep battering Arsenal in the latter stages of cups. nuf said!

&gt;“We were constantly told ‘agitate the customer’ and that ‘any engagement with the customer is an opportunity to ­sanction’,” he told them.

followed by:

&gt;He claimed managers fraudulently altered claimants’ records, adding: “Managers would change people’s appointments without telling them. The appointment wouldn’t arrive in time in the post so they would miss it and have to be sanctioned. That’s fraud. The customer fails to attend. Their claim is closed. It’s called ‘off-flow’ – they come off the statistics. Unemployment has dropped. They are being stitched up.”

&gt;__Cornhole__, also known as __Tailgate__, __[bean bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_bag) toss__ and variants is a [lawn game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_game) in which players take turns throwing bags of corn at a raised platform with a hole in the far end. A bag in the hole scores 3 points, while one on the platform scores 1 point. Play continues until a team or player reaches the score of 21. The game is thought to have originated from the owners of ""www.beverageholder.com"" in Northern Ohio. Others believe it was first played in the Cincinnati Ohio area (Southern Ohio).

Here are my thoughts about the Real transfer dealings, if you care:

&gt;However, IMO the jury is still out on whether we would be better of with Modric and Bale still at the club, or the £100m - 110m (?) we got for the pair. If the team really starts firing this season or next, then maybe it was worth it. If we fall down to 6th, 7th or 8th place again over the next few seasons, I'd say we were fucked by Real.

I've never claimed to be the ultimate authority on all things Spurs, which is why I find your hostility quite puzzling. I thought this was a discussion thread, not the inquisition or some shit.

I've found WhoScored's information in general to be very reliable, and I have no reason to not trust these numbers, as I think he often lined up on left of midfield or at LW that I remember during his time with Liverpool. The stats I mentioned about playing position just have to do with where they started, though, which is a bit silly.

I'd agree that Lallana isn't the type of LW in a 4-3-3 that we'd want to have in an ideal situation, but that was never really my point. I just wanted to mention that both he and Coutinho could operate there effectively for Liverpool. This is especially true when BR relies a lot on his fullbacks for width in the attacking half.

&gt; Council chiefs had agreed to fly the flag as a mark of solidarity with the people of Gaza – they then said an hour before it was due to be raised that the decision had been scrapped and they would lower the Union Flag instead.
&gt; 
&gt; Then following a meeting with campaign group Children of the Ghetto, who initially requested the flag be raised, it was – in front of around 2,000 people outside Preston Town Hall.
&gt; 
&gt; The initial decision had sparked a row online with people questioning why the council was getting involved. After the flag was raised a peaceful demonstration was held with people chanting and holding placards.
&gt; 
&gt; However, there was some minor unrest earlier on and the police had to move in.
&gt; 
&gt; Former Preston Councillor Michael Lavalette, said: “It’s been a strange day. It was definitely going to happen then Preston City Council came under huge pressure, they decided they weren’t going to put the flag up.
&gt; 
&gt; “We had a long and heated argument and meeting with them and in the end they agreed to fly the flag.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s the start of a weekend of solidarity.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mumira Patel, 32, from Preston, was one of the many people in the crowd.
&gt; 
&gt; She said: “It’s a fantastic event, we want to thank Preston Council. It’s very symbolic and historical. It’s all about humanitarianism. It isn’t about any particular religion, it’s about the treatment of decent civilians.
&gt; 
&gt; “People of all cultures and backgrounds and the same backgrounds uniting.
&gt; 
&gt; “We just want to say a really big thank you to the council.”
&gt; 
&gt; When the council announced it wouldn’t be flying the flag, Coun Rankin said: “We have listened to and reflected the views expressed to us about flying the Palestinian flag in Preston.
&gt; 
&gt; “I have been truly touched by the many views that have been expressed from all sides.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is clear this is a very emotive issue and we have had literally hundreds of people from Preston and indeed from around the world contact us about it.”
&gt; 
&gt; However nobody from the council was available for comment at the time the decision was reversed and the flag was raised.
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout the day there were mixed views posted on lep.co.uk
&gt; 
&gt; Prestonvoice32 said: “Who do PCC think they are making this decision on behalf of their residents.”
&gt; 
&gt; And Cumbrianboy said: “Why is Preston Council taking sides in this conflict?”

I find massive clubs like Barca to be the arsiest, you can win everything there is to win with them, make countless millions by selling sub par La Masia products and aging first teamers and they'll still refuse to offer you a decent contract, and confidence bottoms out if you draw a single home fixture.

And also, it pains me to move to other teams :( I get absurdly attached to those lists of numbers and stats we call players and staff in this game.

Showing deals for players in the same position on the extreme end shows the range of transactions in the market and where each transaction is relative to each other.

true,specialkkurtis,null,null,"Congrats on the teaching job!

I'm a PhD student (UCL, not Oxford) living in Oxford with my partner. My stipend is £15,590 per annum. That's it. No extra income.

I've lived in Oxford for nearly three years on that money and I've never felt short of cash. I lived in a nice one bed flat in Headington (£700 per month) and now I own a house in Abingdon. We eat out a lot, we have at least two major holidays each year and I really like gadgets! You can definitely live in Oxford on £16,129.

Google 'Oxford city council tax' and it will give you the exact amount and any discounts you may be eligible for (single person occupancy usually gets a discount).

I've not found Utilities to be as expensive as people make out. I think I worked out that gas and electricity cost an average of just over £1 a day when we lived in our flat. That was a 'fixed' deal with British Gas.

Our current broadband is with Sky and costs £12.50 and includes the telephone line and unlimited downloads.

An all inclusive bus travel 'key' card costs about £400 per annum and gets you pretty much everywhere in Oxford. It's a good deal and most employers offer a discount. I know Oxford Uni gives an interest free loan and a 10% discount for staff to get pay for travel cards or a bicycle.

Food costs are difficult. We like food and spend a lot one week and then hardly anything the next. We'll shop in Waitrose some weeks and then Aldi other weeks.

Restaurants, stores, cinemas and attractions all offer discounts in Oxford for university staff (as well as people who have a bus 'key' card). A Taste Card can be handy also and apps like VoucherCloud.

Again, you can definitely live in Oxford on £16,129. You'll do just fine!

I also think she'll be someone from a previous doctor who episode, probably old who.

Well, it's the phone app and not the full version (my computer is a donkey) so it's a bit more simple.

I'm making them money, I'm winning (admittedly my team does occasionally just forget how to play football though) and it feels like I'm throwing jelly up the stairs with them.

I completely understand where you're coming from with that.

I was ready to sell him for like ~£15mil but then I think either I upped my offer or he gave in. Now he's one of Argentina's star players and valued at ~£50m and ripping the league apart for me.

Shaw became the most expensive teenager in football after joining Manchester United for £27million from Southampton and signing a four-year contract worth over £100,000 a week.

But Chelsea manager Mourinho backed away from a deal once he felt the figures started to spiral out of control and instead signed 28-year-old Filipe Luis for £15.8 million from La Liga champions Atlético Madrid.
“If we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for, for Luke Shaw, we are dead,” said Mourinho. “We kill our stability with financial fair play. We kill the stability in our dressing room.

“Because when you pay that much to a 19-year-old kid — a good player, a fantastic player — but when you pay that amount of money, the next day the players knock on the club’s door and say, 'How is it possible I play for this club 200 games and won this and that; how come a 19-year-old comes here and gets more money than I get?’ It would kill immediately our balance and we don’t allow that.”
Brazilian Luis is understood to be earning just under £80,000 a week at Chelsea. During four years at Atlético, he won La Liga, the Europa League, the Copa del Rey and reached last season’s Champions League final. Shaw made 67 first-team appearances for Southampton and has won three England caps.
Mourinho added: “You can say Luis is much less expensive. He played for Brazil, won titles in Spain, won a European competition, played in the Champions League final, this guy is much cheaper than an English young lad.
“And is he good for our average wages, yes he is.
“Sometimes you have to make decisions. I don’t criticise the other clubs for paying it. They can pay what they want. I don’t have any comment about it. But for my club, we can say it would be very negative for us.”",0,1406326562,null,0,false,0,cj7utk1,t3_2bqam3,t1_cj7utk1,t1_cj7ur5c,null,1434900407,17,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,17

There's nothing crazy about certain specialism earning more than 4x median salary.  And most developers don't even earn that if you measure against the city they live rather than UK average, more like 2.5x.  For example the £80,000 job listing posted earlier, the London median salary is £34216 (Source: [ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2013-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2013.html)) - that's only 2.3x median salary. 

There does seem to be strange snobbish factors at work here.  Companies refusing to pay more than ""market price"", but yet not being able to hire anyone; even at great cost to themselves.  I once saw a company with retention problems gradually lose their development team as people left for better offers, the company loudly complained about the ""skills shortage"", only for it later to emerge they were trying to hire replacements at lower salaries than those the old team had been on (which in turn weren't high enough to keep them interested); meanwhile their product stagnated and the competition poached all their customers.  They had the money, they just refused to ""pay over the odds"".

People have been talking about offshoring for decades now, but it doesn't seem to have had any effect[1].  Developers close to ""the business"" seems to be really valued; especially amongst companies who are primarily technology focused, or small companies who need rapid development.  The companies most likely to engage in offshoring are those who lack the technical leadership at the right level to bridge the gap, and end up trying to split on-shore ""product development"" from off-shore ""programming"", but this way is most likely to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.

true,dudewhatthehellman,eu,European Union,"&gt; I hate the Lib-Dems because of their appallingly self-serving decision to support a government that has unnecessarily caused immense harm to the population, all the while protecting those who actually put us in the poor situation in the first place. 

Well I applaud them for taking the chance to get in government and doing everything they have done whilst there. You're clearly biased against the Tories but England voted for them and I'd rather see a Conservative Lib-dem coalition than not having a government or seeing Labour take hold again. 

&gt;Quick question for you: if a political party can get away with abandoning it's manifesto promises and doing whatever they feel like to get into power, then how on earth can you trust them?

Quick answer: Every single party does that, what's new? They've kept their other policies, more so than other parties do. One of Obama's core issue was the closure of Guantánamo and he never did it, does that mean he's not the best candidate for the US presidency? Of course not. It's their economic soundness and social policy in general.

Lastly, the AV referendum was supported by the Lib Dems but not actually made by them. How is it their fault that it didn't pass seeing as the two main parties didn't support it (yay labour). It was a democratic vote not a vote in parliament.

The three major targets from last summer: Mkhitaryan, Willian and to a lesser extent Diego Costa all had good, productive seasons for their clubs. Willian, I'll still say he's overrated and is absolutely not worth the price Chelsea paid for him. If we had signed any or all of them and they didn't perform, the narrative would be, ""look at wasteful, inept Liverpool bringing in subpar players again."" Had we signed them and they played well, everyone would be calling Rodgers and Ayre geniuses. 

We're signing a lot of players and I guarantee some of them (particularly Emre Can imo) will make the club look very shrewd indeed. No transfer is a sure thing but just because the players we were linked to did well doesn't mean that the players we're linked to now are poor quality. 

EDIT: For clarity, the ""lesser extent"" with reference to Diego Costa is just that the links to him were the least concrete last summer. I know he had the best season of the three of them.

&gt;You're clearly biased against the Tories but England voted for them

Interestingly, they didn't win. they required a coalition in order to be able to obtain a majority.

&gt;They've kept their other policies, more so than other parties do. 

Simply put, I don't believe you. I remember Blair and those little cards they put out before the election with the 5 manifesto promises printed on them, and they kept to that, so I'm pretty sure you're wrong about this. This government has been remarkable for neither party keeping it's election promises. Coalitions cause difficulties sure, but it was pretty disgusting the unholy glee both parties had in abandoning their promises as quickly as possible.

&gt;Lastly, the AV referendum was supported by the Lib Dems but not actually made by them. How is it their fault that it didn't pass seeing as the two main parties didn't support it (yay labour).

The simple point is that the Lib-Dems have supported the Conservative government to do some despicable things over the last few years, all on the promise of getting a chance to push AV through. Which they then screwed up. And let's not have any of this bollocks that
&gt;the AV referendum was supported by the Lib Dems but not actually made by them.

Five years from now Syria and Iraq could have dissolved, Russia could have partitioned Ukraine, Scotland could be independent, the UK could be out of the EU, China could be the world's foremost superpower - so many things could have changed, but the Palestinians will still be firing rockets at the Israelis, and the Israelis will still be dropping bombs on Gaza. If they aren't, it'll be because they are in one of their uneasy truces that punctuate that activity.

So why even bother to pick a side if you have no reason to? I can understand why people with ties the region or to one side or the other might feel it's important, and I understand a humanitarian crisis when I see one, but I don't get why it should have special prominence over other events, as it seems to have. I don't understand why journalists, news pundits and politicians who've never even been to the area have a ritual bun fight over it. I think probably the best reaction to something everyone tells you that you should care about, is to question why.

I implied nothing of the sort: you've put words in my mouth. I don't believe living on benefits by choice is ethically fair and I completely disagree with you that people should consider JSA as an optional alternative to work. I resent that sense of entitlement. If that's what you're defining as ""scum"" then we're on the same page but that is certainly not the word I would choose.

&gt; Well, that's a different question as to whether or not it's sensible to use JSA as a lifestyle choice for any given individual.
&gt; As for whether they should get it? No, you worked for it, just like I do. I begrudge the tax system in its current form too. But the system is designed in such a way that this is where we're at, whether we like it or not. If I were you, I'd focus my attitude on piss-poor paying employers. We wouldn't have this situation if they weren't so pervasive. Blaming people on the bottom when the top is so utterly fucking corrupt is ridiculous in the extreme.

Your argument was that people who work for minimum wage are mugs because they could make almost as much on handouts for doing nothing. Furthermore, you accused me of ""self-congratulatory wank"" for taking pride in the fact that I support myself instead of living on handouts from people who *are* working.

I have a huge problem with that attitude. I agree that the minimum wage is too low, and I consider taxes a necessary evil for the public services we all enjoy, but I firmly believe state benefits should be a safety net for those in dire straits, not a handout for people who think they're too good to work for minimum wage.",0,1406330250,null,0,false,0,cj7whs2,t3_2borok,t1_cj7whs2,t1_cj7vjo4,null,1434901237,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5

On the other hand, there are many elements of risk you assume when you travel in the developing world, and dodgy, alien, potentially (even more) corrupt criminal justice systems, operating according to different, sometimes almost incomprehensible rules and laws, is most definitely one of them.

I know the drugs are pretty much tangential here (although they presumably may be (partly) responsible for the death), but it's worth hammering this home because I ran into so many otherwise sensible and lovely people in SE Asia who seemed to totally turn their brains off and assume it was a game with limited repercussions because mostly the local cops didn't give a shit (until they did - and when they did, that gave them the power to pretty much do what they liked).

Wrong.

&gt; I don't believe living on benefits by choice is ethically fair and I completely disagree with you that people should consider JSA as an optional alternative to work. 

Ok. You believe that, fair enough. I don't, and I think any claim you try and make to moral supremacy by invoking an obligation to over-simplified ethics is a nonsense. You can live in a fantasy world of honour and absolute morality if you want, but the reality is going to get you! Give me a solid reason beyond ""oh, i earned this myself woopdedoo"" why anyone would work an extra 150 hours a month for an extra 50 quid. *Oh yay, I earned an extra 50 quid and all I had to do was get up at 7am every day and go to a job that pays like shit and probably has shit working conditions too and not get home until 11 or 12 hours every day, but hey, at least I jolly well earned that extra 50 quid myself!*

Oh, how totally worth it that is.

&gt;  If that's what you're defining as ""scum"" then we're on the same page but that is certainly not the word I would choose.

If you don't respect those people and you don't agree with them, it doesn't really matter what you call them, you still by definition consider them degenerate. That's what that word means. 'Scum' is just a pop across the pond from there, so don't pretend like this is some kind of shocking accusation. If it's because I put it in quotes, then I'll retract that, I guess. If it's so important. Even though that's still what you clearly meant. 

&gt; Your argument was that people who work for minimum wage are mugs because they could make almost as much on handouts for doing nothing.

Yes, it is. Because I think they are.

&gt;  Furthermore, you accused me of ""self-congratulatory wank"" for taking pride in the fact that I support myself instead of living on handouts from people who are working.

Yes, I did. Because I think that work is an avenue to money, which is an avenue to freedom, and the desire to pursue these avenues is the only thing that makes any sensible person go to work in the first place. If you're using work as some kind of self-congratulatory wankfest on how noble a human being you think you are, rather than as a means to provide you with money to enable you to have the freedom to do what you like, then I think you're an idiot. Then again, if you just can't help but love working slavishly for low reward, then by all means go ahead, but at least try and earn some real self-respect by acknowledging you're unnecessarily whoring yourself out for less than you're worth. 

&gt; I have a huge problem with that attitude.

Get off your cross, man.

&gt;  I agree that the minimum wage is too low, and I consider taxes a necessary evil for the public services we all enjoy, but I firmly believe state benefits should be a safety net for those in dire straits, not a handout for people who think they're too good to work for minimum wage.

The problem with making that statement is that you're pretty much entirely ignoring the inherent current reality of the UK, wherein vast amounts of people are being underpaid for the work they do. In ignoring that simple thing, you are by extension legitimising it, which is really pretty fucking repugnant.

If you think anyone that has half a brain is going to work for nothing more than if they didn't work, or only marginally more than if they didn't work - then you're naive and your ethical conclusion is overly simplistic and clearly clouded by an assumption that the normalisation of low wages for honest work is acceptable, when it isn't. 

The fact is, until wages (especially in Northern Ireland) reflect living standards and adequately reward the massive effort that is full time employment under increasingly shitty work conditions, of course people are going to take the easier option. They'd be fucking retarded not to, regardless of whatever morality you yourself happen to ascribe to.

The day our home fixtures are an Old Trafford clone of tourists, core supporters priced out and a sterile atmosphere will only be the day some will take notice. But by then it'll be too late, and this club as we know it will be gone forever.

We have to get over this idea of not wishing to come across as ungrateful for the riches we've had poured into this club.

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; Yeah, but cutting disability benefit is pretty horrific. 

Cutting disability **for the poor** is horrific. Cutting disability benefit for those who clearly don't need it is definitely in the interest of the tax payers.

The part about the pensions is mainly only in there to illustrate the amount spent in comparison to unemployment benefits, but I still don't think pensioners living abroad should be able to claim for the winter fuel allowance simply because ""they're entitled to it"".

&gt; Means-testing costs money too - it has to be clear that the money saved is greater than the expense required.

If it costs so much money, why do we do it for the unemployed?

And if the system is already in place for unemployed people, why doesn't it apply to all other benefits?

You don't need some complicated system for means testing. It's a simple section on the unemployment benefit form when you apply for benefits that states how much capital you have in bank accounts/savings accounts, etc. (There is also a part of those forms that states you grant the government access to any bank accounts to check these figures.)

Adding that section to other benefit forms will not bankrupt the country. 

The main point of all of this is that targeting a few unemployed people may look good in the papers, but few people understand that other benefits cost the country far much more and are far more wasteful.

Unemployed people are an easy target because they're a minority when it comes to benefits and voting power, so the many other millions of people love to shit all over them while claiming a fuck-ton of money they don't actually need.

No you don't.  You are free to decide that Israel doesn't deserve the support of the UK government on a particular issue, but that doesn't mean you have to uniformly support the Palestinians and condemn the Israelis.

Personally, I think it's something of a childish impulse to feel the need to pick sides in what amounts to a tragedy.  This isn't a football match.  There are steps that either side could take to bring an end to the current conflict.  

If I have to pick a side, I'm on team peace.  In my opinion, that means that the Israelis need to stop killing so many civilians and Hamas have to stop firing rockets into Israel.  Your opinion may differ on what each party must do, but the point is that both parties can do something.

I think the park at the bottom of Barcroft and the flags there abouts aren't an issue as it is a nationalist area. In the same way you wouldn't go into to the Newtownards road and ask them to remove their flags and emblems etc you cant expect the people of Barcroft et al to do the same. The important thing about the whole ""shared space"" idea is that you recognise the rights of certain parts of the community to celebrate aspects of their history that you may not necessarily agree with. A good example is on the 12th of July you have boys marching in old time UVF uniforms and at Easter republican parades you have boys marching in IRA uniforms from 1916. Whilst you might like one, both or neither you have to respect a communities ability to 'celebrate' its 'culture' in ways that may not appear appealing to you. You might think the old UVF men are heroes of Northern Ireland and deserve all the praise we can give, you may just see the parade as loyalists trotting out emblems of the good old days when they were in charge. You may see the men of 1916 as revolutionary heroes, you may see them as the blood stained fore fathers of the PIRA. 

The crucial thing is that you recognise more than one point of view exists(and certainly more than the black and white examples I have used but you get the idea) and respect the rights of those who chose to express themselves lawfully.
