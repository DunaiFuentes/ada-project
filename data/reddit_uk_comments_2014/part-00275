They have to get their assets back in order first before they start lending out again it was the condition of the bail out, hence why lending has been so low because in the long term the banks having assets enough to stablise themselves should this happen again is worth fair more than us shelling out for it again.

The information is incredibly complicated, incomplete, and often completely unavailable; and companies do their level best to hide information which will upset their customers, to green/redwash their companies, to put geographical, legal and conceptual distance between them and their worst practices, tailor the presentation of their products ethics for the markets they are operating in, etc.

Oh look another wild assumption based on no information again, ill place it with the others shall i? even a chimp learns, yet you keep making the same idiotic and retarded assumptions based on nothing despite being the one trying to argue against using assumptions in your earlier comments (and being really shown up by it.)

You see an intelligent man actually uses information and data to form his opinion and ideas/points and comparisons, for example, using data and evidence i can categorically state that the shit hole you call a dwelling with your other fucked up house mates,  i wouldn't live in if you paid me, i know how much you pay and i can absolutely state that in an ""aspect of your life"" i have a much better more luxurious and expensive property that doesn't look like some ramshackle shit hole like yours does.   

And before you go blowing your trumpet thinking because you got a high response rate or applications for your room, that i must be wrong and you are doing well, ill remind you that shitty squalid council tower block flats have waiting lists thats are years long. Demand is not an indicator of your ""success"".

Likewise i find it funny that someone who spends their time publishing drawings on the Internet done by strangers of noel Edmonds for approval of different strangers actually has the nerve  to call someone a loser because they think that person plays a computer game, i mean surely this doesn't need explaining to you .

I am genuinely amused that you really actually think you are something, and that despite the repeated proven stupidity of your past comments and the indisputable reality of your living arrangements and ""career"" (i use that term very loosely ) you actually think you are ""beating me in every aspect of your life"".

Another top tip for you son: total delusion is not a successful life strategy, you might be able to get a temporary nights sleep by playing that card to your ego, but eventually reality catches up to you, even though your brain is probably very below average,  even so, eventually it will work out its own lies and deception.

I must confess however your post subsequently has been of value to me, what was originally a pile of wank posted by an immature unintelligent muppet turned out to be a sobering and sincere window into the life of the less fortunate, and has given me much satisfaction and pleasure in reminding me of the blessings and wealth for which i am afforded and often take for granted.

Much like seeing a chimp at the zoo lets you appreciate the full richness of human life. Communicating with you and peering into your life has been a really rewarding experience for me and made me appreciate all the things you don't have and never will, but i take for granted, so in a weird way, thank you for being you.

true,Sasakura,null,null,"&gt;I'm not quite sure how to phrase this but I bank with HSBC, are ATMs widely accessible?

HSBC has a main office right in the centre but all ATMs (in the UK, pretty much) will accept your card without fees.  Only non-bank branded Link machines found in post-offices or small shops may charge for services.  If you've got a non-UK/EU card then you'll be charged a fee wherever you use it.

&gt;I'm budgeting something like 50 pounds / day for food (assume eating out mostly but I'm going to try my best to cook). Feasible? Way too much? Way too little?

£50 is waaay more than you need to spend on food, I happily get by on £10 per day on food and that's buying ready meals from supermarkets.  With some planning and storage for dry or tinned foods you could make do on 1/2 that.  Compared to Singapore (did I stalk right?) restaurants are much more expensive and food will can more expensive but good quality can be found for cheap.

&gt;I assume its mostly pub culture in Oxford? What about night clubs and stuff? How late are pubs (and other things like grocery stores) open?

Lots of (good) pubs but there are some comedy clubs and nightclubs around.  Generally pubs are open til 11pm and clubs later during weekends but individual places may vary.  Normal shops close at 6pm, larger grocery stores used to close around 9 but may stay open till 11pm.  Small stores will close at 11 (but also on sundays unlike large stores).  There's a few 24hr supermarkets but in general everything shuts overnight.

&gt;How do you guys primarily get around?

From where you are, either go to the Woodstock road and there are many buses going into the centre.  They will stop overnight but can run quite late (2-3am) during weekends.  You can also walk down the canal path direct to the train station/SBS which should be about 30min from where you are.  The path is fairly safe at night but I know not everyone would recommend it.  If you miss the last bus you can get taxis or just walk; the streets up to Jericho are safe at night.",0,1410995490,null,0,false,0,cklb64y,t3_2gpeyy,t1_cklb64y,t3_2gpeyy,null,1426952931,5,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,5

Don't get me wrong i have no doubt the open sewer you call your existence has some truly wonderful shit nuggets that would really make me appreciate being me and having my life even more than i have seen so far, but i feel that the time and effort spent wading through to find them is better spent elsewhere.

I doubt you will understand, but should they ever find a cure for your condition and you manage to obtain the status of average (keep dreaming champ its half the battle) maybe you will get a glimmer of just how retarded you have been, and were (currently are).

Ill keep my fingers crossed for you and hope that one day the  miracle happens, until then perhaps consider getting a trusted adult or carer to sanity check your work, you might find it helps improve your life, which, lets face it, is probably the only direction it can really go Considering where you are now.

 What about swimming pools, or staircases then? I would argue that it is easier for a child to accidentally die from falling down stairs, or into a pool (admittedly not in the UK where the weather doesnt call for many swimming pools.) I dont have the figures in front of me, but I remember reading some time ago that in the states there are hundreds of pool accidents  every year. Yet the government is yet to make them illegal. 

 Stairs are similar, its insanely easy to fall down a flight of stairs. Yet safety gates are not mandatory. 

 My point is, childrens safety is an easy card to play, who can condemn a politician for wanting to protect kids right? The fact remains though that accidental gun deaths make up a tiny fraction of the deaths in countries like Switzerland, Norway and Iceland (where gun ownership is legal, and common.) These countries also have some of the lowest crime rates in the world. 

 The real reason guns were banned is its a ""bandaid"" solution to higher crime rates. An easy cop out for politicians who don't want to actually have to make peoples lives better - as well as a safety net for the government (imagine the London riots with armed rioters, its terrifying.) 

 If childrens safety was the main concern, things like Coke, all of the ridiculous sweeties kids seem to eat so much of, fish and chips, would all be regulated, as one could quite easily argue that these things are causing more deaths than guns ever did. Obesity is a real problem, but try to find a politician willing to tell Mr and Mrs Smith that they cant give their little angel another coke...

    Spain GDP:                                                      1,012 Billion EUR

    Money from all sea fishing:                                     1.5 Billion EUR

I looked up how many tons of fish Spain got from Scotland last year, it adds up to a measly 2,000 tons. Mostly hake and monkfish is what we fish in Scotland (not particularly beloved species in Spain.) Spain fishes from the sea 750,000 tons anually, so assuming fish is equally priced we would get:

    Money from fishing at Scotland:                                 4 Million EUR

    Percentage of Spain's GDP that comes from fishing at Scotland:  0.0004%

I hope I didn't make any mistake on the final division but in any case, you can see the impact would be very very tiny.

This is entirely inconsequential for the government of Spain. In fact the fishing fleet is changing locations all the time. Add to that that rake and monkfish are ""commodity"" fish, it's something you buy frozen and feed to kids and nothing that people would miss if there were a tiny bit less of it. Spain is surrounded by water from several seas, anyway, we also have a very strong fishfarming industry. We also fish a lot from Africa in addition to our own coast. This would hardly be an element of pressure.

And in case you were talking not about Scottish waters but about blocking access to the north, [in this article in French](http://www.mumm.ac.be/FR/NorthSea/fishing.php) from the Royal Belgium institute of Natural Sciencies you can see a chart of North Sea exploitation by countries, as you can see Spain doesn't even register. We don't need to venture so far north for extra fish, Africa is nearby. Even without the North Sea, Spain is the largest fish producer in the EU, with 16% of the production (Spain has territory in Africa, the Canary Islands, which helps.)

If a black person says this, it isn't looked at much be a issue as it's unlikely to be used with malice as they are black, whereas if a non-black person uses the word it is less easy to tell the person's intentions by the use of the word because they're not black. It would be unlikely for a black person to use the word 'nigger' with true malice towards another black person as it is an insult based skin colour, the same skin colour which is possessed by the person using the insult. This makes the person immediately think they are not being serious in its usage.

Thus we have an issue were it's okay of black people to call black people 'niggers' yet unacceptable for non-black people to call black people 'niggers'. That is unsustainable. Everyone should be living by the same rules if you want people to get on, we must avoid the ""one rule for us, another rule for them"" issue as this breeds separation.

If it is unacceptable for a non-black person to call a black person 'nigger' - it should be unacceptable for a black person to call a black person 'nigger'.

I see the Yes vote as the best way forward and for the politicians to grow up and work together to continue to be united potentially sharing our armed forces, currency etc. but for Scotland to make it's own laws and (trade) agreements with the UK.

The HoL is unelected, appointed by politicians and still has seats for Bishops and hereditary peers. The UK has a two party system, and one of the two parties is practically a non-entity in Scotland (and a complete non-entity in NI). Asymmetric devolution makes constitutional crises possible, something that gets more severe if devolution increases. There is no codified constitution. And fundamentally we have a unitary state in an age that is going to require increased subsidiarity, ""Westminster is sovereign"" is an anachronism. 

Better Together, the Unionist parties have wasted three years denying the problems that exist at the heart of the Union, never mind actually proposing practical solutions to how they may be tackled.

That is why Gordon Browns speech and much of the Better Together arguments, emotive and seemingly heartfelt as they may be, cannot be  trusted. They make no promises, they refuse to acknowledge the existence of problems, they propose no solutions.

It's generally a young, tech-savvy community and not representative of the wider population. When most people on Reddit (including me) think of gamers, we think of people who actively sink time and money into playing games. We think of people who actually own consoles or gaming PCs and use them every day.

Even someone who just messes around with Angry Birds on their phone for a few minutes each day would technically be a gamer. I mean, nobody says ""I'm a reader"" or ""I'm a TV-watcher"" because those things are very mainstream and those are simply mediums. While gaming is more mainstream than it has ever been, there's still a world of difference between someone who plays LoL or Starcraft for hours each day and someone who just plays Angry Birds on the bus to amuse themselves for 10 minutes. I would call the former a gamer but not the latter. Nobody would ever say: ""yeah, I plan to go home tonight and play Angry Birds for a few hours.""

Still I don't believe there's a special gate or criteria someone needs to meet before they can be considered a gamer... everybody is going to have their own views on it. Some might consider *me* a hardcore gamer but I consider other people who spend way more time gaming than me to be the hardcore ones while I'm quite casual.. it's all about perspective.

I think you made your point respectfully, but Westminster &amp; the BBC seem to be implying that we are making up our minds based on sentiment and nationalism. And yet from here in Scotland the debate has a level of seriousness, quality and intelligent enquiry among people who might never have even voted before which I have never before experienced in British politics. It is absolutely exhilarating to see the kind of engagement from people rather than the politicians for once and I think that the principal reason why the Yes vote is rallying. I've never experienced anything like this in my lifetime and I've never before seen such disparity between what is presented on the news and what it feels like to be here. And maybe that's the point: the UK is now too disparate to properly represent all its constituent parts. Maybe it's time. 

Both sides of course can make claims to patriotism: to Scotland, or to the UK. I'm an internationalist and am voting Yes because I believe Scotland stands a guardedly better chance of creating the kind of society I want than the dire trough UK politics is in. I can assure you that from up here there is very little nationalism in this debate any more: it's about appropriate rule. If I felt nationalist fervour I'd run. Source: I was born in England.

2. Its interest free till 1 month after your course completion date, then its 9.9% APR.
3. You wont recieve all of the loan since the bank will pay your uni directly for the tuition fee for courses over £2k.
4. There are admin costs if you don't pay the loan back every month so i don't agree with what you said about paying it back at any time.

Like the other comments, depends on what you can afford once you're working and how you live. I personally would not suggest using the loan for a mortgage if your projected income can't support.
As you the loan, I would try and pay it off asap, or pay as much of it back through a personal loan which can be given through you bank at a lower interest rate. Might save you some money.
Btw, the earlier you pay your loan back, the lower the total value of repayment. I definitely recommend this rather than using the loan for a mortgage.

Lots of people Cycle, busses are regular and run quite late.

&gt; Any restaurants etc to recommend / check out? (Bonus: I'm on Keto, so if anyone can recommend anything keto-friendly that would be huge)

I don't have the budget to eat out much but I know that the wetherspoons pubs (there are at least 2 in Oxford) are very good at listing their ingredients and I know a keto guy who has the Chicken and bacon salad from there often.

&gt; I want to use this opportunity to develop some hobbies etc

Check out Dailyinfo, lots of classes, clubs, all kinds of interesting local things.

&gt; I assume its mostly pub culture in Oxford? What about night clubs and stuff? How late are pubs (and other things like grocery stores) open?

Yeah, it's fairly prevalent but not everybody is into it, it's a diverse city.  Pubs are usually open until 11pm, clubs until maybe 2am.

&gt; As I'm moving to Uni there I think I'll have to do a run to buy sheets, towels, laundry hamper etc - all the college goodies. Any recommendations of where to buy this? 

Even if you have access to a car if I was going to start anew i'd be tempted to buy everything through amazon or ebay.  If you can get things delivered to your room or to your cousin's place then I think you could get a really good deal.

&gt; I'm not quite sure how to phrase this but I bank with HSBC, are ATMs widely accessible?

Yeah, you won't have trouble finding ATMs

&gt; I'm budgeting something like 50 pounds / day for food (assume eating out mostly but I'm going to try my best to cook). Feasible? Way too much? Way too little?

If you're careful with money, £50 will last you a week or more.  That's supermarket food of course.  If you want to eat out, expect to pay £5-8 for a cooked lunch and £8-15 for a cooked evening meal.

Maybe this is the same case with Toure. They move Fernandinho down to play defensively and Toure up to be almost a CAM of sorts. So perhaps it is his role to roam around looking for room and waiting for us to get the ball so that he can receive a pass....

There might spring up a kind of spite (which may be a big deal in election season) given that Scotland will be borne out of what will inevitably be viewed by some as a hostile act, which could result in UK politicians being a bit bitchy with regard to Scotland. That's the context in which I think there may be concerns for Scotland's future as a member of various organisations and things. 

That aside, Spain seems to be pretty pissed off about the whole affair, and they may well kick some other shit up.

That coupled with our great form, having home advantage, and having our strikers coming off of goals this weekend, we should have won easily.

If you can increase your revenue numbers through sponsorship, TV, European Competitions, and obviously, matchday revenue; then you can spend more. 

You should see the recent criticism of FFP, that it basically keeps the status quo because it is so hard to grow incrementally up from lower leagues, whereas a club like Man City, gets a free pass because they took a shit club and poured money into it pre-FFP and then instituted rules that would insure no one else would ever do that again.

1)Walk/bike or get bus if you're lazy. Oxford is not that big you can easily walk it, recommend cycling though. No idea how late buses run, google it.

3)Iffley road gym is subsidised. Brookes have a climbing wall Oxford students can sign up to use somehow.

4)Loads of pubs, most close quite early (like midnight or earlier) but there's a special few who are open far later (e.g. the half moon). There are lots of cocktail bars and there are actually a good number of reasonable clubs, which of these you go to depends on what kind of clubbing you like really.

5)Primark.

6)Yes, they're everywhere and most places accept card.

Firstly, I would disagree with your ranking of PL keepers for one, I'd put Hart and Lloris at least above Szczesny, maybe even De Gea with (Lloris above Hart). In any international competitions that I remember Reina had been ahead of Valdes: WC 2006 and 2010, Euro 2008 and 2012. I don't know about qualifying, but those are more important.

To me Mignolet reminds me a lot of De Gea during his first season at United, but not improving as quickly. Who knows whether he'll push on or not, but I doubt a recovering Valdes will get much better. Maybe we'll keep him around for two years or so but we're going to need to have a good young keeper. I'd argue that Valdes is actually a worse shot stopper and no better at dealing with crosses. Valdes routinely makes relatively simple saves complicated and gives up entirely too many rebounds. Experience is definitely in his favour though, I'd expect him to mostly keep his cool in pressure situations, but as I don't think he speaks English I think he may have a hard time marshalling our defence, most importantly the center backs.

I want to reiterate that I think we should sign him, but the way people are acting it's like we're picking up one of the top 5 in the world, and I think that's not at all the case. I'd like to be wrong and Valdes proves to be a great keeper, but he makes at least one bonehead mistake every season and his general play to me isn't amazingly impressive.

I think how much 'homework' you get depends on the tutor, but I was told that you should generally spend 3 hours a week of your own time studying the language, a bit more if you're doing it for credit.

For me, personally, balancing this with just the workload of a degree was tricky, let alone a part time job on top. However I am naturally very poor at learning foreign languages and a lot of other people in my class seemed to excel just fine.

I cannot 100% confirm whether it shows up on your transcript but I wouldn't imagine failing or quitting will not be of any detriment. I would recommend having a good crack at it but not feeling obligated to see it through to the end if it becomes too much on top of everything else you have on. All this only really applies to if you're not taking it for credit btw.

It's a great opportunity and I would recommend it: it's free, the teaching is good and it's by no means the end of the world if you want to drop out or don't get a good mark (although I imagine you will, I passed and I can still barely ask where the nearest pub is in german).",0,1411009357,null,0,false,0,cklhkq0,t3_2gpafr,t1_cklhkq0,t3_2gpafr,null,1426949872,2,false,universityofyork,t5_2ss68,2

true,IUsedToBeZed22,newcr-5,"Columbus Crew SC, Everton, Sky Blue FC","I can't believe I'm encouraging someone to take a look at other teams, but if you're actively looking to fall in love with a team, maybe you should watch more Prem matches to solidify your choice? We have a saying that goes ""Evertonians are born, not manufactured. We are chosen, we do not choose."" You're certainly not the first person to be drawn to the club by Tim Howard or something similar, but I'm getting this weird ""rushing to get married"" vibe here.

That sounds *really* harsh, and I don't mean it to be. Honestly, by not wanting to just root for a team that will play Champions League soccer every year, you're already a better fan in my eyes than 90% of Americans who follow Premier League teams. But I'd definitely encourage you to watch as much Premier League (and MLS!) as you can. I don't know if you're in the Boston/New England area, but going to see your local side a few times a season is a really great way to help you ""ease into the sport.""

At any rate, I hope you end up with us, but don't pick your wife on the first day of high school (although some have with great success).

**ANYWAY** onto your questions:

1) it's really tough to say. As you alluded to, there isn't a whole lot of movement in the Prem. The rich clubs are always buying top talent and pulling superstar squads together, and until Bill Kenwright finds the buried treasure of 47 pirates, I wouldn't expect us to consistently do much better than 5-8th place. We have a good mix of seasoned talent and promising youngsters and a fantastic manager in Roberto Martinez. It's just a lot harder to go from 5th to 3rd than it is to go from 10th to 8th. 

2) Watch everything you can. The games are on Saturday mornings and early afternoons, so you won't have conflicts with the Patriots. Do you have NBC Sports Network? If you do, you have access to free full HD streams of every Premier League match that isn't already on TV. But if you really want a list of important matches, the two most emotionally charged matches for the Blues will always be against Liverpool. The Merseyside Derby is one of English soccer's best rivalries (even if the Redshite pretend they don't care about us), and those matches are always thrilling (but whatever you do, don't watch the second Derby from last season don't don't don't don't don't.

When you ""split"" the two centerbacks and push the defensive mid back to form a crude back three, the press in the final third has to be intense. From the Sunderland, QPR and West Ham matches (and even in flashes against Liverpool), we're showing a lot more urgency already, so the attack can only improve. 

I'm watching the Dortmund game against Arsenal and that's the way a proper press is done. Arsenal's defense just couldn't cope with the pace of Auba and Immobile, and though we don't really have any players in the same mold of those two, we can definitely learn from their unit pressing.

Such an outcome would also risk exposing Salmond as fallible, since so far he's been able to use the tremendous antipathy towards Westminster to play a sort of *""He says, She says""* game. This works by making outlandish claims, which are then rebutted by Westminster. But many Scots intensely distrust Westminster politicians, particularly English Tory's, and so choose to believe Salmond regardless. A supra-governmental organisation like the EU, which many Scots do respect, calling Salmond out on his bullshit would expose him as fallible.

&gt; But the default will have consequences as it looks like rUK will pick up the tab to prevent a panic and things spiraling out of control. Dumping billions of debt onto the rUK taxpayers is going to make for some very frosty negotiations on all the other issues, issues where Salmond and the SNP have been making fantastical claims too I might add.
&gt; 
&gt; The yes voters are deluding themselves if they think they, as just over five million, can dictate terms to 58 million people and win every negotiation to their advantage. Sure there will have to be some give and take, but they are all take and say they won't have to concede a single thing, this is delusional. These are the same people who were claiming stridently, at least up until a few months ago when the EU issued clear statements on the matter, that they would still be in the EU after independence. Even in the best scenario of ""a midnight treaty signing switchover"" they still have to technically leave the EU. But some were trying to deny that for so long calling it ""scaremongering"" as if Scotland would somehow inherit EU membership out of thin air.
&gt; 
&gt; EU partners have made it clear it's going to take something like two years, possibly five if the Spaniards drag their feet to discourage Catalonia. If they default on their debt then rUK is certainly going to respond to make it cost them elsewhere. And even if rUK leaves the EU, and isn't there to cause trouble for them, Spain will not like the idea of Catalonia defaulting too when they leave. Catalonia leaving would cause huge trouble for Spain as it is via the increase in their budget deficit. If Catalonia left and also defaulted then Spanish banks, and perhaps others, would need another bailout. Spain has every reason to veto a defaulting Scotland from joining the EU to send a clear message to Catalonia.
&gt; 
&gt; While all that discussion about possible consequences is of course hypothetical, it's very much within the realms of reality. They are not getting the pound and defaulting will bring serious consequences down on their head whatever form it takes, yet nobody in Scotland has properly discussed this.

It would not be a default, the debt is the UK's debt and the Treasury has already confirmed they will shoulder it all if need be. It will still be UK debt regardless, but there will be an agreement where Scotland will take responsibility for a portion of it. Scotland could very well say they're not going to make an agreement to take responsibility for any, it's just that's not at all fair because they have a responsibility to take on the liabilities with the assets.


However, the BoE is an asset, if the UK refuses to share that asset then I think it is entirely possible that Scotland could refuse to take responsibility for a **portion** of the debt that they otherwise would have, as a way to compensate themselves, why should they take on all of their share of the liabilities without their full share of the assets? Remember, it's not all or nothing, Scotland could agree to take responsibility for say 80% of what is calculated to be it's share if there is no currency union.

true,tree_bear,lfc99,,"Right at this exact moment we're finding out just how awesome that Remy signing would have been. I think people would feel better about playing the diamond, which is what I want us to play against West Ham, if we had some other options at striker. However, I still think that our style of play improves so much in the diamond that I would start Balo and either Lambert or Borini (idk make them fight for it).

I've heard that Balo and Lambert couldn't work because they both like to hold the ball up. In the diamond, Mario not only has the freedom to receive the ball wide left, wide right, and deep, but also we have Sterling in behind ready to zoom up the pitch. I don't mind theoretically having 2 target men because Sterling provides the creativity through the middle.

With the way our team presses, I think 2 holding midfielders is a bit silly. Gerrard's role dropping into the back 3 (on offense) technically makes the shape a 3-5-2/3-4-3 in attack with the split centerbacks and the fullbacks bombing on. You mentioned 3-5-2 in your original post and I think our fullbacks are so good at bombing on that we could keep it a back 4 and still technically play with wingbacks because our offensive shape has Gerrard as the de facto 3rd center back.

Speaking of Gerrard, he's been pretty magnificent in that Pirlo role. I don't see any particular reason to change it. The problem with a 2 man midfield is that Gerrard goes forward more because he sees the space in front of him. Problem is he usually leaves space behind him when he goes forward and if we give the ball away.... well Aston Villa happens. He's so used to being able to do whatever he wants and score amazing goals and singlehandedly win games that I think in a midfield two he loses a lot of discipline. It seems like he enters a different mindset when he plays deep in the midfield 3. The only way I push him forward is if we have one of Lucas/Allen/Can back there but then I think you sacrifice some pressing, especially if Gerrard is playing instead of Lallana.

For the West Ham game I would play a diamond with a little tweak: Lambert as center forward and Mario as a roaming sort of wide striker in the David Villa mould. Mario can run around the pitch and receive the ball in the areas he likes while Lambert holds up the ball for Sterling's runs through the center. When the fullbacks get forward we now have two big strikers in the box. Hendo covers the space wide right that Lambert doesn't occupy.

I think that's primarily because nobody, outside the newspapers running ""Spain will block you and force you to adopt the Euro"" stories, seriously expects Scotland to find itself outside the EU.

&gt; When I asked one of YES voter about it he replied that he simple doesn’t care about EU. Well, I do care and as someone who has European federalist political views I’m frighten that in 2016 March for the first time I can find myself living outside of European Union while still living in Scotland.

Given the promised Brexit referendum on the UK leaving the EU, it seems odd that someone with European federalist political views wouldn't be equally concerned about that.

Or, indeed, have that mentioned to him as part of the reasons to vote yes - the ""if you vote no we could find ourselves dragged out of the EU"" argument has been made repeatedly.

edit: I missed the obligatory Orwell reference to nationalism:

&gt; Same nationalism, that [George Orwell tried to warn us about](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat).

Where Orwell writes:

&gt;Scottish nationalists insist on the superiority of Lowland Scots

No they don't.

&gt;[Celtic nationalism] has a strong tinge of racialism. The Celt is supposed to be spiritually superior to the Saxon

Not they're not.

With that out of the way, if anyone of you saw Bayern play since Xabi has joined, you see how Xabi just falls into the defensive line while the younger hence faster legs push up. I would like to see something of the same sort happen here. Gerrard pushes the ball forward and then along with Manquillo, and Moreno maybe Sakho or Lovren move ahead while Gerrard falls back.
He has aged and his speed is not up to the level of the rest of the younger guys. But his leadership and experience is still needed in the team. And for that, I would still choose him.

Though I would love to have Skrtel back in the starting 11, i want the backline to gel up, and constantly changing it could prove to be detrimental. Hence atm, no change up there.

Anything that puts two strikers up front is my kind of formation. Idk why, but thats just how liverpool seems to work. and if sturridge is fit enough then HALLELUJAH!!!

A result in the 40's is very respectable for what is effectively quite a new independence movement at the tail end of an economic crisis.

The definition of an asset here is the key I think. Nobody is saying you can't have your share of the gold in the BoE vaults, what's left of the gold anyway. They are just saying they don't want you on the board of the BoE affecting its decisions, nor will the BoE be your lender of last resort. I can't see how that's unreasonable. You are setting up a new country, you should have your own central bank.    

You will tell us to sod off if we start wanting to regulate you to prevent a property or banking bubble, but you want us to be on the hook as the lender of last resort if something goes wrong? We can read, we know you are planning to use low tax rates and regulatory incentives to compete with us. Why the hell would we enter into a tails you win heads we lose arrangement? The delusions of the cybernats that we will agree to this is just ridiculous.  

You are of course able to default. All I have been pointing out is that rUK has no reason to see that as a friendly gesture. That's because it's not, it's a very hostile gesture to default.  

You are morally responsible for that debt. You can claim you aren't but I don't know on what basis. Legally responsible and morally responsible are two different things. Your share of the debt was spent in Scotland. It's your debt morally and there is no moral reason rUK should assume that debt. If you want to default and force us to cover that debt, we will respond and make you pay in other ways. I can't see how you think we are going to have billions of debt dumped on us and just lie there are take it. You are going to be facing an angry mob baying for you to be punished, and frankly I don't see why you shouldn't be if you default. If you don't default I want things to be as civil as possible but why are you expecting us to be civil if you dump debt on us just because you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up a central bank?  

I expect the rUK to pursue Scotland for the debt vigorously through all means. Including seizing your share of all the other assets that might have been given to you otherwise, gold and military assets as well as blocking you from joining the EU. Even seizing money from Scottish nationals that have money in the UK. If you are benefitting by 30k pounds per working person, then we should just take that from your citizens. Don't worry though, just like your default will be ""legal"" we will pass a law so that it's ""legal"" for us to seize all your assets. Doesn't sound so inviting now does it?  

Spain and the ECB will not want Catalonia or anyone else to think they can pull the same trick of leaving and defaulting and rejoining the EU either so they will likely block your EU entry anyway. But adding an rUK veto on top of all those other vetos will bring some degree of pleasure.   

This cybernat logic just boggles the mind. You are setting up a new country, that requires new institutions. Just make them. Why can't you just set up a Scottish pound and say you are going to peg it to Sterling, the markets will look favourably on that and I doubt it will cost you much more than the BoE to borrow money. Why the *hell* is that not the SNP policy? Not only do you not have a simple policy of having your own central bank, you are walking around like you can load up the rUK with billions of your debt and we will take it lying down. This delusional smugness of the cybernats has hardened my heart on this issue entirely, I want rUK to drive a really really hard bargain now.

They will accept the result and work on a smooth transition to independence. That is going to include currency union, an open border agreement and supporting Scotland in its EU membership. 

Ireland fought a bloody *war* to get independence but after it was done a currency union was maintained (for over fifty years) as were open borders (until this day). Irish citizens also retained full residence and voting rights in the UK (to this day, Irish citizens can vote in UK General elections, they can vote in this Scottish referendum for that matter if registered there). This was all despite a decidedly frosty relationship at times between the two governments; as recently as 1969 the Irish government had plans to invade the UK.

* In English, each clause must contain exactly one tensed verb. In clauses with one or more auxiliary verbs, the first auxiliary verb is the tensed verb.  
* *Thou* is the second person singular pronoun for the nominative case in the informal or familiar register.  
* *You* disagrees with *thou* in either plurality, formality, or both. The subject cannot be both singular and plural, nor can it be referred to formally and informally in the same breath.  
* When conjugating regular verbs for *thou*, the suffix attached is -(e)st and the irregular verb *shall* is conjugated to shalt. This would make the conjugation of ""to upvote"" *upvotest*.  
* The phrase in parenthesis is not technically wrong, but is very awkward as it involves nominalizing the verb phrase ""to vote yes to something"" when there is absolutely no reason to do so.  

Using commas to separate clauses can make your sentences easier to read. I'm not too sure about your choice of auxiliaries either, but changing them would change the meaning of the sentence and I can't be sure whether you mean what you have written or what I would expect you to have written.

You definitely don't know what you're talking about. Just a few days ago a veteran of the European Parliament and former bloc leader said right here on reddit in an IAma that of course Scotland would be in the EU. The EU certainly hasn't shot anyone down.


&gt;The definition of an asset here is the key I think.

Sterling is an asset, Scotland has disproportionally contributed to it's value even, I think many people don't realise just how ridiculously important North Sea oil has been at times to Sterling, especially during parts of the Thatcher years. 


&gt;You are morally responsible for that debt.

I agree, as does the Scottish Government. However, the UK is also morally responsible to fairly divide assets with Scotland.


&gt;Even seizing money from Scottish nationals that have money in the UK.

Again, you *definitely* don't know what you are talking about, ridiculous isn't even the word.


&gt;Spain and the ECB will not want Catalonia or anyone else to think they can pull the same trick of leaving and defaulting and rejoining the EU either so they will likely block your EU entry anyway.

Spain don't want Catalonia to leave, but the EU respects democratic decisions and not even Spain have been promising to veto Scotland, all they say is that Scotland will have to reapply but there are plenty of people who disagree.

Yes, she could have been.

They seem to - generally - look like Clara, so it's not just as if she somehow subconciously directs the actions of random other people just for long enough for them to save the Doctor's life - there seems to be some kind of genetic element going on there somewhere too, which must mean that it's a life-long influence (and then, what about her parents, and other ancestors...), so perhaps explaining a Gallifreyan Clara, where she only needs to have any influence on this particular regeneration, might be easier, but ulitmately the Claras pose just as much of an ""identity"" question, as anything that I pose in this rambling piece of head-canon.",0,1411029135,null,0,false,0,cklnexb,t3_2gnd8o,t1_cklnexb,t1_ckldf8j,null,1426947078,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

FFP says you can only spend a certain amount based on revenue. So, in order to spend more you need to have more coming in and a larger stadium is a big part of that. Wages, transfer fee sizes all increase because of the increased money coming in. This attracts more players, better players because the wages are quite low in comparison to the other top 5 or 6.

true,confluence,null,null,"I really liked all of Moffat's episodes during Davies' tenure, so I was really looking forward to his taking over of the show. When it actually happened, though, I was very disappointed. It feels as though he had a small number of good story ideas and has used them all up, and his seasons have mostly consisted of episodes in which past plot points are endlessly recycled, nothing much happens and all of the emotional arcs are completely unearned.

Moffat *tells* us that his characters are interesting and have profound emotional connections, and expects us to care, but he doesn't *show* any of that actually developing on the page. There were times during the past few seasons when I felt like the actual show was taking place off-screen and we were watching the outtakes: whenever an episode started with everyone walking out of the TARDIS and talking about their last off-screen adventure, I wished that we could see *that* adventure, instead of another hour of aimless running around and everyone crying over someone dying (spoiler: they weren't permanently dead -- *again*).

I also dislike the way that time travel and regeneration have become what the series is *about*, rather than a mechanism which allows the show to 1) set up and tell good stories that are set anywhere in space and time, and 2) change the main actor, which is why these plot elements were initially introduced. A lot of the time travel is, frankly, very silly and makes absolutely no sense, so shining a spotlight on it *all the time* does the show a disservice.

I think the most concerning thing for me about how we're trying to play going forward is Adebayor.  The high press system requires a high level of discipline from the striker, as he is generally the one who ""initiates"" the press.  As soon as he triggers a press by chasing down a ball/man, the rest of the team HAS to follow suit.

In a side with a really intelligent front man (like Diego Costa), it works brilliantly.  But Ade can be a total loose cannon, drifting around the pitch wherever he wants, and at times running like a madman when there's no real need or opportunity.

So even though he can be great when fit and firing, I don't think he's quite the player to lead our line if attempting to play a highly organised system.  Soldado, for his size, pace and form disadvantages, is a much more intelligent player, and is more likely to make the kind of runs and movements to get the best out of our attacking trident behind him.

true,ttamimi,blue,"""Farmer Hat"" Guy","Okay. Awesome. Let's look at this:

- The bachelors is awesome, but it's not vital. Most start ups and development agencies around the South West rely on portfolios? Have you got a solid portfolio? If not, start making one!

- You might have better luck if you orientate yourself towards a specific discipline rather than 'spreading yourself thin'. Have you considered focusing on web development, game development or system development for example?

- You should know that each area in the M4 corridor seems to specialise in something different: Bristol is where you'll find some very cool sys dev start ups. We have a few game development independent agencies and we have some web development going on. Bath is where you'll find the more snazzy up-street agencies with a solid focus on UI and UX. Cardiff is more eCommerce orientated and they have some world leading agencies for that. Gloucester and Wiltshire host system development companies as well as some very large names like Dyson where there's a lot of room for hardware-orientated work.

- In summary: You are unlikely to survive by focusing just on IT experience. Competition for that is far too fierce. You've got to specialise. 

- People to speak to: You've got to hook up with some recruitment agents. Some of them are nice and some of them are cunts, but they will get you employed one way or another. Have a look at Yolk recruitment &amp; Fishtank. You also need to write yourself a solid CV that you can submit to employers since a lot of web agencies and independent agencies prefer not to use recruitment services.

- The public sector and the private sector here are VERY different from one another. You should prepare yourself psychologically for which one you feel more suited for. In a nutshell, Public Sector have 'lower standards' in terms of time and pressure, but the salary is likely to also be lower in proportion. The private sector is much more intense and the wheels move much faster, but it's more financially rewarding. It will however eat your life up.

- You can also opt for freelancing, but you've got to be prepared for hunger, anguish and tears if things don't work out. 

- Some employers will have reservations against employing someone who will need permission to work in the UK. Do you have indefinite leave to remain? If not, you should consider it as a long term goal if you want to settle down in the UK.

The EU shot down the idea that you would be automatically in the EU. This debate ended MONTHS AGO. You simply don't automatically get back in. You HAVE to leave. Definitively. The president of the commission has said this. The president of the council has said this.  

Now all things being equal reapplying and getting in should be very easy, a formality even. However, all things *aren't* equal if you default. rUK and Spain could easily veto your application on the basis of a default. And if you default I think we should. The delusion of the cybernats thinking you can just drink at the bar and leave without paying your tab slurring that ""I'm settin' up me own pub"", no it doesn't work that way. The tab is still open and you will still owe money. Nothing you can do or say is going to make every rUK citizen pay thousands of pounds you owe without some **serious** consequences.  

&gt;Sterling is an asset  

No it isn't. A central bank and its currency are not seperable, they are an institution. Nor are they seperable from the taxpayers that ultimately stand behind them. You can have your share of the gold in the vaults of the central bank but you need your OWN central bank as an independent nation. That bank needs to issue it's OWN currency and to stand behind YOUR OWN economy. However, NONE of that absolves you from the debt you OWE.  
 
You have no guarantee of Spain's actions if you default, nor ours. You are not loading up everyone here south of the border with thousands of pounds of debt each without consequences. It's as simple as that. You are just deluded if you think you are going to dump debt on rUK citizens without consequences.

Scotland splitting away from the rest of us in the UK certainly gives them the opportunity to be run by a government they feel better represents them and their needs if they do it right/if they're lucky, but it seems (to me at least, and from what I've seen/read from Scots intending to vote No, many of them too) to be a pretty big IF, and comes with a list of huge questions/risks to be addressed (currency, economy, long term viability etc etc).

It certainly doesn't help fix the system for the rest of us.

It's clearly not at all an easy or clear decision to make - every indication leading up to today is that the result is likely to be incredibly close (most pre-polls have been pretty much 50/50), so is bound to be easier swayed by opinion and emotion.

When the doctor talks about evolution of predators and prey, I think it was interchangable between Daleks and Time Lords. However, the evolution of those hidden are the Silence. They're near perfect in the sense that there's almost no information on them, except for the bits that were revealed but I would guess that the Doctor, even now, cannot remember them.

At the end of the Time War, the clear winners were the Silence. Daleks and Time Lords were too busy fighting each other off, weakening each other which allowed the Silence to win in the end.

All the Time Lords would slip away into a pocket realm to hide from the Silence until they would feel confident and reveal themselves. Otherwise, it would be impossible to fight them. The Doctor would stay as bait. The Doctor agreed to this. 

Time Lords have a tendency to meddle in time and space and this disrupts the flow of the universe. The Doctor knew this but he could not convince the other Time Lords. He figured, if he was able to stay here and meddle by himself, it would lead to problems in time and space and the other Time Lords can sit back and witness it and learn.

This all occurred during the time of the ""War Doctor"". However, he knew that if he were to have this knowledge it would effect his decisions and it may reveal their plan. He put a restriction on himself, so that he could not access the information regarding the Great War and only knows that he caused the disappearance of the Time Lords and Daleks, and assumes he destroyed them; there would be no other logical reason. He is left feeling despair, confusion, as if he is unsure how or why he committed the act. However, he continues to live for a purpose even though it is not quite clear what purpose is left...

**Ferdinand**

We currently have a situation where Ferdinand is guaranteed a starting place. In fact, there has been speculation that the 3-5-2 experiment was designed to accommodate Ferdinand in the team. So far, he's done little to make a positive difference. So, I'd like to see him benched, with Onuoha starting in his place. This should be part of  adopting a new philosophy of meritocracy.

**3 at the back**

I think 3-5-2 offers us a chance to make up for the lack of goals in our front line. It allows us to use more of the midfield as an attacking force.

We should reconsider playing this formation at home. We'd need Onuoha as a centre back, with Hill and Caulker (or Ferdinand) alongside him, I'd recommend starting with Caulker. We have a choice of flying wing-backs.


None of this is a personal slight on Ferdinand or Caulker. Players take a while to settle into a team. The current approach puts too much pressure on these two new players, who should be eased into the squad.

**4 at the back**

Away from home we should adopt a  more traditional formation.  Hill is not suited as a left back.  Players like Traore are ideal, providing pace and defensive capabilities when needed.

If it goes exactly like the Quebec referendum, a no vote will be followed by Alex Salmond blaming [money and ethnic votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_and_ethnic_votes) and in the process commits political suicide. The SNP will claim that the criteria for rejecting ballots was too harsh and will pursue no voters to find incidences of electoral fraud.  The SNP will win the next Scottish parliament election but not try to force another referendum claiming that they are waiting for ""winning conditions"".  They will then lose in the following election.

On our side, we will do some token gesture, like requiring bills that affect Scotland to go through the Scottish parliament as well as the two houses. We will then actually work on putting into law a proper framework for allowing a nation to hold an independence referendum, though said law will include terms such as [""clear question"" and ""clear majority"" with ""clear"" being suspiciously left undefined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1995#The_Clarity_Act). The government would then start a long-term campaign to promote pro-UK views in Scotland, which Alex Salmond will claim is an attempt to buy control and will inevitably backfire giving more support to the independence crowd.

You want to have your cake and eat it. Either we get the financial assets with the debt, or you keep both.

This is your own politicians' doing.

Not to mention, the debt is legally the UK's, and they have agreed to honour all UK debt so Scotland isn't ""defaulting"" on anything. Its just not paying another country's debt.

1) It assumes the Doctor couldn't come up with such a speech on his own.  The Doctor has made many, similar speeches to those in trouble and afraid before.  Never have we had to assume someone told it to him as a child before.  We always attributed it to him, coming up with a way to comfort someone in need.  This could easily be the case here, and Clara could just be using those words to comfort another child (albeit a Galifrayian child) unrelated to the Doctor.  Yes, we can assume she thinks she is giving the Doctor's words back to him, but that doesn't make it the reality of the situation.  She (as we) has imperfect knowledge of the situation and can easily be mistaken after jumping to this conclusion.

2) It assumes the Doctor would have no way of hearing this speech later on if they weren't spoken to him directly from Clara.  We are shown that this boy runs from the other children and hides so they don't see him cry.  However, it is likely the other children still know why he runs away, perhaps some bullies even using it as an excuse to pick on him.  A speech like this could easily be the turning point in someone's life (as it was implied to be for Rupert), perhaps causing them to stop running (as often at least) and maybe stand up for themselves or fight back.  Someone who was friends with this person would note the change, and the person  would likely be eager to share their new secret with a close friend.  There is plenty of indication that the Master and the Doctor were at least contemporaries, perhaps even friendly before they looked into the time vortex.  It is not impossible to make the leap that the Doctor heard a similar speech on the 'power of fear' from another rogue Time Lord.  In fact, putting it that way, doesn't it sound like the speech a villain would monologue, explaining to everyone how they are better than them because they have learned to harness their fear into a superpower?

If the oil dreams come true, there might be as well a house price surge in Scotland, as everyone grows rich as a Norwegian.

Or - the ridiculous fixation on property prices is given up and prices stay on normal levels. The UK way to think that a house is worth what an agent's estimation says is ludicrous and needs fixing. It is worth what someone gives you for it. If you are not selling it is exactly one house.

Or - the independence weakens the pound so much that a lot of investment schemes and mortgage constructions become unstable. House prices might fall just because the economic ripples whipsawing these contracts/arrangements put a lot of houses on the market. The UK is anyway in for a massive crash at some point. Nobody under 25 can realistically afford to buy a house in the UK. Nowhere near realistically at all. And as I said, a house is worth what it exchanges for, not what the paper asking price is.

I don't see how, especially as the eurozone is moving *towards* political integration because they are having trouble with a currency union *without political integration*, that you can propose a political divorce and a continued currency union.

true,dragontiers,null,null,"While this is a possibility, I believe it is less likely for a number of reasons.  

1) As miasimia pointed out, this is not a new character trait for the Doctor.  Most of his incarnations have him talking to himself while solving an issue, even if he is not alone.  It helps drive the narrative (by letting the viewers see into the Doctor's thought process), and is a fairly common personality quirk.

2) As elavers points out, it would be a feel bad moment.  It is one thing to hide something for a big reveal later, another purposefully feed your viewers false information and make them feel lied to.  This would seem to cross that line.

3) I'm pretty sure, as elavers said, we saw the regeneration.  Additionally, this season's first episode involved the usual newly-regenerated antics, with the Doctor knowing certain things but scrambling them up (he knew who Clara and the posternost gang were, even though he occasionally mixed up the names). We have no reason to believe the Master would know all this information.

3)Additionally, the way the Doctor acts, especially in private, is very different than the way the Master acts.  He would be harsher, crueler, even if he had turned a leaf and was willing to be 'good'.  He lacks the empathy of the Doctor and would be more likely to use the most expedient method to help rather than the kinder way the Doctor generally chooses.  We are also given no indication the Master holds the same level of hatred for the Daleks as the Doctor does.  While he is probably not on good terms with them, the Doctor holds the Daleks to be the worst possible thing in the universe.  The Master would likely simply see them as a threat, but not hold the same level of hatred.  In Into the Dalek, we see the Dalek is inspired by the level of hatred the Doctor has for the Daleks.  This seems to point to it being the Doctor and not the Master.

Everything is not a circlejerk as much as you'd like it to be. 


Calling the team pathetic for 1 bad game after they've made you so proud with a great start to the season is being a shitty Arsenal supporter and exactly what is the definition of plastic. 


They can play half arsed preparing for City and get this result all over again by going back in time in this game which wont amount to much when the group stages end. They don't need to be called pathetic for it just because YOUR brain can't comprehend the fact that we are the only team who have not yet fucked up in the league and we should do everything possible to keep it that way especially against City. Youvreally think getting out of the group is a problem? If it was we'd have fielded the proper squad and not one to test a new formation.

Who gives a fuck to useless internet points and circlejerks. This behavior is plastic and embarrassing and these people can fuck right off supporting Bayern in fact, even they drop points so make your own club.

Spain doesn't even need to fish in Scotland, they do so because of some stupidity regarding EU quotas that must be used up that I don't remember the details of, if Scotland is not in the EU any longer then I would imagine they'd move on to other territory. They have plenty of sea for Spain to exploit, also, nobody is taking their jobs, so they have no reason to protest to the government.

The premise that a few hundred fishermen would cause the union to protest about this when 20% of the GDP (Catalonia) is at risk is ludicrous, the president has the support of the public opinion on this. Do you think Spain is like the US where unions are batshit insane?

Even if they had any reason to be worried (they dont't) or were insane (they aren't), they would have absolutely no way to exert any influence. Besides the unions, the industry doesn't really care, fish will be obtained elsewhere.

As for your second point, what EU nations would pressure Spain, and why would they do that? Spain's GDP is five times Scotland, it's a significant portion of the EU economy, why would any European nation exert economic pressure in Spain that could result in a weakening of the Euro?

You are doing some impressive mental gymnastics to arrive to the conclusion that Spain wouldn't dare vetoing Scotland. Most Spaniards outside of Catalonia support the president in this, like it or not, they want Scotland made into a cautionary tale.

By the way, the European Union really would like Spain to recognize Kosovo, they have been trying to make Spain not veto it for a decade, to not avail, and you don't see any kind of pressure other than strongly worded speeches.

After the third season came out, I remember reading that he considers Sherlock to be a show about the characters, not about the cases they're solving. So it wouldn't surprise me if he considers Doctor Who to be a show about a Time Lord and his companions, in which the adventures that they have in space and time are secondary to their interpersonal relationships.

When he does this kind of thing in Sherlock it doesn't bother me as much because 1) Sherlock has short seasons, so he's not dragging out the same relationship drama over ten episodes; 2) a lot of stuff *actually happens* in a Sherlock episode, even if it's only supposed to provide a backdrop for the characters; 3) Sherlock takes place in the modern day and has no supernatural elements, so Moffat is a lot more constrained by the laws of reality.

This is not to say that there haven't been some contrived and implausible plot twists in Sherlock, but at least he can't pull the kind of timey-wimey deus ex machina that has become par for the course in Who.

I don't mind stories about interpersonal relationships. A show which was all action and plot and no character development would be lifeless and dull. But there's a reason that I enjoy reading fanfiction and have no interest in mainstream romance novels: in order to care about interpersonal interactions and find them interesting, I have to care about the characters and find them interesting.

Sometimes I feel that Moffat is writing fanfiction for a canon that exists entirely inside his own head. He wants to write dramatic stories about established characters, but without actually having to establish the characters himself, because he finds that part boring.  The problem is that not everyone finds that part boring and wants to skip over it. I find that part crucial to my enjoyment of the kind of stories that he *is* writing, and I find the show deeply unsatisfying when it is missing.

I was watching the coverage of this case on Sky News this morning, and according to the police comissioner they interviewed, this particular arrest against Zalkalns was dropped because of a ""lack of evidence"" and the victim in that case couldn't ""prove"" any assault occurred. Now - and perhaps I'm being a little judgmental about how hard the police actually worked on this one, here - but doesn't that rationale for not investigating him further seem kind of, staggering? I mean, surely it's exactly the case in basically all indecent assault cases ever that most victims have no 'evidence' other than their word? (E.g., 'that 40-year-old man just grabbed my breasts/butt/penis through my clothes in the middle of the deserted street without my consent.') 

Often, there are no forensics, because that's the very nature of the crime! And what would be the point in having it even be a crime, if the police do just drop it in basically all such cases, because 'lol victim statements don't count as evidence, sorry.'? If we were to apply that standard to all arrests, for example, I can name you a lot of '70s ex-BBC stars who would be walking around free right now... because they were convicted on exactly the same kind of 'victim statement' evidence. No - if we needed rock-solid CCTV proof to take any indecent assault arrest further, arse-gropey Rolfie would be banged up on several fewer charges right now.

I just bet that some poor hapless plod in Ealing is going to be getting a tongue-lashing over not taking this particular case further tonight.

Source:

Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. (Galatians 5:19-21)

So, where are the drugs mentioned in this verse? Actually, the word translated ""sorcery"" is the Greek word pharmakeia, from which we get the English word ""pharmacy."" The primary meaning is ""the use or the administering of drugs"" (usually associated with sorcery or idolatry). Since this verse comes from a list of things that, if practiced, would preclude one from heaven, this should be a reasonably strong suggestion that the Christian should not practice drug use. In addition, the book of Revelation lists drug use as one of the things for which the unrepentant will suffer the wrath of God.

true,pectorisrobur,null,null,"Yes, but even a British citizen is barred from obtaining a visa to another country (like the US) if they have comitted such a crime. Why not such a policy here?  

Entering any sovereign nation, for people who were not born there, is a privilege and not a right. The rights and 'public interest' of the citizens of said nation trump any interest which a foreign criminal may have. How would we feel if we were, say, Spain, and several convicted British ex football hooligans wanted to travel to Alameda for a match? Wouldn't we say - sorry, but no? It may not be very nice for the British tourist who feels like they're being pre-emptively judged on their legal past - but Spain's interest trumps theirs. They do not want a new risk, however 'unlikely', to their citizens. And as a foreign state, they have the right to. 

Likewise, it may be in a convicted murderer's interest to move to the US, but it's not in the US goverernment's interest to import a foreign convicted murderer to the States. Again, their own nation's priorities trumps the convicted criminal's. As a nation, the interests of all their current citizens (including all their law-abiding immigrant citizens) and any potential risk to them, is measured against other factors. The potential gains the state can make from the convicted (possible special skills, possible money through taxes), is measured against the possible defecits (re-offending potential, possible harms to citizens, money spent on rehabilitating or otherwise legally convicting him in the case of re-offending), and they say: no thanks. The cons outweigh the pros. You might not like it, the murderer may not like it, but it is not up to you or me or them - it's their decision in their interest. And only the country can make that decision. Just like Scottish people wouldn't much appreciate us making the decision in their referendum, it's not up to anyone else to demand that their country's legal system or their British criminal's legal right to obtain that privilege trumps the other person's or the other nation's interest. It shouldn't be beyond countries to look at criminal history, to look at matters of public record, and say: actually, on the balance of probabilities, you can continue to live in your own country. We don't want to allow you to immigrate here. It's our country and our choice, and we choose to allow only immigrants who have not previously murdered or raped anyone. We're sorry. 

Not to mention, people with 'unspent' convictions are barred from jobs and holding public office even in Britain all the time. How many convicted murderers do we know who are invited to live in honoured residence, to become Lord Mayors or police officers? It might not be 'fair', but sometimes we really do say that people who have committed such an offense should not be allowed to hold certain positions or obtain certain privileges, out of respect to their victim's family and on the possibility that they re-offend. We require murderers and rapists to show a certain respect and make certain their amends to society, even if they have fulfilled the legal obligation of prison. And automatically immigrating to another country is a privilege granted or refused, not a right.

And it's not too 'Daily Mail' to insist that someone who's been convicted in a court of murder gets a reasonable sentence - yes, even if there were mitigating circumstances. If the circumstances had indeed been that mitigating, I'm sure that there were many other legal outcomes (manslaughter, aquittal on grounds of self-defense) that should be and probably were considered in such a case.

The ""I don't get it so nobody should get it"" argument is nonsense and smacks of jealousy.  We elected a government which promised to keep education free, and it has done so.  The rUK elected a government which tripled tuition fees, taking higher education even further out the reach of those of limited means.  

Scottish tuition fees are paid by the government out of the block grant, which is calculated based on population size.  The same money pays for free prescriptions, which many other people decry as ""handouts to the Scottish"".  It's simply a matter of how our government decides to spend money.  The Treasury receives more in tax receipts per head from Scotland than it pays out per head via the block grant.  So there is no net loss to the rUK for these ""subsidies"".

In town it depends on your budget! Take a walk down Seel street for some options, anywhere down on the Albert docks will be expensive but their the most popular options for tourist. For the best place to go after the match you can't go wrong with Pogue Mahones on Seel street. As for Nightclubs it depends on your taste, I'd keep away from Concert square in town myself as it's not really my cup of tea as I'm more of a trendy bar/cocktail bar guy myself. Best shopping is down in Liverpool 1, it's pretty easy to find and quite central so it's easy to walk around, most of the big name shops are there. 

Nandos' is a fancy Portuguese chain restaurant in Liverpool One, great if you love chicken and hot sauce but not that much choice outside of that. There are qite a few good eats on Bold street, or if you fancy something more stylish then head out of the city a bit to Lark lane, a more bohemian suburban street with nice eateries and bring your own bistros (Moon and Pea (byo), Bistro Noir to name a few, but booking is recommended for these). 

Taxis in Liverpool are generally very cheap in comparison to the rest of the UK, but if you want to save a bit of money then call a private hire firm (Delta, Alpha and Phoenix) if you've got the time.

&gt;You have a misplaced faith in the post-soviet prison system.

I just love it how people compare automatically a whole region of Europe just because they are ""post-soviet"" rather than focusing on actual points and discussing them in details. To give you a quote from [http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/prison-rehabilitation](http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/prison-rehabilitation)

*Nonetheless, there has been much criticism about the level of rehabilitation that actually occurs in the UK's prisons, mainly due to a lack of funding for these programmes and prison overcrowding, which hampers effective delivery of many schemes.*

In fact, I bothered and looked at re-offending rates and guess what:

[Latvian](http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/space/files/2012/07/Latvian_Probation_Recidivism_Study_Summary.pdf) - *In terms of frequencies, those previously sentenced to jail committed a new offence in about 51% of cases during the measurement period, compared to about 26% rate among the conditional release group, 20% rates among the community work service group and about 16% with a suspended sentence.*

[British](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/reoffending-rate-increases-8475391.html) - *There was also a notable rise in the proportion of criminals handed prison sentences of less than 12 months who reoffend, which increased from 56.6 per cent to 57.8 per cent.*

Depending on interpretation they are even higher in UK or at least at similar levels so well done with your prejudice!

&gt;I'm against completely free movement anyway. We should have quality and quantity controls over who comes here.

That works both ways, meaning that if you don't have a proper skill, you wouldn't be able to move in Europe as easily as you can now, consequently blocking new possibilities of work for those Brits. On the other hand, UK welcomes all ""students"", which is often known as the ""free entry to the UK""... but that's another point.

&gt;Saying ""let this murderer come over or he might just sneak in and continue to be a criminal"" is blackmail. Let him change his lifestyle for the better in his home country and if he is found here lock him away for five years then deport him.

Theory meets reality. Wake up, we don't live in ideal world. There is a very good chance that criminals will get here in any case. I'm not making a point that UK should open borders to rehabilitate but the point that closing those borders will not necessarily limit numbers of offences and suddenly resolve the problem.",0,1411047238,null,0,false,0,cklr812,t3_2gqxk4,t1_cklr812,t1_cklprsq,null,1426945246,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Other places to eat... Il Forno I think is the name, ive heard good things about. 

Regarding nightclubs, there is a street with maaaany nightclubs, just ask the cab driver. I think those places are a bit too crowdy, and the people trying to get you to choose their club is really annoying. But there is some more low key, youll find it ;) There is a stripclub called ""Dreamers"" or something. Ive been to 3-4 diffrent stripclubs in Liverpool but thats my favourite. 

Would also encourage you to travel to melwood, and get some pics and look at the players when they leave. I love that.

Also on match day, travel 3+ hours ahead of kickoff if you wanna get a seat at one of the bars in the area!

It's also within walking distance of the main hotels so, as you said you're in town, you should be okay. If it's more bars you're into, head to Matthew Street and Cavern walks which is much more relaxed and casual with a focus on Irish pubs a lot of the way round. I have to recommend Cava though, for it's £1 tequila shots.

Food wise, there is all sorts as has been mentioned. I would particularly recommend a Chinese restaurant up near the Bombed out church (ask a local, it's a war memento).

As I said in my original post, obviously the UK wouldn't self-sabotage just to spite Scotland. I think I explained pretty clearly that the UK will look after itself. Where interests align with Scotland, that will be fine. But for where they directly oppose each other, I don't think yes voters have fully appreciated the repercussions.

Again - I guess the main question is this; if you feel so badly done to by Westminster, why would you expect them to treat you favourably or better after slapping them in the face? Right now, most English don't want Scotland to go, and I reckon most of us think the UK government have done a terrible job with the ""no"" campaign. Most English people like Scotland too. But if there's a yes vote, public support will absolutely back the rUK government to negotiate against Scotland.

true,TwelveBore,cnty-england,England,"I could be wrong but here is my gut feeling about independence. 

Scotland has a strong identity. As a result of this, it will always feel a degree of resentfulness about having a government imposed upon them from outside of Scotland where they are outnumbered. This spreads into every aspect of ""Britishness"". They know that British institutions are run largely by English people with a few Scots/Welsh. They know they are the junior partner in this relationship.

It probably has very little to do with disliking the English, there's just a really strong feeling that Scotland is its own nation and should run its own affairs, which in the long-run could lead to greater opportunities for Scots and a feeling that they hold a greater stake in the future of their country.

Many seem to be apprehensive about stating this and want to search for reasons to justify independence. However, I think it's a perfectly reasonable argument to become an independent nation. It's a country that, let's be honest, is forced into acting like a region of another country and is being discontented with this.

It would be nice and convenient if we were all able to see ourselves as British and felt that to be our main identity and were completely at ease with this. It's obvious that this is not the case with a growing number of Scots and with the fall of empire people will inevitably ask themselves why they are remaining in such a union.

Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have looked like three foreigners going on a fucking safari trip these last few weeks. In the event of a potential break-up of the UK, the British Prime minister has had to refuse to debate Salmond because he knows he is not liked. That is a pathetic position for a leader to be in.

Had the euro crisis not happened, would this even be a close vote? Can anyone honestly see the UK moving forward happily together if this is a no vote, without another referendum being triggered 10/15 years down the line? Rather than feeling empowered to fight for their political beliefs, are people in Scotland going to feel bitter and betrayed every time a policy or decision they haven't voted for comes to fruition? Many of us feel disillusioned by the Westminster elite, but that feeling must be amplified tenfold on the other side of the border. 

I have come to sympathise with independence because one of the main arguments for ""no"" has been that if all goes according to plan, the UK *could* get a Labour government in 2015. This means the English might vote Labour.

If you can set up multiple mini accounts, maybe start building an emergency fund with £500 straight off if possible, and then the 10% top up can go to just your rainy-day savings pot.

While ISA rates are godawful at the moment, it's still a taxfree wrapper (not that you'd be needing it on £800pcm though). Still, it's worth building it up this tax year.

Check Martin's Money Tips for good rate ISAs. I would personally **not recommend** putting it in **(A)** anything below a 2% if you can help it, you'd be better off just keeping it in my option below, or **(B)** stashing in a long term ISA that doesn't pay well. Likelihood is that interest rates will rise within the next few years, and you don't want to feel like a chump when it's far higher than your fixed rate.

Otherwise, if you don't fancy that (or better still, in addition to that), buy some premium bonds. You don't get any interest on these, but it's safely tucked away money that you often forget about until you win some money, it' a bit like a mini lottery, every so often you might win £25 or £50 for example. Go to the post office and fill in a form for free.

Furthermore, I'd perhaps suggest getting a credit card and swapping it for your credit card if you havn't already, start building up a credit history, BUT ONLY USE IT AS YOU WOULD CASH/DEBIT CARD. Don't go trigger happy, and make sure you set your current account to pay it off IN FULL every month. You don't want to get into the rhythm of having debts.

My other main problem with this, which I said to the other guy who replied to that comment, is that there is NO clear public mandate on this either way.

But I don't remember doing much work on it to be honest, aside from the odd essay (I did EEM) and also the project work in the 3rd and 4th years. All my tute sheets were done on old fashioned pen and paper, as were my notes.

Certainly you don't *have* to do any of your CAD and stuff on your own laptop. There are loads of department PCs and resources you can use. On the other hand, you may enjoy playing around with Solidworks/Autodesk/Matlab in your own time and it's nice to be able to save and access your stuff on your own laptop without having to go into a library or computer room.

As for Desktop vs PC, I'm biased towards PCs :) and obviously you get more bang for your buck in terms of power. But unless you play games, you don't need something so powerful to do CAD and Matlab. Even fairly cheap laptops can pack a fair bit of power these days, so as long as you have a decent modern one (RAM is particularly important for Matlab and those kinds of analysis software), you should be fine, and you obviously get the portability benefit.

If you do want to build a PC, I'd definitely recommend going MicroATX or smaller. You'll love the ease with which you can move it around when you switch accommodation/go home for the holidays.

Enclaving consists of allocating to one State territorial rights to waters which exist entirely within the waters of another State. It is most likely to occur when a small island is located adjacent to the coast of a larger State located on a continent. By definition, enclaving can only result when the enclaved State receives less marine territory than the adjacent State (such as a narrower EEZ).

The world will see it as justifiably retrieving expenses.

It's absolutely astounding that you think Scotland should be granted anything it demands and the world will support everything it asks for and vilify the UK if they don't give in to all of it.

First off, please don't bother with Nando's. It's basically a franchise like KFC or Macdonalds that pretends to be up market when it really isn't. The chicken is dry and it's just not worth it.

I'd recommend [Meat](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetsteakhouse.co.uk%2F&amp;ei=K-oaVITUF8WL8QGJ3YFY&amp;usg=AFQjCNESyiRqTrdMnfoHFy9Jebld7VCIGw&amp;sig2=zqdRkGVzp5gpiOrkEsszZQ&amp;bvm=bv.75097201,d.b2U)  which is an Argentinian steak house, reasonable price wise and delicious.

There's an Italian called [San Carlo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sancarlo.co.uk%2Fliverpool&amp;source=maps&amp;ei=zeoaVIPlO-KV8gGalYGYBQ&amp;cd=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvpW_anHXnIoowMYrot0LmzvrZwg&amp;sig2=mcrFjVTgy6xnUthcoWJFcg&amp;ved=0CBAQ8xooCjAA) which is really nice and has a really good atmosphere.

Finally [Chilli Pot](http://www.chillipotliverpool.co.uk/) is an asian joint. Great food and again very reasonable.

All that said Liverpool has amazing restaurants all over the city and you couldn't go far wrong just walking around for a while and picking a place that looks nice. Just not Nando's or a Wetherspoons. 

For clubs and pubs it all depends on your preference. I like the bars around Chinatown. Matthew street is more for Stag and Hen parties and can be a little Chavish and the Concert Square is great for Students.

For the match itself the best advice I can give is if you don't want to get caught with the walk back to town (45-50 mins) there are buses that will bring you back for £2. They fill up fast so you need to be quick. 

Leaving the stadium by the Walton Breck road (road nearest The Kop entrances) take a right and head straight past The Albert. You should see them straight away on the left hand side of the road.

Hope this helps and don't forget to enjoy yourself, Liverpool is one of the best cities in England to visit.

EDIT: Oh and try and visit The Cavern bar on Matthew Street if you like the Beatles. It's where they start off.

A quick rundown of the nightclubs in town; 

---Concert Square--- 

SOHO - In my opinion is the best place to have a drink if you're starting early the beer garden is lovely and it has a great cocktail menu. 

MODO - Decent joint next door to SOHO not as busy but has £2.50 mixers. 

Level - New super club with a capacity of 2.6k and 3 floors playing different music. Its pay in but worth it. 

Tiki Joes - Have you pulled yet? No? Okay then go mop up the floor in here till 6am. 

Black Rabbit - Awesome joint plays a lot of RnB and has the best shots ive had in the city, try the RiP shot. 

Djangos - Dark and grungy, plays Drum and Bass and a lot of underground music. 

Envi - meeh 

Others: 

Chameleon 
BarBaa 
Reflex 
Popworld 
KrazyHouse
Camel Club
RubySky 
Paradiso 
Brooklyn Mixer 
Igloo
Republic 
and more. 

---Mathew Street---

I don't really venture here that often so take what I say with a grain of salt.

The Grapes - Cool pub with a community feeling. 

The Cavern Club - Expensive drinks but awesome live music and a must if you're a beatles fan.

---Victoria Street---

Now this is called gay town so if you don't like gays obviously don't venture here at night but in my opinion its the funnest place for a night out. 

Garlands - When you club do you like your drugs, drinking, extremely loud music, dancing, sweat, ketholes and sheer awesomeness? I couldn't recommend here enough. Open on Thursdays (More student orientated) and Saturdays (tad gayer). Drink water and be safe. 

Gbar 
Pink
BaaBaa Victoria Street 
Heaven - Avoid if you don't want to be scarred for life.

* Call alcohol a ""drug"". 

* A drunk person is ""wiped out"" or ""high on ethanol"" 

* An alcoholic is a ""junkie"".

   


People notice when you do that. They really do. And before you can change people's opinions you need to show them that they are no different. Them enjoying an occasional pint of beer is pretty much the same as someone enjoying the occasional spliff or pill.

  


Also... the amount of lives ruined by the state for cannabis is ridiculous. (nearly 8 people per day)

* 4,825 total drug seizures

* 4,250 cannabis seizures ( **88%** )

* 2,867 people arrested




The cost of policing is also ridiculous. How many police officers does it take to arrest 8 people per day. The officers, the testing staff, all the other staff too.  It's no wonder that violent crime is on the rise while the only sector were the police are ""catching more criminals"" is drugs. A complete waste of resources. Police should be dealing with violent crime.

Yeah, it's been established that Gallifreyans colonized nearby planets. We had a whole story on the nearby planet of Karn where the Doctor said something about growing up in the neighborhood. It makes more sense for it to be a one of these colonies. The Daleks were in their final assault on Gallifrey so conveniently the whole fleet was together. It wouldn't make much sense for him to steal a WMD and then risk getting blown up by a Dalek saucer before actually using it. The surface of Gallifrey is supposed to be hellish at this point, not just a big empty clear skied desert and he wanted the chance to actually use the moment.

He didn't expect to survive because The Moment was expected to blow out a large chunk of the universe to save the rest.

With Listen, I took the implication to be that the Doctor spent time on one of the colonies as a kid... possibly in a children's home which would further the Danny comparison they are setting up and makes sense with the references to ""the other children""

Heck, it even explains why there was nobody around the barn because they were probably evacuated back to Gallifrey when the Daleks came close or the Daleks blew them up which explains the lack of housing. 

As for why the barn itself is slightly different, maybe they couldn't book the same location for filming or couldn't reconstruct the set.

The result was the Parliament Act 1911, which removed from the House of Lords the power to veto a Bill, except one to extend the lifetime of a Parliament. Instead, the Lords could delay a Bill by up to two years. The Act also reduced the maximum lifespan of a Parliament from seven years to five years.

In short the Lords can delay bills from the Commons but it can not stop them, we are have fully democratic system even without electing the second house. In fact while I don't agree with peerages I think electing a second house in much the same way we'd elect the Commons would be a total waste of time because the whole point of the Lords at this point is to dampen reactionary law making that can result from people who have a vested interest in being reelected.

1) The far right bombers tend to operate alone.

2) There are fewer of them than Islamist bombers.

Because the Scottish referendum is supported by largely left-leaning individuals - hence the battle cry of ""we don't like tories"" - the narrative of the referendum has become about support for a country looking to free itself from the yolk of a right-wing tyranny it doesn't want. The reality (like the previous two PMs being Scottish and 3 parliaments being Labour controlled) doesn't match up to the rhetoric at all but this is not important in politics.   

In the case of the EU referendum, the promoting party is the Conservative party. It doesn't matter that there are left-wing anti-EU proponents or that there are right-wing pro-EU proponents, it only matters that the Tories are seen to be in charge of the EU debate. This has made the idea a right-wing one.   

Inherently, your question is based upon a perception that is being driven by a clear narrative in the media. At the risk of having a tinfoil hat, it is basically how the key players want you to see things. The SNP want the debate in scotland to be about ""democracy"" and ""anti-tory"" (despite the fact that this flies in the face of certain realities) because it will mobilise the voters that they are targeting.

The EU debate is similar - by framing it as a right wing issue the pro-EU lobby has been able to characterise the anti-EU movement as a bunch of right wing nutters. Again, despite the fact that the proportion of nutters is probably the same in both camps (UKIP have just put the nutters front and centre but whatever - if there was a left wing equivalent I suspect they would be equally crazy).

He stood for election and polled the most votes. It's only a town council but it should be inspirational nevertheless.

Seriously, if people feel so strongly about the political process in the country then stand for election. There will be no change unless people like *you* get involved and drive the change. 

If this referendum does nothing else I hope that the number of people inspired to vote makes ordinary people realise that they can make a difference and get involved in local, regional and one day, national politics.

Err on the side of caution. For many countries in the world that means simply not allowing anyone in who has such a conviction. 

&gt;If you look below you will see links showing that re-offending rates in both countries are pretty similar and if something are lower in Latvia.

That is completely irrelevant. Just because the AVERAGE, criminal has the same, or an even lower chance of re-offending, does not mean we should treat all criminal as if they have the same chance of re-offending. What I said was that a judge should look at each case and treat it on its merits. 

It is possible to commit a murder, serve your time, and then no longer be a threat to the public, such as crimes of passion. However, it is also possible to murder someone, serve your time, and still be a threat. Those are the sorts of people who we should be able to identify and keep out of our country. 

&gt;It's a Norway's rehabilitation system which seems reasonable (one of the lowest rates in Europe). And guess what, they base it actually on more freedoms for convicted people

Again, that's great, until you let in one murderer who clearly would be a danger to the public, and who could have been stopped with just a quick look over the case file.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; I'd also like to add Freemasonry is NOT a secret society

Can confirm. I am one. And at 28 years of age, I (along with my best friend who's 31) am *by far* the youngest one not only in our lodge but in every lodge I know in ours and all the surrounding counties. I think only a few lodges in London even have a handful of people under the age of about 45.

Our lodge is pretty much exclusively over the age of 70. Most of them see it as a way to get out of the house and away from their wives for a few hours a week to eat and drink with other guys. That's it. No secrets - I tell people I'm a mason all the time. Hell, we're so broke we even sold our lodge and now we have to meet in a hotel *in public*. Anyone can wander into the vast majority of what goes on, and the hotel staff always do.

If OP is really concerned about corruption in the planning department, submit a FoI request to find out the universities that each employee attended. That is far and away one of the biggest causes of corruption. ""Hey, you also went to Oxford? In *Magdalen College*? Me too! Welcome aboard.""

Also, I'm a planner by training (but not practice) and member of the RTPI. Any application that requires planning permission (i.e., that's not general permitted development, like small extensions to a house) require approval by the elected councillors. The planners will write a recommendation for refusal or approval based purely on policy - very little is subjective, with a handful of notable exceptions. Any of the 'corruption' in planning will be on the end of the councillors, not the planners, due to the nature of the system. If you believe the grounds for refusal are not in accordance with policy, you may appeal to a court and, if you win, will be awarded all costs. There's a healthy appeals process to planning in the UK; far healthier in other countries I've worked in. Furthermore, if things get really sticky, the Planning Inspectorate will send a guy up from London, and if he finds the slightest hint of wrongdoing, they will nail your bollocks to the wall. Put quite simply: *it is never in the interests of planners to play politics*. That is what the councillors do. Any written evidence that shows that you've either intentionally or inadvertently made your recommendations without taking key factors into your condition will be evidence in favour of someone else at appeal, such as your letter of recommendation to the councillors. For example, one of the problems that often happens is that a councillor will make a political promise during an election and then try to lean on the planning department to make it a reality. One possible consequence of this is that the planners might prioritise the application over others for the sake of expediency, but *they do not have the final say*, and as I said, the planning system is all about documentation. Every last little piece of your decision must be explained, in full with no errors or omissions, to the councillors. They then use that information to make a decision, and will often cite those letters as evidence when giving the decision to the applicant. Any errors or omissions will certainly arise during an appeal, and if it can be shown that the council acted against the planning department's recommendations, it is them who will be held to the fire, not the planners. This is also why there tends to be a fair amount of tension and mistrust between planners and councillors - councillors see them as people who ruin their ambitions, and planners see councillors as morons who don't know a single thing about how the system works. They're both right.

When it comes to the background of that, Freemasonry wouldn't even register on the radar of anyone in the area. The only place I can see it being *potentially* beneficial would be the hiring process, and because planners are nonpartisan, I can't see how it would really matter. Then consider that most Freemasons I know are well past the age of retirement, and I can't see how it would ever affect anything at all.",0,1411054374,null,0,false,0,ckluhhm,t3_2gqmup,t1_ckluhhm,t1_cklo0dx,null,1426943723,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

An ISA is an Independent Savings Allowance, not to be confused with an Independent Science Assessment. It is basically the government's allowance for a certain amount of savings to be tax free in a given financial year. It's cumulative, which means while the limit for putting money in one this year is about £15k, you can put another £15k in next year provided you don't move your money out of the current one. There are stocks and shares ISAs (a gamble, but may pay higher or lower returns), or cash ISAs (safe but steady low returns). Personally, I'm not a risk taker when it comes to money (why risk what you've got if you're not too badly off, and probably couldn't afford to lose those savings?), but it's an entirely personal decision.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;For many countries in the world that means simply not allowing anyone in who has such a conviction.

So coming from a point of view that if you made wrong in the past, you should pay for it until the end of your days? Meaning, you are already lost as the society won't give you another chance of normal life, so you have no other choice but to get back into crime....

&gt;That is completely irrelevant. Just because the AVERAGE, criminal has the same, or an even lower chance of re-offending, does not mean we should treat all criminal as if they have the same chance of re-offending. What I said was that a judge should look at each case and treat it on its merits.

You mentioned ""by British standards"" as in implying that Latvian standards allow murderers to walk free, hence my response and indication towards the rates which are pretty similar, meaning systems are alike.

Your further comment gives more light and it makes a bit of sense but then again, it touches other points. For example, are those ""judge reviews"" going to be objective? How long would they take? How in practice would that work? How many people travel between UK and Europe, without a need for a visa? You would have to issue visa to everybody and check everybody on merits of their possible convictions. Don't get me wrong though, even one life saves is worth the hassle but then again, we cannot even tell for sure whether that conviction wouldn't have happened if the screening process was in place.

As a side comment, is UK doing such checks with those who require visa to get to this country? I sincerely doubt as I got here on a visa initially as well and it was a pretty quick border check, rather than full analysis of your status and previous possible convictions.

&gt;Again, that's great, until you let in one murderer who clearly would be a danger to the public, and who could have been stopped with just a quick look over the case file

At the same time Britain may have exported one murderer to other country. That makes things equal. Rather than focusing on foreigners are bad because they potentially are convicts who potentially may re-offend, we should work globally on what to do to reduce crimes in general.",0,1411055099,null,0,false,0,ckluuuw,t3_2gqxk4,t1_ckluuuw,t1_ckluey6,null,1426943550,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Having said that I am very much in favour of decentralising power from Westminister, which to me seems incredibly anachronistic. I completely understand why people have lost all respect for politicians. 

As for HS2...surely that's a good thing, no?

**EDIT:**

I live in London but grew up in York, ever since I've lived here (8 yrs) I've been able to get up to York in 2 hrs on the EastCoast train service (if it hasn't changed hands again since?).

One of the main criticisms of President Hollande has been that he is far too right wing. 

Germany also has introduced swinging austerity measures such as higher taxes.

All of these nations of course have shameful welfare states but Britain's is by far the worst. We have been consistantly slashing our welfare state since Thatcher and now spend a mere 23% of our GDP on welfare.

From Wiki:
&gt;Their actions cause Davros to challenge the Doctor's reliance on his companions. The companions, however, are transported to the Vault before they can execute their plans, whereupon Davros gloats over his seeming victory and makes the Doctor reflect over the deaths he has caused and the sheer number of people who have died for him. Davros then summarises the Doctor as ""the man who keeps running, never looking back because he dare not... out of shame!"" and says, ""This is my final victory Doctor; I have shown you... yourself.""

We take responsibility over our own criminals, and most people would have no problem with a British criminal not being allowed into another country because of their criminal record.

You can take any amount *out* of the ISA that you like. The limit counts towards what you put *in*.

&gt; The best cash isas are a good 0.7% lower than the net from the 123, hence my decision to go out of it. 

As I mentioned in my previous post, I know the current ISAs aren't as competitive as they once were, but 0.7% isn't a huge gain considering the likely downside that it'll take 2 years subscriptions to make it back up again (entire first, partial second). Perhaps in 2 years time you'd want to use that subscription to add *new* money rather than re-adding money you withdrew? 

If history is anything to go by, then good ISA deals will likely come along in the future.

Perhaps you can reconsider, unless you've already done it?

Also, if you want to take more risk, you can switch to a stocks &amp; shares ISA (directly from your cash ISA), and this will allow you to trade without incurring capital gains tax in addition to capped dividend tax rate.

Especially as you are essentially agreeing with my comment above. I'm saying that the idea of shetland breaking away from scotland is an equivalent kind of idea as English regions breaking away from England.

I acknowledge that scotland has been a distinct country for a few hundred years, and I'm basically saying that's where the line should be.

England has never been a homogenous Country itself. It was a loose confederation of ever-changing sovereignties in Anglo-Saxon times, and even more so as Viking powers took control of various areas, importing their people and languages. The range of accents in England is rooted in this fact.

The Norman conquest of England didn't really include Scotland (but did include Ireland incidentally), and this is largely why they are distinct.

The S&amp;P500 has returned an average of 10.4% since 1970 (so equivalent returns to putting the money in an account with a constant 10.4%/year return). The average return each year is about 13% but you can't average things quite like that.

Of course there are other important elements of rehabilitation and these vary, even between prisons in the same country! I was providing evidence that the outcome is still similar between those two countries, meaning Britain is not better than Latvia, with sorting out their convicts.

Not fully either. It's often a case a review of penal system is sought, even reintroduction of death penalty (guess which party advocates for such). On the other hand, as UK may possibly import criminals, it at the same time exports them, making the risk for average Brit to remain or roughly same level - one murderer less, one murderer extra=0 balance. If you stop importing, you will also stop exporting.

However, you won't introduce an easy system of screening if convicts aren't  coming to this country. I bet that such system doesn't even exist when getting a British visa!

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;So coming from a point of view that if you made wrong in the past, you should pay for it until the end of your days? Meaning, you are already lost as the society won't give you another chance of normal life, so you have no other choice but to get back into crime....

Once you have served your time you are let back into your own country, but why should any other country in the world risk letting you into theirs? How do they know you are reformed? 

&gt;For example, are those ""judge reviews"" going to be objective? How long would they take? How in practice would that work? How many people travel between UK and Europe, without a need for a visa? You would have to issue visa to everybody and check everybody on merits of their possible convictions.

I agree it would be a very difficult, time consuming and expensive system to implement. Which is why simply not letting in any serious offenders might be a preferable system. How much time and resources should we be spending to help foreign criminals get into this country? 

&gt;As a side comment, is UK doing such checks with those who require visa to get to this country? I sincerely doubt as I got here on a visa initially as well and it was a pretty quick border check, rather than full analysis of your status and previous possible convictions.

Part of the visa application process is submitting any crimes that you have been convicted of. You can be refused entry if you served 12 or more moths in prison. 

&gt;At the same time Britain may have exported one murderer to other country. That makes things equal. Rather than focusing on foreigners are bad because they potentially are convicts who potentially may re-offend, we should work globally on what to do to reduce crimes in general.

It does not make things equal at all. Britain has a responsibility to protect its citizens from criminals. If it thinks someone might be a threat it should have the right to stop them at the boarder. In the same way, if a foreign country lets a British criminal in, and he commits a murder that could have been prevented, it is the fault of that countries government, and they should be held responsible. Britain already stops people from coming in on a visa if they have a serious conviction, the same should apply for EU residence.

 That's completely true, we got a lot for him (which we haven't spent very well considering Suarez would got there anyways with or without Torres' transfer), but I am still divided about him.

 I understand he wanted to go away to play CL and compete for titles, but that could've been done so much cooler if he went anywhere but Chelsea (my personal most hated club) or Man Utd.

 If he went like Alonso to Spain, Italy, France, Germany or wherever no one would really hold that big grudge for him.

 Also, Torres' transfer and slow LFC downfall combined with Croatia not qualifying for WC at that time, really turned off my interest from football for about year and a half in which period I barely watched ANY football.

- No more discrimination towards the rest of the UK on their university fees and other things. Essentially they only get away with it because of a legal loophole -- they're forced to offer certain benefits to all citizens of the EU, but the rest of the UK doesn't apply because it's their own country technically.

- No more retarded Barnett formula giving them more money per head than anyone else.

- No more Scots meddling in English matters by voting despite the fact that we can't vote in theirs. Oh how funny it'd be if we could vote in this independence vote; it would be no more unfair or frustrating than them voting in our matters (the Scots were the deciding vote in several dreadful votes, such as the trebling of university fees in England.

I don't care how much of a world beater you are, but that strategy has no place in professional level. Let alone LFC level.

If a pyramid scheme is not selling or investing anything you are just shifting money around, so clearly for every winner there is a loser etc and the higher the winner the more losers.

Pyramid schemes are gambling, provided they are open about how the schemes work and don't mislead people by actively lying and making false claims, i have no sympathy for the victims.

They are more than happy to take other peoples money as payout yet cry buckets and claim victim status when they are the others paying out.

&gt;The PM faces a bruising showdown with his own backbenchers after promising to retain the formula, which was established in the 1970s and awards Scotland £1,623 a head more in Scotland than in England. The pledge to keep the formula appeared in a joint statement by Cameron, Clegg and Miliband in the Daily Record.

&gt;Polling of MP by Dods, the political information service, found 63 per cent think the formula should be changed - including 83 per cent of Tories, 41 per cent of Labour and 78 per cent of Lib Dems.

The formula is gash anyway. Do away with it and add some more tax raising powers. Start off by allowing the Scottish government to raise income tax by 10% each way as per Scotland Act 2012, but allow them to vary the tax bands not just uniformly apply an increase/decrease across all bands.

I was looking for a team that had these criteria:

a) Was not a front-running big-spending favorite. I did not want to be a fair-weather fan or a front runner.

b) I did not want to pick a team that had a significant risk of relegation in the next 5-10 years. I looked for teams with a long history in the top league.

c) I wanted to choose a team in a city that would be nice to visit as an outsider when I finally get around to travelling to a home game, or was close to other tourist locations.


In the end, my choices were between Everton and the Spurs. After watching some games, there was just something different about Everton that I can't quite put my finger on. I have never regretted my choice.

Any other system would have meant the costly creation and enforcement of a separate electoral register - and it avoided using complex rules on who is, or isn't Scottish. Although the system they used is far from perfect, it's probably better than any alternative. Right now there are people who consider themselves Scottish who don't live in Scotland and can't vote. If they'd used more complex rules you'd probably have all sorts of bizarre situations were Americans born in Scotland who lived there till age 3 on a military base were able to vote, whilst a 60 year old man with thousand year old Scottish heritage who had been born in say Hong Kong and emigrated to Australia last year couldn't vote.

I agree 100%. But that is what is being attempted with the ""yes"" camp from some quarters, including official BT members like Jim Murphy who has been suggesting that there is an official campaign of intimidation. Police Scotland have issued two statements asking the press not to deliberately stir things up. 

&gt; I mean seriously are you're really going to argue that 'No' voters are violent maniacs?

Absolutely not but they do seem to have a lot more of them. Groups like the Orange Order, BNP, EDL and SDL have ""backed"" the union and Better Together etc want nothing to do with them. These groups have long associations with violence hence the problem. There really aren't any groups like that on the ""yes"" side, maybe a few Irish Nationalists from Belfast but I've not heard anything from them besides the occasional mural picture. 

As long as people seek to conflate random egg throwers as ""official supporters"" then I'll spin that around to shine a light on how invalid it is.

SNP has been more about removing themselves from the Eton educated school boys that run Westminster, whereas UKIP's motives seem to be increasingly to be about 'controlling the borders' and immigration. One motive lends itself better to a left wing narrative, the other to a right wing narrative.

If the UK leaves the EU then we're losing one of the primary forces for multi-lateral cooperation. The EU has much more effect on the day-to-day lives of British citizens than the UN or NATO. Isolationist politics aren't inherently left or right wing, but they are especially unpopular with the parties on the left of UK politics.

Scottish independence, however, is being sold with the very important ""we want to stay in the EU"" argument. That turns it from ""we want to sit on our own and not play with the other kids"" into being explicitly in favour of international co-operation. It turns it into wanting to be considered an equal not just of England but of France and Spain.

Think of it like going to a house party with your significant other. If you're always the one sitting on the other's lap you'll get fed up and eventually start demanding your own chair. The EU referendum is the equivalent of refusing to go to the party at all.

&gt;
&gt; ...

&gt;Those who choose to make a service declaration and register as service voters are able to register for up to five years at a fixed address in Scotland even if they are based outside of Scotland or think that they may be posted outside of Scotland in the next year.

I'll give you the currency issue, but the EU is hardly Salmond's fault. We could have a definitive answer on where Scotland would stand with regards to EU entry post-independence if *our representative* to the EU would ask for a definitive answer. Alex Salmond is not our representative though. Alistair Carmichael is, and neither he nor his predecessor, Michael Moore, will ask the EU for a definitive answer because that would be ""pre-negotiation"" which is a complete abomination unless it happens to be on the topic of currency. 

The other thing about the EU is that if the UK elects the tories again next year, we'll be having a referendum on that, so there's absolutely no guarantee that even a no vote would keep us in the EU.

Not really, no. 

The UK's EEZ (our maritime boundary) is already subdivided into areas covered by Scots, English, or NI law by the [Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundary Order 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Adjacent_Waters_Boundaries_Order_1999). The area covered by Scots law is the shaded portion in [this image](http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/mk4f0b0425.jpg) (you can see the same image at the end of the bill itself).

Putting aside the fact that there's no substantial demand for Shetland to separate from Scotland (beyond the local Lib Dem, Tavish Scott, ""[mischief making](http://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2012/03/19/the-isles-and-the-referendum-some-observations)"" according to the Shetland Times) if Shetland were to separate it would essentially be an enclave within the existing Scottish boundary.

As an enclave, like the Isle of Man, they would be entitled to a small perimeter around the coast. They wouldn't receive a huge chunk of what would become Scotland's EEZ.

If the argument is that they wouldn't remain with the UK, and would strike out on their own as a totally separate country to both, then with a population of 20K they would be something like the [4th smallest microstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate) in the world.

The origin of this question is Tavish Scott trying to needle Alex Salmond, and the Telegraph picking up that story and running with it ad nauseum. There's no popular support for independence from either Scotland or the UK on any of the three islands (""Shetland"" has become some kind of mythic anti-Salmond totem for the Telegraph, for some reason they always forget about Orkney or the Western Isles).",0,1411062506,null,0,false,0,cklyvxw,t3_2gqrkd,t1_cklyvxw,t1_cklqv6m,null,1426941649,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

One, yes, the Time Lock and the pocket universe both happened.  It gets confusing, but those are separate things completely.  The time lock separated the entirety of the Time War from the rest of reality, whereas the pocket universe was created inside the time lock, and simply plucked Gallifrey out of the universe, as opposed to the Doctor destroying it via the Moment.  I know, I know, it's complicated.

Two, from their perspective, the Time Lords gave him a second set of regenerations because he was about to die.  He's their only chance of freeing them, and he was willing to die without speaking his name, which would have ensured they stayed lost.  So from a practical standpoint, giving in to what Clara was demanding and giving him a new regeneration cycle actually serves their needs.  Now that he is living longer, he still has a chance to free them.

Three, I was thinking about the cracks, and unless I missed something, it's just never been addressed again yet.  He leaves Trenzalore without looking at that crack again, and then regenerates, and then hits the ground running, essentially, as Twelve--and so far, they haven't been back to Trenzalore or revisited that issue.

No, I think that's quite an important distinction.

There are a lot of people who absolutely are Scottish (so answer yes for ""Who is Scottish"") but who don't get the vote. Their main complaint about not getting the vote is ""but I'm Scottish!"".

This vote is about who makes up society in Scotland, not who was born in Scotland or spent their formative years here.

Once there is Scottish citizenship, which you can take with you when you move, then future referendums would be much easier as the criteria would be one of citizenship rather than simply residency.

We don't have citizenship, we can't feasibly use nationality, so residency is simply the least unfair choice.

&gt; I said the same thing.

We did ultimately say the same thing in intent, but I think it's just worth bearing in mind that ""this is so unfair, *I'm* Scottish and I don't even get a vote"" is a very common complaint amongst Scots who've moved away.",0,1411063127,null,0,false,0,cklz8gr,t3_2grt03,t1_cklz8gr,t1_cklz1xd,null,1426941487,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Dardanator,null,null,"&gt;and we the people have no power to force the Westminster goverment to make things better, as has been proven over the years

I disagree with this - we have the power, we've just never used it. Voters in this country have consistently been apathetic and pessimistic about politics, adopting a tribal stance on politics whereby people have blind loyalty or hatred toward the conservatives or labour, either of which ensures neither will give a shit about them. Westminster is painted as being outdated and resistant to change, but we've probably seen more political reform in our generation than any other. Devolution was introduced in Great Britain for the first time in its 300 year history, though there were some campaigns for this in Scotland, it was also offered to Wales and parts of England despite there being little public appetite for it. We've seen cities being offered electoral reform and new options for local governance. Westminster offered us AV, far from perfect but an improvement over the voting system we've used for centuries, and it was us who rejected it. We've even seen the house of lords and the centuries-old rules of succession for the monarchy undergo changes to modernise how things work.

It is very clear to me that recent british governments have wanted to reform things and decentralise power, it is in their own interest as well to hand down power to a regional level, right now the government has far too much to do and it would be able to govern more effectively if it had fewer things to focus on. The problem isn't westminster, it's us, the voters, we've adopted a rotten attitude toward politics, a belief that it's not our job to care about it and we're unhappy because none of the politicians do what we want - because people all want different things! What happened to political action in this country? People hardly protest any more yet we know very well it worked in the past. All parties know that devolution must be extended to England, but what can they do when most English people are instantly against the idea, thinking ""MORE politicians? No thanks!"" and even those who do want devolution can't agree whether it should be on a regional or England level?

My hope in this referendum is for a no vote, but one that is close enough that it gives people a kick up the bum and brings about some major changes in this country. There is one reason why I'm optimistic about seeing change, and it is the rejuvenation of political interest that we have witnessed in Scotland. People all over Scotland are caring about politics now, discussing and debating with others. We're anticipating a historic turnout in this referendum. People are happy because they realise that they can make an impact on politics and that their votes do matter, and people are going out in droves to the polling stations. I don't agree with the yes campaign but I admire them especially for the level of energy and enthusiasm they've shown and how much they've managed to drum up interest in politics and get a lot of people to change their minds. I can see exactly why they're happy about thinking they have the chance to shape the future of their country, but I disagree with them on one key thing: a yes vote for independence won't deliver them that chance because they already have it.

If Scotland goes independent and all that enthusiasm and engagement in politics stops, people revert to just voting once every five years and leaving it to the politicians to run the country like we do now. If that happens, Scotland will not improve at all. The level of political engagement we're seeing from people across the board in Scotland is fantastic, and that is what we should be seeing in politics all the time. It doesn't matter if there is a yes or no vote, because it is only by engaging with politics, discussing issues and ultimately letting those in government know what the country wants that people can build a better society.

My hope is that the people of Scotland vote no, but their newly awakened enthusiasm for politics continues and serves as an example to the rest of us. If it spreads to the rest of the country and people start giving a damn about politics and working to achieve the change they want, we will see some fantastic change.",0,1411063796,null,0,false,0,cklzlwy,t3_2gql7d,t1_cklzlwy,t1_cklrkbj,null,1426941313,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

 I had a presentation for my physics lab today. As I got up there and loaded the Powerpoint slide, my heart started racing. Because... you know... nerves. Then I thought of the Doctor's take on fear, and I ran through that scene in my head. 

“Let me tell you about scared. Your heart is beating so hard, I can feel it through your hands. There’s so much blood and oxygen pumping through your brain, it’s like rocket fuel. Right now, you could run faster and you could fight harder you could jump higher than ever in your life. And you’re so alert it’s like you can slow down time. What’s wrong with scared? Scared is a superpower!”

It honestly helped calm down my nerves and let me continue on without hesitation.

In my experience one of the biggest forces for encouraging extremism in the UK are Islamic groups which target young people at schools and universities. They are often invited by the Islamic society to speak, and it is though these events that they get into the minds of young British Muslims. I've personally seen it happen to good friends who were third generation Muslims.

This is just one example, but it shows that there are many forces at play outside of it just being a 1st generation problem, and to dismiss it as such could lead to big problems for society in the future.

* In 1884, the **German** Paul Gottlieb Nipkow created the first electromechnical TV system; it wasn't a practical system.

* In 1925, the **Scottish** John Logie Baird used improved technology and Nipkow's mechanism to create a mechanical system that could show a just-discernable human face.

* In 1926, the **Hungarian** Kálmán Tihanyi designed a fully-electronic, non-mechanical system.

* In 1926, the **Japanese** Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated the first *working* fully-electronic system.

* In 1927, the **Russian** Léon Theremin added interlacing to get the resolution up to 100 lines.

* In 1927, the **American** Philo Farnsworth made the first working system with electronic pickup and display devices.

* In 1928, the **American** WRGB became the first television station to be created; it lacked regular programming and was used internally by engineers.

* In 1931, the **German** Manfred von Ardenne gave the first demonstration of a system using a CRT for both transmission and reception.

* In 1936, the **British** BBC began transmitting the world's first regular, public, high-definition [not sure what the dividing line for ""high resolution"" is] television service from London.

true,kopking08,null,null,"I'll say first that everyone who thinks Coutinho is best suited to a traditional number 10 role have not watched the lad play in a Liverpool shirt. Coutinho isn't a genius around the box. If anything it's where he's the worst. He can't shoot (or hasn't shown it yet) and he has rarely shown he's able to execute the short incisive balls you need in and around the box.

That said, where he has proven himself excellent is in starting just deeper then where a traditional 10 plays and then coming deeper and finding pockets of space. I think you could probably create a square in the field to show where he is best and it tends to be from just a little towards our goal past the halfway line up to probably 35 yards from goal and then leaving maybe 10 yards to the sidelines on the left and right. 

In that area, Coutinho gets the space he needs to not only make a great pass but, because he has that passing ability, he also gets closed down such that his little bursts of pace and dribbling ability become exceptionally useful. He hasn't shown his qualities there this season, but if he belongs anywhere he belongs in that space. And I'd say that would mean us operating whatever the front 3 are doing, with a deep DM, Hendo, and then Coutinho.

As for Sterling, I think he's proven that he's most dangerous through the middle, which is only the case because at the moment his passing is more incisive then his crosses are accurate. What Sterling does best is find space with the ball at his feet and I think he's proven himself a surprisingly talented passer. 

The one thing I've found with Sterling from the start is that people assigned weaknesses to him that weren't there simply because traditionally those weaknesses exist in players with his size and style of play. Sterling has been strong from the start. He didn't get pushed off the ball like people liked to say he did and when he did (like everyone occasionally does) people used those rare instances to support their invalid contention. The other criticism has been his passing ability, which people just jumped onto because usually people who play the way he does lack that part of their game. 

Sterling can pass. He can't make as good of a pass as Coutinho, but the qualities in his game allow his passes to be just as if not more dangerous. 

Does that mean he should be the 10? Right now it looks like we operate best with a 4-1-2-1-2. It follows that Sterling should be that 1 in attack. ",0,1411064864,null,0,false,0,ckm070q,t3_2gs7ky,t1_ckm070q,t3_2gs7ky,null,1426940983,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

Start out with the UK official healthy eating and lifestyle - smoking/ alcohol units/ physical activity - guidelines, noting some are minimums others maximums, also noting portion sizes (surprisingly small for meat and processed stuff). The guidelines are NOT ideals so you should aim to *consistently meet or exceed* them: many countries advocate seven or nine servings of fruit and veg each day for example. Few Brits eat enough oily fish but this supplies skin friendly nutrients (long chain omega-3s, bioavailable vitamin D and many others).

If you want a commercial healthy eating book, 'The Smarter Science of Slim' by Jonathan Bailor (health professional) and 'Feed Your Face' by Jessica Wu (dermatologist) are decent. I have not read JB's second book 'Calorie Myth' but it's likely decent too. There are a ton of free podcasts on iTunes if you prefer listening to reading or don't have a decent library, and a website called 'Marmalade &amp; Mileposts' dedicated to SSoS recipes, various free NHS healthy living apps.

At the end of the day, David Cameron and Nick Clegg will directly be blamed for losing Scotland when (just years ago) Scotland leaving the UK would have been unthinkable. That could hopefully be enough for the coalition to fall apart, calling another election.

Nigel Farage - despite not really weighing in on the issue of Scottish Independence - has gained a surprising amount of support in the UK from attempting to appeal towards the British working class and promote his image as a typical British man who can relate to the people. If he plays his cards right, he could be the next prime minister.

While it's perceived that Labour may lose the ability to win elections in the UK, this could prove beneficial in the long run. Things would have to get much worse in the UK to sway voters to turn towards the left and vote Labour and I feel the economic and political effects of a Yes vote in rUK could lead to this depending on who wins in 2015.

The problem, I think, is that we don’t really understand the time war at all.  What was it?  What kind of war was it, how did it work, and what are its limits?  Why does no one else remember it besides the Doctor (and maybe a few others)?  Wouldn’t time lords from before the war began still exist in the past, and maybe even time travel?  How does the time lock work, and who did it?  So many questions!

Here’s my admittedly-incomplete theory about the time war and the time lock.  Buckle up, because it’s long and probably incomprehensible.

I think that history as we see it most of the time on the show (and all of the time in classic Who) is the “real” timeline.  In that timeline, every civilization (except Gallifrey) just rolls on unhindered, and is basically unaware that the war ever happened.  That’s important, because references to the war make it clear that most of the universe was involved, but no one ever shows any evidence of that—so how?

I think that sometime between Seven’s regeneration into Eight and the beginning of the episode “Rose”, the Daleks and the Time Lords went to war.  Conventional war, at first.  Then, it developed into a Time War.  What that means in this context is that both groups traveled back in time and fought each other.  This happened repeatedly, to the point that both sides tried to intercept and undo the other.  That led to a situation where events happened, then were negated so they never happened, over and over.  That resulted in countless alternate, contradictory timelines.  This went on until time itself began to break down, threatening to take the universe with it.  That is why you had things like (and pardon me if I quote this wrong) “The Could-have-been King and his army of Meanwhiles and Never-weres”.  That phrase, to me, indicates that history itself became uncertain.

To protect the universe from collapsing, someone (and I’m going to guess that the Doctor was involved, but we really don’t know) put the war in a time lock.  That means they separated all those alternate timelines from the real one.  As far as the real one is concerned, the war doesn’t exist—with one exception.  Gallifrey.  That is because the Doctor destroyed it.  When he used the Moment, it was so powerful that it destroyed Gallifrey in ALL timelines, including the real one.  That event also marks the endpoint of the Time War, and by extension, the endpoint of the time lock.  The Doctor goes on, the only time lord left (except the Master, who escaped to the end of time BEFORE the time lock was initiated).

Now, the pocket universe.  In The Day of the Doctor, the Moment doesn’t want to destroy everyone, so it brings Ten and Eleven into the time lock (note that Ten comments in the barn that they shouldn’t even be there).  Together with the War Doctor, they change history.  (The Moment is responsible for bringing all the other Doctors into the time lock—and presumably back out of it afterward—here, as well.)  They place Gallifrey in a pocket universe, and the war ends.  Now, from the perspective of the real timeline, nothing changed; the Daleks and Gallifrey are still gone, and the Doctor is still the only one left.  The paradox of changing his own timeline prevents him from remembering (until Eleven closes the loop, anyway).  Gallifrey exists, the war is over, but no one knows the planet still exists.

I know this still leaves questions, but I do have one slight piece of evidence (spoilers for “Listen” ahead).  [Spoiler](#s ""In ""Listen"", the Doctor and Clara visit the Doctor's childhood on Gallifrey, and have no indication of having to enter the time lock to do it.  That indicates that Gallifrey from BEFORE the war still exists.  Now, why we never see anyone travel from that time, I have no idea."")",0,1411066886,null,0,false,0,ckm1akv,t3_2gs3gh,t1_ckm1akv,t1_cklzf2b,null,1426939913,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I was getting my visa on the border, what application process are you talking about? Or was it for those visas which are sorted out abroad? Does UK actually checks convictions with other countries?

&gt;Britain already stops people from coming in on a visa if they have a serious conviction, the same should apply for EU residence.

Who says it should? What is the basis of such thinking? After all, that's the whole point of the EU, making things easier in Europe but that brings some possible negatives.... which are still the same as long as the balance is at zero.

&gt;Britain has a responsibility to protect its citizens from criminals. If it thinks someone might be a threat it should have the right to stop them at the boarder. In the same way

And the same applies in the country. Are you 100% safe just because it's Britain's responsibility? Of course not. There will always be risks and following your way of thought simply leads to divisions. Why would it be fine to stop someone at the border, because he served in prison, yet it's perfectly fine to let past convicts walk through streets if they are of the same country of origin? Ideally, I wouldn't like to see any of them on streets.... but that won't happen.

Making things harder, equals harder for yourself as again, checking everybody's convictions means you wouldn't be able to go this weekend to Paris, just because you wanted to do some shopping. You would have to wait for few months, until your file is checked as after all, you can potentially be an ex-convict, so a risk to French citizens.

I'm sorry but that kind of thinking is very narrow. Especially in the EU's solution, where as I've said, the case doesn't even exist as most probably ex-convict Brits migrated from the UK, so you have LESS risk from Brits. Does it really care if its a British making a crime, or a Portuguese? Or a person without a visa, or with visa? Or a person who got here illegally anyway?

We should focus on global reduction of crime, in cooperation with other countries and don't build borders which are simply not necessary.

In fact, the study tells you a completely opposite to what you propose:

[Immigration and crime](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/immigration-and-crime-evidence-uk-and-other-countries) 

*Estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in the asylum seeker share of the local population is associated with a 1.1% rise in property crime. Since asylum seekers accounted for only around 0.1% of the population, the macro effects were small. A one percentage point increase in the share of the population that was born in the A8 countries leads to 0.4% fall in property crime.*

Not only that but how many referendums should be held? Once every 5 years? Every 10, 20, 50? Ultimately if the threshold is only 50% it will ultimately pass, but the status quo should have far more protection than 50%. 50% thresholds are for regular elections, not history defining moments. Can the 'No' voters stage their own referendum to get back into the UK? Why not? At least don't change the terms; we only need 50%.

In the 2010 election 35% of Scots voted for the Conservatives and Lib Dems.  Admittedly less than the 42% who voted Labour, but still considerably more than the 20% who voted SNP.

The end of the conflict is obviously when Gallifrey was put into the pocket universe and the Daleks all shot themselves.


But that still doesn't explain how some Daleks like the Dalek Emperor and Caan and Sec managed to escape the end of the war. There's honestly far too much confusing stuff and inconsistencies.

The reason that situation exists in the first place is because it is illegal true enough and I think it should be legalised for many reasons. I also think things like mushrooms, LSD and Ecstacy should be legalised as the problem with ecstacy is because it is illegal you get all sorts of shit in tablets.

Other drug offences are worthy of police time, Heroin ruins people (I work with addicts and see it day in and day out) as do various other drugs.

As well as being a nightmare to administer (especially in the current case, because there's not a formal definition of Scottishness, as compared to being a UK citizen), you'll have expatriates running the risk of materially affecting the outcome of an election. Those guys don't pay taxes here. They don't work here. They don't live here. They're not subject to the political decisions of the leaders here. Unless they were exiled (which isn't really applicable to the Scottish case) they chose to leave. I see nothing fair about having them meddling with the lives of the people they left behind, or the people who came to take their place. You can't demand a vote somewhere just because you feel like you should belong there. No representation without taxation!

The only reason the current UK expatriate voting system is tolerable is because there likely aren't enough horrible UK expats living in Dubai or the South of Spain or wherever they are to make a difference in any given UK election. With the referendum, particularly one as contentious and close as this, the political consequences of having an expat vote decide the election could be appalling. Many people on the losing side of such an election would not be happy with the result, and I reckon with a referendum as divisive as this, a legitimately won, settled and seen-to-be-fair result is pretty important to a lot of people.",0,1411068042,null,0,false,0,ckm1xd2,t3_2grt03,t1_ckm1xd2,t1_ckm0zei,null,1426939618,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;Try new stuff. If it doesn't harm you, and it doesn't harm others, then yes, it's worth trying.

In addition to this piece of advice I'd like to add the following: don't try anything you don't want to do, or feel you are being pressured into. If you want to experiment with some recreational drugs or alcohol (if you didn't drink before uni), know the risks and precautions to take and do it in a safe environment that it doesn't harm you or others, then go for it. However, if you'd rather not, don't feel you have to just because other people think you do. If you want to stay teetotal at uni, that's your choice as well.

In a wider sense though trying new stuff at uni is a very good idea.

true,fasolia5,num2,,"I wrote this in the player rating post but it fits here as well. Yeah boring game etc etc but it was a good chance to look at things tactically. How Stambouli would stay behind to anchor and allow bentaleb to go forward. How width was there in the first half as Naughton was pushing up and stambouli covering the right back spot. Same going on with Davies and bentaleb covering him when he went forward. Triangles on the edge of the box to create overloads were there but Lennon and Townsend were not making anything out of it. Lennon was useless on the left (as always).   
Second half was much less tactically sound since naughts and Davies kept the back four in shape and didn't venture forward. This made for some pretty narrow play, specially with inverted wingers still being implemented at that point.  
I worry about how we are doing well in the opening stages of the game but tend to taper off as the game wears on. A common problem with new managers, it will just take time to hold tactics down.

true,Capsulets,null,null,"&gt;The experience of West Indians in the UK assimilating and becoming Black British in the current generation seems to bear out the conjecture including a period of radicalisation in the 70's and early 80's and then leading to assimilation from the late 80's onwards.

While you could draw a comparison between the two groups, I think it would be a fallacy to say that because one group went thorough that process, the other will. It's easy to compare them if you only look at the similarities and not the differences. 

As I've said, I think there are many factors contributing to the radicalisation of young Muslims, and it is a global problem, not just in the UK. Isolated communities, difficulty in giving up cultural differences, and Religious leaders who seem to be able to get the attention of young people and convince them of whatever they want are problems that we face today in a way that we have not been capable of dealing with. 

You might be right about it being a first generation problem, but I have yet to see enough evidence for this to convince me it is anything more than a hopeful guess. And if it does turn out to be wrong, we will all wish we had started to do something about it sooner. 

&gt;In order to assess what your experiences have to teach us about this situation I'd have to know more about them. If you have the time perhaps you could share in more detail.

Several of my friends at university went through a radiclisation process which I believe to be quite common. I'll try to describe it as best I can.

They all started out a relatively liberal, more agnostic than really religious, but from Muslim families. 

The process starts with members of the Islamic society on campus early in the year coming up to people, asking if they are Muslim, and inviting them to the Islamic society if they are. Even if they say they don't really follow the religion, they are invited under the understanding that it is really just a social club, for fun, and they don't have to be practising to join. 

After attending a few meetings, the practising members are able to become friends with the newer members, and convince them to start attending prayer meetings if they were not already. This is the start of the process of turning them back onto religion. 

The more senior members of the society, who almost always hold extremist views attempt to pass those views onto the rest of the group, which by now makes up essentially all the Muslims at the uni. They do this by attempting to be good friends with members, organising events and meals and such, while at the same time passing on their own ideology, often using emotive events to build anger and resentment. The Israeli Palestine conflict was a big one while I was at Uni. 

The biggest problem is that the senior members of the group have close ties with preachers and Imams who really should not be passing their ideology onto anyone. [These](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/throw-gays-mountain-imams-speak-london-conference031013)	 preachers [often](http://www.studentrights.org.uk/article/2063/khalid_yasin_banned_from_campus_by_university_of_east_london)	 encourage extremism, preaching it to the congregation at Friday prayers, and then meeting smaller groups of young men after, to discuss even more extreme Ideas.

Two of my friends were invited to these smaller meetings on several occasions, with different preachers. One, who I think was more easily lead astray, would come back and explain to me how our government was trying to suppress Muslims in this country and that they needed to fight back. 

Make no mistake, the passing on of extreme, anti western ideologies is entirely intentional and planned, by the preachers who visit the unis, and the senior members of the societies themselves, many of whom will have already graduated, and come back to work for the student union. 

Like I said, several of my friends went through this process with varying degrees of severity. Two became extremely radicalised, and I do not see them to this day. It is very upsetting to know what is going on and not be able to do anything about it. For instance, I know exactly what drove [this](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/transatlantic-jet-terrorist-brunel-university-6005119)	 man to do what he did. I know the groups and society's that he was a part of.

While I have see the effects first hand, the same process can be seen at university's [across](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8560409/Universities-The-breeding-grounds-of-terror.html)	 the country.

Don't leave anything even remotely valuable in communal areas like kitchens if you're in halls, no matter how much you trust the people you live with.

Don't sacrifice your food budget for trivial things, malnutrition can make you feel very shitty and will make you less able to learn. Get fresh produce from the local market, it'll be dirt cheap.

Get a good pair of walking shoes.

And because it does come up for some people (myself included) if you're seriously not happy with your course choice, realising you made a mistake is OK if you act on it earlier, either switch courses before you're too far behind, or leave the course before you're too much in debt and too burned out to get a good grade.

Canary Wharf for example was a highly successful government program to invest in the new economy. All of this investment was in London.

Take Edinburgh for example, it's now one of Europe's biggest financial centres (4th iirc) but it managed this without central government support. Had this program been more distributed the disparity today would be lesser. Other UK cities have developed their own financial centres, proving that the talent was there. One of the main reasons why they did this was because operating in London is quite expensive as people expect to be paid more. I could up my salary by 30-60% tomorrow if I was willing to move there. The banks and ancillary industries did this of their own choice rather than via government support. 

Ultimately the one unifying thing about the areas that got invested in is that they were all Tory strongholds and they were the government at the time. There's no issue in shitting on Yorkshire miners that never vote for you anyway. Which incidentally is one of my reasons for voting ""yes"" today as we'll have a PR government where this is far less of an issue.

I've just looked at the report, and the figure 1400 seems to refer to very specific kind of abuse (""The Inquiry applied the definition of child sexual exploitation which is used in Government guidance and is set out in Appendix 4, paragraph 48 of this report.""), over a 16 year period.

I don't know how many young women grew up in Rotherham over that time, but that sounds like it's about 1 in 1000 or something. Maybe 1 in 100, I don't know.

What do you think the national average figures are for rape or sexual assault?

I think rape and sexual assault are horrible crimes, but I also think that most people underestimate how common, prevalent and everyday they are. For 88 victims to experience a particular category of it each year, in a city of 250,000 people, does not sound like it would be abnormally high.

1) You say I am stretching the evidence.  I don't feel that I am.  Can you explain to me how I am stretching it?

What if every single living being has a companion, a silent passenger? A shadow. What if the prickle on the back of your neck is the breath of something close behind you?""  We see at the end of the episode she thinks that there isn't anything hidden, it is all just fear.  Therefore fear is a companion.

3) &gt;If it were another child, why show us that moment?
Because it nicely sets up the plot of having another Time Lord (maybe the Master, maybe someone else) show up.  What effect Clara's words will have is wide open, with a lot of possibilities.  The writers have done more with less.  Remember the scene with the Doctor missing his coat and then suddenly having it back when running from the Weeping Angels on the spaceship?

Three I moved to a few months ago. Much cheaper and the 3 coverage seems to be almost as good as EE in rural areas. 4G is included. It's much cheaper. In the really rural areas you will sometimes end up on 2G roaming which is useful probably. 
Plus if the signal is crap at home you can connect through your wifi (I think EE is about to introduce this)
