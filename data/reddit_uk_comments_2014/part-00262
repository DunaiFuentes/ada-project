true,liamdpt,EN,england,"Again remind me when on earth I said I wanted more defending? I haven't once said Ramires isn't right for us, I think he is. If by ""he can tackle"" you mean it takes him 3/4/5 attempts to tackle someone 90% of the time then fine. Although fouling someone is a major part of the way Mourinho sets up, you can't say he can defend because he can foul someone, that's just plain stupid. I also like how you throw in ""disrupt play"" and ""get the card when needed"" as two separate attributes like he's actually trying to get himself booked and isn't getting booked for disrupting play, they're the same thing. So all in all you manged to mention two of his attributes, one was wrong and the other just shows what a dirty player he is, not how good he is at defending(Me saying he's a dirty player in no way implies I don't want him at Chelsea or that he isn't good enough btw, before you try and put some more words in my mouth).

Just because I acknowledge players strengths and weaknesses and I'm not afraid to speak about a players weaknesses doesn't mean I do not like the player or think he isn't right for us. Like I've said Ramires is poor defensively but his work rate more than makes up for that and still allows him to cause problems for attackers. I also like how you say he definitely isn't known for his attack yet he played the most part of his best season for us on the wing.

Khedira isn't an amazing tackler but he's far better than Ramires, in fact, if you consider Ramires even a decent tackler there's no way Khedira is anything but an amazing tackler. With Khedira, he's a better tackler, better passer, much stronger, similar but probably slightly worse work rate, much slower but with him we would be solid. Ramires is very prone to making mistakes. Off the top of my head there's only 3 players that I think would suit us more than Ramires; Pogba, Khedira and Vidal.

This process has become a bit more stringent since the introduction of [new rules](http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/financial-services-products/mortgages/mortgage-market-review) back in April, but it hasn't *necessarily* made it harder to get a mortgage - it may actually make it easier for you if you are managing your expenditure sensibly. .

With regard to fees/etc - a lot of lenders will offer to pay your legal fees in certain cases, as long as you use the solicitor they nominate. In many cases it's also possible to add fees to the loan so that you don't have to pay them upfront - but if you do this make sure that you won't be charged interest on the fees.

I'd recommend trying to get as much of a deposit together as possible, as the LTV (loan-to-value, basically how much you want to borrow as a proportion of the value of the house) is one of the main factors in determining the interest rate you'll end up paying.

Given that you're a first-time buyer, you might want to have a read of some impartial advice from the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-a-mortgage-shop-around-or-get-advice), and look at websites like [this one](http://www.unbiased.co.uk/mortgage-adviser) which can help you to locate a local mortgage adviser.

Yes they were all male.  But that doesn't surprise me.  I suspect that men are inherently more predisposed to acts of violent aggression.  Doesn't mean that we can't do anything to limit male violence (we have already done much), but neither does it surprise me that these were all males.  

Males make up the majority in all armies and have done throughout history across every society.  Maybe it's a universal sexist conspiracy, or maybe there's a simpler reason - men and women have innate differences, with men being more likely to be violent.

BTW - I usually get downvoted for expressing this opinion.  Apparently it's OUTRAGEOUS to suggest there exist any cognitive differences between men and women, despite there being quite a bit of evidence that this is the case.

There's also big differences between gender and religion.  You can't choose your sex, but you can choose your religion.  I can't become a woman but I could easily become a Muslim.

Yes it's possible with one, yes it's easier with more. A mortgage broker will be required for this, they will give you the information you need on accounts.

&gt; Share to Buy / Help to Buy: Are either a good option? I'm incredibly keen to buy as central as I possibly can, in which case it seems Share to Buy might be only way forward. But is it a kind of shitty deal, in the long run?

Shared ownership and help to buy are very different things. Shared ownership is where you have part ownership of the property and pay rent on the other half. Shared ownership *can* be worthwhile but it has a lot of drawbacks and is not a good idea for a lot of people. Have you found any shared ownership properties in your desired location?

Help to Buy is a government scheme that gives people without a large enough deposit the help they need (either through mortgage guarantee or loan) to purchase. If you're earning £50,000 a year Help to Buy isn't going to enable you to buy a place that costs &gt;4x your income, but if you only had £10k in cash it would help you with a deposit for a £200k place.

You actually have a ton of rights under the sales of goods act. There is some great information here: http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act

The retailer (i.e. Jessops) is responsible. They often pass the buck and tell you to contact Sony etc, but as the seller it is THEIR problem. We pay high prices in this country, and these laws are one reason why - so hopefully people will be aware of them and use them more. 

An item you are sold must be ""fit for purpose"". Since the Sony A65 costs around £800 and is a mid-range semi-pro camera, it should be expected to last several years. Don't let anybody palm you off with any ""out of warranty"" bullshit. You can expect it to focus properly (since it is marketed as having good autofocus) and not to get random cracks through the body (since it is also marketed as durable and high performance).

You are also entitled to a repair, replacement or refund ""within a reasonable time but without causing significant inconvenience"". They've dicked you around for almost 3 months which doesn't seem very reasonable at all. But again, this is Jessops' problem, not Sony. Sony have messed you around, but Jessops are the retailer and you have your statutory rights to an item which works. 

By the way, if they DO give you the refund, I highly encourage you to walk out the store with it. Obviously, tell them to put the refund back onto the card you used to buy the camera, or in cash if you paid cash. **Do NOT accept any store credit**. A refund should be given back in the form it was paid (i.e. back on your card, or in cash). Don't take a refund and buy another camera from them, especially not one out of full retail packaging without a box - that sounds like a con.

And some other advice, as someone else into photography, I also used to shoot Sony but I ditched them for Nikon a few years ago. Why - because they had a nasty habit of being schizophrenic and not supporting their cameras. The a65 is a pretty good camera, but it's already discontinued and Sony are doing their new stuff already. It doesn't surprise me that they don't have spare parts for it, and they seemingly don't know how to repair it either. I went for Nikon (D800), but Nikon repair isn't great either and it has a pretty bad reputation. And the Nikon reputation has taken a battering with D800 focus problems, D600 shutter disintegration, the shitty Df and the ton of new models coming out. Personally I'd recommend Canon as the most reliable and most stable company. As the largest dSLR company (Sony is larger in total, but their camera division is tiny), they are generally accepted to have the best support too.

Final thing: You can contact Which magazine too (link above). Play the story of you being a teenager who bought an expensive camera and how upset you are. They can send threatening letters for you, and they carry a LOT of weight. They would easily get you a refund or a brand new camera.

It just happens to be that the Western backed fascist government which is now in control of Ukraine has been shelling it's own civilians. You think Russia would stand by and let that happen? It's one thing to call it invasion... Ukraine shares a relatively large border with Russia. It's funny how it's not called an invasion when the Western Establishment (including NATO) travels half way around the world to terrorize a local population, namely in afghanistan, iraq, and libya.  
  
But it doesn't matter because those people are brown and they are receiving Western democracy (or should i say terror), isn't that right? At least, that's what the media likes to portray. Oh silly me, why would it be an invasion, those people are brown! Of course, it must be a war!  
  
You only need to look at the NATO expansion into Russia over the past few decades. The reasons Ukraine had a neo-nazi coup pushed by the West is so they can continue to corner Russia by also making Ukraine a NATO member... which ironically has already been called for. The previous Ukrainian government had closer ties to Russia, and with that, NATO had no chance of controlling that region. Hence the political interference. 
  
The only aggressor is NATO and it's sock puppet states, such as the UK. If we were not an aggressor, we would not need trident, or pointless aircraft carriers.

theory perception video part:
get hold of practice dvd's, you need to know the style this is done in, this tripped me up.
bottom line: for every 'incident' in the video, click twice:
first click when you first see something bad going to happen
second when you see it actualy happening (maybe 1-2 seconds after first click)
maybe 3 clicks if you haven't clicked much, just make sure you get some sort of score on each incident

practical: real life practice, as much as you can (do not do lessons only) try and have a drive once a day, even if it's only for 20 mins around town or something

yes, this all costs money, accept it, it's worth it, even if you can't afford a car afterwards, just get the licence, the car comes later

also, you will suck at driving, more than you sucked at anything in your life, don't worry, this is normal, when you know you are sucking, also know that this is part of learning to do something you have never done before in your life, ever, the plain practice you put in counts later, give yourself at the very least 6 months to do all this, prob more like 12 though

Sure, some did but then again, people who didn't go to the cadets (it's seen as uncool by many kids) also join the forces.

For many, including myself, the cadets provides access to activities for those from the underprivileged. Thanks to the Cadets I was able to: fly solo in a microlight, glider; do aerobatics; rifle competitions; kayaking/canoeings; hiking in Brecons, Dartmoor &amp; the Lakes &amp; cross-country skiing in Germany. There was no way I would have done that without the cadets and for that I'm extremely grateful.

I was with Avanta for 14 months, for the final 3 months I was in that place 5 days a week to jobsearch. Literally, I'd go in for an hour and sit and use their shitty computers, do my jobsearch and leave without even muttering a word to anybody in the place for 3 months. 

Thankfully I'm now back at the jobcentre where it appears that I'm finally getting listened to. I have 5 years experience in payroll, it's a job I know I can do. The problem is that I don't hold any Sage qualifications (I used Epix and Oracle). After countless months of trying to save up money to pay for my own course (around £800), the sanctions started rolling in. 9 of them since January of this year. All of them overturned after weeks upon weeks of chasing them up with the sanctions department. Blew all of my savings and ended up in debt (of which I've only just paid everybody back this week). My advisor at the jobcentre is helping me set up a case to get help in funding for the course.

I'm now left with £20 in cash. The gas ran out this morning and there's £1.20 left on the electric meter. My next lot of money comes in 9 days, which is reserved for bills and rent. I have half a loaf of bread in and half a pack of bacon.

This leads to the major parties canvassing opinion from voters in swing seats and then taking that on board and amending their manifestos to attract those voters leading to a situation where the opinions of voters is more likely to be ignored/taken for granted if you live in a safe seat. 

IMO this is one of the biggest reasons for the independence referendum. The tories have little chance of winning seats in Scotland so put little effort in North of the border which has allowed Labour to rest on their laurels as they know people won't vote the tories in and only those overwhelmingly pro indy or disillusioned with Westminster will vote for a party which is guaranteed not to form government (i.e the SNP). This has led to Labour policy moving away from Scottish voters as they chase swing seats in middle England and is ultimately why they lost so badly at the last Holyrood elections. Holyrood has acted as balance to Westminster so any perceived loss in representation in Westminster has been regained in devolved areas. This has lead to devolved policies following a different trajectory in part thanks to the AMS system, which generally leads to greater accountability to the electorate and parties generally have to work harder to keep their seats compared to FPTP.

If Scotland does vote yes it surely has to be the death knell of FPTP as it will have played a significant role in breaking up the country (although even if there is a no vote it would still make sense to reform).",0,1410017927,null,0,false,0,ckassug,t3_2fn2po,t1_ckassug,t3_2fn2po,null,1427167895,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

So after chasing it up for weeks at the jobcentre, I eventually started sending e-mails out to my MP to take up my case. 

I got a phone call with an appointment date and time to head into my local MPs office and to take along all the paperwork I had. I was sanctioned because the work programme, avanta, kept sending my post to other addresses and in turn started sending other claimants post to myself and sanctioning me for it, whilst simultaneously ignoring the initial problems. I wish I was kidding when I say that I've had 9 sanctions since January, all for the same problem, all of which have been overturned. On getting to the MPs office he assigned his secretary to take on my case. She handed me the phone and listened in on the call. On eventually getting through to somebody, I asked if there was an update on my appeal and how long I can expect to wait for one. The woman on the other end of the line told me that there was no appeal in. Which was a load of shit, I'd put it in in person 5 weeks previously and had mounds of paperwork to back that up. But I was told that since it wasn't on the system, I'd have to go and put another appeal in and wait for a decision. I asked her how long I could expect to wait for the decision and she told me that they no longer have a time limit to get back to people, as there's that much of a backlog. 

The MP's assistant was horrified at the treatment they were handing out. She ended up having to get the MP to use his office email to fast track my case and it was sorted in less than 24 hours. 

There's been times this year where I've considered just getting locked up and at least then I wont have to worry about how I'm going to feed myself for the next week or worry about having a roof over my head (I've already lost a home this year due to sanctions that were the fault of my advisor).

A scalar means you're just looking at one thing, so the height of a person. This is scalar because there is nothing else to it, just the number (for example 180 cm).

Sometimes you might want to look at more than one thing though! Let's suppose you want to measure the speed a car is travelling at. But there's a problem, the car could be moving left, right, up or down. So we'll write down 2 numbers - one for it's left and right speed, and another for it's up and down speed (this'll usually be called **i** and **j**).

The if you cross something, it means you're taking the *cross product* of it. This basically means you want to know the average of two vectors - if you combined the speed of two cars you'd work out their combined speed with the cross product.

But while we're at it though, we're the bad guys because the Germans wanted to build as large a navy as us. Great. 

&gt; The public face of the war was based entirely on lies

It's almost as if we were the guarantor of Belgium and it's the fact that they invaded Belgium which brought us specifically into the war. 

&gt; The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war, the secret Ottoman–German Alliance having been signed in August 1914. It threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's communications with India via the Suez Canal.

It's so terrible of us to have invaded them after they declared war on us, we Brits sure are evil.

&gt; As the war was ongoing, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers being preoccupied with the war effort and had conducted large scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous Greek, Assyrian and Armenian Christian populations in the form of the Greek genocide, Assyrian Genocide and Armenian genocide. 

For a minute there, I forgot we were the Bad guys!

&gt; We must never forget our servicemen's sacrifice over a pack of lies, it's a national disgrace and our whitewashing of our history is abhorrent. 

I thought I'd leave you with some Orwell:

&gt; England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution.

I'll repeat my self in case anyone sane reads this:

&gt; It's a cool poster. It's about patriotism, national service and the whole idea of ""ask not what your country can do for you, but rather what you can do for your country"" type of sentiment, which I think we could all learn a bit more of as a society today.

And so part of the problem becomes clear. 

Find a job elsewhere, do your shopping somewhere less absurdly extortionate. You'd save bucketloads.

...Snark aside, they have a point. The rate at which private tuition fees are rising is extortionate- and there's not much that anybody bar those that set the school fees themselves can do about it. 

It's fine to make the observation that this is viewed as such a problem because State schools tend to be significantly worse than private schools, and the overwhelming majority of people don't even have the option of considering a private school- but the problem of rising fees is still a problem for a lot of people. 

...That said, fuck it. The point that *matters* is that the disparity between most state schools and private schools is so severe that this kind of nonsense manages to be an issue, somehow. People shouldn't feel like they have to drop £30,000 a year on fees to give their kids a ticket to a guaranteed ticket to a good education environment, and, equally, people shouldn't be able to buy such absurd advantage for their children while less fortunate kids don't have anything like that kind of opportunity.",0,1410022268,null,0,false,0,ckaultv,t3_2fmleh,t1_ckaultv,t3_2fmleh,null,1427166971,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3

This is not true, cross product, average speed and combined speed are totally distinct concepts. The cross product is a vector (arrow) perpendicular to both of the other two, and its length is a function of the lengths of the other two vectors and the angle between them. If they are parallel, the cross product has length 0, and if they are perpendicular then the cross product has the length as the product of the lengths of the other two. Other lengths follow a sine wave between these two values.

I should also point out that velocity is what we call the vector that indicates a change in position, and speed is the name given to the length of the velocity vector. I'm not sure if you're misusing the term or not, but I wanted to clarify.

I don't know what significance the cross product of two car velocities would give (I am curious about what you meant?), but it has its uses, for example in the study of magnetic fields.

I honestly think Indy would be good for BOTH countries. The UK is stuck in a rut, a rut of the same old parties, the same old system. Change happens at a glacial pace.

I think Scotland voting to leave is the kick up the arse that the UK needs to change it's medieval ways. I think a successful Independent Scotland, with a fairer society, more equal and just, will show that it IS possible, that it does NOT have to be a race to give all the money to those who don't need it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Anyway, back to the hypothetical question. What would stop a nuclear power taking the UK? 
  
A bank that is under control of the rothschild network.  
  
This is why Libya is a good example, and what NATO stands for. If you declare independence from the banking mafia (rothschild) then you are invaded, pillaged and demonized. Just as if you were to drop the dollar for trade. The dollar is the rothschild's token of trade. It's not coincidence that because Russia had questioned to drop the dollar involving oil trade, that they are now a ""threat"" to what is essentially a global monopoly. This was before the problem happen in Ukraine and the timing is of no coincidence. It's to pave way for an excuse to make Russia look bad. Essentially all it comes down to is simple propaganda.  
  
Libya was toppled and Qaddafi murdered simply because he wanted to be independent of the Western Establishment (what he called as the disease of extremist capitalism) and hoped to bring in the gold backed dinar as africa's token of trade. NATO simply murders and terrorizes in the name of corporate interests.  
  
You'll start seeing more demonization over the BRICS countries after the media has finished blasting Russia. Brazil, India, China will be next, because of that fact that they are planning to drop the dollar when trading in oil.  
  
In otherwords, if you have a rothschild controlled central bank, then you don't get invaded. You can deter that invasion from the West by having nuclear weapons... look to North Korea, but as a consequence they will destroy your country and it's people through sanctions. North Korea is the way it is today, because of one thing. The lack of a rothschild central bank.

I have had students end up with apprenticeships at stables, hairdressers and mechanics after work experience, when they hadn't considered it before. Many students find work experience boring and find it tedious having to dress smartly and be punctual, but that doesn't mean it was not worthwhile.

Obviously Pochettino was willing to sell Lennon without replacing him, which would have left us genuinely short at wing/AM.  Holtby probably wanted to go out on loan, so fair play to the club for accommodating him, but we really should have replaced him. We sold Sandro without any obvious need to do so, and if Capoue or Stambouli get injured or don't adjust well to the club/league or have a drop in form or whatever, we're going to really wish we still had the Beast.

It might not be too obvious but basically you start off with a back four, with Wisdom at RB and Gamboa ahead of him, in basically a 4-4-1-1.

If the main striker on the opposite team tries to play up against Pocognoli, the back line shifts across. Lescott helps him out and tries to assert himself against the striker. Wisdom shuffles across and essentially becomes a centre half. Gamboa slots in a right back.

When we have possession, Gamboa gets forward like a winger, Varela cuts in from the flank, which allows Pocognoli to overlap. Wisdom doesn't tend to get forward so it doesn't matter as much if Pocognoli over-commits going forward, plus Yacob will sit in front of the back four, allowing Gardner to get forward more.

Sess can drift out to the right to link with Gamboa, or get beyond Ideye.

Anyway, the answer to the question is he could keep his place and Gamboa could still play.

You could even play Baird in defensive mid and he could drop into central defence when needed.",0,1410024404,null,0,false,0,ckavjhq,t3_2fep4m,t1_ckavjhq,t3_2fep4m,null,1427165832,2,false,WBAfootball,t5_2tivu,2

All he's saying is that he wasnt going to screw Villareal over to come here (like Sevilla feel Fazio did).

...what? This is all speculation. Why would Levy be assuming he'd force his way out and then not increase his bid? We have valuations for players and we're not going to pay over that valuation. If Musacchio was rated at max 17M, which is what we supposedly bid, then why would we keep going up and up? 

Villareal supposedly wanted to come out with a the 17M just for them and the only way that would happen is if we increased our bid by a lot because Musacchio's other owners own something like 1/3 of his rights. We'd be paying at least 25M for Musacchio, when we could get Fazio for less than 1/3 of that.

MPs are elected by constituency (a geographical boundary, the whole country is divided into constituencies, one per member of The Commons).

So you'd think MPs represent issues relevant to the issues of that constituency right?

*Wrong*. MPs vote on party lines so what matters to your constituency doesn't matter.

**So I Should Vote For The Party That Represents My Issues?**

Again, *wrong*. You vote for the party most likely to get the majority of votes in your constituency that most closely represents your issues. Because the party you *want* to represent you may well have no hope at all of getting a majority in your constituency.

**So What If My Constituency Majority Votes For Another Party?**

Then your vote is *wasted*. Yes, *wasted*. It counts for *nothing*. Nada.

It doesn't matter if 33% of the entire country voted the same way you did. The fact that they didn't get a majority in any constituency means all votes cast for your chosen party *count for nothing*.

**Does Our Electoral System Lead To A Reduction In Representation?**

Compared to a *proportional voting system* that ignores constituency boundaries, absolutely. More than half the country came out to vote wasted their time and effort - because what they want is *completely ignored*.

It's not fair - but it won't change. Why not?

Because the system favours particular parties. Those parties gain power. And *don't want to lose power*. They will *never* bring in a system that denigrates their claim to power.

That depends on who you are - if you're a UK national who is living in the country, or someone with a qualifying visa or means of being here legally then you get it free at point of use.

If you're an EU citizen almost everything gets charged back to your country (some things that the country won't pay for get charged to the patient but this is very rare).

If you're not a UK or EU national, and you don't have a visa or aren't supposed to be here, you get charged on a cost-only basis. The NHS, like lots of medicare and/or medicaid hospitals in the USA (not sure if it's medicare or medicaid), employs a number of lawyers to check into the background of paying patients to see if they can afford it or not.

If you're counting numbers of people, then the majority -- vast majority -- of Britons living in official poverty, are white. That's simply because the majority of people living in the UK fall into that classification.

However as a percentage of all white Britons, ""only"" about 15% live officially in poverty, whereas about 22% of black and nearly 30% of Asian Britons are in poverty.

---

&gt;__River Song__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) created by [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) and played by [Alex Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kingston) in the British [science-fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. River Song was introduced to the series as an experienced future [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) of series protagonist the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), an alien [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) who [travels through time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction) in his [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS). Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with the Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the audience's perspective) is his first and apparently her last. In later appearances, River is a companion and romantic interest of the Doctor in his [eleventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor) incarnation, portrayed by [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\)). River Song was created by *Doctor Who* writer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) for the show's [fourth series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_4\)) in 2008, under the tenure of [executive producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer) [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies). When Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive producer, he began expanding on the character's background, depicting adventures earlier in River's timeline, upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest star to a [recurring actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_character) in the series. Other actresses have subsequently portrayed younger versions of the character.

true,MadArend,num20,,"I don't think accommodating the CDMs was an issue.  Having one extra player is not a serious burden.  Sandro seemed content to stay and fight for his place, and he's presumably only just getting back to full fitness anyway.  And Stambouli will probably need some time to settle and adjust, especially since his transfer was very last-minute.  So at least until January, I doubt there would have been issues ""accommodating"" our CDMs.  

Bentaleb isn't going to be a DM, he's mainly going to be box-to-box, and if he has to get pressed into service as a rotation DM for any significant length of time, then Dembele will end up playing two games per week, which I can't imagine him doing with his health history.

So unless you're ready to put Paulinho back in CM to rotate with Dembele (which I don't, both because I think he's poorly suited to CM in the Premier League, and because we *need* him for depth at AM), we'd be better off with Sandro around as cover.  Especially since he wasn't agitating for a move and is a great presence to have at the club.

Regardless, what's done is done.  I certainly hope none of this comes to pass, Strambouli hits the ground running, no one gets injured, and we buy a player or two in January to fill out our AM ranks.  But if we lose a CM to injury and then one of our other CMs goes down from over-use (like Vertonghen at left back last year), then I reserve the right to say ""I told you so.""

I used historical data of house price increases, rental incomes, stock market increases, etc. over 25 years. I took into account costs such as insurances, tax, repairs, etc, as well as the various tax breaks. It took quite a long time!

In summary, the results were that the two options were roughly equivalent in terms of total value over 25 years. However, it isn't the whole story. For me, the tax issues for property are not straightforward. You have to set up limited companies to achieve efficiencies for tax on rental income and capital gains. You need expertise in balancing the tax costs, leverage and tax benefit. Another downside is transaction costs. Buying and selling houses is slow and expensive compared to funds. Crucially, I think property is high risk. If you're putting your future into property then you need lots of properties to spread the risk! Value can be effected by neighbours, other buildings, physical damage, etc. In funds, you spread your risk automatically.

Another aspect to think about is what will you want when you're 75 years old? Personally, I won't to worry about unscrupulous letting agents and dodgy tenants. I just want a nice income from a combination of equity yields and pension drawdown. Set it up and forget about it!

I decided that property would be a good investment if I had the passion and expertise in property - but I don't. For me, a portfolio across ISAs and SIPP is easier and more tax efficient. I'm also confident of beating ftse100. That together with SIPP tax efficiencies mean I can easily beat property growth too.",0,1410027410,null,0,false,0,ckawvui,t3_2fldop,t1_ckawvui,t3_2fldop,null,1427165206,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The best thing for you to do is to track down the person who is in the position to make a decision on your case, or someone as close as possible to that role, and tell them about every fear you have. Only then will your fears be allayed or your hopes dashed, as the case may be. I expect the former. 

You need a proper advisor. The people at the college where you propose to do your access course may help you to find this person. If I'm right, the person you need will be working for your local council. Things may have changed. Perhaps you need to go to the student loan company. The key is to talk down the highest level of person, preferably someone with the authority to make a decision in a car such as yours, should you go ahead and make an application. 

I repeat, things will not be as bad as you fear. Taking that first step towards pursuing your degree is half the battle. Getting to the heart of the labyrinth of student loan decision making now may spare you some anxiety over the coming months.

true,kddean66,num18,,"I think the article is pretty good but misses the plot with respect to my and others' Levy frustration. For me, it's not about splashing the cash, it's about making the correct decision at the absolute critical moment to ensure success or failure.

Levy made two massive mistakes in the past 3 years that destroyed our trajectory and momentum. First, he pulled a Levy and waited until it was too late in the window to sign Moutinho. I agree that we need to be frugal, but a leader is supposed to recognize the right moment to take a risk and he blew it. With Moutinho, we easily win one more game that season and pip Arse for Champs League, solidifying us as a top 4 club rather than a club who got top 4 a couple of years.

Second, he should have done anything and everything to keep Bale. For my English friends, you may not have any idea about the impact that Bale was having in developing a US fan base. I've actually run into a few Tottenham fans here in Oklahoma USA recently and all of them tie their fandom to Bale. Heck, last year when NBC Sports was taking the broadcast rights from Fox, their massive billboard in NYC had Bale as its poster child for the EPL. He alone could have propelled Spurs into a top 3 or 4 fan following in the USA had we kept him.

Now, keeping Bale was no easy feat and may have been a fait accompli once Madrid came calling, so now onto the next colossal blunder by Levy and co. The Bale money was massive and we had a real opportunity to use it to create a top 4 squad by spending the money on 3 or 4 top, top players but he went and spent the wad on 6 ""good"" players and 1 player (Eriksen) who will be a top player in the future. We already had Sandro (coming back from injury I realize), Dembele, Holtby, Siggy, Townsend, Lennon, and Carroll in the midfield. All are good players but there wasn't a superstar in the bunch. So, Levy/Baldini go out and buy Paulinho, Chadli, Capoue, Eriksen, and Lamela. This was piss poor evaluation. We already had the ""squad players"" for the midfield. Why not sign Lamela (who will attain his reputation imo), Eriksen, and one other top quality midfielder? Force Real to give us Ozil or go and get Griezmann or someone of similar quality and then pay Villa the 25 mil they wanted for Benteke and be done with it? Instead of purchasing a whole slew of squad players, we could have just signed 4 impact players: Lamela, Griezmann, Eriksen, and Benteke. Now, we may have been unlucky with Lamela and Benteke getting injured, but you don't know that going in. And at least we could have looked at the season and given credit to Levy and co for doing good business and setting our squad on a firm foundation, if not being a little unlucky.

So for me, Levy does deserve criticism because there are moments in time that calls for a leader to make the one or two correct decisions that put you above your competitors. In the last 3 years, Levy hasn't produced those decisions and now we are below another team in the pecking order (Liverpool) and will be back below Manu once their big spending pays off and the attain their equilibrium position in the league.",0,1410029058,null,0,false,0,ckaxmen,t3_2flcz5,t1_ckaxmen,t3_2flcz5,null,1427164862,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Also note how BBC either ignores or plays down protests which go against the interests of Western governments, but then tends to play up and give huge coverage to anything that is for these interests. You didn't hear anything about the massive protests in Australia recently. Or protests in London generally get ignored.  

At best if they do, they're buried away quietly in some far off section.

It's very subtle but most people don't realise that they're also biased, most people are too blinkered and think the BBC is the gold standard in the same way an idiot thinks Fox News is the best or RT sells the truth.

The 32 years comes from the fact that over the last 50 or so years Scotland has been ruled for 32 of them by a Conservative government it didn't vote for. 

Yes, you could say that in that there are many millions of people in Liverpool, Manchester etc to whom the same statistic applies. That's true. We're not claiming to be *abused spouses* or an enclave of radically different political thought. We're simply sick of living within a system that isn't particularly democratic. If 49% of the voting people are **ignored** you aren't being represented. 

The SNP *did* win a majority, they won it in a PR voting system that's supposed to prevent majorities. They showed people mostly vote Labour because they feel they *have* to, not because they want to. I don't want to live in a country where you are dissuaded by the system from voting for the people you believe in, a system that shunts you to *""biggest least objectionable""* but then still ignores you just because the party you were forced to vote for got 1 less vote than the party other people were forced to vote for.

However the independence vote isn't about those people in Liverpool and it's certainly not about abandoning them or turning our backs on them or anything like that. As above, we're not kingmakers... we're so tiny we have no appreciable effect on the system at-all. It's through happy accident that we retained our position as a nation, involved in a partnership of nations and not just a city in England or a political belief. That allows us to dissolve that partnership. 

We shouldn't forgo it just because people elsewhere don't have that opportunity, it's within their power to fix their own system even with us gone.

Oh that script.

They shot an arrow into a spaceship to get it into orbit.

The very very small amount of gold (compared to the massive amount being glugged into the circuits, which did make a bit of sense, making the circuits with gold) charged the spaceship so it could get out the atmosphere and not blow up half of the planet.

“Because it’s ROBBIN BLOODY HOOD! Aren’t you supposed to be a teacher, woman?”

“La, la, la, can’t hear your logic over Robin Hood being alive!”

Changes in this version:

-	Now able to explode wooden archery targets
-	Removed the ability to work on anything mechanical such as evil robots or machinery because that literally never comes in handy under any circumstances.

This tiny golden arrow is exact percentage of gold which is needed to stabilize the alien ship’s engine simply by coming into contact with the ship’s hull which it will do thanks to the fact that we will fire it out of a shoddy wooden bow at a ship that’s already nearly in orbit and incidentally the robots didn’t have this exact percentage of gold needed to stabilize the engine because they’d given it to us in a ploy to capture Robin Hood whom they didn’t need because if they had the golden arrow they’d be leaving the planet, not to mention that they had tons and tons of gold in form of plates and platters which they didn’t melt into circuits even though they knew the engine was far from necessary capacity to get the ship into orbit and yet they gave gold away to the person they were trying to capture which they didn’t need to- 

Ah, screw it. Suspension of disbelief – ENGAGE! 

I love you, suspension of disbelief. You keep me happy.

Overall: this was my favorite episode so far! I liked the previous ones too, but maybe because those were so dark I enjoyed the change of mood and pace so much. It was adventure, it was funny, it was actiony – I loved every second of it! The Sheriff was hilarious and if I could have just one spin-off buddy comedy episode with just the Doctor and Robin  I would be so happy.

This episode has definitely become my favorite Gatiss written episode.

I thought the actors for Robin Hood and the Sheriff played their parts really well. While reading the script, I thought of Cary Elwes from Men in Tights as Robin Hood and Tom Reilly seems a bit like him in some scenes. Ben Miller, as the Sheriff, looks a lot like the Master as others have pointed out.

I think any reservations about Capaldi’s Doctor not being funny is gone in this episode. The banter between the Doctor and Robin was one of my favorite scenes while reading the script and the execution of that in the episode was as great as I hoped it would be. The two bickering amongst each other while Clara being like a school teacher to two schoolboys was just fun to watch. In general, I think Clara had become a much more enjoyable character to watch in my opinion than last season.

Maybe I haven’t been listening all that carefully, but has there been a musical leitmotif for Capaldi yet? I remember seeing an interview with Murray Gold on composing Capaldi’s theme but I don’t think I’ve noticed it in the past three episodes.

true,Tenure,silence,Silence,"My thoughts: a lot of people are going to hate this episode, because it's campy and silly. 

I really enjoyed it. I was laughing all the way through and just embracing the campiness and comedy. I thought it got at the ""hero"" theme of this season too without beating us over the head with it or going to emo about it. Enjoyed elements of the previous two episodes, but this was the first where I really got into the swing of it and thought, ""Ok, I really know who this Doctor is now"". This was definitely his tangerine-on-the-door moment. 

On that hero point, it got at that thing about the hero questioning who he is... but actually learning something this time. And through comedy. Kinda like how guardians of the galaxy is a comedy, but it uses that comedy to drive real character understanding, because the comedy is produced by characterisation and the way it clashes. 

Also, I'm... I'm actually really liking Clara? I normally don't like that ""oh she's the smart women and the men are being dumb and chest beating"" humour, and I've especially not liked her as an assistant in the past, but...I thought it worked rather well here. I liked the competition between Robin and the Doctor and the way it was motivated, and I loved the way they assumed Clara was the leader. I also liked, as someone pointed out last week, the Doctor is getting very comfortable with letting her wander off and do stuff on her own - he trusts she can solve a problem and... She actually does a pretty good job of it. And... I'm not annoyed by her anymore! I genuinely find her funny and likeable and smart.

Anyway, overall, my favourite episode of this season. Loved the line about taking over Derby... And then LINCOLN! And the friendship-is-magic moment of them firing the bow together. And the Doctor still seems to be figuring out sums for some reason on his blackboard. And what is the promised land... Gallifrey?

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"&gt; A lot of players got upgraded in winter and have not transferred that number to FIFA 15.

What a load of bullshit, only 3 players who received winter upgrades will be included in the top 50; Vidal, Hazard and Suarez. Vidal got upgraded to an 86 and will be an 85 but both Hazard and Suarez got upgraded to 88's and they can't be any lower than that. So unless you have some kind of inside info that nobody else has, 2/3 of the only winter upgrades we have an idea about have carried over at the very least.

&gt; FIFA will never make Hazard a 90 simply because, well 1, he isn't a 90 rated player.

The same Fifa that had him as a 91 in online seasons for almost half a season? Ok...

&gt; You don't give 90s to 23 year olds unless they are literally Messi, but not even Messi had that. 

Messi was a 90 on Fifa 10 at 22 years old...

&gt; Look at the list of people Hazard would have to be ranked higher than if he was a 90, its simply ridiculous. 88 is an amazing rating for any player, I dont know why people on here thinks its nothing.

Nobody is saying 88 isn't an amazing rating but like I said, he received an upgrade to 88 in early Feb and he played his best football after that, so if he was good enough to be an 88 based on the first half of the season why isn't it plausible that having an even better 2nd half of the season would result in another upgrade of one or two? Again, he was a 91 in online seasons for about 3/4 months. I don't think he will be a 90 btw, I think he'll be an 89, I just don't think 90 is as unrealistic as you're making out.

true,rosetylr,rose,Rose,"The episode was okay to me. I mean, it wasn't very exciting to me, but it had funny moments here and there. It was okay until the ending. 17% of the gold they needed was an arrow, really? 

Capaldi was great, as usual. He's been giving me the impression that he's the ""GET OFF MY LAWN!!"" type of Doctor, which I absolutely have no problem with, but this episode really gave off his more protective and caring side as well as his sassy side. Also, I think we're gonna see more of the Doctor and spoons in the future. 


Other than that, I found Tom Riley funny as Robin Hood. I *really* hoped he could be another companion. I could just imagine him and the Doctor bickering in the TARDIS, with Clara in the back with crossed arms, rolling her eyes, thinking: *""why do even I insist on staying?""* That'd be fun.

Overall, okay episode, sucky ending.

Also: Jenna looked stunning in this episode. I mean, she *always* looks stunning, but more so in this episode.

 [**Wilhelm scream**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm%20scream): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Wilhelm scream__ is a film and television [stock sound effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_sound_effect) that has been used in more than 200 movies, beginning in 1951 for the film *[Distant Drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_Drums)*.  The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion.

&gt;Most likely voiced by actor and singer [Sheb Wooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheb_Wooley), the sound is named after Private Wilhelm, a character in *[The Charge at Feather River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charge_at_Feather_River)*, a 1953 [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre\)) in which the character gets shot with an arrow. This was its first use from the [Warner Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.) stock sound library, although *The Charge at Feather River* is believed to have been the third movie to use the effect. 

&gt;The effect gained new popularity (its use often becoming an [in-joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-joke)) after it was used in *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars)*, the *[Indiana Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones)* series, [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company) cartoons and many other blockbuster films as well as many television programs and video games.

I was basing this off of past FIFA's and in forms/head to head. Toure got countless IFs, and TOTS and still got 86. You seem to not be familiar with FIFA. You even admit the player that we did see who got an upgrade in winter didn't bring it over to fifa 15.

&gt; The same Fifa that had him as a 91 in online seasons for almost half a season?

I just checked right now, he isn't 91. I don't know why you keep saying this. 

&gt; Messi was a 90 on Fifa 10 at 22 years old...

Wow, did not remember that. Even then, Hazard to get a 90 rated now would be crazy and nearly put him on par with Messi. That means if he even gets two or three informs and a team of the season he would be over 93-4.

&gt; he received an upgrade to 88 in early Feb and he played his best football after that, so if he was good enough to be an 88 based on the first half of the season why isn't it plausible that having an even better 2nd half of the season would result in another upgrade of one or two?

Because thats not how the fucking game works. Go to /r/fifa and try and say that Hazard would be a 90 based off of that. They would laugh at that. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/2fn9yf/the_last_10_what_are_your_thoughts/

Over 50 comments in that prediction thread, only two have Hazard as 89 and all the other predictions put him as a 88. You think they are all full of bullshit too?

You seem to be letting your club bias go against your reasoning. I will make sure to come back to this comment tomorrow and reply to you when Hazard is an 88.

I might be going off track. How can I put this in a way you might understand?

Don't be fucking twats. Seriously. Stop being cunts. 

Burning a 'Muslim bus' is not going to stop Muslim extremism. Because there's a difference between 'Muslim extremism' and just plain 'Muslim', you understand, right?

Right guys? 

And even then, even if there WASN'T a difference, I'm not sure how burning a bus would make any positive difference. Or benefit anything or anyone. Did you even think it through or just think, ""fire burn bad thing!"" and let the cave man out or something?

Because right now you're not making this country better. You're making it worse. You're actually committing criminal, potentially life threatening acts in order to terrorise a community. Which... has a certain tang of irony. Don't worry about the last word there, it would take too long to explain.

I actually posted something similar earlier today, but it needs repeating here: [State schools aren't worse than private schools when you control for pupils' social backgrounds.](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisainfocus/48482894.pdf)

There are two reasons state schools appear to be worse: Firstly, the press loves citing the worst possible stats about schooling because it sells more papers than when they cite the best stats and it suits politicians of all parties to go along with this so they can be seen to be doing something about it and take credit for any minor improvements. Secondly, social inequality and social mobility in this country are both awful: Poor people have it enormously worse than rich people and all the factors associated with poverty are thus exacerbated.

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"&gt; I was basing this off of past FIFA's and in forms/head to head. Toure got countless IFs, and TOTS and still got 86. You seem to not be familiar with FIFA. You even admit the player that we did see who got an upgrade in winter didn't bring it over to fifa 15.

Yes I admitted one players rating didn't brought it over but it's also impossible for the other two to be any lower than their upgrades, so again, 2/3 will at least match there upgrade. Nobody is talking about IFs, remind me when I brought them into it? IFs only come out when a player is in form, it's in the name. We're talking about winter upgrades when players are upgraded for more than just form.

&gt; I just checked right now, he isn't 91. I don't know why you keep saying this.

Why would you be checking after the season's over? The whole matchday thing that made him a 91 ended when the season ended. And you asked me if I know how Fifa works...

&gt; Wow, did not remember that. Even then, Hazard to get a 90 rated now would be crazy and nearly put him on par with Messi. That means if he even gets two or three informs and a team of the season he would be over 93-4.

You forget that the rating system has changed since then, back then there wasn't so many highly rated players, the best players were usually 90/91 and there was only usually one or two of them. Now the best player/Messi is usually a 94 and there are 4/5 90+ players. If Fifa 10 used the current rating system Messi would have been more than just a 90.

&gt; Because thats not how the fucking game works. Go to /r/fifa and try and say that Hazard would be a 90 based off of that. They would laugh at that. http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/2fn9yf/the_last_10_what_are_your_thoughts/

It isn't? Players don't receive upgrades based on how well they have played? Why would I go there and try and say he would be a 90 when I've said I think he'll be an 89?

&gt; Over 50 comments in that prediction thread, only two have Hazard as 89 and all the other predictions put him as a 88. You think they are all full of bullshit too? 

Did you see the Sky Sports Poll in which Liverpool had like 60+% of the votes saying they would do the best, the other 40% was split between 3 teams... Well if it's the most popular decision it must be true. Also, I never said you're talking bullshit because you think he will be an 88, I said you was talking bullshit because you were literally making things up.

&gt; You seem to be letting your club bias go against your reasoning. I will make sure to come back to this comment tomorrow and reply to you when Hazard is an 88.

You can come back and gloat all you want. I haven't once said he won't be an 88, all I've said is **I think** he'll be an 89 and 90 isn't unrealistic, just like 88 isn't unrealistic either.

Exemplified well here:

[Stats](http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2013%2F10%2FHartBlog.jpg)

He hasn't earned the right to a new contract, the reason other players have received new contracts is precisely because they have.

I think we should review the situation in 6 months, and if there hasn't been a vast improvement, which seems unlikely at this stage, then finally review in the summer, when he'll have a year left on his contract - and then it's a case of extend his contract or sell.

My opinion, devoid of sentiment and coldly logical? As follows:

Joe has hugely regressed, and he is no longer of the standard required to make it at this club, not too dissimilar to Micah's situation. I think this time next year we won't have renewed his contract and he'll be a new signing for a midtable side in an attempt to resurrect his career, and he'll have lost, or be close to losing the England number 1 status to Fraser Foster.

It'll take a huge turnaround this year for us to renew his contract, unless the board grant him one out of sentimentality and homegrown rules.

I genuinely don't think he makes the grade here anymore.

GK is a problem position for us at the moment, and I think we'll look for a genuinely top draw one sooner or later, with Caballero eventually serving as number 2.

What? Where specifically did they ever mention anything about reverse aging?  She ages normally.  She and the Doctor are just meeting each other in reverse order.

Actually, we don't know that Missy believes what she is doing is right.  We really know next to nothing about her intentions, let alone how she feels about those intentions.  For all we know, she may be intentionally doing wrong for a whole variety of possible motivations.  The fact is, we just don't know enough about her yet to say that she is any way similar to another character as far as her actions are concerned.

The Beeb probably don't want to risk getting complaints from the British public and being accused of showing insensitive material.

Edit: It might be important to add that a backlash of complaints against the BBC could come from the Tv Licence fee.

true,DRM25,null,null,"I'm also 25 working at LBG and I'm in a similar financial position to you. I currently max out on sharematch &amp; 2013 sharesave as well as contributing 5% towards my pension. I will be upping my sharematch contribution to £500 in the new offer.

key facts for you to consider:
• Pension - paid from pre tax income, your investment is at risk of going down as well as up, you can't access this for at least 25 years
• Sharematch - paid from pre tax income, you buy shares at market price each month. T&amp;Cs - hold for 3 years and you receive matched shares, hold for 5 years and you lose any income tax liability, max investment £125/month, investments can go up and down.
• Sharesave - paid from post tax income T&amp;Cs - invest fixed amount for 3 years up to £500/month with no downside risk at a fixed share price of 60p
• You pay 42% income tax on marginal salary

Firstly, getting Lloyds to contribute to your pension is the most beneficial long term so you should keep your contribution to a min of 5% in order to get the 13% lloyds contribution. For sharematch you should take advantage of the initial £30 match (assuming you plan to stay at lloyds for at least 3 years).

The next step is then to calculate how much disposable cash you have which you would like to invest and when you would like to benefit from that investment. 
• If you don't want access to any savings until at least 50 years old then you could invest additional amounts over and above the 18% into your pension, although this seems excessive at 25
• If you don't plan on working at Lloyds in 3 years then the sharesave and sharematch are both pointless. If you do plan on staying 3 years but not 5 years then the sharesave is going to be better than sharematch. 
• If you plan on staying for 5 years then you will need to do some calcs (but rough calcs I've just done would say that if returns on average each year are greater than 0% but less than 18% then sharematch is better, otherwise sharesave is better). FYI you can only invest an extra £95 each month into the sharematch anyway. 

It's also worth mentioning that you have the ability to cancel sharesave during the 3 year period and redeem any money which you have put aside to date with no risk at all (if for instance you decide that it would be better to invest elsewhere).

&gt;Your idea that there would be violent riots involving muslims (or other minorities) because police would pursue serial rapists in their communities is absurd. 

That's not what I said. If gangs of white men had gang raped 1,400 pakistani muslim girls since 1997 in 1 small town alone, and the police had largely ignored it even covered it up, we all know what would happen. I expect the local police station would be burnt to the ground within hours of the news coming out. 

As such, the police would never allow such a thing to happen. With the white working classes however they know that there will be pretty much no reaction at all from the ""community"", because there really is no such thing as the ""white community"" who react as one. That's what I mean when I say certain groups are prioritised.

Three words: No Tuition Fees.

I'll say it again, slowly. No. Tuition. Fees.

The currency thing is vastly overhyped (chances are, it'll still be sterling both sides of the border), the borders are likely still going to be open, so your fears are misplaced.

Nonetheless, because Scotland will be in the EU and not the UK, EU regulations will forbid Scottish Universities from charging UK residents tuition fees. Currently, Scottish and non-UK EU students don't pay tuition costs on their undergraduate degree. Even if you're worried about a couple of trips to the Bureau de Change and having to pass passport control, that's still worth your while, surely!

You'll save thousands of pounds a year with independence, if you go to a Scottish University - assuming you're going for a Scottish-style 4-year course and independence happens too late for your 2016-2017 term, that's still a cool £18,000 saved right there.

She's saved 2 people. One of them we're not entirely sure whether or not the Doctor actually killed. This could be a time when she believes that the Doctor is a paragon of goodness, and tries to help him by saving a lot of the people that die in his presence. They might have actually dated before, considering he tends to date a lot of people (married briefly to Marylin Monroe in the Christmas episode based off of *A Christmas Carol* in season 5, River, Elizabeth I was hinted at during Tennant's time and even shown during *The Day of the Doctor*).

However, if you spend your entire life cleaning up someone else's mess, and aren't actually with them to see the good, I could see it very easy to lose faith in anyone. It would also explain why Kovarian would know how to trick the Doctor twice.

So, the Doctor wouldn't have dated Kovarian. Not intentionally, anyways. But, the Doctor has been oblivious to different encounters with people before. He didn't know who the Face of Bo was until what was probably Jack's last episode on Doctor Who. Heck, the term of being a boyfriend could be just as twisted as her reasoning for murdering the Doctor.

And Missy and Kovarian look similar enough to be the same person. Hell, Jack looked nothing like the Face of Bo. Facial changes was one of the first odd things talked about in New Who with Cassandra (Episode 2, New Earth).",0,1410040560,null,0,false,0,ckb2mtd,t3_2fnrjr,t1_ckb2mtd,t1_ckb1u7t,null,1427162454,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

&gt; I agree we shouldn't of sold Negredo, let's not forget he is out for ~3 months still, so we still would of been left with two strikers. Negredo was due back around January where the window opens again so I think that factored into his move away



I haven't seen any articles about his status and recovery time in a month, when at that time he was due back in October. So when someone else said he was still not going to be back until january I believed it. 

Again my point is selling an injured Negredo for 25million whenever you are getting that money is a great deal.

Separately we need a fourth striker, and got beat by United to Falcao. 

Even if Valencia had offered 25 mil and Negredo had been healthy you still have to take that deal. That was over value for him, and he is already pushing 30. and don't forget that he might not have made the [champions league](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-citys-alvaro-negredo-faces-4041520) team if he had stayed.It was a mistake not to get someone in this window but I am trying to defend the Negredo move as good business regardless.

Monsters were weird. Highly unbelievable, but I can look past that. I think it's weird how in the previous episode we could see a Dalek antibody turn a man to dust but we can't see these monsters do basically the same thing. Very G-rated episode. Ok robots need gold. The Promise Land. Where the story falls apart is toward the end. The end is highly unbelievable. The golden arrow hitting the outside of the ship was enough to get it into orbit? Very, very poor writing there. Like the idea though where the sonic wasn't used to solve it, but a little more thought could have gone into the defeat. I rate this episode 2 out of 5 stars.

As it stands our block grant is calculated by taking the UK budget on devolved matters then dividing it roughly by the population share of Scotland.

*So* if the UK spends £100bn on the NHS about £10bn gets added to the block grant. We don't *have* to spend it on our NHS mind but that's how the total is calculated. 

If Westminster privatise areas of the NHS in a way that reduces the budget then that has the knock on effect of reducing the block grant.

Scotland not privatising in unison means that to maintain our NHS budget requires money from elsewhere in the block grant being redirected to the NHS. If the reductions are severe enough we'll have no choice but to also reduce our NHS. 

It doesn't *have* to be services that turn pay-at-use either. For example let's say the English NHS spends £1bn/year on some x-ray facilities. That's £100m sent to Scotland, who also use it for a similar x-ray facilities. 

If the government then decides to contract that out to BUPA or ATOS or somebody at £800m then that's £200m freed up. If that gets spent elsewhere in the NHS everything is fine, Scottish budget not effected. If however it's moved out to a non-devolved issue (like tax cuts, benefit cuts, military spending etc) then Scotland's budget drops £20m **even though it didn't privatise so it didn't save any money**.

Scottish NHS has to find that £20m from somewhere else or follow suit. 

This is already happening with things like prescription fee's, the UK doesn't spend any money on prescription fees so the appropriate money doesn't get added to the Scottish budget. The Scottish government simply decides to take money from elsewhere to pay for it. 

True in other areas outside of healthcare, University fee's and the Bedroom tax are best examples.

At the end of the day none of these guys really have any credentials that they're anything other than full of shit (unlike the likes of Hansen, Carra or Neville who have been world-class defenders). In particular defending is an incredibly subtle and nuanced skill, and it's really easy for anyone to take a handful of clips and use them to make whatever point they want to make. Especially if you're going to isolate mistakes.

I reckon for any regularly starting goalkeeper in the world I could make a compilation video of poor goalkeeping or quality saves, or for a striker of missed easy chances or quality goals, and it would portray them as either a shit player or a world-class talent depending on how I wanted them to look and which clips I choose. With defenders it's even more complicated because, for example, a last-ditch tackle is either a great tackle to prevent a goal or they were fucking shit and out of position to begin with depending on how you want to spin it.

The idea that the EU would be happy to kick Scotland out once it becomes independent is silly on any level, other than as a piece of pre-referendum scaremongering by the 'No' campaign.

Plus, the only way I could see that happening is that she tapped into her regeneration ability somehow, which would be irrelevant because Kovarian has no regeneration ability.  The only way she could is if she was a Time Lord, and the Doctor can recognize other Time Lords.  

Plus, if she is deluded enough to believe that the Doctor is her boyfriend and that they are ""on the same side in some messed up way in her mind"" then she is deluded enough to believe that her actions aren't for good and that the Doctor is fine with that.  I will concede that it is possible that she crazily beleives that she is working for good, but the opposite is equally possible.  We just don't know enough about her yet to know which.  

As far as the Captain Jack/Face of Boe thing, there is 5 billion years worth of aging that happened there.  A feat unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.  I'll forgive the Doctor for not recognizing Jack if he is over 5 billion years older.  

As for the Doctor having dated her in the past, he would have to have done it off screen, making it weird for her to show up now.  Plus, even if the Doctor and Missy did have a connection in the past, that in no way proves a connection between her and Kovarian.  

I think Kovarian's actions are far more easily explained.  There doesn't need to be history between her and the Doctor.  As we know from Tasha Lem, her faction of the Church of the Silence broke away and tried to assassinate the Doctor by creating River and blowing up the TARDIS.  She's a religious fanatic.

There's an anomaly here.  Scotland offers free tuition to all EU citizens, but England/Wales/NI aren't EU nations so fees are charged as usual (although you can get scholarships etc.).

Once upon a time, it was possible for Scottish universities to offer Eng/Wal/NI students four years for the price of three (final year of your first undergraduate course was free) as an incentive to come to Scotland and use our universities instead of staying on your home turf.  That has now been withdrawn.

As for LLB... I think Dundee is still the only Scottish university that teaches both Scots and English Law.  When I studied there I knew two girls studying English Law and a third guy who was doing an English-&gt;Scots Law conversion course.

true,Sheafer,null,null,"The writing in this series is really starting to get me down. It's shoddy and ridiculous.

And it's such a shame - capaldi is fantastic, Clara remains excellent, and they're being so badly let down. Apart from the utter chaos of the first episode (dinosaur in London, barely commented on and basically irrelevant to the plot, the appalling hammyness of some of the puns, the gross call-back to matt smith, etc etc etc...) it was also incredibly unoriginal - as it all has been. So far, in three episodes, we've had three episodes about mad robots. We've had the sister ship of the girl in the fireplace, giant metal castings replacing circuit boards in advanced technology (fires of pompeii and whatever the sleveen in Cardiff episode was called), a dalek with feelings (human darlek and dalek caan) and yet another ship masquerading long term as part of the English landscape. And the stupidity of some of the solutions are painful. The golden arrow thinking on the outside of the hull gave it a massive power boost? Really? Miniaturisation into the dalek? An a dalek immune system incase that should happen? And buttons to press (for fucking who?!) to turn on dalek memories that are repressed in case of what? In case Davros decided he wanted them to be good now? It's cretinous.

God - the hammyness of the points they're making too. Could you please explain one more time that the doctor is Clara's hero? After she says so directly twice, please please have Robin hood explain it too, for anyone who has suffered a serious head injury and missed the point. 'YOU. ARE. A. GOOD. DALEK.' Thanks chap, we'd missed the analogy. And we would never have picked up that there was a subplot if you hadn't had a giant flashing lantern hanging on it in all three episodes so far. 'the promised land. Like the robots but much more sophisticated.' Honestly.

There are some decent moments - the stuff about pretending to he heroes was nice at the end of this - but where's the innovation and excitement? Where is the stuff that makes the universe feel huge and endless and worth exploring? Where is the inspiration you could see with blink, with midnight, with the silence and the flesh? Where are the character studies you saw in the girl who waited or, again, midnight? 

And why are lines that are clearly meant to be important given no follow through? I've made mistakes it's time to set them right'. (with meaningful levers being pulled) - well? When? 'its time to set them right. At some point when I remember.' 

And after the war doctor directly asks DT and MS 'why are you so afraid of being grown ups' why are the writers so afraid of having an older doctor that they feel the need to have him act like a child for 10% of every episode. Not an excitable eccentric genius (as per the whole of matt smith's reign) but a child - fighting over keys and wanting a pet dinosaur. They've got this darker, stronger, sophisticated doctor - and if feels like they've built this incredible relic of power and substance and now they're trying to display it by covering it in gold tinsel and pink balloons.

true,Obligandus,null,null,"OK, so here goes:

Amy from her birth to Rory's first death is just regular old Amy. Then she forgets Rory when he's erased from existence (Cold Blood, S5E9). Amy's brain is special because of her prolonged proximity to the crack in her bedroom wall which lead to ""the universe pouring into [her] head every night"" whatever that means.

This is why she is able to (with effort) remember Rory again based on her contact with the plastic-duplicate-Rory (The Pandorica Opens, S5E12). The child Amy in The Big Bang (S5E13) is an alternate version from the version of the universe that had all the stars get destroyed in ancient Roman times. The adult Amy at the end of this episode is the Amy from a new version of the universe in which she has living parents. Her magic ability to remembers things that never happened spontaneously brings the Doctor into this new universe.

So far so good? Two adult Amys, one set of memories because of her magic powers. (One and a bit; she remembers two versions of her childhood.)

Some time between Christmas Carol (S6 Christmas Special) and The Impossible Astronaut (S6E1) Amy is kidnapped by the people from Demon's Run and replaced with a clone. The clone has no independent thought and is inhabited by the real Amy's mind until it is dissolved in The Almost People (S6E6). At this point her mind returns to her real body aboard Demon's Run.

Still one set of memories (ish) and a roughly continuous line of experiences for Amy.

In the Girl Who Waited (S6E10) there are two versions of Amy. One from a timeline where she is left behind and one where she isn't. The one from  that wasn't is taken away in the TARDIS and the other one never happens. This is the same Amy as before with the same memories.

In The Wedding of River Song (S6E13) River changes time and a third Amy exists in a world where she never met the Doctor. By the start of the episode she has already used her magic powers to import *some* of her other self's memories. At the end of that episode (after the timeline is restored) we see the real Amy again who seems to remember everything. Presumably she used her magic powers to import her memories of the ""aborted"" timeline back into the main universe.

After that there are no other versions of Amy that I can recall. If you need anything else clearly up (River, etc) or more clarification on this issue with Amy please ask.

The only advice I can give is to wait. I *really* disliked watching season six when it aired and the only recourse I had was patience. Doctor Who is so changeable from one season to the next, one Doctor to the next, etc that I guess you could just wait and see if it improves.

This isn't very helpful, I'm sure, but I've got nothing else. I personally disliked the first two episodes until I watched them a second time through (and found them to be nothing special). This third one I didn't mind so much so I guess this season is growing on me slowly.

The current formula will almost definitely remain till the end of this series at least and probably beyond with how successful its been thus far on the whole.

In the 1950's Scotland was arguably more right wing than England. 15% of Scots still vote Conservative despite the extremely low chance of them get their constituency seat.

It's commonly not understood that the SNP is really a hodge-podge of different ideals that only really agree on one thing - We won't get anything but Labour unless we come together, defeat them and obtain political independence from Westminster.

Independence is about Scotland getting the government it votes for. If Scotland votes for extreme socialists of Tommy Sheridan's ilk then it'll get them, likewise if it votes for the most Thatcherite person available.

If the youth program works out we will be having one or two young players find their way into the first team every few years, which helps out how many we have to bring in. All the young guys that don't make it get sold at a profit that adds up when all sales are considered. This let's us fund that one extra purchase each year that keeps us in that very top group of teams.

United have absurdly huge sponsorships, but that's what they've earned for being at the top for 25 years. If we can keep bringing in trophies every season, we'll find ourselves with bigger and bigger deals too.

Also, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Over the next three seasons, United need to have two consecutive years of CL football or else one of their major deals (I think it's the kit one) gets cut in size. Now, if they keep spending like they are it's easy to say they'll make it, but they also aren't spending smart at all. While their attack is good right now, it will only be getting worse each year. The defense is just horrible and the midfield makes no sense. They've got to get through a very good Everton, a more balanced Liverpool, a gelling Spurs team, and/or Arsenal who are title contenders when healthy if they want to get top 4. That's a huge ask and if they don't make it up this season, one of Liverpool, Everton, or Spurs gets a year of CL money to strengthen themselves.

People are acting as if United are already back in the top 4 just because of the money they have, but money itself doesn't win trophies. You need to spend that money well to bring in the right players for the right roles. I suppose if you're a betting man you'd put your money on United finding their way back up, but personally I have serious doubts that this club knows how to move on without SAF guiding things.

This does not reflect the voting intention of most of the country and is completely undemocratic. 

There is no chance of meaningful reform in Westminster in my lifetime unless something drastic happens. You should be cheering us on; a successful Proportional Representation system in Scotland is likely the only thing that could bring about change in rUK due to public demand. 

WRT to the oil, as present all of the spoils from it are invested in London, Canary Wharf being the most visible result. If it continues like this then Scotland will have seen practically no benefit from this wealth and will be in a little trouble when it does run out. And just like in the 80s, when the economy was shifted to be investment friendly as opposed to export manufacturing, we will see zero government support in helping industry transition to new sectors outside of central London. We'd much rather have the cash now to build a proper infrastructure to fall back on.

This wouldn't be happening if a Federal/Devo Max system were on the table. More to the point- if that *were* on the table, the Scots could vote for it with a clear conscience, without the spectre of economic collapse staring them in the face. 

That some kind of new quasi-federalist, or at least strongly regionalist constitutional arrangement hasn't been offered by this government, or the last, nor is it likely to be offered by the major parties come next May, is a huge indictment of Westminster's approach to the issue. 

As an Englishman, and someone who will always identify as British, I sincerely hope that the vote ends up ""No"", by the narrowest possible of margins, for the sake of lending a mandate to further regionalisation within the UK- benefiting *all* of us.

Were I Scottish, though? I think I'd be voting Yes. However bad things get, escaping this dysfunctional political system would be worthwhile. If the Scots had the option of voting for an option that left them in the Union and gave them the autonomy they obviously need, given the utter inadequacy of the London-centric politics we've seen over the past few decades, they'd take it- but that's not on offer, and the continued obstructionary business from the big two is killing the case for the union.

Never before has DW been this terrible.  It is sad, capaldi could have been as good as any past doctor but he feels like a meta doctor.  Not a real doctor, but someone just loosely commenting on past doctors picking and choosing moments to show case whenever he feels like it.

He is not a serious doctor and I hope to god it gets better, because he is signed for at least one more season.

I blame the writing, but there is a point when an actor as good as capaldi has to stand his ground to protect his own image and even the image of Doctor Who from terrible writers that just plain suck.

I watched starting at 9 and going to now.  Before this season I watched a lot of classic DW.  And capaldi seems to be the worst out of all DWs because the plots are just terrible.  I was actually surprised how good DW was in even the first season.  I felt the The Keys of Marinus was excellent.  It was like watching a modern show(with a few compromises). It was cool to see the group split up and come back together.

I don't know whether its the system, the other players in the team or a Mourinho's instructions to him, but I feel like he is capable of sooo much more as a player but we put some shackles on him, voluntary or not.

I feel as if he was a starter on Madrid, Bayern or Barcelona he would be able to be so much more creative and effective, and this really bothers me. Hazard in my opinion has the potential to be one of the best of his generation but he has to get a lot of the ball on a team that keeps the ball a lot. Playing counter attack with Hazard is like playing counter attack with Messi to me. Robben, Ronaldo, even Reus, these guys are players that could dominate with counter attacks. Not the likes of Hazard, Messi, Iniesta..

I'm far more likely to be able to connect to a Scot than a Londoner. Scotland is a principle part, yes London has almost twice the population of Scotland (5 million compared to 8 million) and as such should, in theory, get higher representation that Scotland but in real terms the Scots are space out over 78,387 km2 compared to London being only 1,572 km². That doesn't mean Scotland should get 78 times the representation but at least 4-5 times more because being spread out over a large area the people will obviously support different things, they're not likely to conglomerate like London has with high-earning business sectors dominating the inner-city who probably all have fairly similar views.

Not many people are good enough to be starting ahead of Diego Costa. Adebayor and Soldado included.

&gt;And before anyone pulls stats from Lukaku's past I would just like to say please take a look at Soldado's stats. 

Slightly different scenarios. Lukaku's stats are from a time when he's improving and theyre also in the PL. i.e. the stats say this is a young striker who's proven himself in this league and still has potential to improve. Soldado's are very different. He's a proven goalscorer in his prime in a different league and has struggled since.

I completely agree that Soldado should be given a chance and I think he should be starting ahead of Adebayor, but to say that Lukaku isn't a good enough striker for us or that he wouldn't improve our team is a bit harsh.",0,1410057050,null,0,false,0,ckb9l5b,t3_2fofdy,t1_ckb9l5b,t1_ckb95xz,null,1427159209,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

When they report it, its no longer a rumour. Here, let me define the term rumour to you, since you don't seem to understand it:

""a currently circulating story or report of uncertain or doubtful truth.""

Does that sound like any of BBC's ""rumours""?

The Guardian has been wrong on several occasions. You're an idiot if you think they're a reliable source. Want an example? [HERE.](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/20/chelsea-sergio-aguero-carlo-ancelotti) I'm going to quote an excerpt just so you don't cry about the headline:

&gt;Roman Abramovich is expected to make more than £100m available to the Chelsea manager, Carlo Ancelotti, this summer – and Aguero will be at the top of his list of targets. The Argentinian, 21, is also wanted by Manchester United, Manchester City and Internazionale.

&gt; Atlético, who are resigned to losing Aguero in the summer, are poised to start a bidding war featuring Europe's biggest clubs.

This rumour was published in 2010. Did we spend £100m that summer? NOPE. Our biggest signing was Ramires. Did we chase Aguero in 2010? NOPE. But do you know who we did sign? Fernando Torres.

""a currently circulating story or report of uncertain or doubtful truth.""

Holy shit, arguing with you is like talking to a wall. Use your own damn definition correctly before you try and correct me and talk about my understanding.

""a currently circulating story or report of uncertain truth.""

It is not certain until the club or player officially announce it, hence why its still called a rumour. 

&gt; The Guardian has been wrong on several occasions. You're an idiot if you think they're a reliable source. Want an example? HERE. I'm going to quote an excerpt just so you don't cry about the headline:

Now you are calling me an idiot? I never said that The Guardian can't be wrong, hell, no source can never be wrong. Every single source at one point or another has been wrong. But, in comparison with your average tabloids, they have a much more relativity increased reliability rating. If The Dailymail and The Dailystar report something I wouldn't give it a second look, but if The Guardian and other major sources reports it, it at least has a reasonable possibility to be true.

And what hell is this article you are moaning about. I am not going to even delve into arguing too deeply about a 5 year old story that didn't even report anything definitive.

&gt; Roman Abramovich is expected to make more than £100m available to the Chelsea manager

Making funds available to someone doesn't mean you have to spend it dipshit. And again you show your incredible stupidity and lack of understanding of the clubs past.

**We spent £95,800,000 that season** If did not think that is close to what The Guardian reported was available to Ancelotti you are a lunatic.

&gt; and Aguero will be at the top of his list of targets.

And again, they didn't say we were going to fucking sign they guy, they said we were interested in him. Why would you not expect Chelsea to be interested in a very talented young striker that is looking for a transfer?

In the UK, it manifests itself by ignoring vast swathes of the electorate (people who genuinely feel left out of whichever party is large in their constituency are boned) and creating large amounts of ""safe seats"" impossible to lose.

In fact other countries have it even worse. Look at Canada 1993 for a particularly shocking example.

It's been established that the Doctor has multiple time streams in his head (Eccleston and Rose discussed seeing the time streams). Thus if the Doctor says with some certainty someone doesn't exist - he isn't seeing it.

Perhaps Robin Hood, the Sheriff, and the like were somehow selected by the robots as being people who looked like characters from the books they had scanned in their database. They then gave the humans a subliminal mental tweak (like Jackson Lake in the ""Next Doctor"" absorbing information and assuming a new identity. Perhaps the reality of encountering overly powerful robots from another world created that stress - then the robots programmed everyone to play their role).

Thus, with the characters in place, the robots may have found the need to ""follow the story"" to make sure it seemed real.

Of course, none of this was spelled out in the episode.

""a currently circulating story or report of uncertain truth.""
It is not certain until the club or player officially announce it, hence why its still called a rumour.

You conveniently ignored my question. Would you call BBC's rumours uncertain truth?

&gt;Now you are calling me an idiot? I never said that The Guardian can't be wrong, hell, no source can never be wrong. Every single source at one point or another has been wrong. But, in comparison with your average tabloids, they have a much more relativity increased reliability rating. If The Dailymail and The Dailystar report something I wouldn't give it a second look, but if The Guardian and other major sources reports it, it at least has a reasonable possibility to be true.

My God, do you ever stop complaining? Here, Guardian article with Ramires rumour: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-returning-atletico-madrid

&gt; And what hell is this article you are moaning about. I am not going to even delve into arguing too deeply about a 5 year old story that didn't even report anything definitive.

Lol, if my tone suggests that I'm moaning then I'm at a loss for words about yours. What wasn't definitive about that article? That it explicitly stated that Aguero will be at the top of our summer transfer list? That Atletico are going to start a bidding war for him? Stop wasting my time with your nonsense, its starting to get annoying.

&gt;Making funds available to someone doesn't mean you have to spend it dipshit. 

Actually, that's exactly what it means. Again, if you fail to comprehend such plain English you're better off arguing with Kindergarden kids.


&gt; And again you show your incredible stupidity and lack of understanding of the clubs past.
We spent £95,800,000 that season If did not think that is close to what The Guardian reported was available to Ancelotti you are a lunatic.

Hahahaha. That £95.8m included Torres and Luiz deals which took place in the Winter. Moreover, it was widely believed they weren't Ancelotti's signings and that he never asked for Torres. We let go of important squad players like Ballack, Deco, Carvalho and Belletti and replaced them with Ramires and Benayoun in the summer. Carlo was never fully backed that summer or in the Winter and definitely not in the way Roman backed Jose before or how he's backing him now. I think its you who is displaying an incredible lack of knowledge about the club's past. Jesus Christ.

&gt; And again, they didn't say we were going to fucking sign they guy, they said we were interested in him. Why would you not expect Chelsea to be interested in a very talented young striker that is looking for a transfer?

Let me break this down for you: It says Aguero **will** be at the **top of our list of targets.** Which means he was top priority. Since we signed Ramires and fucking Benayoun that summer, then signed Torres for £50m, that hardly shows he was top priority. Once again you fail to understand basic English and continue grasping at straws.

true,PeppersGhostSCP,null,null,"After the Doctor and the gang leave the castle, the camera pans over to reveal the Sheriff's hands reaching up out of the molten gold. The implication is that the Doctor was right all along: Robin, the merry men, the Sheriff, and Marian were all created by the robots as part of their 'historical camouflage'.
 
If you watch the episode from this perspective, a lot of things start to make sense. 

* Toward the beginning, it's briefly mentioned that Marian is a newcomer to the area. The man who tries to protect her is not a relative, as he refers to her as his ""ward"". 
* When Clara is trying to extract information from the Sheriff, he goes along with whatever she suggests. There are no robots or spaceships in the Robin Hood legends the Sheriff is programmed to act out, leaving him with a big hole in his memories. He only begins to reveal his history with the robots after Clara supplies the narrative.
*  The Sheriff has a point when he says, ""Why would we create an enemy to fight us? What sense would that make?"" This makes sense, but consider the fact that, until the Doctor interfered, we never actually saw Robin doing anything that would interfere with the robots' plans. If all had gone according to plan, Robin would have won the contest, narrowly evaded capture, and escaped into the forest. It's even possible that this scene was enacted multiple times before the Doctor arrived.
* After Robin's arm is cut, he clutches it very tightly and makes a big deal about not being able to use it. In the following goodbye scene, Robin is wearing an uncut tunic and his arm seems to be completely better. Then, after the Doctor says ""I'm not a hero,"" we get this line for Robin that really clinches it for me:

""Neither am I, but if we both keep pretending to be–ha ha!–perhaps others will be heroes in our name.""

He then shakes the Doctor's hand with his bad arm. The Doctor glances at Robin's arm twice before shaking it.

All right, so that's hardly a smoking gun. But it *fits*. The Doctor directly calls the metal men's spaceship ""like [the Marie Antoinette], but more sophisticated."" Moments later, he points Robin's perfect hair, perfect teeth, and perfect jawline, further emphasizing the comparison. Half Face harvested body parts to suit his needs, and the metal men harvested human parts to build the ""perfect"" Robin Hood. That's why why the hair and blood samples the Doctor took were authentic. The Sheriff briefly corroborates this theory when he briefly alludes to being ""half man, half engine"". 

Half Face became more human as he replaced his robotic parts. Similarly, the Robin and Sheriff gradually became convinced of their false identities and pretty much became their characters. When Robin's arm was slashed, he saw the metal framework underneath and remembered the truth. That's why he sounds so hopeless when he talks about Marian at the end, and why he immediately pulls out her picture after the Doctor leaves: he assumes Marian is just another part of his false memories, unaware that the metal men created an android of her, too.

Okay, maybe I'm grasping at straws here, but that's my head canon and I'm stickin' to it. It fits with the story, explains away some inaccuracies, and justifies the camp so it's good enough for me.

(For those aware of the deleted ""beheading"" scene: the Sheriff was desperately trying to hold on to the illusion of being a real person, creating justification for contradictions as they arose. It's possible that his programmed identity was intermingling with his true memory of events: the spaceship landed on top of an innocent bystander, and they salvaged bits of the body to use in building the Sheriff. That's probably reaching a little bit, but again, this is mostly just my head canon.)",0,1410062214,null,0,false,0,ckbbntu,t3_2fnsw2,t1_ckbbntu,t1_ckazehq,null,1427158170,66,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,66

Sure we had Luis in that role for the last few seasons, but even when he was out, we weren't a shit team like the days when we used to rely overly on Torres and Gerrard. We have adequate replacements for every member of our best starting 11, and that is a welcoming relief after the shallow squads of seasons past.

In saying that though, every good team will have that one player who's considered the Star, and with the departure of Luis, and the decline of Gerrard, the player who looks to be taking up that mantle is Raheem Sterling. Been our best player in the first games of the season, top scorer to date, and made the crucial assist for the winner against Southhampton when it was needed.

He's still very young and I don't want him to put too much pressure on the kid to carry the team on its back, but I'm hoping he's mature enough to handle it and come into the spotlight as the best young player in the premier league. Similar to how Messi took over from Ronaldinho, it'd be a dream come true to see him emulate this for this post-Suarez era. He's got the talent and right mentality to do it, and if it all plays out this appears to be the season where he's poised to finally be a household name.",0,1410063831,null,0,false,0,ckbca1a,t3_2fozl4,t1_ckbca1a,t3_2fozl4,null,1427157882,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

&gt;Why did they have a whole vat of molten gold not doing anything?

Perhaps there was a pipe that we couldn't see connecting it to the engine? Or they were just about to load it into the engine when the prisoner revolt happened.

&gt;Was all that this DAMAGED ALIEN SPACESHIP needed gold? No copper, silicone, components?

...I can't think of a good answer for this one. Maybe they somehow found substitutes for everything else?

&gt;How come they did about 30% of the fixing in about 10 minutes when they had, presumably, been going about this for a while.

It seemed like they were more gathering the materials for a while and almost everything was fixed but just needed some final touches with the gold.

&gt;How come all of those prisoners had stolen gold plates with those laser-robot guards watching them?

I'm pretty sure the prisoners were handling those and were supposed to be dumping them in the vat, so it wouldn't be hard for them to get a hold of one.

&gt;How come a laser-robot's laser, which earlier turned a man to ash, bounced off of the gold plates without melting them?

...ummm...I got nothing. On that note, I doubt leaked radiation would *enhance* plant life and somehow cause the weather to be sunnier.

&gt;How come they couldn't aim around the gold plates?

It did look like a few of them did as some peasants seemed to have died in the revolt, but I suppose that was probably just stray reflected lasers. Perhaps the robots assumed that the gold would be burnt through? Or if you want a cop-out easy answer we could just chalk it up to bad programing.

&gt;Why didn't the Sheriff torture/ actually question Clara when she was brought for questioning?

The Sherriff seemed to genuinely like Clara or at least some of her qualities. He did mention a few times she would have made a good Queen.

&gt;Why did the Sheriff answer Clara's question's during her questioning?

Normal villain gloating with perhaps a bit of wanting to show off to Clara.

&gt;The Sheriff was either a very human-like robot or, if he was human, why didn't the robots replace him?

In the deleted beheading scene he as revealed to be a cyborg as the ship injured him when it crash landed and the robots rebuilt him. I assume they kept him because he blended in better with the local culture and had knowledge that they likely didn't have (their database had general historical knowledge like the legend of Robin Hood, but I doubt it had thinks like ""Joe Schmoe from that village over there has a small stash of gold!"")

However, you still need to learn it because you're only allowed to fail a couple of questions. The British driving test is one of the harshest in the world (Finland is a notable exception).

As some others have already posted, the manner in which your questions are put makes it sound like you're being blasé.  You will fail your theory if you don't buy the books/ DVDs and learn them to the point that you can feel confident of passing practice tests every time. There are interactive DVDs and online practice theory tests if you google them. 

My biggest concern though would be your hazard perception test. The hazard perception test is virtually impossible to pass without considerable practice with practice tests. It's kind of like a videogame... if you're playing Call of Duty, it doesn't matter how well you know how to shoot a gun, or how long you served in the army, until you logged a certain amount of hours playing that game you will get your ass handed to you because you've no experience with the controls.

The hazard perception test requires you to make split second decisions as to when to click to indicate a hazard. It's not entirely intuitive, sometimes something that looks like a hazard isn't, other times something innocuous is. And there's an over-zealous cheat detector that monitors how often you click in case you're just clicking incessantly- unfortunately it catches out a lot of none cheaters who're too nerve-y in their clicking. And you fail the test instantly if even a single time it ""catches"" you ""cheating"", or if you don't click at the right time. It is wildly unfair and you will fail the first few tries unless you do the practice tests.",0,1410064573,null,0,1410064781,0,ckbcjg9,t3_2fmnv8,t1_ckbcjg9,t3_2fmnv8,null,1427157760,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Episode 2: Show that the Doctor has hatred in his hearts and that it is hard for him to change his ways, though still possible.

Episode 3: This episode really showed that he was his own Doctor to me (first episode doesn't count because his personality was still forming).  Without his guilt on him for Gallifrey he doesn't seem like he is repressing himself.

Lukaku was loaned out last year too, if you remember, when Chelsea had three underperforming strikers. Wouldn't he have been good then? For him to be loaned out then signified that they had no intention of keeping him.

I don't want Bony. He's very hot and cold, and he was awful at the World Cup. He was outclassed by Drogba, who I'm sure you would argue is way past his prime too and isn't worth playing. But he was much better than Bony.

Don't forget if we sold Soldado, as I'm sure is your preference, and bought Bony we'd be missing two players for January and maybe February (for the ACON).

Benteke might be good, but again last summer when he was agitating for a move no one big went in for him. If he was that good shouldn't someone in the top half of the table made a move?

These aren't the only strikers out there. I'm confident Adebayor won't be with us past next summer, so we'll need to find a new striker for sure. But I don't want Benteke or Bony - I want a relatively unknown player to come in for a good fee and impress. For either Bony or Benteke we're looking at 20M+.

(Possible spoilers)

I base this on a couple of things: 

1- as stated before- all available evidence to this point shows us that she is in control of a tardis.  The saving of the soldier from Deep Breath is so similar to the Doctor's saving of Journey Blue that they might as well have her in a Chameleon Circuit failed Police Box.

2- the use of a Dinosaur in Deep Breath and her snarl and gasp shows us a bit unbalanced of a person who is very sake yet very primal.  The Rani investigated Dinosaurs extensively.  Nice nod that could build a fun thing to the reveal of who she is later.

3- so far she actually hasn't shown the Doctor any Ill will.  She brought him and Clara together.  She may have even escaped from the stasis cube in the 50th anniversary (when the three doctor's came out of the painting). 

Clara who saved the Doctors existence, means it is a weird thing to posit someone as a mortal enemy by helping save him and when the two are ready to part bring them back together.  She needs the Doctor alive.

4- Her relationship with the Cyber Men will obviously wait until the final, but would a Time Lord who became a lunatic because of her research not be the best fit with Cybermen who are lunatics 
always seeking to upgrade people?  

Finally, would it not also make sense that (from what I know of the Rani) that all of her research leads to the creation of Heaven?

true,Hirshologist,flair8,,"Soldado had nothing positive last year except maybe one assist or one goal all together.  IMO, he actually had his best performances under Sherwood when he was played with two strikers.  I hope your right, but your dreaming man.  Objectively speaking, he's a bust and that probably won't change.  He's effectively played his way down to third choice striker. 

Yes Lukaku was loaned out last year and it was a huge mistake by Chelsea.  Mourinho admitted in a Mourinho way by claiming that Lukaku forced the loan move because he wanted guaranteed first team action.  Had Mou not fucked up, Chelsea probably would have won the title. 

Bony did not have an awful world Cup by any means.  He scored two goals.  I saw every ivory coast match.   He was not ""outclassed"" by Drogba (whose a great player btw even at his age).  Sure ACON hurts, but that's only a couple of games.  For the rest of the games, he'd improve our team tremendously.  And I'm not saying we have to sell Soldado btw.  I just don't see the point in not signing a new striker based on blind faith that Soldado will get better. 

Benteke hasn't been moved because of his injury.  No one is going to pay the money Aston Villa wants because of it and Aston Villa has no incentive to sell him if they can't get full value. 


&gt; I want a relatively unknown player to come in for a good fee and impress. 

Huh?!?!?!   That makes zero sense to me.   

Your logic is odd man.  You should stop trying to look at wierd tangential ways to rate players and actually just look at how they played on the field.   We'd be lucky to sign strikers the quality of Benteke or Bony, and I guarantee you will love them to.

1- after two weeks of Confused Doctor and dark mood Doctor, this episode was badly needed for some levity.  I watched ""Into the Dalek"" before this.  I felt like the Doctor is a good Dalek is one of the darkest places the show can go to.   What that means is that the Doctor could destroy universes far better than a normal Dalek could.  Pretty dark.  

2- Why didn't Missy save the Sheriff? If she really meant Ill will to the Doctor, saving the Sheriff would have certainly helped.

3- The Doctor isn't a hero.  But if he pretends to be then maybe one day he can be and more important he can inspire others.  One of the themes of the new Who is that the Doctor is at his best when he inspires others to be amazing.  This Doctor isn't inspiring others, in fact he is down right distrustful and nasty.  But that isn't the Doctor.  That isn't a good man.  If this Doctor wants to be a good man and live up to his title of Doctor he will have to remember how to inspire others.

He way under-estimates just how loathed he is by the Liberal majority across Britain. The Scots hate Cameron, but it was Clegg who put Cameron in power.

true,thousandfaced,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"As a working class non-nationalist student from Glasgow I definitely agree that we share more in common than not. However, I'm voting yes in the referendum for exactly the reason you have said you would also.

I believe there is a fundamental lack of representation at Westminster that ensures political apathy for the vast majority of people in this country. For the last few weeks here in Glasgow this apathy has been notably absent from my life. People are talking about politics absolutely everywhere, across all walks of society and on nearly every issue. Democracy hasn't suddenly appeared overnight though. We just didn't talk politics because there was seemingly no chance to vote for a Westminster party that would actually represent you. The old adage was, ""Whoever I vote for, the government always gets in"". I think that's because of the electoral system at Westminster.

First past the post inevitably leads to a de facto two-party system where only the most centrist of voters decide the election and the course of the country. Considering voting for a third party that may better represent you? Well you've simply guaranteed that the party you like least has a better chance of winning. [Watch CGPGrey explain the inadequacies of FPTP here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).

What's the point of voting for the party that represents you in the election if you don't stand a chance of winning or even being represented? What's the point of engaging in democracy at all? To not participate in a system that offers no realistic prospect of representation is a totally logical decision on the individual level. 

For ages, the only alternative option has been to participate in the gargantuan task of shifting the range of acceptable political positions in our society [(the Overton window)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window). However, what working class person has the time to do that when they are already working twelve hour shifts to pay the rent that’s already going up? It's my belief that such an individual simply does not have the time or energy to discern the right (and often nuanced and complex) view on the whole range of issues. Get involved in politics? You must be joking! How can anyone in such circumstances be expected to know that the simplistic solutions offered by a right wing media - that demonizes immigrants and benefit claimants - is wrong when you don't have time or energy to even begin to scrutinize their claims? 

Why not vote for the party that promises to get rid of the Other? ""You work hard and you are from here. It's only right that you should get more. You deserve better!"" For me, therein lies the appeal of UKIP and a particular faction within the SNP. With the Other being Europe and the rest of the UK respectively (of course thankfully plenty of working class people outright reject this kind of rubbish). Regardless, I understand how seductive and disgustingly effective it can be to employ the scapegoat tactic to get what you want. However, as mentioned I'm still voting yes in the referendum. 

**Why?**

The Scottish Parliament uses a proportional electoral system meaning that I can vote for whatever party I agree with most without any negatives. [(CGPGrey again on Mixed Member Proportional Representation here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0I-sdoSXU) Consequently I, and most Scots like me, actually feel represented by our Parliament. We can make an informed choice and actually expect to get exactly what we vote for. It is a brilliantly successful example of democracy in action.

Since its inception Scots have abolished tuition fees and prescription costs, given free bus travel to pensioners and protected the most vulnerable from austerity measures such as the bedroom tax. Additionally, all of this has been fully funded from Scottish taxes that we send to Westminster and receive back in the form of the block grant. There is no handout from a central government paying for this. We get these benefits simply because the parties we vote for implement these policies and our taxes pay for them.

However, these policies should have been implemented across the whole of the UK. Instead the Tory-lite Labour Party has imposed tuition fees on non-Scottish students, launched an illegal war in Iraq and presided over the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Old Labour party died in vain simply to become electable after a decade of Tory-led privatisation and right wing drift among the UK electorate. Now the Tories are back in government with one MP in Scotland, tax cuts for the wealthy and an austerity plan that hurts the most vulnerable across the UK.

At the last UK election I supported the Lib Dems in order to provoke some kind of (ideally proportional) voting system reform. Instead I got a Tory-led coalition and an easily defeated AV referendum. Now with UKIP waiting in the wings before the next election, I don't want to leave the EU. I don't want to have the NHS privatised. I don't want to be involved in any more foreign wars and I don't want to have nuclear weapons stationed a couple of miles away from my home city. But as a voter in an ultra-safe seat the voting system means I don’t have any real say in that. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak47StR76XQ]

With no prospect of electoral reform, I (and many Scots like me) have a chance in two weeks to support the nationalists for one time only. In doing so we can end Tory government in Scotland forever, protect our government services against privatisation, vote for a party in future beyond the narrow London-centric selection offered that currently dominate Westminster and inspire a better way of doing things for the rest of the UK that we leave behind. 

However, whatever happens in the next two weeks, I hope this generation of Scottish voters remain as engaged in political life as they are today.

&gt;

&gt;The __Wilhelm scream__ is a film and television [stock sound effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_sound_effect) that has been used in more than 200 movies, beginning in 1951 for the film *[Distant Drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_Drums)*.  The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion.

&gt;Most likely voiced by actor and singer [Sheb Wooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheb_Wooley), the sound is named after Private Wilhelm, a character in *[The Charge at Feather River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charge_at_Feather_River)*, a 1953 [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre\)) in which the character gets shot with an arrow. This was its first use from the [Warner Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.) stock sound library, although *The Charge at Feather River* is believed to have been the third movie to use the effect. 

&gt;The effect gained new popularity (its use often becoming an [in-joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-joke)) after it was used in *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars)*, the *[Indiana Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones)* series, [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company) cartoons and many other blockbuster films as well as many television programs and video games.

I think most of us agree the Doctor should always remain a british dude - I just think that's who he is. But there's no reason why he needs to hang out with british people. 

Canadian would be a good choice, because A) Scots and Canadians have historically gotten on quite well, and B) as the American audience of Doctor Who continues to grow, it might be neat to have a ""not-quite british, not-quite american"" companion, both within the fiction, and as a nod to the newer audience.

My current theory is that Missy - whoever she is - is collecting those souls who have willfully sacrificed themselves for the survival of others, and is planning to use them in one final mass-sacrifice or suicide mission to save... something.

The amount spent by individuals on healthcare would go up but the public expenditure by the government may well go down.

The NHS reforms mean that foundation trusts are now free to raise up to 49% of their revenue from private sources (up from around 2%).

In the short term that simply means the hospital offering you the opportunity to ""go private"" and the government footing the bill.

---

&gt;

&gt;In England and Wales, an __individual voluntary arrangement__ (IVA) is a formal alternative for individuals wishing to avoid [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_England_and_Wales).

&gt;The IVA was established by and is governed by Part VIII of the [Insolvency Act 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_Act_1986) and constitutes a formal repayment proposal presented to a debtor's creditors via an [insolvency practitioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_practitioner). Usually (but not necessarily), the IVA comprises only the claims of unsecured creditors, leaving the rights of secured creditors largely unchanged. Insolvency practitioners charge initial and ongoing fees that are in addition to the debt.

&gt;An IVA is a [contractual arrangement with creditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_creditors) and can be as flexible as an individual's own circumstances (providing the individual can comfortably afford £100 per month, every month); they can therefore be based on capital, income, third party payments or a combination of these.

Remember, in 8.02, the Doctor winds up on a ship piloted by human soldiers, and their commands tell them that nobody leaves alive. How is that different from being a robot? 

Although he did apparently manage to get them to let him leave long enough to bring Clara back without any fears that he wouldn't return. That's a hidden flashback to the Doctor's persuasive ability in episode one where he convinced a robot to go against its programming and kill itself. 

Remember the bit where the Doctor says that one of them lied about their programming? The Doctor lied (""I'm programmed to not kill"") because the Doctor lies. However... he proceeds to not kill by convincing the robot to kill itself, contrary to its programming. He does the same thing in episode two. He doesn't kill the soldier, but only because he convinces her to kill herself for him. 

And, in this episode, he doesn't kill because he gets Robin Hood to do it for him, by firing the golden arrow into the fleeing space ship. And, to cap that off, he rewards somebody he considers to not be real with that not-real person's ultimate desire, Maid Marian. 

I think that this episode, in retrospect, is going to be a gigantic turning point for the Doctor's character; the instant when he begins to become aware of what he has to do, and why he chose this particular face.

I have a feeling now that this entire series arc is going to be about the Doctor rediscovering his connection to humanity and, therefore, his love for humans, something he lost during the whole tangle at the end of the last series, when Ten and Eleven got wrapped up in the fate of Gallifrey and the War Doctor's attempts to destroy everything.

With the limited info that you've give, here are some suggestions:

Can you cut other costs? 

Can you cancel the phone contract? 

Can you return the DFS furniture for a refund?

Can you return the Littlewoods goods purchased? If not, tell Littlewoods that you'll pay the debt, and ask them not to charge you debt collection fees, or you're just throwing more money away.

If you're paying council tax, have you considered this? http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/council-tax-bands-change

Do you have a PPI product you can reclaim? Google it if you're not sure.

For your gas/electricity bills, have you tried switching supplier? The longer it's been since your last switch, the more you are likely to be overpaying by.

For your internet/phone bills, have you tried negotiating the price? Sometimes the retentions team can offer big discounts to keep you as a customer. I pay £8pcm for all the minutes/texts/data I can use.

For your personal finances, switch your current account to Halifax bank and get £100 cash, plus £5 per month. That's £200 cash plus £10pcm free money if you and your partner both do it. Open another account elsewhere and switch to First Direct, for another £100 each. Get another £50 each if you leave First Direct a few months later. http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts

For any home items that you need, try Freecycle for free furniture and other stuff.

You (and your partner) need to make some lifestyle changes. You are buying phones that you can't afford, and paying way too much for them. You are buying furniture that you can't afford, because you think you 'need' it. No more buying things on credit, unless it's interest free.

The point is in most of these stories a character, or representation of one, talks of a version of what we would call Heaven.

Also, one thing to note, only Missy refers to it as Heaven. Everyone who seems to be getting to this place refers to it as 'The Promised Land', but when they get their she refers to it as Heaven or paradise.

With what seems to be a strange theme in the last couple of episodes being that of faith and believing in something/someone that seems impossible to be real, I feel those themes will recur every episode.

My MBP was one of the core duo ones (silver keys), I think it was intel but ""pre facelift"", I.e before the screen had a black bevel around it. Anyway, the slightly longer version of the story is that this was around the time when they were having major, major issues with the onboard NVIDA GPU chipset (I.e faulty batches that would become slightly / completely desoldered  from the logicboard). The consequence being that you could boot up but with no display, I verified this because I could use another mac to boot from via FireWire, but had no video graphics on the internal or external screen. 

There was a recall scheme at the time, but this was kinda irrelevant as I was covered under apple care. Anyway, they completely replaced the logicboard and it was working, except there was a dint in the lid, I'm not normally precious, but this was a £2k computer. So it went back, then returned but some of the keys weren't working. By now I was losing my patience because there was a two week turn around in each instance. Each time I had to ensure I was around for a courier etc. Also when on the phone with them they could never give an actual return date only an estimated one. 

So I just thought fuck it, I'm gonna take them to court. Like I would do if a builder had done a shit job fixing my roof, I didn't care that it was apple. So I searched companies house and got their list of appointed directors (for their UK arm). I then filled out a claim on the money claim site and put down the UK company secretary as the point of contact. 

I then got a phone call from their UK OP's director, A friendly Irish guy.  He said sorry and said that a brand new MBP would be sent to me with extended apple care, and that I could of course keep my MacBook Pro with sticky keys. There was a caveat that, I must of course cancel the money claim, and also sign a NDA. Well I got the MacBook Pro and the extended apple care, but nothing to sign! So here I am telling you all about it!

Picking up on your point, I suppose it was a bit sad, but this was a little bit before all those genius bars and such so I was only interacting with people on the phone, so it was just corporate sounding apologies. They were also trying to keep a lid on the NVIDA stuff (which was my original fault), so it was an extremely easy solution to just send me a new one. They probably have a massive slush fund budget for sorting this kind of shit out. 

I got the last laugh, I stripped my old MacBook pro down, cleaned the keys with mentholated spirit, let it dry and the keys worked fine. Sold it for about £1200.

Probably not.  Your right.  Your list of faults could be longer and more depressing by going into detail, but on the whole - Yup the UK is a profoundly depressing place to live.

The UK is better than some places, but on the whole its going down hill and has been, one way or another, since the '80s.  Unfortunately, the deterioration seems to be speeding up at an exponential rate at the moment, as though those at the top of the pile are feathering their personal nests as faster than ever insulate them from the enviable crash.  The country is being systematic asset stripped.  

The most depressing aspect of this will what my children inherit if they chose to stay here.  Thankfully, I got to spend the majority of my life living in other countries.

* UKIP are much more reasonable than the press let on. They're not going to get us into any illegal wars or do any nasty stuff. They've got a few swivel-eyed councillors and want some caps on immigration. 
* We have given up our civil liberties, voluntarily. This is really quite bad. At least we're doing a good job of keeping our police unarmed and accountable; that's where the rubber meets the road.
* Housing and land-ownership is our biggest economic issue, but the real impact is that it eliminates meritocracy and transfers wealth to a lucky few (the old homeowners, the right-to-buyers, and the aristocracy). But we all **know** it's a massive issue, so we're on the right path towards doing something about it. (The right path, by the way, is Land Value Taxation.)
* The left/centre/right political spectrum is meaningless. Don't fret over it.
* Voters will vote out the current regime when they do something that has an obvious negative impact (e.g. a poll tax). That's just democracy, the least worst political system.
* An unequal society is not bad. An unfair society is. Our society is a moderately fair. It's not going to get any fairer any time soon, as the current political momentum is towards more random interference with people's freedoms.
* We are not in international decline. The massive amount of foreign money being invested in our housing should show you that. Why does everyone with a bit of money want bricks and mortar on this soggy island? Because they know it's only going to get more valuable.
* Youth unemployment is an effect of the massive government interference, which is an effect of democracy. It will get a bit better during the next boom. Not much to be happy about here.
* Corporate lobbyists in this country can't do much. They can whisper in the ears of our politicians, but they can't really buy them. It's not like the States.
* Electoral reform will happen. Probably the next time there's a coalition government. Vote for more 3rd parties.
* Our infrastructure is _old_. Because we have a history of great infrastructure. And that history will continue, slowly.
* London's dominance is a result of London's ability to bring massive amounts of money in through selling professional services. Good on London.
* Our education system is fantastic. You're ability to complain about it is proof that it works. I bet you have lots of good ideas about how to improve education, and I bet you have very little privilege. Imagine a country where Joe Bloggs is able to intelligently critique a nation-wide social service - that's the country you live in.
* Key services are being reorganised to better suit our needs. If you see an act of corruption during privatisation, call it out. We don't have infinite money to spend on the things you consider most important. We are OK at budgeting. We'll probably get better.
* Quality of life should have nothing do to with work intensity. When I go to the gym I lift until I'm half-dead. I don't expect anyone to pay me for it, because I'm not providing anyone else with a service they need. When I go to work I sit in a chair and play around with excel spreadsheets and clients rave about how quick I am and throw money at my company.

Remaining calm and polite is a theme that's been repeated several times for a very good reason: as soon as you lose your temper, you suddenly become subject to another set of policies for dealing with abusive customers - and they never expect anyone on the shop floor to deal with abusive customers, they'd far rather throw you out of the store and let you have it out with head office.

*Dangerous*? How? why? They are raising a important point, one which needs to be addressed. All politicians have been in bed with Murdouch, nothing new.

&gt;we've given up our civil liberties; no one cares because TV spy dramas have convinced us our police and intelligence forces are all good guys

Not sure where to start on this one. Yes their needs to be a debate about privacy and security but to assert that none of this is needed is a touch Alex Jones.


&gt;housing is in crisis no one is doing anything about it

It is you are right, steps are being taken but it is the red tape that slows things down, especially in London and the south east where new homes are most needed. 


&gt;the left are perpetually on the back foot and forced to try and reclaim the centre

I would argue from an outside perspective, certainly from a US  one , that we are more left wing than right as a nation despite who is in power.


&gt;voters have decided that politicians are 'all the same' and that's enabling dangerous populists like UKIP to succeed

Most politicians are the same, I am not so sure that is too much of a bad thing, I would rather they agree on big issues so that we can be progressive and take action than have a US style shutdown due to politics.  *dangerous populists like UKIP to succeed* again with this, confused, the EU needs to be perhaps scared as it needs reform.


&gt;our society is horrendously unequal

Again this is not something just the UK suffers from, it is global it is capitalism and yes it is wrong. Most measures of this put the UK mid table similar to Australia and New Zealand and better than Ireland but worse than Belgium. So the UK actually does quite well, better than most of Europe once you factor in tax exchanges.


&gt;we seem to be in international decline


Correct we are. However its *relative decline* due to the rise of developing nations. Nothing to worry too much about because the UK is big and has immense soft power beyond its economic means, but an Independent Scotland, that another matter. The future and relative decline will mean nations such as Scotland fall off the map in almost all sense of the word.


&gt;youth unemployment is still massive, but those affected are being squeezed harder than ever

We had a huge economic crash not so long ago, its can be hard to remember how bad that was, many economist state even now that we were on the edge of a second depression, like the 1920s one that took 40% of the US economy and lead to huge unemployment levels. [UK Youth unemployment is about 18% putting it as the 10th lowest in Europe] (http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/) better than Sweden, Ireland and many others. Always try to ground such figures in context.



&gt;our government is full of corporate lobbyists, perverting our democracy

Nope thats the US, we have our issues but this is not a big one.



&gt;electoral reform will apparently never happen


I hope it will but I think we are going to have to wait a long time.


&gt;our infrastructure is shit

You mean other than the largest infrastructure [project in Europe 'crossrail'](http://www.crossrail.co.uk/), [Edinburgh's new trams](http://edinburghtrams.com/), [Birmingham new train station and metro](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/new-40million-metro-trams-arrive-7727186) and not to forget HS2. 


&gt;London's dominance is out of control


London makes up about 25% of the Uk's economy        
Paris makes up about  25% of France's economy    
Moscow makes up about 25% of Russia's economy    
Rotterdam makes up about 37% of the  Netherlands economy    
Tokyo makes up about 25% of Japans economy
**Seoul make up 58% of South Koreas economy, they have reason to complain!!!!!!!!!, you don't**    
Mega cities are part of modern society!  


&gt;our education system is leaving our kids without any skills

Education is a big issues, but keep in mind that we need to become a strong knowledge society over this century as many low skilled jobs will start disappearing. 


&gt;our NHS and key services are being privatised in stealth, and the replacements are inefficient, profit-driven, low quality and contracted out unfairly.


*inefficient, profit-driven,* Strange those two words seem at odds, a private profit making business that is inefficient. Private business is not all scary, we risk becoming as adverse to it as the US are to State health care. We need to accept that sometimes private companies do a better job.


&gt;Is there any good news?

Our parents could all afford houses on pretty much any job, my dad was a burglar alarm salesman for god sake and he bought a house at 19 already having two children. Myself and my gf are childless graduates with graduate positions, me a teacher, her at pfizer. We could never afford a house any time soon and we are 26!!

Worse than that the baby boomers are in huge proportions buying up second properties and renting them out to the young. They are literally suckling the finances of the youth as their retirement plans.

I don't hate them or blame them, do you hate a Lion for killing a deer? They can't be blamed for being born and taking the opportunities given to them and the over population that came with them, in fact they have done much to solve it by having less children. Unfortunately there has to be rough times as we go through the shock wave of population bubble hitting retirement. I also don't mind it being this way, I would take the technology we have over houses and other property any day.

##BHAs

So I tried these first to deal with my closed comedones and help lighten some PIH. I've only used two, one by **Boots** and one by Neutrogena. I've found the **Neutrogena** works best for me. They both contain alcohol, but my skin doesn't seem to mind that one bit.


##AHAs

Then I read that AHAs were better for CCs and they are! So far my skin is happier with both of these in tandem. My first AHA was the **Nip+Fab Glycolic pads**, which I love. But the glycerin and hydroluronic acid combo in them made my skin a little too heavy (even at night) so I discontinued use. I really liked it though, the pads were very convenient! I'm currently using a lactic acid toner from **Eucerin**, and my skin is really in love with it. 


When I'm too tired to do wait times or pressed for time I use Avene Cleanance K as it's a combo AHA/BHA. I don't use it every day because it's a gel-cream and prefer toners. But it has its uses!


##LHAs

I also use an LHA in my night cream.

It's perhaps philosophical, but it's also valid concern. Those Nightingales also migrate to Africa, hence less habitat here reduces their numbers beyond our national boundaries also where they're likely under further threat.

I know I won't get much of hearing on here because of how left-wing this sub is, but hear me out. There's such a double standard about UKIP. Approximately half the UK wants to leave the EU, and three quarters want to strongly reduce immigration. These are perfectly legitimate positions for a party to campaign on, and they are opinions currently unrepresented by the three establishment parties. 

Yes, there are a handful of people with questionable views that have associated with them, but that's inevitable in any insurgent movement, and the vast majority of them get kicked out of the party when they cause an offence. In fact UKIP is the only party that bans all former National Front and BNP members from joining. The difference is the mainstream media latches on to every comment from any random UKIP supporters/low level council candidate, while ignoring similar things from the establishment parties. And often misquoting them to make it seem worse too.

true,Melberger,null,null,"I don't agree. When our defence was strongest under Mancini is when he showed his best form.

We play a higher line under Pellegrini, and it means Joe's got a lot more decision making to do - one of the biggest weaknesses.

His shot stopping was his biggest strength, and now it's fairly average. Every single other aspect of his game is weak.

With the high line we play, our GK is often required to act somewhat as a sweeper, coming out and intercepting long balls, receiving the ball to feet and keeping our game ticking over by playing it quickly. Keepers that do this very well are the likes of Lloris and Neuer.

These are all things Joe is very poor at. So once you take out the shot stopping, he literally offers us nothing we couldn't get from an utterly bog standard keeper.

I think that's why we brought in Caballero. He's a fairly strong keeper, not a world class one, but a solid one. But importantly, he's suited to playing with the demands of a team playing a high line.

That's a core aspect of what we need from a keeper nowadays, more often than not they won't have much to do, as we're better than 9 out of 10 teams we usually play. They'll just have to keep the ball ticking over, and provide a reliable presence at the back. And on the rare occasion they're tested by a shot, they'll have to have kept their concentration - another thing Joe is very poor at.

I genuinely don't think Joe makes the grade here anymore.

I think it's a priority that we go in for a top draw goalkeeper with these qualities next summer, Caballero will do in the meantime.

Ultimately I think Joe's time is up, much like we saw with Micah. The only thing that's seeing us persevere with him is sentimentality and his homegrown status.

&gt;The right path, by the way, is Land Value Taxation

I don't see this happening any time soon. Too many vested interests are at stake. We can't even add higher council tax bands at the moment.

&gt;Key services are being reorganised to better suit our needs. If you see an act of corruption during privatisation, call it out. We don't have infinite money to spend on the things you consider most important. We are OK at budgeting. We'll probably get better.

Most privatisation is indirectly corrupt. It's not that CEOs send politicians a brown envelope stuffed with £50s. It's more that well connected companies who donate to the right parties get to influence the legislation, and then get to bid for the contracts. 

NHS privatisation won't let us choose between the nice shiny BUPA hospital in your town and the Nuffield down the road. A small cartel of well connected suppliers will bid for contracts and then try to maximise profits by cutting the service to the bone. 

The government have tacitly acknowledged this by talking about awarding more contacts to SMEs and co-operatives, but of course none of this has happened. 

If we can't do privatisation properly (and by and large in the UK we can't) then we shouldn't do it at all.

The businesses themselves are profit-driven but that doesn't mean they're efficiently delivering value for the customer. My experiences working in a company that contracted to the public sector was that most major tenders get snapped up by a few big 'service providers' who would then deliver through a pretty homogeneous pool of subcontractors. Money was being saved between the service providers and the subs (typically in parts of the supply chain which had little oversight from the customer), but not between the local authorities and the service providers.

We've privatized a large portion of our adult social care, rail services, energy, and a lot of periphery health services. Why hasn't the magic of capitalism and free market competition improved them? Why are my gas bills getting 10% higher despite neither costs nor service improving by 10% in turn?

true,Atrixer,eng-Eastanglia,Norwich &amp; Hull,"Thanks for sharing your opinion. There is just a few points I'd like to talk about:

A new voting system is only a matter of time in the UK. Our current system is flawed and the more pressure we put on the Government to change it, the faster it will come.

The idea of no student fees and fully free prescriptions was part of devolution. Will an independent Scotland be able to afford this when they are having to pay for everything else, as well as their plans to expand public spending? Most economists are saying no to that. The current student fees are a farce, something I might never have to pay back, and something that barely effects my income when I do. It's the only pre-tax loan repayment available. You could call it invisible debt. 

Yes I agree that those policies should have gone across the whole of the UK, i'm generally a center left leaning voter, but much preferred old Labour and have an avid hate for the Conservative party. I grew up in a region dominated by the Torys, with lots of old, rich and racist people trying to tell me that The Torys would protect British culture. 

I too supported the Lib Dems, and was really pissed when they joined with the Torys for a chance at power. They've had no say in anything, and have to go back on things they say. They have basically been swept under the rug. 

I have to disagree and say that tax breaks for the ultra rich are a good idea. Bear with me here. Would you rather that rich people stay in the country, contribute to society and businesses here, or would you rather they moved abroad for cheaper taxes, and we lose all that money? Tax breaks are an incentive for people to keep their money in the UK. 

It's VERY unlikely we will see NHS privatization, and VERY unlikely we will leave the EU. Those are extreme views from some Torys, and UKIP, whom I feel are only gaining popularity as a way to scare the larger parties into representing our opinions more. 

To your last point, will being independent really end a Tory government forever? My biggest fear for Scotland is that the newly elected governments are worse than the current London based government. As I said before, the Politicians are very similar. The SNP throw more lies and flat out untruths than any party I've seen before, and the only parties I would personally vote for in Scotland are in favor of voting NO. I hope this spurs all people within the UK to be more involved in politics, I hope it kick starts a political revolution across the Isles.

Personally, my dream would be to have London Government that oversees the UK, and a few smaller Governments elsewhere in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with a Devolution Plus style power, similar to US states. That way we could all enjoy the benefits of a Union, but with a real say over our future. With Scotland's referendum, I don't feel they are really getting a say over their future, but instead are simply changing the seat of power from London to Edinburgh, with things staying the same, but slightly worse. 

The thing that worries me the most is that the SNP acts as though Scotland is a super unique country and will be special if it leaves the UK. Yet in reality the most similar country to Scotland is the Republic of Ireland, and we know how that turned out. It's economy is in tatters, it has the lowest youth unemployment in the world, it has high migration problems, it's industry's are still in decline and it's purchasing power is the lowest it's ever been.

I'll say first that I'm an aging Anglophilic Yank who lived in Europe as a kid in the '50s (army brat) and who has made a number of extended visits to Britain, beginning in the '60s. Every few years, I go and spend most of a summer. I like the UK and I like (most) of the folks I've met there. I've acquired a significant number of friends in that time, mostly in London, and I've played host to several of them in return when they've visited the States.

But having said that:

Please don't forget that Scotland was an completely independent nation with its own cultural and political history for many centuries. The only reason Scotland ever became part of the UK was by conquest. There's nothing ""natural"" about it. If the Scots decide they've had enough and they want to be independent again, no one else has any moral say in the matter. You guys in the south will just have to get used to being only ""England"" again. Or you could try to keep them in by force of arms -- again.

The starting salary of a Regular Infantry Soldier is £17,945 after a rigorous selection process and 6 months of gruelling training (and constant training throughout your career).

I'm not convinced this is a good comparison. An infantry soldier on starting salary is at the start of a career which should hopefully see them promoted and obtain pay rises as them become more experienced at a later date.

An MP is not an entry level position- it's fairly near the top of a political career. A more apt comparison would be to a researcher, staffer or intern.

That's not how the betting industry works, they have their own pollsters and statistics experts. I worked for a bookmakers for a while and the in-house mathematicians earned more than our regional manager, they are considered absolutely key to day to day operations. Not just for calculating odds but also finding patterns pointing to fraud or fixing. 

Far more bets have been placed for 'yes' because that's the bet that promises the bigger pay-outs, but the bookies are firmly on the 'no' side because that's what the maths has indicated thus far.

As to this yougov poll; if one poll amongst many is newsworthy it's because it's an outlier. If the other polling companies start showing similar trends in the next week I'll pay attention.

The big question about him was Charlton's dire performance at the start of last season that led to his sacking, however I believe that was as mostly down to the chairman restricting Powell in the transfer market and other behind-the-scenes things that effected the team so hopefully Hoyle will give him the freedom he needs.

I still remember that Powell team that dominated League One and the one straight after this that nearly reached the play-offs in the season we nearly got relegated so Powell certainly knows how to get the best out of teams encouraging attractive football, especially young teams like ours. He seems like a very hands on manager too and he seems to get on with his players very well.

The signing of Hudson is an important one, wouldn't be too surprised if he comes in as the new Captain and Hoyle says he got the ok from Powell on this signing before completing the deal. Hudson is well experienced at the top end of the league so I expect more so than Robins and Grayson there may be a bit more pressure on Powell to get in the top half of the league and move on from there.

I'm not expecting an immediate revolution but I think Powell is certainly a fine appointment for us and I'm feeling quite optimistic about the move. I really want this to be the right move to get this club moving upwards once again.

There's been plenty of silly moments in the past few years, but so far this season the episodes have felt short on story. *Deep Breath* had some great moments - and was quite solid - but the villains weren't memorable, and the dinosaur was criminally underused. *Into the Dalek* felt like a wasted opportunity to get under the shell: 15 minutes of story stretched out to no real gain. *Robot of Sherwood* just seemed... off. Maybe its just that I find Robin Hood almost irredeemably boring, but what was the point of the episode? Despite the best efforts of the actors, it felt like fanfic. (Not bad fanfic, but fanfic nonetheless.)

Two of my favourite episodes (Midnight and Blink) didn't rely on novel settings to tell great stories. In fact, their greatness came about due to production limits. I'm really hoping that we get a bottle episode, or something similar, this year that avoids tropes and just tells a solid story.

Although AVB deserves some credit for playing Bale more centrally, it was hardly a masterstroke.  It was obvious he was the only player in our team capable of affecting the outcome of a match on a regular basis, so it made clear sense to play him there.

You can't really argue that we've ""regressed"" since firing AVB.  Sherwood was never a long term solution, and besides, at least he got the team scoring goals again.  We scored 3 or more goals in nine EPL matches under Sherwood's short reign, compared to eight matches under AVB's entire run, which was a full season more, WITH Bale in the side.

Yes, we could finish seventh this season, and yes, we could lose all those players.  We are in a precarious position, and Poch has a long way to go to prove himself here.

Poch at least has proven himself with two smaller clubs with fewer resources than us.

It shows when people come here asking us if chavs are like white trash, trailer trash* or what our equivalent is to a ghetto and it's hard to answer because we have nothing quite like that it honestly does just sound like a horror story.

I would probably take the piss out of your weight and mix it with being American, that's just banter same with any spelling like color vs colour.

I do straight up think America is in a lot of ways an insanely backwards country and I will assume that any American is going to be backwards in someway and hold backwards views. I would avoid talking about anything that could raise these views because I wouldn't want to upset someone, it's just not needed unless specifically asked in which case I'll be brutally honest with a bit more tact than this post.

It's not a perfect country, nor is any. We've come far from how racism used to be, albeit it's still not as good as many would hope, but we are getting somewhere, managing to get the first black president elected is an achievement at the least, disregarding how good he is politically.

Guns though is still a debated topic, some believe it's a good thing to have guns, some don't. Personally I believe it is a good thing for home defense and hunting. If someone wanted to get a gun to do malicious things with it, they'd get it regardless of legality, because the actions they would proceed to do with it are far worse.

[removed wall of text]

Was just googling, and [this](http://makingthemarrow.com/2013/04/29/at-the-mercy-of-the-nhs/) sort of stuff sounds a lot like what happened to me. It's all 'procedures and processes' and 'wait your turn' for months on end, while your body is biological and will keep dying no matter how patiently you wait and take the fuckups in stride without question like you're 'supposed to'. And if you eventually get even slightly upset and cry (no threats, no violence, just crying) because you feel terrible and are in pain, then you're 'hysterical' and that's 'abusive towards staff'. Wtf?

I have never been treated as badly by doctors as I have on the NHS, many of the doctors and nurses I had in Australia were British so them being British isn't the problem, and I've had misdiagnosis and stuff in Australia and in Norway as well, that is normal, that's part of the process and that's how medicine works, but the mistakes don't drag on for literally years because I can actually see people who listen to me.

I support something like the NHS existing, I'm not against it ideologically. I'm against how the current system functions and treats people in reality, I'm not the only person this affects, I've left the country now so the NHS being improved won't affect me personally anymore, but it's not right that people should have to suffer with this just because they live in the UK, not everyone can leave.

The first story didn't happen, but the second did. And when heterosexual men keep going around sexually assaulting and raping my female friends and putting my lovers in hospital they deserve any retribution they get.

By your logic I would be justified in the first scenario, because you can't expect me to read these stories of heterosexual men raping women and beating gay men and not expect someone to do something about it eventually.

If you are consistent in your logic, then you better watch your back. Because when your group (hetero men) exclusively rape my friends and put my lovers in hospital, you deserve whatever you get.

So when you're walking home alone at night remember that. And if a 6 ft 2 scouser with crazy eyes stops you and asks if you're gay, then my friend, say no. Say no and run. And if you wake up in hospital then don't blame me, blame your group. Because after the sheer quantity of atrocities committed by YOUR group in this country, you deserve whatever you get.

&gt; ( 2/2)Rather than establishing borders, Ed is focused on keeping the UK together
    — Labour Press Team (@labourpress) September 7, 2014

&gt;So, there you have it: **Ed Miliband doesn’t want border guards between Scotland and England because he wants to preserve the 300-year-old Union**.


The point is, the Mail article is saying AFTER an indy Yes vote he'd bring in the border guards (and presumably a big fence, too).

That's also what [he said back in June](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28053031) and [here is what Ed Balls also said](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/ed-balls-border-controls-in-scotland-inevitable-1-3458378) at the same time. They both say border controls will be used if an independent Scotland decides to use a different immigration policy.

Given that it has long been known that Scotland needs immigration {[here's Jim Murphy talking about it back in 2009]
(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5912130/New-rules-encourage-immigrants-to-live-in-Scotland-not-England.html)} and Scotland therefore would need more immigration, it follows that Milliband wants border guards and fences.",0,1410095864,null,0,false,0,ckbjeos,t3_2fo1i7,t1_ckbjeos,t1_ckbj0py,null,1427153335,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Housing is in Crisis but they probably don't want to because rich fucks from overseas can come and drive sports cars at illegal speeds down random streets in posh parts of London. The people who run things most likely benefit from this. 

The problem with the left is that they're seemingly tailoring themselves to the over-humanitarian, spineless simpletons. Trying get that vote from the people who constantly crow about empathy or whatever. 

We've been in international decline for quite some time, I feel. That's what happens when Empires crumble. 

Electoral reform was tries a while ago but they perverted the other options. I remember getting a ten page booklet of utter dross from the council or whatever about the Alternative vote. it was utterly indecipherable. Then there were other people, couple of videos on youtube for isntance, who could break it down simply and easily - and explain why it as better for the people (not the politicians) and also compare it to the vote as it stands and why that doesn't work. 

London definitely needs a competitor but, again, I'm not sure that the people with the money either want to take the risk, or want to set up a competitor in, say, Manchester or wherever. If you concentrate the money in one area it's potentially easier to control it. 

Education gave us skills, but every cunt who was asking for them suddenly turned around and said they weren't good enough, or they were looking for experience, or whatever. And I hope they all fail because of it - if a whole swathe of these people crumble and default and fall into the proverbial sea then I will not bat an eyelash.

Truth is far right and far left are terms that don't really make much sense and the whole right and left spectrum doesn't really work anymore. The most common examples we see are the far right being authoritarian or fascist like Hitler and the far left being socialist or communist in nature basically like Stalin. 

When you think about it though, fascism or authoritarian regimes are not exactly much different to socialist or communist regimes. I mean Hitler's Fascism is effectively Socialism mixed with Nationalism.

Now on to the current parties. Labour and the Conservatives are both Centre right parties who differ very little on each issue, which is hard to believe for most people but it is accurate. I would argue that the Lib Dems would be a centrist party or arguably maybe centre left but none of the big three are remotely socialist or authoritarian or anywhere close to far left or far right. Even UKIP aren't far right but theyre certainly further right than the big three. 

Have a little look at the [Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) and take the quiz it has on there.

&gt;

&gt;__Dry water__, an unusual form of ""powdered liquid"", is a water-air [emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion) in which tiny water droplets, each the size of a grain of sand, are surrounded by a sandy [silica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica) coating.  Dry water actually consists of 95 percent liquid water, but the silica coating prevents the water droplets from combining and turning back into a bulk liquid.  The result is a white powder that looks very similar to table salt.

If Scotland becomes a fucking great country, huge social safety net and great everything as per SNP's promises then I can just move there and join in. 

If it becomes worse then we'll know we're probably on the right route with our centre politics. ",0,1410097908,null,0,false,0,ckbjz6c,t3_2fpfxi,t1_ckbjz6c,t1_ckbgugb,null,1427152821,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Bike riding is good but you'll find pretty quick that oxford isn't that big and you'll see it all. If you want a challenge go up 'Old Rd.' to the top of the hill, the views are good. Less hard is going to and around Port Meadow. It's nice there.

Yes, he was in England before, when he was 20 fucking years old. What so you expect of him exactly? Sorry he didn't score 30 goals. 

Since you're going back to when they were still kids we should look at Suarez's year at Groningen where he scored a paltry 10 goals. LOL what a failure!!! He will never be good!! ",0,1410097925,null,0,false,0,ckbjzct,t3_2fn8wr,t1_ckbjzct,t1_ckbg425,null,1427152817,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2
