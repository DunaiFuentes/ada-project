Godwin: *""The council are now forcing us to use recycling bins... Nazis!""*

Not Godwin: *""The campaign tactics of this party are reminiscent of Nazism.""*

General rule of thumb:

Referring to Nazism during a discussion where the subject is of personal opinion, of little consequence or the political outcome is of no more than inconvenience to your personal being, is usually a Godwin.

Referring to Nazism when discussing political parties that stand on an authoritarian platform and use scapegoat rhetoric as part of their campaign, or the political outcome of a decision will adversely affect a group of people, is usually not a Godwin.

It's annoying, I wish regional releases would go away, I wish the companies would just trust you because I know Plenty of people that buy Music, Games, Movies even if they pirate it they still buy it to support the developer even if its bad. It's just the morally right thing to do.

Pirating has also saved tons of things. For example this game Army Men RTS. If I could I would buy this but I cannot find this game ANYWHERE except on pirating sites because its so old now.


I've also been to the cinema watched a movie came back home downloaded it watched it again then bought it when it comes out in blu-ray for future watching.

Am I still in the wrong? I have paid for it twice and yet I would still end up with a fine or a jail sentence because it's the law?

The law we have currently is open to abuse by the big Giants of the movie world.

I think the UK passed a law actually which allowed you to have backups of MP3's so I hope we will soon transfer that to MP4.


 I fully understand that the law is the law and we should abide by it but some laws are stretched so much that it's almost laughable to jail someone for paying to watch the movie, Then downloading it then buying it when it releases on DVD.

It's like they don't want your money. They want you to either pirate it and get jailed. Or buy it, Wait months/years for it to come out on a DVD Release, Then buy it.

You are just acting foolish now. The **words** group and party mean smiler things in terms of their linguistic meanings.

The **concepts** of a group and a party **within the EU** mean totaly different things. One is elected the other is not for a start.  

Do I need to explain everything I say at this level? 

&gt;But they do NOT need to be part of specific group to be heard. Being in a group means they get extra funding and I think Farage gets to have a seat more to the front (lol).

They do need to be in a group to be heard at the same level as others. They get extra funding AND speaking time during debates. 

&gt;If by any chance, some rich and big EU countries, let's say Germany, France and UK made such group, they would have extra funding and too much power (due to them having most of MEPs), where they could only seek improvements which would be only good for them specifically, giving no chance to other countries to be heard. Also, maybe because to limit the idea of forming a group from specifically one country, even with different parties, so that they would get extra money because they formed a group ""UK-only"".

There is nothing stopping what you describe happening now. Germany France and the UK could form a group (although this is unlikely to happen as it would mean MEPs from all parties in all three countries agreeing to form a group). Then they just need to find 4 independents or MEPs from any other country willing to join them. 

Or they could just form a group with 7 members and do the same thing. The reason it doesn't happen is that parties within each country will never form a group together. 

But all of that is irrelevant, because yo still haven't answered my question. Why is it undemocratic for small groups of nations to form a group if they feel their needs are not being met by the EU?

&gt;You are putting too much power into EU, which doesn't have that power. Don't forget the EU deals mostly with international issues within the EU. For specific countries to deal with their own problems is for their local governments to do that. Seriously, sometimes people misunderstand the EU by sooo much.... but that's what listening to Farage and right wing papers leads to.

The biggest political issue in this country today is immigration, and the reason it is the biggest issue is that we have been unable to deal with it in the way the British public want. Its foolish to say that countries should sort out their own problems, when the biggest issue of the day is one that we cannot sort out because of the EU. 

&gt;Dude, really. When you join a group, you automatically become part of that group. It's not talking about a group of ""white people"", or group of people specifically with English heritage or whatever. It's a political group, which they made/joined and if their members have some totally weird views they usually are not let in - hence Farage himself throwing away some people from his party for that individual's views! So please don't try to defend it using that basis as the same time forgetting about the latter.

As I have explained, there is a difference between a part and a group. Groups are made up of members from parties, and represent their parties views, not the views of the groups. 

For example, the Scottish national party, which wants Scotland to leave the UK, has MEPs in the same group as the UK Green party. Does that mean that the Green party want Scotland to be independent too? Should they be working together if they have conflicting views? 

&gt;But that's exactly what you are missing here. Farage does NOT want to change the EU. He only acts in a way to harm it..... even though it cannot make Britain exit from the EU from within the EU's parliament. If you don't like the group, just quit it, not meddle with it inside. It's highly immoral.

We technically he wants the free market part of the EU without the political union. But I didn't actually say he wanted to change it, he wants the UK out of it as it is. I know that, he knows that and every who voted for UKIP knows that. Millions of UKIP voters help fund the EU, so the EU should be working for them as much as it works for anyone else who has an elected MEP there. 

They vote for UKIP, they want to leave the EU, they want their MEPs doing everything they can to prevent the EU gaining any more power and that is exactly what UKIP are doing.  

&gt;NO! I'm saying (look point above). Farage attacks the EU on nearly everything. They even voted NO for some very decent changes, like saving some animals..... because it was their ""protest vote"". Like they protest voted to show their behind when EU's hymn was played. That's not only immoral but completely pathetic. Just like hooligans shouting and swearing when other group's hymn is played.

UKIP vote no on anything that will give the EU more power on principle. If the EU is voting to have more power to stop poachers UKIP will vote no **because they believe that those powers should go directly to the UK instead**. There is nothing immoral about that. It is a simple concept, the UK should be making these decisions for itself, not the EU. **That is what the people who voted for them want and expect them to do**.

The reason they turn their back on the EU anthem is that they believe it implies the EU is some sort of federalised united states of Europe, as having a national anthem and a flag and an army, as has been suggested, are all things that Countries have, and the EU is not a single country. UKIP belies it is encroaching on the sovereignty of member states, and since it was not something that was ever voted on or agreed by the people of Europe, they oppose it. Turning their backs is the most visible way of showing their opposition. 

&gt; UK needs some form of government in any case, hence being in government and wanting to change it would be pretty normal. Being in government and wanting to totally disassemble it from within would only make sense if that government had serious issues (but that doesn't mean it couldn't be CHANGED, hence making no case for total disassemble). Or if you were an anarchist and didn't want any government at all..... but that would make you hypocritical as you joined a body in which you don't believe.

So what you are saying is that people don't actually need their MEPs. That if they vote for anti EU parties the MEPs should just not turn up because it spoils it for everyone. 

First, that really shows what you think of democracy within the EU. That anyone who disagrees would be silenced. It also shows who really has the power in the EU, since MEPs aren't that important. 

&gt;Hence, they can form a group to be wider heard. 7 countries out of 28 is already a pretty small number but if they can't even get that 7 countries then simply maybe there isn't enough Euroscepticism in Europe??? 

Why does that matter though? Why should the UK have to wait for the rest of the EU to become more euro sceptic before they are able to do anything? There are Eurosceptic parties across all of Europe, more than there are greens or liberal democrat parties, but UKIP dosen't want them in their group. The French national front is one, with 23 MEPs, a similar number to UKIP in the UK. The NF is a far more racist group than UKIP, but France elects them anyway. Shows that UKIP does have morals. There are more than enough Euro sceptic MEPs to form a group, probably the 3rd largest group, with around 100 MEPs.

Piracy has been a massive force driving easier access and more convenient time- and format-shifting options in consumer content. Napster was absolutely the impetus for iTunes. These arguably 'immoral' actions have made the world a better place for everyone by lighting a fire under the asses of the media companies. 

By arguing for their rights you are arguing for their control over the market, implicitly. If piracy steals some control from the content companies and forces them to compete to win it back with better and more convenient prices and services, don't we all win? Isn't this just competition in the distribution channel?

The world isn't as simple as ""oh well, it's illegal, therefore it's wrong"". The world has never worked that way. It's intellectually lazy.

Torrent sites ARE mostly piracy. I know and understand the technical aspects very well that they don't host files etc, but the entire premise of the site is to enable people to easily find pirate content. We can make all sorts of arguments about why piracy shouldn't be illegal, or why the laws are silly, or why music/movie business models are outdated, but right now, downloading and sharing copyrighted stuff *IS* illegal. Therefore it's not unreasonable for the courts to block access to those sites which are breaking the law. Yes, it's unworkable and you can use a VPN or a proxy, but it's not a conspiracy theory. It's just a plain old application of the law.

As for other things, there's a line to be drawn. We have all grown up in a golden age of the internet where it was a separate reality to the real world. But now, in 2014, the internet IS part of the real world. The legislation is just catching up. We wouldn't allow a guy to sell counterfeit goods in a high street shop, or to advertise them openly in a newspaper - so why should having a store selling counterfeits online be any different? We don't tolerate threats or stalking/abuse in the real world, so why should it be tolerated online?

As for Snowden-type documents, again, there's a line. Whistleblowing is one thing. Publicising government wrongdoing is one thing. But leaking locations of secret bases, or breaking confidentiality agreements IS illegal, and it shouldn't be any different if it is done over the internet. If you printed out the files, removed them from the office and handed them to the chinese government, that would be treason. So why is uploading them to wikileaks treated any differently? This very much depends on the content which was leaked, which is why each case is tried individually. In Snowdens case, it seems that he leaked both - public interest stories of government wrongdoing (such as PRISM, breaking open source encryption etc), but also actual confidential intelligence such as our bases in the middle east and our techniques for eavesdropping on enemies. 

All you're seeing is real world standards finally being applied to online (which has been a lawless land until now). I don't believe it is a huge conspiracy theory to clamp down on our freedom.

It seems that you sadly believe the reddit hype. There's no such thing as the tory porn filter.

If you change ISP, or set up a new internet connection, when first setting up your account you will be asked whether you want to allow or filter adult content. You might get an itemised list where you can block categories like porn, gore, sex-based sites, chat sites etc. If you don't want filtering, just hit ""no"" and be on your way.

The whole idea was to provide a very easy way for technologically illiterate people to filter their connections. For example for parents with kids in the house. Setting up a software filter on every single device is difficult with phones, iPads and consoles accessing the internet. Setting up router-level blocks is way too difficult for most people. But an ISP level block is pretty effective. Not foolproof, but it's a reasonable step to make your kids' lives more difficult if they want to access bad stuff.

Why is easier and more convenient access to privately created (and owned) content a good thing? Surely the ideal situation is one in which an entity who creates something has control over the distribution of that content because... it's theirs: they created it. If you write a song and record it and want to sell it for £1,000 per copy surely, in an ideal world, you would have every right to do so and there would be no chance of someone undercutting you by (literally) stealing your product? Surely in an ideal world I would be able to say ""I'm sorry but £1000 is unreasonable, sell it for £1 and then I will buy it"" and you would have that choice: you would have every right to say ""No thanks, I'll stick with £1000."".

I think competition is wonderful, driving innovation is great, but I cannot agree with the argument that it's okay to take content owned by someone else and compete with them on the distribution of that. If you don't like the way that a company is operating then you use a different company: that is my fundamental opposition to the argument that piracy is reasonable competition. You can't compete with someone using their own product you've taken for free, it's categorically wrong. If you don't like that you have to pay £10 for the new Jessie J album with DRM, the alternative isn't taking it anyway: it's listening to different music, music that *doesn't* have the restrictions you don't like.

false,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;The concepts of a group and a party within the EU mean totaly different things. One is elected the other is not for a start.

Of course I know it's different. The consensus remains the same, being part of anything which you join to brings some responsibilities etc, hence saying we joined the group so that we can get money but we don't like people from that group still remains controversial.

&gt;They do need to be in a group to be heard at the same level as others. They get extra funding AND speaking time during debates.

But you seem to be forgetting they can't form such group because there aren't enough of them, hence the issue isn't actually an issue serious enough as otherwise more countries would like to join that group - simple as that. They get enough time to speak for the size of the issue they want to speak about. Also, I really don't think Farage does a lot of voting, speaking and other proper work there.....so he doesn't actually need that time in any case.

&gt;Then they just need to find 4 independents or MEPs from any other country willing to join them

Yet, they haven't found them so haven't formed such group.

&gt;Why is it undemocratic for small groups of nations to form a group if they feel their needs are not being met by the EU?

They are still heard!!! It means giving adequate time to adequate problem. If a group can't find enough members from 7 countries, then it obviously means that groups doesn't have that much important stuff to say on European level.

&gt;The biggest political issue in this country today is immigration, and the reason it is the biggest issue is that we have been unable to deal with it in the way the British public want.

Nope. The biggest issues it with people like Farage, right wing papers and you, who purposely make a problem where there isn't one. The same with the all ""EU is sooo bad"". It's very often completely made up or actual lies or some hypothetical rhetoric.

&gt;As I have explained, there is a difference between a part and a group. Groups are made up of members from parties, and represent their parties views, not the views of the groups.

So you're basically implying the EU's ""groups"" have absolutely no other meaning of shared values or anything, other than having more money and more time to speak in parliament?

&gt;They vote for UKIP, they want to leave the EU, they want their MEPs doing everything they can to prevent the EU gaining any more power and that is exactly what UKIP are doing.

You are missing a point. UKIP's main policy is to quit the EU, not change it, hence people should vote UKIP in national elections..... but the reality stays in a way that UKIP is actually taking majority of votes from Conservatives, who did promise an election..... which can lead in UKIP gaining few MPS while Labour majority, hence having no EU election whatsoever. That's just a completely confusing tactics, which actually shows that UKIP is about the power, not about their policies.

&gt;If the EU is voting to have more power to stop poachers UKIP will vote no because they believe that those powers should go directly to the UK instead. There is nothing immoral about that. It is a simple concept, the UK should be making these decisions for itself, not the EU.

Hence making a whole argument of ""anti"" simply idiotic. If you agree on certain legislature, yet you don't agree to that legislature on international level ""just because"", you are fighting with a nonsense argument. The best they could do would be to abstain, rather than vote NO.

&gt;That is what the people who voted for them want and expect them to do.

Don't take that for granted. People vote for plenty of different reasons. I bet some of them (quite many probably) vote UKIP solely because they don't like black and Muslim people..... as proven by a comment of one UKIP supporter in an article, where he started ""So many Muslim people....that's why I vote UKIP"". Shit.

&gt;The reason they turn their back on the EU anthem is that they believe it implies the EU is some sort of federalised united states of Europe, as having a national anthem and a flag and an army, as has been suggested, are all things that Countries have, and the EU is not a single country

""IMPLIES"". Who says it's a rule you can't have a flag, nor an anthem even if you are not a single country? Who makes those rules? You can have an anthem even at a school's group and make your own flag.... It's not a rule but hey, the UKIP people will always find something that in their view is wrong with the EU.  Their behaviour was disgraceful and I'm surprised none of them flashed their bare ass as they don't like the EU is so much. Do you know what the word ""respect"" means? Even if they don't support it, showing their backs is a complete lack of respect.... even if EU was to imply it wants to be a single country.

&gt;So what you are saying is that people don't actually need their MEPs. That if they vote for anti EU parties the MEPs should just not turn up because it spoils it for everyone.

They should not vote in EU elections at all. If they don't support it, don't vote for it. Instead, vote for your MP..... but guess what, the EU is actually more democratic than UK's FPTP, hence gives some power even to small parties! Oh the irony.

&gt;First, that really shows what you think of democracy within the EU. That anyone who disagrees would be silenced. It also shows who really has the power in the EU, since MEPs aren't that important.

Wrong, wrong and wrong again. Why don't you bother reading what I'm telling you? If you want to change something as in improve etc, then it's all fine. If you don't want to be part of something than.... do NOT be part of it and great start would be to NOT join that group/organisation!!!

&gt;Why does that matter though? Why should the UK have to wait for the rest of the EU to become more euro sceptic before they are able to do anything?

Why do you assume it's a matter of time that people will become more eurosceptic? Maybe it will actually change towards the opposite?

The UK can do something about Euroscepticism. Either quit the EU or change the EU. It doesn't make sense to advocate in the EU, for the UK to quit the EU but you are somehow unable to grasp that concept.

If other Eurosceptics in EU parliament can't form a party or a group than it obviously means they either don't get enough support (meaning the problem isn't as big as they describe it is) or can't even form anything with themselves, showing how chaotic they are.",0,1413986754,null,0,false,0,clgjek1,t3_2jyws6,t1_clgjek1,t1_clgik6j,null,1426406377,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There's another vector too - if the refresh rate was just in the right band to not be obvious, but cause a lot more work for the brain to rebuilt the image.  Causes eyestrain / headaches.

That only applies if you look at the monitor, of course.  The actual frequency band shrinks once you know how to look for it, and is at different places for different people.  Interestingly, blue eyed people tend to have higher frequency resolution than brown eyed (whom tend to have higher spatial resolution), hence need a higher refresh rate.

Annoyingly, high frequency CRT's were expensive, and I needed a very high frequency (120 Hz plus; most people were fine at 78 Hz …); meaning that I had to invest in a seriously expensive CRT, back when I was a poor student.  It's still my primary monitor at home, 15 years later though, so I figure I got my moneys worth…

It's not clear who you mean here.

&gt;The 'you wouldn't want Romanians living next door' comment likely refers to 'travellers',

You can infer that if you want, but if anything that makes ir more, not less, racist. Not all Romanians are Roma (this is what you mean, by the way: Roma is the PC term for people otherwise known as gypsies; 'travellers' usually refers to Irish travellers, a completely different group) and to suggest that they are is prejudiced and inaccurate.

&gt;The 'I don't like being on trains full of foreigners' sentiment is still somewhat relatable too.

Perhaps. I frequently find myself surrounded by people not speaking English and it doesn't much bother me. The particular train scenario has never happened to me, despite the fact that I've lived in London my entire life, and even if it had there'd be no reason to assume the people on the carriage were immigrants. In any case, it's not a sound basis for public policy.

&gt;I'd like to know what you would consider the ceiling to be for population density.

There's no simple answer to that (as you seem to tacitly acknowledge by not suggesting one yourself). However, most of the population growth of the UK is from people being born here, not immigrating here, and most immigration here is not from the EU. Therefore, restricting EU freedom of movement would do very little to mitigate this problem. It's also worth noting that Britain is not that densely populated by global standards, so we can presumably take on more than we have now without succumbing to some sort of disaster.",0,1413987321,null,0,1413988291,0,clgjni1,t3_2jvsuv,t1_clgjni1,t1_clghxbb,null,1426406261,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

I wouldn't call nuts (arguably a worse risk, because they can directly cause death) inherently dangerous because a small percentage of the population are allergic, so why apply the same logic to cannabis?

The carcinogenic thing is because people tend to smoke it. Smoking anything is a cancer risk, burning things in lungs leads to scar tissue, which can lead to cancerous tissues. Combine this with the fact that many users smoke with roaches instead of filters and mix with tobacco, and the cancer risk makes sense.

Barnesy was lethal for us upfront and we were flying high in the early 90s. I've been a lurker here for a long time but never made an account. Even though you all fight and argue, at the end of the day all of you are fellow supporters and it makes me proud to be a part of this sub which is still far ahead of some of the other plastic ones.


As the years have gone past my love for Liverpool has turned into an obsession. Can't miss a match, can't hear negative things about our club and can't sit down with an Evertonian on the same table. We've had our highs and we've had our lows but even though we've been counted out they don't understand the true meaning of YNWA. They don't understand what the 12th man brings and they don't understand that counting us out didn't turn out that well against the previous teams in the CL who did so even if everything seemed set in stone.


Perhaps they are all right. All the stats are the only thing that matters. We are going to lose 10-0 by their calculations but what they don't understand is that we are Liverpool fucking football club and I believe in the club, I believe in the manager and most of all I believe and back the players to show up against all adversity. Even if we have had all these bad games, when the worlds spotlight is shined on you and you get that 90 minutes to do something for every wrong thing that you did previously, you can bet they will play their best game of the season. Even if we end up losing we will go out fighting and we will be able to hold our heads high in the face of all these petty Mancs and Evertonians who aren't in the fucking thing to begin with.


Eagerly awaiting the game. You can call me a romantic, you can call me delousinal, you can call be an utter pillock for all I care but I believe. I believe that we will win or draw tonight. I believe we will get out of this group and I believe that we will make this competition the highlight of our current season.
If I'm wrong I take full blame and responsibility. I have nothing but faith in the lads. Tonights our night and theres no fucking team no matter how good walking over us. We will give them hell whatever the result.

Is this based on this group's years of experience in scheduling Premier League games around the International calendar? The scheduling of games is extremely difficult and should not be dismissed in such a way.

Also, if you would like to see competitive matches played overseas then how do you decide on which matches take place overseas? The premier league is currently structured in such a way where everyone plays each other twice for a total of 38 games. Do you suggest that the premier league adds more games to an already jam packed schedule? 

A possible solution to this is that two teams would play their home and away fixtures abroad. I think this is an awful solution because you are screwing the season ticket holders out of a game and potentially fucking with the integrity of the league. Lets say Arsenal are chosen to play city abroad while Chelsea draw Crystal Palace.

a) I quite like the EU

c) they seem to exploit easy prejudices for popular support; their politics are cheap and insidious; I don't trust them 

d) people always swing for parties like UKIP during economic recession and it usually just makes things worse; I don't trust them 


e) even though I don't particularly feel represented by the other parties I won't vote for UKIP just because I can't relate to the other parties and it seems irresponsible to do that; I trust the other established parties more than them to at least not completely fuck things up 

d) visions of Farage as PM only ever end in catastrophe and embarrassment and I don't think they would generally be very efficient running a government 

e) judging by what their councillors and supporters generally think of gay people id have to be completely devoid of self respect to even consider it at this point 


f) my gut instincts and politics all point to UKIP being a bad idea and not right for me at all 

g) even though they aren't inherently racist, they're often still very bigoted and dishonest and overly hostile and they attract a lot of people who are racist because their policies and politics appeal to racism 

h) their policies don't resonate with me as I don't have a hard on for the military or libertarianism or Christian privilege and various other things, and I'm no expert on economics so couldn't speak on that but they're also pretty anti-science which is a big turn off

false,iomex,eng-devon,Devon,"I was thinking about what you have said today - and my previous thoughts that this situation is the same as people requesting female drivers.

I do think you are right in your last points there - by going along with these requests you set a very uncomfortable precedent. This is something you wouldn't (and don't) get if it were about gender, so I guess I should retire that comparison (in this context anyway).

Whilst I do understand it is important to stand by what you think is right - the taxi business is extremely competitive. There is no money in it, profits are razor thin, and the nature of the business means things happen very quickly and you can literally sink a company in a matter of days by one slip-up. If this happens, we're not talking about making an extra few quid, we're having to fire controllers and default on loans - I'm sure you can appreciate this is something anyone wants to avoid.

The cab company owner does not want to alienate his passengers - his reputation with them is as important to the business as his reputation with the drivers. It is a difficult balancing act sometimes - so I can understand he is taking the approach he is (even if you or I would not do the same ourselves).

The truth is that this happens *all the time*, and all over the country. I work for a small firm which has a Kurdish driver. He went to pick someone up who later kicked off on the phone demanding that we do not send that driver to collect him again. When asked about this, the driver explained that it was a racial issue and he was happy not to go to that customer again as it is 'one less racist in my car'. I don't want a racist in my car either so I don't pick up that bloke. 

I have been on the receiving end on several occasions, too, so I can appreciate viewpoints from both sides. As a young driver (who looks a lot younger than he is), I've had one or two people refuse to get in my car because they don't trust 'young' drivers (I'd class this as ageism). The same has happened to our oldest drivers. I've also had similar occurrences due to gender, but also the other way round in that I was sent to a gay bar on many occasions to pick up passengers as the customers didn't want a straight driver.

I don't think the cab company owner is being intentionally discriminatory. Infact, the BBC [article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-29722225) quotes the boss as saying he accepts requests from passengers whether they want a white driver or an Asian driver. He appears to be trying to cater for everybody, even if their motives appear racist. 

&gt;Mr Campbell said: ""If they ring up and ask for an Asian driver, we will send them one. If they ring up and ask for a 'local' driver we will send them one.

&gt;""We also get people specifically ringing up by name for a driver, and we try and send them as well.""

To me, this story seems a bit desperate and appears to be off the back of the recent abuse scandal.

Yes, we're a net importer of many things. However, we're a net exporter of some of the most lucrative industries (finance, law, consultancy, etc.). 

&gt; I don't see us being able to negotiate on physical goods - there is no incentive for countries to give us a good deal as we have nothing of value to trade...

I don't think you understand how it works. Like with any bartering/trade negotiations, you don't go ""we have apples, you have apples, let's swap apples."" You go ""You have apples, I have pears, I think 1 pear is worth 3 apples"" and then you negotiate. You trade based on what you can offer other countries. We offer them finance, they offer us manufactured goods/food etc. Our goods are far more valuable than theirs. We will get a good deal.

&gt; our influence, which will diminish if we leave the EU.

Not true. If that was true then why are FIFA, CERN, the UN (European HQ), IBO, ILO, WHO, WEF and several other huge organisations based in Switzerland? We're stifled by the EU. We can't go out and make our own trade deals with China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Turkey and other up-and-coming nations. We have to sit and wait until the EU decides to do it for us. And even then, it will be for the benefit of Germany and France (which are net-exporters of manufacturing goods), not the UK.

&gt; Yes, driving down prices on developing countries that are already scraping the bottom of the barrel will certainly help their economies grow and their people get out of poverty.

You completely misunderstood what I said. Prices in developing countries are cheaper because labour is cheaper. By buying their goods (thanks to independent free trade agreements making it financially viable for companies), we will be helping boost their economy. There will also likely be an increase in FDI due to the free trade agreements. Our withdrawing from the EU and seeking new trade partners will only ever be a good thing for developing economies.

&gt; The other thing about influence, it tends to have the opposite effect on those who choose to be loners. It's almost as if, to become influential, you need to be part of a group, club, movement or... union... or commonwealth... in which there are other members to influence.

I think you don't quite understand why we're so influential. We have the 6th largest GDP in the world. We are one of the G6, G7, G8, permanent member of the UN Security Council and NATO. We **are** a highly powerful, highly influential nation. We don't need that power diminished by being represented by a faceless EU Bureaucrat. We don't need to be a part of the EU to be in those groups and have that influence. The US aren't in a commonwealth or conglomerate of vastly different nations, are they not influential? Other countries and people respect the UK. We will have absolutely no problem negotiating trade agreements with any country in the world.

It has the added perk of protecting them from what economic journalism in particular suffers from: the authors of controversial material being criticised rather than their subject matter. If one of their authors was seen to regularly contribute the most libertarian-leaning pieces, any criticism or expectation of the author would inevitably carry over to any articles they wrote. It's easier to dismiss an article written by an author with a known bias.

Also, I really don't think Farage does a lot of voting, speaking and other proper work there.....so he doesn't actually need that time in any case.


As I have already said, the issue of Euroscepticism is large enough to form a group, around 100 MEPs from almost all member states, its just that Farage doesn't want many of them to join because UKIP has principles and integrity. It is incredibly undemocratic to say that just because they are not in one party, they should not be given the chance to speak about the issue as much as any other important EU issue.

&gt;Then they just need to find 4 independents or MEPs from any other country willing to join them
&gt;Yet, they haven't found them so haven't formed such group.

What? No, the reason Germany France and the UK haven formed one group is that there is no political appetite to do so. You are confusing yourself, you came up with an example and now your are thinking about it as if it was a reality. 

&gt;Nope. The biggest issues it with people like Farage, right wing papers and you, who purposely make a problem where there isn't one. The same with the all ""EU is sooo bad"". It's very often completely made up or actual lies or some hypothetical rhetoric.

Yeah, the millions of people who are concerned about immigration are only that way because they are too stupid to think for themselves. The reason Euroscepticism is a growing force is that people like you would rather insult and put down people with genuine concerns than actually have a discussion and come to a comprises on the issue. 

&gt;So you're basically implying the EU's ""groups"" have absolutely no other meaning of shared values or anything, other than having more money and more time to speak in parliament?

Getting time to speak in parliament is THE goal of any MEP, party or group. 

And I notice you didn't comment on my question about the Greens and SNP being in the same group. Its very telling which questions you choose to not answer. 

&gt;You are missing a point. UKIP's main policy is to quit the EU, not change it, hence people should vote UKIP in national elections..... 

You have just gone on and on about how if Euroscepticism was a big deal their would be more MEPs wanting to join Farages group, now you are saying that Euro sceptics should not vote for them in the EU elections! Make up your mind, what is it? 

&gt;Hence making a whole argument of ""anti"" simply idiotic. If you agree on certain legislature, yet you don't agree to that legislature on international level ""just because"", you are fighting with a nonsense argument. The best they could do would be to abstain, rather than vote NO.

To repeat what I said. UKIP vote no to prevent the EU gaining any more power. This seems like a good idea for a party who are opposed to EU expansion doesn't it? 

&gt;Don't take that for granted. People vote for plenty of different reasons. I bet some of them (quite many probably) vote UKIP solely because they don't like black and Muslim people..... as proven by a comment of one UKIP supporter in an article, where he started ""So many Muslim people....that's why I vote UKIP"". Shit.

How does voting UKIP stop black and Muslim immigration? 

&gt;""IMPLIES"". Who says it's a rule you can't have a flag, nor an anthem even if you are not a single country? Who makes those rules? You can have an anthem even at a school's group and make your own flag.... 

If you are running a school the chances of you trying to start your own country are quite low. 

If you are a union which over they years has become more and more politically intertwined, lead by people who have specifically said they want there to be a United States of Europe, have suggested things like a European Army, then creating your own flag and anthem to many will be a sign that you want to completely federalise Europe without the consent of the people, and that will worry many people. 

&gt;They should not vote in EU elections at all. If they don't support it, don't vote for it. Instead, vote for your MP..... but guess what, the EU is actually more democratic than UK's FPTP, hence gives some power even to small parties! Oh the irony.

If you agree with what UKIP are trying to do the the EU, trying to reduce its power over the UK, then it would be stupid not to vote for them. Sorry, you are just being ridiculous. 

&gt;Wrong, wrong and wrong again. Why don't you bother reading what I'm telling you? If you want to change something as in improve etc, then it's all fine. If you don't want to be part of something than.... do NOT be part of it and great start would be to NOT join that group/organisation!!!

I can read perfectly well what you are saying, it's just that it is moronic. Its not a question of whether we want to be a part of the EU or not, WE ARE A PART OF THE EU! What ridiculous logic to say that if you don't agree with a body that has so much power over us, we should stay away from it and not try to limit its power through democratic means. You have utterly failed at logically considering the position of UKIP supporters. What you are suggesting makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!

&gt;Why do you assume it's a matter of time that people will become more eurosceptic? Maybe it will actually change towards the opposite?

By looking at the change over time. Parties like UKIP are growing in support. If that support starts to fall I will recognise that. 

&gt;The UK can do something about Euroscepticism. Either quit the EU or change the EU. It doesn't make sense to advocate in the EU, for the UK to quit the EU but you are somehow unable to grasp that concept.

The only way to change the EU is to change the rules on free movement of people. Limit immigration, because that is the issue people care about.  The EU has consistently shown for many years that that is non negotiable, so I don't really see any progress being made on that front. 

&gt;If other Eurosceptics in EU parliament can't form a party or a group than it obviously means they either don't get enough support (meaning the problem isn't as big as they describe it is) or can't even form anything with themselves, showing how chaotic they are.

Again, as I said, there are around 100 fully Euro sceptic MEPs. Add to that the parties which have promised a referendum if they are elected, such as the conservatives, and you can see that in the UK at least, the majority of people voted for parties which will give them the opportunity to leave the EU. The same may be the case across the EU.

Who knows..

But I do find your comparison interesting, in the physical sense of ""stealing"" 1000s of papers from an office and handing them to a journalist being different.

Consider the Pentagon Papers and Watergate. The gates of all gates.

I actually agree with your sentiment, in essence the Law is simply catching up to the online world. But I hold a cynical view that the physical world is so utterly corrupted by power, establishments and control, that the internet represents total democracy and a real chance at true transparency, and that the old powers simply want to control this unfettered freedom being allowed to the masses. But I digress.

I don't agree that revealing secret military bases was ""bad"", and that something being illegal is immoral. Whistleblowing these locations could have prevented torture planes landing there or further Guantanamo Bay style abduction sites being allowed to fester.

The Government doesn't really care for morals any more than petty pirate distributors.

About 4 years later I'm still watching every game I can (which is probably about 80-90 percent of them (mostly missed the League Cup early rounds, real tough to find streams for some of them). I might not consider myself as much of a fan as some Americans on here probably, but I'd absolutely love to make it to a game at St. Mary's sometime. Since 2010 I've been back to England and caught an Arsenal game and a Hertha Berlin game, but it just hasn't worked out to see Southampton yet. Gone and walked around St. Mary's and the city as much as I could, but it was offseason. 

As for the rest of the questions, I own last year's home kit, but I'm not too fond of it. Still looking for a scarf, as I've got a bit of a collection [going](http://i.imgur.com/cslPQhE.jpg) (plus or minus a few more Sounders ones or some I don't like as much).  

Favorite memory is definitely clinching promotion from the Championship. I've always followed Seattle sports since I was a kid, and one of the things about Seattle teams is that if things are looking promising, we will find a way to fuck it up. Lose to a much lesser team, move to Oklahoma City, whatever. That season, things looked promising that entire year, but the fuckups never really came, even when I kept expecting them to and by the end I was almost surprised promotion actually happened. 

Favorite player is probably Wanyama. Loved him at Celtic, the dude's hilarious on twitter, and he just looks happy to be playing, something I like to see in footballers. Glad he's coming into his own end of last season/this season too. I'd answer the rest, but bleh, I feel like I've already written a ton.

This point really bears emphasis. 

This, avowedly, is *not* a place where we welcome ""token"" UKIP supporters, so long as they ""behave""- they're *welcome*- every bit as welcome as, say, the average Labour supporter would be. 

There's absolutely nothing to say that a UKIP member *has* to act in a way contravening the rules. And, frankly, the rules were crafted in the first place to just limit discussion to levels conducive to polite, *pleasant* discussion. 

Kippers are welcome. Tories are welcome. Labourites are welcome. Liberals are welcome. Anyone with vaguely decent approaches to political discussion is welcome- we're not about to ban anyone for, say, thinking present immigration levels are acutely undesirable. 

Right-wingers shouldn't feel like some kind of second-class contributers here. They're as welcome as anyone else, *as long as they abide by the rules*- as applied to everybody else. 

And, frankly, ""not being a bigot"" is *absolutely* compatible with right-leaning positions. 

Yes, the moderators of this subreddit are presently fairly centre-to-left. But the thing is, we're not setting up a circlejerk- this is meant to be a place for *discussion*. And people from all walks of life and the political spectrum are welcome, as long as they participate in good faith, and abide by the basic rules.

If you're a cyclist trying to get between Canary wharf and Greenwich, tower bridge is a 10 mile detour, the Woolwich ferry (if it's working) is a 7 mile detour - neither are really practical. Woolwich Tunnel has the same problems as the Greenwich one. DLR will now take bikes out of hours which helps but Cutty Sark station is a nightmare with one and it's no use for commuters due to the peak hours restrictions.

During commuting hours, cyclists in the tunnels massively out-number every other user for this reason. It's a vital transport link, there simply is no other practical way across.

Just to be clear though, I'm not serious about banning pedestrians. I think considerate cycling should be permitted and anyone who has a problem with that should be directed to one of the alternatives. How many people honestly *need* to traverse that tunnel on foot?

How about the bit where he insists that people have a ""right"" to discriminate against classes of people they disapprove of, and directly compares anti-discrimination laws to Nazism? 

Ok, where does he sympathise? All I can see is his quotation of a letter from a woman regarding a letter she once recedived from an elderly woman in Wolverhampton. 

&gt;In the hundreds upon hundreds of letters I received when I last spoke on this subject two or three months ago, there was one striking feature which was largely new and which I find ominous. All Members of Parliament are used to the typical anonymous correspondent; but what surprised and alarmed me was the high proportion of ordinary, decent, sensible people, writing a rational and often well-educated letter, who believed that they had to omit their address because it was dangerous to have committed themselves to paper to a Member of Parliament agreeing with the views I had expressed, and that they would risk penalties or reprisals if they were known to have done so. The sense of being a persecuted minority which is growing among ordinary English people in the areas of the country which are affected is something that those without direct experience can hardly imagine.

&gt;I am going to allow just one of those hundreds of people to speak for me:

&gt;“Eight years ago in a respectable street in Wolverhampton a house was sold to a Negro. Now only one white (a woman old-age pensioner) lives there. This is her story. She lost her husband and both her sons in the war. So she turned her seven-roomed house, her only asset, into a boarding house. She worked hard and did well, paid off her mortgage and began to put something by for her old age. Then the immigrants moved in. With growing fear, she saw one house after another taken over. The quiet street became a place of noise and confusion. Regretfully, her white tenants moved out.

&gt;“The day after the last one left, she was awakened at 7am by two Negroes who wanted to use her 'phone to contact their employer. When she refused, as she would have refused any stranger at such an hour, she was abused and feared she would have been attacked but for the chain on her door. Immigrant families have tried to rent rooms in her house, but she always refused. Her little store of money went, and after paying rates, she has less than £2 per week. “She went to apply for a rate reduction and was seen by a young girl, who on hearing she had a seven-roomed house, suggested she should let part of it. When she said the only people she could get were Negroes, the girl said, ""Racial prejudice won't get you anywhere in this country."" So she went home.

&gt;“The telephone is her lifeline. Her family pay the bill, and help her out as best they can. Immigrants have offered to buy her house - at a price which the prospective landlord would be able to recover from his tenants in weeks, or at most a few months. She is becoming afraid to go out. Windows are broken. She finds excreta pushed through her letter box. When she goes to the shops, she is followed by children, charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies. They cannot speak English, but one word they know. ""Racialist,"" they chant. When the new Race Relations Bill is passed, this woman is convinced she will go to prison. And is she so wrong? I begin to wonder.”

&gt;The other dangerous delusion from which those who are wilfully or otherwise blind to realities suffer, is summed up in the word ""integration."" To be integrated into a population means to become for all practical purposes indistinguishable from its other members.

&gt;Now, at all times, where there are marked physical differences, especially of colour, integration is difficult though, over a period, not impossible. There are among the Commonwealth immigrants who have come to live here in the last fifteen years or so, many thousands whose wish and purpose is to be integrated and whose every thought and endeavour is bent in that direction.

&gt;But to imagine that such a thing enters the heads of a great and growing majority of immigrants and their descendants is a ludicrous misconception, and a dangerous one.

&gt;We are on the verge here of a change. Hitherto it has been force of circumstance and of background which has rendered the very idea of integration inaccessible to the greater part of the immigrant population - that they never conceived or intended such a thing, and that their numbers and physical concentration meant the pressures towards integration which normally bear upon any small minority did not operate. 

I can't see any direct sympathy from Powell about this woman, as for another point you made:

&gt;How about the bit where he attacks British Sikhs for wearing turbans?

That is a quotation from a Labour MP, a Mr John Stonehouse how can it be used to attack Powell I don't know, Below is the quotation.

&gt;'The Sikh communities' campaign to maintain customs inappropriate in Britain is much to be regretted. Working in Britain, particularly in the public services, they should be prepared to accept the terms and conditions of their employment. To claim special communal rights (or should one say rites?) leads to a dangerous fragmentation within society. This communalism is a canker; whether practised by one colour or another it is to be strongly condemned.'

One could argue the character angle any number of ways. Some people seem to prefer a more 'submissive' role for the Doctor companions and others would prefer a more dominant character. Or would you prefer a more neutral type character?

I do not think the series should have a companion character with more tenacity, strength, and wit than the Doctor character. (I almost wrote himself here, but there's nothing in the canon that says the Doctor can't be female).

This sort of 'buddy travel' type thing can be seen in both the original Xena and Hercules series'. In Xena, you had 2 female leads filling a 'dominant' and 'submissive' role where EVENTUALLY the companion character becomes a more dominant type character (incidentally, her part in the show was also reduced IIRC). Or you can have two male characters such as the Hercules/Eolus combo. But Eolus was always less 'masculine' than Hercules himself.

""PKK terrorists murdered noncombatants, targeting village officials, teachers, and other perceived representatives of the State and committed random murders in their effort to intimidate the populace. The PKK brutally murdered seven primary school teachers in predominantly Kurdish areas and often targeted civilians in an effort to prevent them from collaborating with security forces or to coerce them into assisting the insurgents. The PKK was also responsible for at least 23 disappearances.""

&gt; Actually I'm simply going from ""member of a right-wing extremist party"" to ""right-wing extremist"". I don't care much for the ""loony views"" smear game, but the political views of Congress of the New Right are certainly very right-wing by UK standards.

The Wikipedia page lists the following as their policy platform:

- A new liberal constitution
- Reduction in the size of parliament and the addition of an extra chamber
- Regional autonomy
- Lowering tax and the size of the welfare state
- Decriminalization of drugs
- Opposition to same-sex marriage
- Restoration of capital punishment

The only one of those that is outside the political debate in the UK is the last one, and it has majority support from the UK public. That does not make an extreme party. Supporting a terrorist group, however, does make for an extremist party. Labour are in bed with an extremists.

And would you advocate for restricting immigration of English speakers to Wales, Cornwall, Ireland or Scotland? After all, they really have displaced the natives of those areas.

&gt;Sadly however a significant number of them are.

This is so vague as to be meaningless. What's a 'significant' number? And, again, if I'm worried about a particular group coming here for vague reasons (they might be an 'eyesore', they might be 'criminal'), how is that *not* racist?

&gt;This is the group people are concerned with

Is it? Then why do they say 'Romanians and Bulgarians' and 'migration from the EU' when they only mean 'a small subset of Romanians that have a particular name I could easily use'?

&gt;It's not a policy. It was an offhand remark.

I didn't say it was a policy, I said it was a basis for policy, by which I meant that Ukip have used 'I don't like being on trains full of foreigners' to excuse or explain their attitudes toward immigration.

&gt;And a huge number of those born here are the children of immigrants due to the custom of large families.

Again, there is no basis for thinking this is the case. A few decades ago you could've said something similar about Irish families. I don't see the country being overrun by the Irish. It's also an established fact that second generation immigrants have family sizes closer to those of the native population, so the effect lessens in impact over time.

&gt;Even if immigration was stopped tomorrow, our population would continue to rise for a few generations.

The birthrate is greater than the deathrate in the native population, so our population would continue to rise for as long as this remained the case. This doesn't have anything to do with immigration.

&gt;Again, simply because we can does not mean we should. It is beginning to harm us more than it benefits us.

tl;dr So, while there is no smoking gun 'I hate blacks' racist comment, in the speech Enoch concluded that discrimination doesn't happen in the UK, and when it does it is mainly felt by non-immigrants, that anti-discrimination laws are bad because they will offend non-immigrants and will allow dangerous and divisive elements in the immigrant community to flourish, and that immigrants are seeking to dominate the non-immigrant population. This is all wrapped up in a lot of scaremongering.

While you might not be able to pick out a racist line (although I'd suggest there are racist undertones), Enoch most definitely was not right, unless you don't think discrimination has ever happened in Britain to someone based on race, or if you think discrimination laws are a bad thing, or if you think immigrants are trying to dominate the non-immigrant population.

false,Pallas_,cnty-scotland,An Irishman in Scotland,"&gt; While you might not be able to pick out a racist line (although I'd suggest there are racist undertones), Enoch most definitely was not right, unless you don't think discrimination has ever happened in Britain to someone based on race, or if you think discrimination laws are a bad thing, or if you think immigrants are trying to dominate the non-immigrant population. 

But the speech wasn't about there not being such a thing as discrimination, but more a call for complete integration and that if immigrants are allowed to build up their own community and run sort of ghettoized areas integration will not happen, as Powell says in the speech itself.

&gt;The other dangerous delusion from which those who are wilfully or otherwise blind to realities suffer, is summed up in the word ""integration."" To be integrated into a population means to become for all practical purposes indistinguishable from its other members.

&gt;Now, at all times, where there are marked physical differences, especially of colour, integration is difficult though, over a period, not impossible. There are among the Commonwealth immigrants who have come to live here in the last fifteen years or so, many thousands whose wish and purpose is to be integrated and whose every thought and endeavour is bent in that direction.

...

&gt;We are on the verge here of a change. Hitherto it has been force of circumstance and of background which has rendered the very idea of integration inaccessible to the greater part of the immigrant population - that they never conceived or intended such a thing, and that their numbers and physical concentration meant the pressures towards integration which normally bear upon any small minority did not operate.

Cheaper across most if not all routes. Try flying to the USA from BFS. Continental fly to Newark from BFS and will charge close to 800pounds return. Fine if you're going to New York, but if you're going further afield, West Coast, MidWest, the South. Dublin airport fly to Charlotte (Major hub), Chicago (Major hub), NY, Boston and I think even direct to LA. Dublin even has American immigration and customs in it, so you get processed in Dublin and when you get across the pond, disembark and go on your way. Easy.

BFS is not centrally placed, you access it by country roads. No rail link and roads are awful. It's easier to jump on a motorway and head to Dublin if you are going by car.

false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Firstly you hit the first important point about wind/solar energy: a degree of independence for individual citizens. Given ten or so years and battery costs dropping to affordable levels it will be financial common sense to own rooftop solar panels and a home battery: during the summer you probably won't pay any bills at all.

Secondly, while we do need reliable forms of energy generation to meet times when there is no wind/sun, renewable energy has become (and continues to become) progressively cheaper to build and install. It also has the advantage of having no fuel cost once installed.

When the wind blows and the sun shines, we're able to access extremely cheap energy from renewables: with enough on the network it will contribute to lowering bills. 54% of your home energy bill is the wholesale cost of buying energy (the rest is taxes, system charges, so on...). With renewable energy itself being free, that 54% can translate into less real currency, allowing smaller bills. Once you factor in the building cost of the renewables, we're at the stage now where onshore wind (and maybe solar?) are competitive like this, while Offshore I think isn't yet. Technology marches on, however: give it time.

Third, something I touched on above with free renewable energy, gas and oil aren't free and are subject to price fluctuations and politicking. OPEC decide to reduce oil production, causing a price rise, which hurts people at home because their energy depends on Oil. Russia tightens the taps on the gas pipelines, that hurts people at home who depend on gas-fired generation. The sun doesn't play politics, neither does the wind: it's easier to predict when the sun will shine than it is to predict when Putin or the House of Saud will squeeze again. :P

Fourth, energy independence nationally. The South of England is very sunny, Scotland is very windy. We should harness this to meet our needs with British-produced energy as far as technically feasible.

Ideally what you want to do is this:

* Fill in the baseload with your nuclear and large coal, as we do.
* Fill in whatever's left with renewables, as far as you can.
* Use fast-ramping gas to make up the shortfall or compensate for any sudden changes in renewables output.

It's a very delicate balancing act, one that Germany tried to achieve in the Energiewende and didn't do very well on, but it's possible. What tripped Germany up was the total lack of control over their renewable production, because their laws put most renewable generation (domestic, small scale) outside the control of the System Operator. As a result, they experienced absurd ping-ponging in the demand they were experiencing (a cloud goes over a city, all their solar turns off, all that demand suddenly pops up wanting coal-powered energy), which in turn lead to chaos in the balancing payments.

Ironically one of the groups that raked in *huge* profits from the Energiewende were those that owned and contracted fast-acting gas and diesel generators.",0,1413995703,null,0,1413995904,0,clgnzl8,t3_2jvops,t1_clgnzl8,t1_clg00df,null,1426404169,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's a weird one - abstracting a bit, most people's assumption was that rising levels of prosperity would lead to social progress similar to what was seen in Europe. However that hasn't been the case - for example, it was assumed that the more wealthy and more educated people became, the less religiously observant they would become. However, in India, [increasing levels of prosperity has basically lead to a temple-donations arms race](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-10/news/30139400_1_pilgrims-guruvayur-temple-donations), where people vie to outdo each other in how ostentatious and lavish their offerings to their chosen deities are. 

Similarly, it seems like as people become wealthier, dowry demands are affected by inflation - where a groom would previously have required a motorcycle, he now wants a small car, and so on. 

The key message for me is that increasing wealth without a concomitant increase in education is not going to lead to any social progress. Culturally ingrained mindsets do not change with increasing consumption :-/

Interest rates on savings suck. But mortgages are cheap as hell right now. And we've got 200,000 people a year (net) entering the UK, plus births. And to top it off, we don't build very many houses - only 150,000 per year. (which, by the way, makes Ed Milibands promise of 200,000 by 2014 totally worthless). And no government seems particularly determined to do anything about it.

So can anybody really blame people for buying houses and renting them out? I've been tempted to pick up a few and rent them out myself, but the only reason I haven't is the ""moral"" issue.

false,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"I wrote a response to this exact same question a while back so apologies for the cutting and pasting:


The key to Thatcher was that she was polarising and if you ask anyone who was alive during her tenure, you will get an opinion - no ambivalence, just a hard and fast opinion that's either very pro or very anti.

Some of this is about ideology: Thatcher had very different ideas to how Britain should be run that went entirely against what we call the post war consensus (i.e. a robust welfare state, strong union participation in politics, nationalisation of key industries and the like) and people can argue the toss about the merits of that until the cows come home. However, what sets Thatcher apart is the zeal with which she set about implementing her vision and the fact that she was always more than willing to break a few societal eggs to make her free-market omelet.

This is what inflames people - either pro or anti - about Thatcher. To the pros, she was the person who took a moribund Britain that was struggling to come to terms with it's position in the world, kicked it up the arse and gave it a new sense of purpose. There's some credence to this because Britain in the late 70's wasn't exactly the poster boy for successful social democracy: We had rolling strikes, the three day week and the Winter of Discontent - not to mention the tangible sense of irreversible decline. Seen in this light, Thatcher was one with the stones to stand up to vested interests and gave Britain a new sense of purpose.

However, this came at a price because and while Thatcher was very concerned with ends, she wasn't too bothered about means and would happily sacrifice any number of sacred cows if she thought it furthered her vision of the world. That meant that an awful lot of people lost out during her time and those people tended to be at the lower end of the economic scale and also disproportionately in the North. That's not to say that change wasn't needed - it was - but the fact that she seemed to relish trampling over things that people held dear made it very personal for a great many people.",0,1413996829,null,0,false,0,clgolyz,t3_2k075o,t1_clgolyz,t3_2k075o,null,1426403878,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm assuming that's 28th November, 2015? If so, I'd just forget about the interest rates entirely. You're not saving enough, for long enough, for it to make any real difference. Interest rates are at a historic low anyway, so you're not really going to be boosting £4k, added incrementally over a single year, by a significant amount. Every penny counts yada, yada, yada, but in order to benefit from better rates you usually have to lock the money up for a longer set amount of time, otherwise your forfeit the improved rates, or are liable for charges.


Because, as you said, you're probably going to need instant access to the cash before the wedding anyway, I would just find either a simple current account with no fees or restrictions and throw the money in there, or if you're not going to max out your ISA allowance either this year or next year, a simple cash ISA would work as well.

Her policies succeeded in reducing inflation, but unemployment dramatically increased during her years in power.

The majority of people however have mixed feelings about her because she did hugely popular things such as winning the Falklands war and standing up to the terrorists in the Iranian embassy siege. she also did some very controversial things such as crushing the miners strikes and the introduction of the poll tax which led to riots. 

people respected her for her balls and the strength of her character but were not always convinced by her policies. generally speaking the more north you go the less nice things people will have to say about her as her decisions had a big impact on the industrial centers in the north.

It would also factor in a lot as to the lifestyle you want while you're here.

On the other hand, you could get an equally good learning experience at Glasgow and you would also have the reputation of Glasgow on your side as well as living an arty, bohemian lifestyle in the art districts there.

You will need to be able to document your available funds for living expenses for your visa. At the current exchange rate: you must show $1,317 per month if you are living outside london and $1,639 per month if you are living in London. The US dollar does not stack up well against the pound at this moment so even though this isn't really the cultural answer you asked for it is very important to seriously consider the financial burden. 

I also second the difference in drinking cultures from the US. It is very much a part of the social environment. If excessive drinking makes you uncomfortable you are going to have to find ways to cope with that. It isn't necessarily a negative aspect of the culture: just different. But if you are coming from a big college maybe you are already aquatinted with that. I like to have a drink with some peers but it is on a different level from what I experienced at my small town college experience. 

I honestly love it over here. My program is amazing, the instructors are leaders in their field, I am surrounded by ridiculously intelligent and talented peers, I am living in a beautiful country with a staggering amount of history, and excited by the thriving arts scene of my city (Cardiff). The key to all of this is really the program that I chose. Take your time to find something that you will find engaging: the rest will follow.

Has he been worth the £30m, only time will tell, has he matched his pricetag so far? Absolutely not and he has a lot more to show and provide before we can entertain that notion. He is an exciting prospect, seems to want to try and work hard and fans can get behind that

With Soldado, people seem to be more attached to him sentimentally as he gives his all every game and seems to love to play, as well as having a large social media contribution and always having something good to say about the club and fans. His reaction and celebration after the Cardiff goal last season was brilliant and we can all get behind someone who tries (hence why a majority like Holtby). On top of this his wife had a miscarriage last season which I think brought us all down to reality with him and increased our sentimentality with him. In my opinion I was impressed with how he played against City, with a good through ball to mason and the assist to Eriksen, if he bagged the penalty it would have been a different story, but everyone misses penalties.

With Paulinho, have we seen any of the above? Last season bar a few good games he was played very often and showed not too much in terms of overall quality, he didn't really seem to fit into the role we needed him to fit in. This is in stark contrast to the enormous expectations we had for him after his excellent confederations cup run, and general form with Corinthians. On top of this there isn't a lot of sentimentality behind him for one reason or another (that's how it seems to me anyway), and he isn't young like Eriksen or Lamela for example so it's difficult to see how high his potential to improve really is.

Soldado gets a pass out of necessity. Kane looks good, but he's not going to lead the line in the PL yet, and he can't play every game regardless. Adebayor was our best striker last season, but he's regressed and looks disinterested / lacking. So we're left with Soldado, who has drastically changed his game from being a fox in the box to helping out more and more with the build up play. That doesn't suit his goal scoring ability, but it's a bigger help than what Ade has been doing.

Paulinho on the other hand, has been given opportunities, he started a number of PL games last year, but has yet to have a really good game. He has all the motivation of Adebayor, without showing any of the skill to get away with it.

And like you said, Paulinho is the cheapest of the three. Losing him would be the least bad option in terms of finances. You don't drop nearly 30m on a player like Soldado only to sell him a year later at a loss, that's just stupid.

That being said, I think Paulinho at least deserves the rest of the season, barring some desire on his part to leave. If he's still not good enough by the summer, then we can talk about selling him.

Ken Bates eventually banned Harding from the Chelsea boardroom and effectively limited his input and influence over the club.

&gt; Thanks to the English magazine’s clever rhetorical strategy, calibrating an effective mixture of aristocratic contempt, two-notches-smarter-than-Newsweek diction, and occasional anti-elitist populism to pander to its majority-American readership, readers trust The Economist. 

&gt; They – particularly American readers – trust it because they think it knows more than they do; this is its entire appeal. They even get a sick thrill being talked down to by a dirty old aristocratic prig. For Americans in particular, accustomed to the lifeless, dumbed-down, least-common-denominator prose in their own media, reading The Economist is its own reward, giving them the sense not only that they’re smarter than the average Time subscriber, but that it even makes them vaguely decadent, in a literary-aristocratic sort of way. They become smarter by osmosis simply by being in the imagined drawing room of The Economist‘s wit-slinging editorial offices.


&gt; Or as Michael Lewis, the author of Liar’s Poker, observed after moving to England, “The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people. If American readers got a look at the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves.”

That's how it gets created, not how it gets used. That time and money was invested by choice, it's a gamble betting that whatever results can be sold for profit. Society at large has no duty to make sure that gamble pays off. 

Wheres all the bust airline tycoons complaining that people who go by boat cost them a business? There aren't any. They're just off doing something else where they don't fail at gaining customers. This concept of it being the customers fault for not buying something is pretty damn exclusive to the media industry. 

&gt; That's not the key issue here. What we are talking about is the morality of this action, not how easy it is to do.

Immorality is a part of the world we live in. It's the job of corporations to make profit despite that. Business that don't turn profits do so because they suck at business not because ""*bad people exist*"". Bad people have always existed.

&gt; Sorry but I don't think that's what the research has actually shown. But maybe you're looking at different studies to what I've seen. Which proof are you referring to?

[Columbia University - Pirates buy 30% more music](http://piracy.americanassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Copy-Culture.pdf)

Pirates buy more music -&gt; Pirates consume more music -&gt; Pirates consume beyond their financial means, filling the gap with piracy -&gt; Remove piracy -&gt; Pirates don't conjure more money out of nowhere to pay for the gap -&gt; They just stop consuming.

Thought experiment. Let's say you start selling cheeseburgers at 10p each. People like them, you build up a customer base of around 200 sales per week.

Now increase the price of the cheeseburgers to £30 each. What happens to your number of sales per week? Do all those 200 people like your cheeseburgers *so* much they pull funds from other areas in their life to keep buying them? 

Of course they don't, they just stop buying your cheeseburgers. It's got nothing to do with the customer, you've priced *yourself* out of their market.

Market demand isn't detached from price point, you can't just ignore it and say that any customer at any price point is a customer at all other price points. It's economics 101.

I have never been to England but wish to go and making a pilgrimage to St. Mary's is top of the list. Favorite memory is beating Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield. My favorite player last year was Adam Lallana and this year it is a toss up of Dusan Tadic or James Ward-Prowse just because Tadic was an improvement on Lallanas excellent skill and is bloody fun to watch he makes everything look easy in a league he never played in before and Prowsey because his free kick ability. I have naught several items from the online team store.the reactions are pure shock and wonderment. Most people think I'm stupid for supporting them and tell me that Southampton is a joke.

I move from that role around 6 months after and now after 4 other moves sit as a certified scrum product owner and progressing through iseb BA qualifications. 

My point is that you may need to join a company as an office assistant rather than going for specific admin role, sit it out as the general gofer and try to shine as someone keen to show they can do another role there....

I grew up playing soccer, supporting local lower level pro teams, watching the USMNT, playing FIFA, but never really followed European club soccer. This year I decided that I would start following the Premier League. I knew I wanted to pick a team, but I didn't really know who. I made a list of some players that I liked from the World Cup, and decided to try to watch as many of them on opening weekend as I could, hoping that one of their teams would catch my fancy. One of the players on the list was Gaston Ramirez. I had seen him in the Olympics and liked him, as well as during the World Cup. Obviously I was disappointed when I turned on the Southampton-Liverpool game and he wasn't playing, but I kept watching and quickly fell in love with the over-achieving underdogs. Even though they didn't get a result in that game, they kept me coming back each week. 

Of course I was disappointed when I heard that Ramirez had been loaned out to Hull City, but by that point I was already a fan. I think a big reason why I enjoy watching the Saints so much is that their style of play is very similar to my local pro team, the Harrisburg City Islanders. Outside backs that push forward to create chances, a plethora of speedy forwards and wings, and a large striker up top.

I don't have any gear.

One way to look at it is that people have taken a huge gamble, borrowing lots of money to invest in a volatile market. It could have gone horribly wrong, if the property market had crashed (as many predicted), leaving them with several properties in negative equity, soaring interest rates and massive debt. They took that risk, it paid off, they deserve the wealth.

Certainly I *could* have had a go myself, I just didn't have the stomach for such a risk.

But on the other hand, it can also seem very parasitic. They are gambling someone else's money, worst case they lose a bit of a deposit and go bankrupt. The bank (ultimately the rest of us) pick up the tab. And the housing market/base rate are not exactly decided by chance, they are carefully manipulated to try to avoid crashes. So these people waded in like so many parasites, taking advantage of a system which was intended to help ordinary homeowners, not serial BTLers.

Probably the government should have seen what was happening and done something to stop 20% of our housing stock ending up owned by a bunch of undeserving chancers.

- They still target the old enemy. Oh yes all those Republicans they've killed in the last few years. (Also they literally contradict themselves later saying: ""The organisation has murdered 31 people – 29 of them from their own community – while on ceasefire."")

- When did they plan to kill Brian Gillen? If it was last year it would be something. If it was in 1997 then what's the story? Of course they keep it ambiguous so we don't know.

- Why is a planned attack 20 years ago being used as evidence of their capability or intentions in today's world?

And why would a doctor be giving an interview when 100's of people are being rushed into her hospital?

Behind Lloris, Dawson, and Walker, Paulinho played the most minutes of any player on Spurs in all competitions from the 2013-14 season. He has been given many chances to bring his game up and save a couple nice performances has shown to be *appalling* (think that Limassol game).

I can't assign much blame to Soldado for the game against City just as I would not assign blame to our team's collective performance that day (save Capoue and Fazio's shirt-tug). We were not beaten by City as much as Aguero and Hart had incredible games on either side of the pitch. Any other day or against another keeper I believe Soldado's PK and shot on goal would have gone in.

With Mason's performances against Forest, Arsenal, Soton, and Man City (pretty impressive line of teams) I don't see the point in giving Paulinho more time on the pitch when we can develop a homegrown talent.

This is an assumption that isn't backed up by any strong evidence. Without sampling a representative population of pirates, and checking their financial state against media consumption habits to see if their desire for creative works outstrips their means to pay for it, you have no way of knowing if this is true. It could just as easily be the case that they pirate in spite being having the ability to pay.

Additionally, the observation that music pirates in the US also purchase 30% more music than non-pirates does not imply that piracy leads to more sales. It could just as well be that increased demand leads to more sales, but also leads to more piracy (perhaps as this option is so easily available). The assumption seems to be that if music piracy was somehow abolished, the group of people who pirate more would behave identically to the non-pirates - but this is not necessarily the case.

Bent was sold again at 28 for the same price. Don't see how that is a bad piece of business. And he was signed under Jol, not Ramos.

Pavlyuchenko did as well as his price tag suggested. About the same goal to game ratio as Berbatov.

I don't see how it is Levy's fault that Bentley had a mental breakdown.

Eto'o or Villa...really? Even if Eto'o was about to leave Nou Camp for WHL, and David Villa to leave Valencia, at the time a regular in the CL, for us, there is no way we would be able to afford their wages.

So that leaves us with Paulinho and Soldado. Both are obviously quality players, but they might not make it. But two big money duds, so to speak, hardly makes Levy a disaster in the transfer market.

Again, Adebayor laugable? He has the same goal to game ration of Berbatov...and he was half the price.

You conveniently leave out all the great signings under Levy: Naybet, Davids, Keane, Defoe, Berbatov, Jenas, Modric, Bale, Lennon, etc.

Benzema's header was quite exquisite. You could fault the defense maybe for not being aware of the players there (it was obvious from TV) but again, such a perfectly placed ball from Kroos and Benzema.

Third goal however was pretty shit defending.

That being said, I've noticed that when Madrid are attacking, the players stay close to each other and try to play the ball where there are more white shirts. When we're attacking, everyone is going in a different direction and there's too much space between all our players.

Yup. Really wish the Valdes rumours hadn't gone cold but we need someone, at least.

&gt;Can you sell a player after only a few months? 

Yup, we sold Robbie Keane back to Spurs after just 6 months. And yeah, we might as well try to get Origi back.

EDIT: I'm not necessarily agreeing with you that we should sell Balo on, I was just saying that yes it's possible. I think with other strikers fit and maybe Origi back, that Balo could prove useful in the 2nd half of the season as another tactical option, but he's not right for us to rely on completely like we are right now.

Bentley didn't have a mental breakdown. He just didn't have the mindset to play for a big club or desire to work to get in the team. When you are spending that amount of money, a club should do its research.

Ramos asked for Villa from Valencia. At that time Spurs could have afforded the transfer and wages. Levy instead wasted millions on inferior players.

Paulinho and Soldado are blatantly not suited to this league. Surely when spending £40m it is possible to assess whether players can adjust culturally and football-wise. Whatever assessment was done it was clearly a catastrophic failure.

Adebayor pops up with a good few goals when it suits him but he is often a waste of a jersey. Berbatov was an all-round brilliant player who contributed greatly to Spurs' play and created as many as he scored.

It therefore seems an inexact parallel to use the tragedy of Reeva Steenkamp's death to make a point about British domestic violence victims whose deaths - while equally tragic - were (unlike Steenkamp's) most often the culmination of an ongoing campaign of domestic violence and threats from their partners, and whose situations were often exacerbated through police negligence and lack of official support, seeing as there is little indication that Reeva faced the same issues as they did or that a domestic violence shelter would have helped her. 

(The Pistorius trial did not find any evidence to suggest that Pistorius had hit her or used violence against her before. That's not to say it definitely didn't happen, of course - merely that in at least 144 of these 243 British cases, we have far clearer evidence that a pattern of domestic violence definitely did, and that the police should have stopped it.)

Domestic violence is an important issue, and one that needs far more coverage. It's a crying shame that so many vitally-needed domestic violence shelters are being closed down, and that 150 sufficiently desperate women are being turned away from them each day. But it seems odd that the death of a high-profile woman like Steenkamp, in quite a different situation to the average victim of domestic violence, is what's being used to illustrate a point about it here, rather than the deaths of those 144 British women who died in somewhat less ambiguous circumstances at the hands of their abusers.

&gt;- Balo is shit and should be benched &amp;amp; traded

Balotelli hasn't done much for us, by any stretch of the imagination. I'll agree with you there. And I've been furious at those shanks he's blasted 20 yards over the net. But, he hasn't had much to work with. He has no Sturridge to play off of and the alternative of playing Lambert isn't better. We were spoiled with Suarez. Sturridge hadn't seen minutes, and Balo joined a brand new team with heavy expectations. He's put in a solid work rate most games, and he hasn't done the typical pouting bullshit of the past. Saying he needs to be traded is severe. You can't just pluck a striker off of another team, put him in a formation that doesn't suite him, then expect immediate results. Don't make him the scapegoat for what has been a poor year for the entire team.

&gt;- We bought poorly in the summer, over-focusing on youth over established quality

Again, not necessarily true. We bought for depth. It was impossible for Brendan to anticipate the Suarez biting fiasco, so until then, we were solid up top. After it happened, we didn't have much time or resources to nail a star striker. Who else were we looking at? Eto'o? Remy? Luis was irreplaceable, and Brendan did what he could with the time allotted. We bought young, talented players that Brendan looked to develop--much like Countinho, Henderson, and Sterling.


&gt;- Rogers is not as good a manager as people thought -- a rising tide lifted his boat last year

The man isn't a miracle worker. No one expected shit from Liverpool at the beginning of last year, and they nearly stole it from City. Call it luck, call it Luis, call it whatever. I'm glad Brendan is leading the squad. He can only do so much from the manager's box. The man came into a struggling club and began to rebuild it from the bottom up. After one miracle, outlier season, you can't expect constant results like that. The squad simply isn't capable of performing at that level consistently yet. They need 2 or 3 more quality signings and time (a year or so) for the youth players to get experience and develop. 

&gt;- Our defense is shit, but it is made worse by our poor offense and inability to hold the ball

Yeah, can't argue with you much there, except it isn't the ""offenses"" duty to control the pace of the game, it's the midfielders. Liverpool isn't a team that can play with a lone striker and work off of him. 

All in all, I won't be the ""up with the club happy talk types,"" but I will be the person to tell you that you are overly pessimistic and negative. You're entitled to your opinion, but you simply condemned Liverpool without offering any potential solutions. You can say ""we're shite and suck"" until you run out of breath, but what good does that do? Everyone watches the same game, mate. We know we aren't the team we were last year. But, we aren't even below other top four teams of the previous year. It's a long season ahead of us. We're struggling to find form again after having to redevelop tactics after trading our superstar striker away, which is to be expected and takes time. YNWA

Ramp up nuclear to get that coal consumption down. Ramp up wind (onshore and offshore) to cover the rest and use gas to balance and cover times of low wind. And build a shit ton of interconnectors to import and export and take advantage of other countries strengths and weaknesses (Ireland, Iceland, Norway, Netherlands and France).

Let's put a little context in the middle here.  Margaret Thatcher (yes, I know) was in favour of the EEC.  She warned in her Bruges Speech of 1988 about the nature of the looming shift then.   

I'm not asking you to like Margaret Thatcher, or agree with her, but it is an anchor in time warning about how things *might* change as she sees it and how Europe will or should *develop*.

Emphasis on develop - the things you recognise hadn't happened then.

&gt;**WILLING COOPERATION BETWEEN SOVEREIGN STATES**

&gt;My first guiding principle is this: willing and active cooperation between independent sovereign states is the best way to build a successful European Community.  To try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a European conglomerate would be highly damaging and would jeopardise the objectives we seek to achieve.
Europe will be stronger precisely because it has France as France, Spain as Spain, Britain as Britain, each with its own customs, traditions and identity. It would be folly to try to fit them into some sort of identikit European personality.

&gt;Some of the founding fathers of the Community thought that the United States of America might be its model. But the whole history of America is quite different from Europe. People went there to get away from the intolerance and constraints of life in Europe.  They sought liberty and opportunity; and their strong sense of purpose has, over two centuries, helped to create a new unity and pride in being American, just as our pride lies in being British or Belgian or Dutch or German.

&gt;I am the first to say that on many great issues the countries of Europe should try to speak with a single voice.  I want to see us work more closely on the things we can do better together than alone.  Europe is stronger when we do so, whether it be in trade, in defence or in our relations with the rest of the world.  But working more closely together does not require power to be centralised in Brussels or decisions to be taken by an appointed bureaucracy.

&gt;Indeed, it is ironic that just when those countries such as the Soviet Union, which have tried to run everything from the centre, are learning that success depends on dispersing power and decisions away from the centre, there are some in the Community who seem to want to move in the opposite direction.  We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.
Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.  But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one's own country; for these have been the source of Europe's vitality through the centuries.

&gt;**ENCOURAGING CHANGE**

&gt;My second guiding principle is this: Community policies must tackle present problems in a practical way, however difficult that may be.
If we cannot reform those Community policies which are patently wrong or ineffective and which are rightly causing public disquiet, then we shall not get the public support for the Community's future development.
And that is why the achievements of the European Council in Brussels last February are so important.[fo 4]

&gt;It was not right that half the total Community budget was being spent on storing and disposing of surplus food.Now those stocks are being sharply reduced.  It was absolutely right to decide that agriculture's share of the budget should be cut in order to free resources for other policies, such as helping the less well-off regions and helping training for jobs.

&gt;It was right too to introduce tighter budgetary discipline to enforce these decisions and to bring the Community spending under better control.
And those who complained that the Community was spending so much time on financial detail missed the point. You cannot build on unsound foundations, financial or otherwise, and it was the fundamental reforms agreed last winter which paved the way for the remarkable progress which we have made since on the Single Market.  But we cannot rest on what we have achieved to date.  For example, the task of reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is far from complete.

&gt;Certainly, Europe needs a stable and efficient farming industry.
But the CAP has become unwieldy, inefficient and grossly expensive. Production of unwanted surpluses safeguards neither the income nor the future of farmers themselves.  We must continue to pursue policies which relate supply more closely to market requirements, and which will reduce over-production and limit costs.  Of course, we must protect the villages and rural areas which are such an important part of our national life, but not by the instrument of agricultural prices.  Tackling these problems requires political courage.

&gt;The Community will only damage itself in the eyes of its own people and the outside world if that courage is lacking.

&gt;**EUROPE OPEN TO ENTERPRISE**

&gt;My third guiding principle is the need for Community policies which encourage enterprise.  If Europe is to flourish and create the jobs of the future, enterprise is the key.  The basic framework is there: the Treaty of Rome itself was intended as a Charter for Economic Liberty.
But that it is not how it has always been read, still less applied.
The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the 70's and 80's is that central planning and detailed control do not work and that personal endeavour and initiative do.

&gt;That a State-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.
The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the Single European Market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.[fo 5]  And that means action to free markets, action to widen choice, action to reduce government intervention.

&gt;Our aim should not be more and more detailed regulation from the centre: it should be to deregulate and to remove the constraints on trade.
Britain has been in the lead in opening its markets to others.
The City of London has long welcomed financial institutions from all over the world, which is why it is the biggest and most successful financial centre in Europe.

&gt;We have opened our market for telecommunications equipment, introduced competition into the market services and even into the network itself—steps which others in Europe are only now beginning to face.
In air transport, we have taken the lead in liberalisation and seen the benefits in cheaper fares and wider choice.

&gt;Our coastal shipping trade is open to the merchant navies of Europe.
We wish we could say the same of many other Community members.
Regarding monetary matters, let me say this. The key issue is not whether there should be a European Central Bank.

&gt;The immediate and practical requirements are:     
- to implement the Community's commitment to free movement of capital—in Britain, we have it;      
- and to the abolition through the Community of exchange controls—in Britain, we abolished them in 1979;     
- to establish a genuinely free market in financial services in banking, insurance, investment;      
- and to make greater use of the ecu.

&gt;This autumn, Britain is issuing ecu-denominated Treasury bills and hopes to see other Community governments increasingly do the same.
These are the real requirements because they are what the Community business and industry need if they are to compete effectively in the wider world.

&gt;And they are what the European consumer wants, for they will widen his choice and lower his costs.

&gt;It is to such basic practical steps that the Community's attention should be devoted.  When those have been achieved and sustained over a period of time, we shall be in a better position to judge the next move.
It is the same with frontiers between our countries.
Of course, we want to make it easier for goods to pass through frontiers.
Of course, we must make it easier for people to travel throughout the Community.  

&gt;But it is a matter of plain common sense that we cannot totally abolish frontier controls if we are also to protect our citizens from crime and stop the movement of drugs, of terrorists and of illegal immigrants.[fo 6]
That was underlined graphically only three weeks ago when one brave German customs officer, doing his duty on the frontier between Holland and Germany, struck a major blow against the terrorists of the IRA.
And before I leave the subject of a single market, may I say that we certainly do not need new regulations which raise the cost of employment and make Europe's labour market less flexible and less competitive with overseas suppliers.  If we are to have a European Company Statute, it should contain the minimum regulations.

&gt;And certainly we in Britain would fight attempts to introduce collectivism and corporatism at the European level—although what people wish to do in their own countries is a matter for them.

false,skunkd,,Belfast,"&gt;Yes it's bigger because the Dublin government, the EU and the airports owners invested bucket loads of money in it. Dublin airport is surrounded by motorways and infrastructure that allow passengers to easily access and depart the airport.

...because of the population living on it's doorstep right? So why would we invest in it too? Better to spend it on improving our own infrastructure and keep the economic benefits of such public spending completely within NI.

&gt;9pound each way is more expensive and 17pound return.

Get you now. Although that doesn't sound great value for money, you're paying a pound extra and saving 90mins travel time.

&gt;Cheaper across most if not all routes.

...again because of the airlines operating there who service that population? The price to New York seems pretty much equivalent to me. If you're going further a field then Dublin is simply a bigger airport with more choice. I'm not sure what's to be done about that until such time as the population of the Randalstown metropolitan area tops 1million.

&gt;BFS is not centrally placed, you access it by country roads.

Easier to get to for most living in the North West than Dublin. Getting processed in Dublin swaps the immigration chore to this side of the Atlantic. I'm not immediately sure of the benefit other than getting you out the other side slightly quicker in return for turning up at the airport sooner.

&gt;I lived in the shadow of the airport (Randlestown) and I'd always go by Dublin.

false,p_gascoigne,flair3,,"First of all Pav. That is a normal price for a striker that will score about one in every three games. Let me know of any cheaper transfers of an equally prolific scorer to a top 8 team (where the contract wasn't out) that went any cheaper than that.

We always had a strict wage structure--our best players still make less than Arsenal reserve players do. So I am sorry to break it to you, but there is no way the top scorer of the Euro 2008 Champions was going to sign for us. He was the best striker in Europe at the time, why would he join Ramos at Spurs? Also, if Soldado is ""blatantly not suited to this league"", how would Villa have fared? What exactly is different in their playing styles?

Berbatov is probably the classiest striker to ever have played for us. But to make the case he creates more than Ade is just a lie. Berbatov didn't even feel ashamed about his laziness. Berbatov makes Ronaldo look like Roy Keane. Ade is not nearly as good technically as Berbs, but way more of a team player.

Levy had to build us up from a bottom of the league team into top 4 contenders. Andy Reid, Michael Brown, Sean Davis, Lee, Ghaly, were all important squad players that enabled us to move from a bottom half team into a mid-table team.

Zamora was signed for 1.5 m, then he was used to leverage the double swoop for Kanoute and Defoe (hardly a bad bit of business). Blondel was a free transfer and sold for a 1.5 m. Mabizela was a free tranfer. Boateng was sold on for the same we signed him for. Rasiak was signed for 2m., and guess what, sold for 2m. We lost about a 1.25 m on Postiga. Rocha was signed as a back up for our CD, did his job, and was cheap. Adel Taarabt was one of the biggest talents in Europe at the time, was signed for 3 m, sold for 1.5 m., while earning us money in loan fees over three seasons. 

Palacios was excellent for a season, in particular in the Champions League. But having your brother kidnapped, tortured, chopped up, and then buried not to be found for months on can mess up anybody. I really can't see how Levy can be blamed for that on either.

Bassong?? He was the central defender with the most games when we qualified for the CL.

The only transfers we lost money on, and did not add anything to the team was Gilberto, Hutton, dos Santos, and Gomes.

Weigh that up against Defoe, Keane, Modric, Jenas, Kanoute, Berbatov, Walker, van der Vaart, Dawson, Malbranque, Verhongen, Lloris etc.",0,1414010213,null,0,false,0,clgwdvb,t3_2jzd67,t1_clgwdvb,t1_clguw1q,null,1426400122,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The food's very good, the veg is far, far cheaper than Tesco and I love the fact that there's very little choice. Want a packet of pasta? You get one to choose from in Lidl. In Tesco, you have 10 or 20 different brands and you have to examine all the labels to see which one works out cheapest. Who the hell needs 30 types of Frosties, or 17 different brands of washing powder, most of which are made by just three or four companies.

What I find most interesting, though, is all the high-end cars that are in the car park at Lidl now; range rovers, Audis, beemers, etc. Most less than 3 years old, too.

Lidl is still privately owned, so no taking shortcuts to please shareholders, no loyalty card to data mine your every purchase, few buy one get one free offers that encourage you to buy shit you don't need, let alone the Tesco classic of buy two for £5, when the single price is £2.20.

- Balotelli can't ever play lone striker again. Give him a partner and tell him to stay in the middle. And Sterling and/or Coutinho can't be his partner, they are running around the wings. Ideally Sturridge, but Borini doesn't need to be a bad alternative. Not Lambert however. Lambert is a shite Balotelli, and that says something right now.

- However, Balotelli isn't at fault for our poor form at the moment. The entire team looks out of their depth and nowhere near what we had last year.

- Since we apparently not are going to score 5 goals a game this season, we need to focus on defense in training, especially defending set pieces. We have quite a few really good defenders that somehow become shit when they play together for us. It's not their quality that's the problem, it's the training.

- Apparently we're back at the ""Rodgers is out of his depth and makes poor decisions"" now, just as it was year before last. I'm not saying he's infallible, nor that he was perfect tonight. But he's young, and still learning the game.

- I think Rodgers made a bad decision to play with a diamond 4-4-2 in the first half. When we do, our full backs push right up and Gerrard drops in between the centre halfs, almost in a 3-5-2. Obviously Skrtel-Gerrard-Lovren is not the best back 3 you could choose to defend against Real Madrid.

- Sterling did okay in his first start as an out-and -out striker, but only ok. He made some good runs and get into difficult areas, but he didn't beat his man very often, and gave the ball away on the edge of the box more than once.

- Our corners, both attacking and defending, were horrendous. Everyone will focus on our defensive ones obviously, since we conceded that way, but really our attacking corners were no better. I said in the match thread, they may as well have been Madrid goal kicks, since we didn't get on the end of a single one of them.

- Our pressing in the first 20 minutes was excellent, not sure why we backed off. We showed no fear, but then for the next 60 minutes we gave Madrid enough time on the ball to dictate the game.

- Rodgers did well to take off Balotelli and give us an extra man in midfield, which we needed from the start. Obviously Coutinho and Henderson were subbed to be rested for midweek. We did better in the second half, but we still didn't look like scoring.

- Ludogorets scored a last minute winner against Basel, so the group is still wide open.",0,1414010834,null,0,false,0,clgwrj3,t3_2k10wk,t1_clgwrj3,t3_2k10wk,null,1426399945,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Even Balo had his moments, though everyone in the match thread was giving him shit.  We lost because our defense stinks.  Do we have scoring problems? Yes, but we have bigger problems at the back.

I saw a few people defending Glen Johnson in the match thread but I honestly can't see why.  Other than the cross to Sterling around the 83rd mark, he was absolutely dreadful. If he starts against Hull I'll be surprised.  His passing was atrocious and he would repeatedly lose the ball, even when Madrid had stopped pressing. He was good for us once but he hasn't been the same in ages.  He should have left in the summer.

He doesn't help himself at all. For me unless the final whistle has gone, don't swap shirts with anyone unless its the kit man because you've thrown your face in the way of an oncoming boot on the goal line and broken every bone in your face and lost several teeth and got your kit covered in blood.

He's not a 'mobile' striker? THEN BECOME A MOBILE FUCKING STRIKER. I'm sick of this absolutely bullshit idea that people in football play how they play and that's final. Balotelli CAN work harder for the team as a front man, it IS physically possible for him to do so. If he finds it hard on his body, then demand more from your body. Train harder, get fitter, make becoming more mobile your number one priority. 

If you're not a natural poacher like Raul or Huntelaar then study the fuck out of them. Know what they do. Understand how they play because the team NEEDS a goal-mouth striker at the moment, so play for the team and get in the fucking box rather than getting yourself on the angle on your right foot and blasting it high and wide without fail every single time. 

Tonight's loss wasn't Balotelli's fault. Let me make that clear. I'm not blaming him (although his closing down on Kroos for the second was absolutely fucking criminal). Because for me it's a clear lack of fucking testicles between Mignolet, Lovren &amp; Skrtel. There's absolutely no desire for somebody to say ""this is my man, and he's going to get absolutely fucking cunted before he gets his head on this."" it's too passive, too nice and too pretty.

Remember when ran riot at the end of BR's first season? Coutinho. Remember that beautiful assist against Dortmund? Coutinho. Remember 3-2 against City? Remember 3-2 against QPR? Cou-fucking-tinho.

And now Mason's proving why he gets those starts. A season ago he was out injured and in a League 1 side. He doesn't score goals or any glamorous work like that, but he's the closest we have to a midfield distributor.  

And in all fairness, Paulinho's whopping 6 goals in 30 league games for us is just a garbage stat. I'm not asking for Toure or Lampard-esque numbers from him, but six goals isn't glistening. 

EDIT: And I'd absolutely say that the current youth batch has been working out. Harry Kane is in much better form that Soldado right now, Bentaleb is a good squad player who has loads of time to develop, and Mason hasn't looked out his depth.

Pro tip. If you see Oscar and Matic fouling people and not conceding a card, they're doing their job right. Both are exceptionally good at that particular art. It breaks up play, allows everyone to reorganise and is frustrating for the opposition. You'll often see them do little digs - which slows down play even if the ref plays the advantage. Oscar regularly breaks up opposition attacks as they are forming in the opposition's half. It's very difficult for a ref to give a card as it's so deep. Matic performs a similar role deeper on the pitch. Matic may have given away a penalty, but it ultimately didn't matter, and it didn't detract from the fact that he had a very good game again. Nathan Ake also looked good, made one (tiny) mistake with his positioning when he attempted to charge down a ball near their area, and played a pass back to his captain when he first came on that he arguable didn't need to, but I'm basically nitpicking in what was otherwise an almost flawless performance. 

Eden Hazard on the other hand was a bit too showboaty for my tastes. I enjoyed his runs from an entertainment perspective, but I think Mourinho would have been pissed off with his overall attitude and performance. Too many touches, too many attempts at the spectacular, and too many attempts to embarrass opposition defenders when the simpler pass would have been the better option.

There is a builder up the road from me who just built two new houses and they went on the market 4 months ago. I walked past him a few days ago, and he was speaking to another neighbor. The neighbor asked him ""Did you have any luck yet"", ""No"" said the builder. ""Banks are being to difficult and my last two were refused a mortgage. I don't what I will do if they don't sell soon.""

I've gone for two years in a row on Wrong Weekend, and some highlights I've seen are:

* A kid ""dressed"" as a blue porto-john 
* Scarlett O'Hara
* A full set of the then-11 Doctors
* A guy dressed as Iron Man with a chef's coat: Iron Chef-Man
* Two guys dressed as the Robertson family from Duck Dynasty
* A full set of Disney Princesses
* Storm Troopers (some in kilts!)
* Klingons (also, some in kilts)
* Rachel from Glee
* Mario and Luigi
* Batman

The rest of Faire, I really don't see adults dressing up in costumes without them being Med/Ren appropriate.  You can always tell the little girls who went to Disney over the course of the year, though, because with the amount they paid for it, damn skippity their parents are getting another use out of that princess dress.  In some of those families, I've seen a few brothers dressed as Superheroes as well, but then again who's going to tell a kid that Belle is welcome but not Batman?  No one.

I didn't dress up this year for Wrong Weekend (mostly because I got the dates wrong and thought it was next weekend).  As someone who's spent the last several months knitting a Doctor Who scarf, however, I loved being able to chat craftsmanship with some of the folks I saw who were wearing their own homemade creations.

For the Hazard Perception test, here's a tip that served me well; don't be afraid from clicking ""lots"" during the clips. I would click roughly 5-10 times each clip.

Not all at once of course. When I saw the first signs of a hazard that could develop (such as a reversing car), I would tell myself what was happening as I clicked:

""He's pulling out"" *Click*

*Wait 1 second*

""He's still pulling out"" *Click*

*Wait 1 second*

""He's still pulling out"" *Click*

By then the hazard should have fully progressed and might have developed into a hazard. Doing it this way ensured I covered all the possible wiggle room - because remember, you lose points as the hazard develops. Most people are cagey at first about making sure it's a hazard, but the system has a lot more wiggle room than they realise.

false,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,"High speed rail link between Dublin Airport and Belfast, the trains come back up to Northern Ireland again, hopefully fully of foreign visitors willing to spend spend spend spend. Spending money on cross border infrastructure would benefit Northern Ireland greatly.

Improving the infrastructure does not mean keeping open 2 airports within a XX mile radius of each other which fly to generally the same places. Remove the Continental NY link to Belfast, where does BFS fly to that the Harbour airport doesn't? There's a reason why Air Lingus (sic) and BA moved from the BFS to the Harbour. It's a better airport with better transport links.

17 pound return plus 90 minutes in a WiFi enabled, air conditioned coach is a small price to pay than hiking to a cold outdated and it's falling apartm BFS. Add onto that the savings (like the chap below) you make in flight and you'd be silly not to consider flying from Dublin.

As someone who lives in the states, a resident not a citizen, believe me, it is a lot easier and more pleasant getting processed this side of the Atlantic than t'other. You try dealing with 20+ foreign flights, some from the middle and far east all landing at EWR and the TSA only having 10 agents on. It is a nightmare I wouldn't wish on anyone.

Call me a crazy mofo but I'm also pretty certain that not everyone who uses Dublin airport comes from the Dublin metropolitan area. So the silly remark about 1mil metro area of my South Antrim town doesn't really prove anything other than you're trying desperately to clever. 

I take your point about my comment regarding always going to Dublin. It was personal preference but as someone who makes the flight from this side to the USA several times a year.

I believe the inhabitants of the Falklands have the right to self determination and they have overwhelmingly chosen to stay part of Britain's overseas territories - seems clear that the British Government will always defend that decision.

You can argue that piracy in the long run increases profit (due to advertising etc), but directly you are not purchasing something you may have otherwise been purchasing.

It's a lost sale that otherwise would have existed. It's not as bad as theft as I said before, but if you would have bought a product **if** there was no other way to get it, then pirating has lost them a sale.

I mean, take it to the worst case scenario. Everyone pirates, the creators get no money for their work. So you should be able to see that the **direct** nature of piracy is bad. The fact that it might actually lead to profits is irrelevant.

false,rydleo,null,null,"I don't think it would help at all, to be honest.  It's just the way Rodgers has the team set up.  My take on it:

1)  Pushing both fullbacks up constantly is stupid.  If the attacking play is on the left, then Moreno pushes up, Johnson hangs back a bit, the CBs shift slightly left of center.  Vice versa if it's on the right.  If it's central then one FB might join in, but not both.  Ever.

2)  Splitting the CBs so far apart is also stupid.  They are way, way too far apart for large spells of the game.  CBs like to be relatively near their counterpart to improve communication and ensure they're covering the field.  It's far easier to move wide to cover defensively then it is to try and collapse centrally (witness Ronaldo's first goal as a good example, although it was a class finish on a class pass).

3)  We suck at heading.  Our midfielders rarely win headers and even if they do they don't go anywhere near a teammate usually.  Move to set pieces and we've got basically one player in Skrtel who's somewhat decent at handling balls in at head level with everyone else being pretty shitty at it.  

4)  Never in a million years does it make sense for me for our deepest midfielder to be deeper than our CBs.  Why do this?  It's just asking for trouble.

5)  Mignolet.  Seems a nice kid and he has good reflexes, but his kicking is pretty shit (although again our inability to ever win a header doesn't help) and he needs to seriously work on how to play as a sweeper and clean shit up that's over the top.  Also, he sucks at handling corners and free kicks too, which also doesn't help on set pieces.

We don't need a defensive coach as BR would have to be an idiot not to see the issues, it's just for whatever reason he hasn't done anything to solve them.  Practice headers (everyone), get Achterberg (who I have 0 confidence in) to actually work on Mignolet's flaws, stop splitting the CBs so much, hold one of the FBs back a bit on the attack, and have Gerrard move about 10 yards forward and I think the problems all go away.",0,1414021252,null,0,false,0,clh22z8,t3_2k1koz,t1_clh22z8,t3_2k1koz,null,1426397463,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

My eyes did not leave that screen the entire match. I asked if I could accumulate my breaks into one so I could watch it and my god, I was a wreck of a man by the end! We won convincingly and we did it with style. I was so proud of them. Seeing the fans hold Sir Rickie Lambert (Got a nice ring to it, that's all I'm saying!) aloft like the God he is and watching Nige look on the team like a proud parent whilst trying to hold back tears. Incredible. I was on cloud 9.

I don't think I've ever had a stand out favourite player, thinking about it. It's difficult to name a favourite as they're such a cohesive unit and I tend to just find they all have such attractive qualities about their game that it makes it tough to choose a single player! Having said that, I do wish we'd give Cork the new contract he so rightly deserves!

I've not bought the last few kits as...to be honest...I didn't like them. We lost the stripes and, in my opinion, we momentarily lost our identity. The last shirt I bought was the 125 year anniversary shirt. I love it. This year's shirt is wonderful but I simply didn't have the money to buy it on Saturday. It's on my list!

It's often a surprise to people! Well it was in the past, anyway. I've had people call me a glory hunter in recent weeks which is just incredible! Who'd have thought that supporting Southampton, a team that have had everything thrown at them, would someday qualify as glory hunting! I live relatively near London and I'm usually surrounded by Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelski, United and City fans so we're few and far between around here. Also...we get a lot of Portsmouth fans around here! I was best man at a Portsmouth fan's wedding, in fact. That was an interesting day...being a Saint amongst the Skates. Very uneasy feeling, that was.

Like I said, I try and see them at least a handful of times a season. If not, I'll watch them on TV, if we're on...which isn't often.

Haha! Not particularly! I think we suffer quite badly with broadcasting. We play brilliant football, week in and week out yet we're always down the list when it comes to highlights. You can bet we'll get the shortest segment as well!

My point is that we have been and always will have acted far worse than any other nation on earth period - it's not relative when you invoke the behaviour of a religion based in a country that hasn't even had the equivalent of a sexual revolution. People who are raised under old fashioned, pre-war philosophies will act that way.

&gt; As did the Romans. And Alexander. And Napoleon. And the Mongols 

You can take your Stalins, Hitlers, Napoleons and Khans and combine ALL their numbers and still fall well short. Khan killed 40 million across swathes of countries - we did that in ONE country. The numbers are argued about but some estimates total something around the 1.8 billion mark.

&gt;This phenomenon has existed in animation for years, dating back to early [Warner Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.)' *[Looney Tunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes)*/*[Merrie Melodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrie_Melodies)* animated cartoons.

false,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I didn't say anything about criminality, IP law or excuses. Piracy exists, it always will. Piracy has an effect on companies, it always will.

We need to step away from the idea that the solution is in making people stop and into a place where business understand the most effective way to combat it is to accept that it exists, learn from it and dream up attractive alternatives that meet the needs of today's consumers.

As a **business** you simply cannot live in this starry eyed fantasy world where you don't have to worry about illegal things as if them being illegal means they magically can't harm you. They can, they will and other businesses that take the pragmatic approach will quite happily take your falling market share off you.

Do you remember the game developer **Hunted Cow**? No, nobody does. Anyway they made an iOS game and completely ignored the existence of piracy whilst doing so. They released the game, *it got pirated*, and because they didn't put *any* kind of legitimacy check into it what-so-ever the pirated copies created so much additional load on their servers it revealed stability flaws they didn't know existed. So they just took the game offline **for 4 months whilst they fixed it**.

Now the people behind that company can run around all the lawyers, courthouses, politicians and anti-piracy internet forums they can find until the day they die but they are never getting that lost revenue back because nobody really *took* money from them. That money loss was entirely the fault of the developers, they made shitty decisions that ignored part of reality and it cost them.

You can whine about how it wouldn't have cost them if piracy didn't exist but it **does exist**, it's not a secret and it's not going away regardless of how criminalised you make it. This is the world we live in, file sharing is what computers were invented to do. Plenty of companies are out their making money, anyone blaming piracy for their downfall is just using it as a scapegoat for their own business incompetence.

How the hell do you already know this? He's played like five games for us at most. So it's not okay to write off Paulinho, because he'll net like fifteen according to you, but it's perfectly fine to just move Mason out of the way? Why ruin his confidence when he's fought tooth and nail to even come back to this club? 

I still maintain that besides Cardiff and Stoke, he was shit for us. He's forgettable in every sense of the word. 

It's six goals, Jesus. He had his chance, and didn't exactly put up Lampard numbers, and with how we're going to be playing, a goal threat from deep is a luxury so long as the front four works. 

Fundamentally, no one ""deserves"" spot. It's earned, and he just hasn't earned it. That's why Mason is ahead of him. 

&gt;If you think mason and bentaleb are better then paulinho and dembele then I truly feel sorry for you.

Oh, okay, so now you're putting words in my mouth. No need to feel sorry for me.

I never said that I think Mason and Bentaleb are better than the other two (but Paulinho is shockingly average no doubt), but the academy products are definitely a step above in current form for right now. Paulinho looks like he doesn't care whenever he plays. Mason plays for the shirt. That's the basic difference between the two: passion.

Balo hasn't been playing poorly. I'll admit, he's made questionable decisions at times, but he's a striker that relies on service. He's not a Suarez or Aguero kind of striker that can create opportunities for himself. Unfortunately, the service just hasn't been there, bar that sitter he missed against QPR. Has his movement been poor? Perhaps. But most of the time I've seen him at the right end of balls in positions to score. The service has just been sub-par. 

He does possess the ability to create for others. However, Sturridge has been out all season. No one in our starting 11 can score goals consistently, so there's no one he can feed to. Maybe Raheem, but that is still very limited options. 

I just want everyone to wait and give Balo a proper evaluation when he starts playing alongside Sturridge. That's when I'm convinced we'll see his best.
