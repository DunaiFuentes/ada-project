What I don't understand is why do these people listen to the news papers, decide it's absolute fact a then arrange an attack on the crew? They should know better than this. 
In the show you can also see the main leader (I forget his name) saying he arranged a mob of people. It seems like they all listened to him. He should be held accountable! That's why we think it's a joke when your government asks for an apology. 

As you say, your country is beautiful and the episode really showcased this, but these idiots at the end really let everyone else down. It makes us think people in Argentina hate the UK. Your government also doesn't help with how they handle such incidents, especially when your Prime Minister talked about re-invading the Falklands recently.

Most people in the UK don't think everyone in Argentina is like this though, we understand people have different views. It's just difficult for us to take your country seriously when the government constantly causes issues and acts as a valid threat to British life and territory.

I swear people prefer one player and they say the other one is total shit, without looking at it remotely objectively. You're not being fair to either Schurrle or Willian in your assessment. You're making Schurrle seem worse than he's been and Willian better. Even if Schurrle has been utter shit, he was actually contributing to the offense early on in the season. Willian doesn't score that Burnley goal or City goal because Willian doesn't make those types of runs. You're also ignoring that Schurrle has been dealing and recovering with illness.

If we were appalling in the first half with Schurrle, we must have been terrible in the second half by your logic. We literally had 1 shot on target in the first half and 0 in the second half. How is that any better? Willian does not create chances any other decent winger couldn't. His final pass is atrocious either hitting a defender straight or behind the recipient slowing down the counter the majority of the time. His shooting is god awful and he's not even threatening keepers when he shoots it straight at them on the ground with no power or sailing way above the net. His positioning is also mediocre. He often just stands around when we're probing instead of either making space (lots of times he just stands next to Costa doing nothing) or making runs for himself that guys like Fabregas, Hazard or Oscar can spot and assist him with. He's also too conservative with the ball. There will be times we're on a break, Willian gets the ball and he just stops. He then does this right leg fake and passes it back, killing the counter. For such a great dribbler, you don't see him try to dribble past defenders enough. It's great that Willian tracks back so much, but I'm sick of the fucking pathetic excuses on offense. Him tracking back doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to make a killer final pass, take a shot that tests the keeper or position himself to either help a teammate get space or him get a goal.

Willian is the better choice at the moment because Schurrle's in bad form but people who think Willian is crucial at creating chances aren't playing close attention or are misattributing his work rate for final third production.  Of course he's going to gel better when he has a significantly large amount of minutes compared to Schurrle.

I can't find the exact articles I read, but between 2012-2013 things got very heated. As more comments were made, new news articles were written so it's hard to find exact comments. Here are a few that may still be of interest:  
&amp;nbsp;

[President Fernández explaining we should give back the island.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/02/argentina-britain-hand-back-falklands)  
&amp;nbsp;

[Argentina has threatened oil businesses operating off the Falkland Islands with fines, confiscations and jail sentences for their executives.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25149096)  
&amp;nbsp;

[Foreign minister Hector Timerman tells the BBC that The Falkland Islands will be back under Argentine control within 20 years during a visit to London.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21341578)  
&amp;nbsp;

I can't find the news coverage about this but this BBC article states [""The Argentine parliament passed a law laying claim to the Falklands, along with nearby South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands, in a move rejected by the UK.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18425572)  
&amp;nbsp;

Prince Harry was stationed on The Falklands as part of an RAF Search and Rescue crew for a while. The Royal Navy also 'routinely' tasked some ships in the area, most notable was HMS Dauntless. Argentina claimed this was an act of provoking war.  
&amp;nbsp;

The Falkland Island Government [held a referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013) which resulted in a 99.8% vote to retain the current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. The Argentinian government rejected the referendum, further making claims to ownership and unlawful British occupation.

false,wesleynukem,null,null,"1) Aging... Barry and Distin both seem to have lost a step (and maybe even Jags as well) and while the team may have been able to cope with one of them slowing down, we're incredibly susceptible on the break, especially when our wing backs go forward. This also hurts us in transition... one of the reasons John Stones is so good is that he can accelerate and free himself up, allowing him to pick out a forward pass (rather than playing it backwards). http://youtu.be/ExtM3JTv630?t=2m18s

2) Bad luck. Howard played out of his mind last year, saving significantly above the average number of close range shots. This year, he's below the average. A little bit of it might be age, but we're talking about the type of saves that are basically wildly throwing out a limb, so it's also very likely that he just hasn't been as lucky. As StatsBomb wrote before the season...

&gt; I’ve written previously about Tim Howard’s huge performance last season. Unfortunately for the Blues, history shows that such over-performance isn’t sustainable. Howard was undeniably good last season, but luck also played a huge factor. His save% from the prime Zone 1 area was 57%. League average is 44% – a keeper has more chance of callling heads or tails on a coin toss than saving a shot from here. Basically, the numbers suggest it’s far more likely that more of the same next season will result in nearer 50 goals conceded than 40. Unless the shot count goes down, expect Everton to get stung a little more often.

He should be held accountable! That's why we think it's a joke when your government asks for an apology.

Yes! I know! I had some arguments over in /r/argentina about this. I try to tell them that it doesn't matter if the number plate was intentional or not and wether we are offended or not is not the issue here. The issue here is the idiots we have running things! Like argentina can afford to be at war right now... We are not even well viewed by the international community, so we just can't afford to be killing celebrities of a country that can literally destroy our cities in less than 24 hours.

About the people's reaction... Most people over here don't do much critical thinking. As I said, the media controls everything, and that's the only thing that people watch. So they are not forming an opinion on facts, they are just brainwashed on ideas that someone else stuck them in their heads. And yeah, I know that maybe this is not an argentinian specific issue and it happens everywhere in the world, but it is an issue anyway.

&gt; Also, the fact that you guys claim the Falklands are the Malvinas (and get quite vocal about it too) annoys us a little.

To be fair, we learn that name (and they make us study it) since we are in primary school and make us color the maps. It's so stuck in our heads the idea that you guys took the islands from us that we don't even consider another alternative. Hopefully with the power of the internet people can start listening to more points of view and say ""oh hey, that thing they taught us at school is utter bullshit"". Who knows really, time will tell...

Sure, Mangala can be brash and push forward too much. Sure he earns dumb yellow cards but we have to remember, he is still very young for a defender. None of his mistakes are through lack of trying either.

It sounds cliche but he needs time. The EPL is the best league in the world and we have thrown a young defender from the Portuguese league straight into a title defence. I truly think that a season under the wing of Kompany he will calm down.

He has immense talent, everyone can see that but the problems he is having are maturity problems which will pass over time. He's the right guy for the job. Today was one of those days, they happen.

I think they were as crucial (if not more) than Bale to our achievements under Redknapp.

Mason - probably the best passer we have in CM, but inconsistent and doesn't offer enough defensively (is he really that much better than Holtby? oh well I guess being homegrown is an advantage here)

Bentaleb - has talent but still nowhere near top 4 level. Lacking defensively and in attack at the moment. Wouldn't object to see him go out on loan.

Dembele - talented and I think he should be playing more, however Poch disagrees...

Capoue - not mobile enough, useless on the ball, quite average midfield destroyer. I'd sell him.

Stambouli - maybe more mobile than Capoue but not particularly impressive so far. Doesn't offer much on the ball.

Paulinho - good player but doesn't fit the system and Poch doesn't seem to like him.

2 Most commonly Golden Virginia or Old Holborn in small bricks wrapped in paper backed foil. You bought the papers separately usually Rizla brand, green or red, I think the green were marked for using in rolling machines, can't remember or blue was thinner paper. Rolling machines weren't uncommon in the 70's and larger ones could be used for rolling joints.

3. Golden Virginia and Old Holborn for rolling, later in the 80's Drum or the imported version called Duma rolling tobacco were popular, these came in plastic wallet type packing. There was another similar brand called Samson. Fags- Players Number 6 (more popular in the 70's), Benson and Hedges Gold, John Player Red, Blue or Black, Marlboro red.

4. Can't remember exactly, sorry.

5. Not sure they are different? Not smoked for years.

6. Blue Rizlas weren't so common in the 70's as the 80's. People used roach filters in the 80's (a bit of card torn off the Rizla packet usually) but generally most people didn't do that, maybe more of an alternative culture type thing? (I lived in Glastonbury in the 80's). I didn't see people use bought filters until the 90's. I never saw rolling machines in common use in the 80's, they were more of a 70's thing.

7. In the 70's, joints, might have been more but I was a child and only saw joints being smoked. In the 80's bongs and pipes became more popular. Either resin or green stuff, whatever people call it right now, I think I called it grass back then? In the 80's Lebanese black was what most people would like to buy/smoke but usually you ended up with something lighter colour 'something' gold, can't remember the name or a bag of herb looking stuff, didn't look like the weed people buy now. some people grew a couple of plants for their own use. Very rarely I saw cannabis oil in the 80's, like black tar and stored/bought in lengths of drinking straw. You made a joint by joining three Rizlas together or using extra large size Rizlas and made a card roach. some people would break down a ready made cigarette for the tobacco rather than use rolling tobacco

false,bellenya,null,null,"**Name of product:** Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel

**Price of product:** £30.00 for 125ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel is oil-free and non-comedogenic. It gives you the lightweight hydration without oiliness so your skin feels smoother, softer and more comfortable.*

**About you:** Sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin (mostly closed comedones with the occasional cyst depending on the time of the month). Particularly sensitive to fatty alcohols.

**Your opinion:** I bought this product as the gel moisturiser I'd been using throughout last summer (Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel) wasn't quite hydrating enough for my drier winter skin. It has a very lightweight consistency, glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, and lasts all day. It leaves my skin with a dewy finish rather than a matte finish, but I'll take that over the oil slick that my face used to be any day. Most importantly, my skin hasn't had any negative reaction to it! Unfortunately, it's a bit on the expensive side, even though I reckon 125ml will last me 5-6 months of twice-daily use (at two pumps a time), but I'll still be re-purchasing as it's worth it for me personally.

So we took it back...only to be told by one of the ""tech support"" guys that there was nothing wrong with it, it was working how it should be, she'd had a chance to try them out in store so wasn't getting a refund.

&gt; Yes I have. After a blazing row with my mother - who would not accept or believe that the misery the people of our neighborhood were being subjected to was caused by the Conservative government (UK) - I ran upstairs to my bedroom in floods of tears. I jumped onto my bed and put my head in my hands sobbing - then I felt something.
&gt; 
&gt; I lifted my head from my hands, and there is a young man standing next to the bed. He has a tight, dark beard and tight, dark, curly hair. He is wearing a weaved cloak, tied with a thick belt and large buckle. He has a crook in his right hand and is leaning down tending something which I can't see, but is buffeting him and surrounding him. It is his flock.
&gt; 
&gt; As I look up and look at him, he looks at me. His gaze is intense but comforting. He doesn't let up even though his flock is jostling him, and I am transfixed by him. He leans in toward me and as he gets closer, his eyes sink into the back of his head and I am staring into the voids of his eye sockets. Then I can see only the void, and then I am alone again.

They over subscribe tickets because they can't afford spaces in the audience for the recording, it would look bad.

To your question; yes there's lots - they record for well over two hours to ensure they have enough. That does mean sitting through some more flat moments but also some rambling ones which are hilarious but far too convoluted to weave in to the shorter show.

There was a recent news story about the Argentine government putting up posters in all pubic places, saying ""The Malvinas are ours"" or some such thing. My immediate thought was ""ah, so the government is in some sort of trouble, then.""

It being close to elections in Argentina certainly explains that. Before the 1982 conflict, the British government was considering handing over the islands to the Argentinian government. For other reasons, the British government under Thatcher was in trouble, politically.

The 1982 invasion was a god-send for Thatcher. The resulting conflict won her the next election. It was as if the two governments had a penalty shoot-out using the lives of their soldiers to decide who stayed in power in their own country.

Personally, I don't bear any ill-will to the Argentinian people, and I know how nationalism gets hyped up, and how easy it is to use. We have a similar problem here right now with a political party called UKIP, who are busy trying to stir up bad feeling towards foreigners: and if we had a similar situation with, say, the island of Jersey, you better believe that they'd be using that.

And our current government *is doing the same thing right now* over the EU. We may very well have to leave it in a few years just because they want to say untrue things to make it look as if they are being strong against ""the foreigners"". It'd be laughable if it wasn't so damaging.

Those people in the tv show were basically the same as the ""English Defense League"" here. I can well imagine a similar scenario happening here if an world-famous Argentinian tv crew showed up with a car with the registration ""H892MAL"".

In England, terracing has been banned since Hillsborough. There's an allocated seat for every fan in the ground and they're encouraged to sit. There's regularly announcements over the tannoy in Anfield for fans to remain seated, but from my experience a lot of the Kop stand most of the game, and in other areas, they stay seated *unless* there's a chance. If it looks like there might be a chance, everyone stands up in anticipation.

For European matches and international matches, terracing is also banned I believe. In general, all over Europe, regulations on seating/standing are very very lax if the stadium isn't full. If it's a cauldron like Anfield that's always sold out, they'll be very serious on it.

Muslims are an immensely diverse group of people, islamophobia homogenizes their and their beliefs into a single easily condemnable unit.

The truth is there are all kinds of Muslims, an Albanian muslim is quite different from a Sudanese muslim which is different from an Indonesian muslim which is different from a Saudi muslim. A shia is different, from a salafist, which is different from a salafist-jihadist which is different from a sufi which is different from a koranist which is different from a sunni which is different from a non-denominationalist which is different from a cultural muslim. When you talk about islam you are talking about a really very diverse range of beliefs and practices. Pretty much the only thing they have in common are the five pillars. When you condemn that religion and you are condemning peoples beliefs, remember you haven't asked those people what those beliefs are you have decided for them and you will be condemning people for based on your opinion about their belief system not their actual belief system, you will be condemning them for behaviours they might not exhibit, you will be condemning them for attitudes you think they hold. Islam has been with us for 1300 years and are of course as influenced by local cultures. There is a wiki page on islamic schools and branches 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_schools_and_branches

There is fundamental tenet of justice in the western world and that is everyone is treated as an individual. Every single muslim on this planet is an individual with their own politics, their own lives, their own backgrounds, their own influences, their own religious beliefs. They are all individuals and they deserve to be respected as such. If there is one thing you can say about British people is we value fairness. If you value fairness then islamophobia makes no sense at all.

If you still doubt what I'm saying, start a twitter account and add some muslims and just listen to what they are saying on a day to day basis, start with someone like Tariq Ramadan who is professor of Theology at Oxford University and start adding some of his followers and then check out what they are saying on a daily basis. You may find a marked difference between the language used by religious Muslims and the language used by the likes of Anjem Choudary.

I'd stick with a new jacket, as the leather moulds to you and they see more abuse. Second hand leather trousers are fine though. Scour ebay for some to match your jacket. So they can zip together. 

Again with boots, if it's just for summer use. There are some top quality A*, dainese and sidi boots usually going cheap and barely used. As most people often can't be bothered to don leather boots and trousers.

Gloves need to be tried on, so just get whatever the budget allows. I have some non branded hypora leather gloves with carbon sliders that do a decent job. I also have a pair of short Frank Thomas gloves that cost £30 which did fine in summer. Richa make some decently priced gloves too.

On almost every goal we've conceded in the last five or six games, and many of the chances that should have been put away, Fazio is marking the scorer and he's at least three yards behind.

This sub is biased against visible mistakes, which is understandable. Kaboul flies in on strikers in the penalty area and at the half way line where he holds the line. It costs us goals. Fazio, who has been sent off twice in only 17 appearances, makes mistakes too, and they are not less frequent or less serious, but lately we've not been punished because Hugo is playing out of his skin. He can't keep up with strikers running through, and when one or two of his persistent failings result in a goal, he'll be protected by it being ""a drop in form"" and we should ""stick by the pairing"". Once four or five have been punished in a couple of games, then his head will be on the chopping block with all of our other fucking centre backs who've played more than a handful of games.

It's not an easy job, the defenders have different characteristics. Kaboul is quick, loud and dominant. He dives in when it would sometimes be better not to, but sometimes those come off too. He also dribbles the ball out of defence. It's all high risk high gain strategy.

Fazio, like Dawson, sits deeper and tries to go for high balls. You will see him clatter strikers and smash away headers, but he's too slow to mark premier league strikers and he's always pulling their shirts. He's big and brave, and he clonks the ball forward when he gets it.

Vlad is David Luiz.

Jan, like Vlad, is a ball player. He has good touch, but his attribute that sets him apart from the others is his ability to read the game. He knows where the danger is. Jan though is not a leader and it seems to me that his head drops when things are going badly.

None of these defenders are god. All of these defenders are ok for a club with top 4 ambitions. Liverpool have Kolo Toure, City have the ghost of Demichelis, Arsenal are shit.

I'm just sick of people shitting on Kaboul because it's just not the case that he's a bad defender. At his best - which he HAS played at since his injury at times - he is incredible, as is Jan. Faz is Dawson, Jan and Kaboul are King. I am comfortable with Faz in the right games, but I think our strongest pairing to stick to is those two at their best. But in general my point is nobody's perfect so don't be surprised when in a few games Faz's mistakes are exposed or referees clamp down on the shirt pulling etc and it's like he's suddenly fallible and everybody jumps on him.

It's hard to find a source in english, so this is the only one. Read the first paragraph of page 69 ""portraits of a soldier"".[3] This is portrayed very well in an argentine film called ""Iluminados por el Fuego"". The military (dictatorship) didn't have enough soldiers to fight the UK, so they took boys from 18 to 21 years old, gave them a frew months of training, and off you go.

It's probably worth saying in relation to that that they didn't totally expect to have to fight to keep the Falklands, the initial plan was that their Marines and Special Forces would invade and the Army would briefly occupy the islands and then be withdrawn (whilst making sure the British wouldn't be able to reoccupy the islands) whilst they negotiated at the UN for a transfer of Sovereignty. 

The escalation to a full occupation happened fairly organically over the months of planning, and by the time they realised how committed they were it was too late to do a great deal about it.

Although the menial farmers and the sect that dedicated themselves to helping others were scorned by the sect of scientists, researchers - the more intelligent people - they were every bit as valuable to the functioning of that society.

&gt;Hallo! I'm an international Asian IB student currently living in Egypt and have received offers from:
 
* University of Edinburgh
* University of Manchester 
* University of Sheffield

&gt;Still waiting from SOAS. This time last year, I was so sure on going to SOAS but now that I've received offers from the other unis, I'm starting to rethink my next move. I'm really keen on Edinburgh and Manchester (though this might change if I do end up getting an offer from SOAS, it'd be nice to live in London as the city has literally become my third home). I have friends studying in Edinburgh and they love it there. I'd like to know more about the environment/atmosphere/nightlife/etc at the unis I just listed above so I could make a proper judgement of all the unis before arriving to a final decision. 

&gt;Don't laugh at me but one of the attractive features of studying in Manchester would be being able to watch Man Utd's home games at Old Trafford (sorry City supporters who are reading this thread haha). I've been to Manchester before and I really liked it. It's not quite far from London so I can visit my mates studying there + my genius besties at Cambridge (if they get in). Cold climate and grey skies with virtually no sun for long periods of time are not a problem for me since I've lived in Russia before. (I consider temperature below -15'C as proper freezing cold)

The students union at Manchester sells discounted football tickets, and you're only a short bus / bike ride away from Old Trafford. The train links are really good - for instance, it's only 2 hours to London (I've done it as a day trip before). Luckily it's very rare for any of the places you've mentioned to get below -15C - even the locals would be struggling before you got to that point! We don't even get snow every winter. 

&gt;I will be studying Japanese Studies/Linguistics so multilingual/multicultural hotspots are what I'm looking for (I'd like to brush up my languages). I'm also a photography hobbyist, football fanatic (thus Manchester looking like a realllly good option), musician annnd academic buff (I'd like to be a university lecturer one day). I don't drink (I expect myself to be the one who brings my future drunk mates home hah) so not really interested in pubs. Night clubs on the other hand are another thing. 

Manchester is Europe's most linguistically diverse city http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/200-languages-manchester-revealed-as-most-linguistically-diverse-city-in-western-europe-8760225.html  

There's a photography society with its own darkroom http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/photography-society--2 

There are lots of music venues around Manchester (including a big gig venue on campus, the Academy, as well as off campus things like the O2 Apollo and the Phones4U Arena. There are also student led bands, orchestras and even a radio station (FuseFM). 

Manchester has lots of pubs (inevitably - this is the UK!) and a vast variety of nightclubs. However, students will often just go to the pub if they're not having a big night out or getting drunk, but still want to have a pint together, watch the footie etc. If they're going to a nightclub, they'll tend to drink at home together and then go out to the club. It's entirely acceptable for people to go to pubs and clubs but not drink - I have a (Muslim) friend who doesn't drink, so he always just drank Pepsi.  

&gt;**Questions**:

&gt;*  What are the living accomodations like? Average rent fee per week/month?

Read this http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2091577 and check out accommodation.Manchester.ac.UK for prices.  

&gt;*  Sports facilities? Are there any good dance studios offering dance lessons? What about archery/badminton?

There are dance societies, and I know there are dance studios at the Aquatics Centre, though they probably exist elsewhere too. There's also a badminton society too http://www.sport.manchester.ac.uk/sport/sportandfitness/  

The shooting club appears to have archery as a sideline http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/shooting-club--2 but do be aware that you can set up your own society, and the students' union will give you money to do so - and starting a successful archery club would look fantastic on your CV!  

&gt;*  Political views? (Living in Egypt has made me wary of political fanatics...)

The UK is incredibly safe from a political perspective. General elections are held every 5 years and are always peaceful and orderly. 

Violent protest is rare, and when it does occur, it's usually in London, and any violence is directed at the police rather than other protestors - even if you went and protested, you'd be highly unlikely to get injured. The last violent protests of any significant size were in London in 2010, student led, and were about the tuition fee rises. Many more protests pass off every year without trouble.

Protest is seen as being a legitimate part of the political process, and it's not something to worry about. 

&gt;*  How's the nightlife/entertainment scene? 

As above - it's wide and varied, and it will keep you more than entertained for 3 years. 

&gt;*  What sights would you recommend for photo shoots?

There are lots of picturesque areas in Manchester, from Castlefields to the rural Peak District. But join the photography society - I'm sure they'll have lots of ideas! 

&gt;*  Any chance of me getting small gigs as a translator or a photographer at one of the local businesses? I want to start earning some side money so I wouldn't have to rely entirely on my parents for financial needs + build up my CV for post-graduation work. 

You'll have to rely on your parents financially - as an international student, it's simply not possible to do otherwise. It's not recommended that you work more than 16 hours a week in termtime, and that's never enough to support an individual, even before you've considered tuition fees. 

Not a clue about photography, though you can always try your hand at freelance work. For translation, try the NHS and local council, who are big users of translators. There are also likely to be agencies who take translators on. This isn't really my specialist subject though! 

&gt;*  Academic facilities/resources? I plan on studying other subjects on my own for fun if I don't get killed by the amount of workload the professors will dish out on us. (I'm also interested in mathematics, history and sciences)

There's nothing to stop you from going and sitting in on lectures on an unofficial basis. You may also have some free choice credits which you can use to do a module from outside your degree. One unique feature of Manchester is the University College for Interdisciplinary Learning, which was set up relatively recently to help facilitate people taking modules in subjects outside their degree http://www.college.manchester.ac.uk/ 

In terms of facilities, there's the UK's largest single site academic library (4m books, several hundred computers) and the brand new 24/7 learning commons, which is essentially a large study space with desks, computers and group study rooms. 

&gt;*  Football - okay, what are the chances of me being able to watch a Premier League (Scottish League in the case of Edinburgh) match played at one of the nearby local stadiums? (Doesn't matter what club, I'm all for neutral games)

See above!

&gt;*  Photography dark rooms? What are the photography student unions like?

See above!

&gt;Apologies for the lengthy post &amp; set of questions but I'd like to know what to expect so I won't end up as the typical lost international student when I move to the UK. Cheers for taking your time to read this!

No problem! It's worth mentioning that Manchester has a really good orientation programme for international students, so you won't be left to completely fend for yourself!

false,verygneiss,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Much of Australia's coast is 'hard' geology, i.e. made of rock, which tends to be of highly resistant lithologies, e.g. gneiss. This means that large areas are not at high risk, as the coastlines are not retreating rapidly. A comparable situation in the UK would be much of Scotland's coastline.

In contrast, much of the east coast of England [has 'soft' geology](http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/groundwater/UKbaseline/images/geologyf.jpg), i.e. the material at the surface is composed of superficial sediments (deposited during the most recent glacial period and by marine processes) such as sand, gravel and clay. Even the bedrock is soft, e.g. the Chalk. These materials are easily eroded resulting in coastlines which retreat large distances over human timescales.

To compound the problems in the east and southeast of England, the region as a whole is subsiding due to isostatic rebound. The ice sheets of the Devensian glaciation were thickest in Scotland and the north of England, causing these regions to 'sink', i.e. the lithosphere deformed in an elastic fashion. The lithosphere has been responding elastically since deglaciation, meaning that Scotland is rising and southern England is sinking to compensate. This is exacerbated by increased compression of the clays in London and groundwater extraction.

I have seen this. I've travelled through several of the seaside towns in Norfolk, been to Skegness, and some of Dorset.  I just thought I was going to the *wrong* seaside towns.

Some of the villages along the Norfolk Coast looked like they have some money to spend, but some of the towns looked backwards to me. e.g. Hunstanton has that row of cheap houses and shops right near the seafront while the rest of the town looks quite nice. Cromer has the massive seawall (money was spent) but everything else looks like it hasn't had a lick of paint in 50 years.

I've heard that villages were lost over the centuries due to cliff erosion. So why do people still build on areas that will eventually fall in to the ocean?  I find it hard to believe that these are the only places which people can afford to live. I'm sure there's a certain amount of opportunism that they can live next to the sea for cheap for the duration of their lifetime - only to discover that their house will fall in to the sea before they die.",0,1419853667,null,0,false,0,cn88eej,t3_2qozrm,t1_cn88eej,t1_cn87u5h,null,1425168014,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Not all coastal property is the same value. Urban centres can spend a lot more on coastal defenses because the value of the property being protected is a lot higher. But along isolated, rural coastlines there will be property where the benefit of protecting against coastal erosion will be lower than the cost of mitigating against the risk of coastal erosion. 

This has been known for a long time, but the problem with introducing climate change is that it changes the assumptions that those kind of calculations have historically been based on. Coastal defenses built in the 70s and 80s would not have taken sea level rise caused by a warming climate into account. We're now spending roughly £1billion per year on new flood defenses, mainly to respond to the way flood risk in this country has been changing over the past couple of decades.

With Deep Breath, the slapstick is very much like Matt Smith (understandably). His stern nature reflects aspects not only of Hartnell, but also Pertwee and Colin Baker. The Troughton similarities seem less to me, but they were greatly just seen throughout Matt Smith's portrayal (I just had to love the ""oh, my giddy aunt"" catchphase usurped by Missy, though!). There are certainly moments of Davison found in Into the Dalek and Listen.  And yet, Capaldi's Doctor is also still very much his own. What an overall consistent and fantastic performance from him!  His dialogue about betrayal with Clara in Dark Water is certainly some of the best in all of Doctor Who.

&gt; I am sorry to hear that you did not receive the kind of service that we would expect from members of our team in our Currys store in Cheltenham, I can appreciate how disappointing this must be.

&gt;Our stores do need to offer additional services such as anti virus software and laptop set up's as some of our customers may require them however, the manner in which these services were offered is not what we would expect. Your comments have been passed to the Store Manager, this is so improvements can be made to our customer experience and your complaint has been logged under case reference CC******, of which please state in any future correspondence.

&gt;Hope this helps.

To not deploy a task force would have been monumentally stupid thing to do. Why? Because it itself is also a very potent diplomatic tool and also means you have military capability in the area to quickly strike when diplomacy fails, which it did. The (then incredibly desperate) Argentine government was in no mood to suddenly retreat (to do so would mean their downfall) so rebuffed the diplomatic advances. The UK had no other choice but to attack. 

Also read your response to the 'What would you do if you were a PM question' and sorry to inform you, but the Belgrano was part of a pincer movement by the Argentine navy to hit the task force from two sides (the other side of the pincer included their navy's only aircraft carrier), so sad as the loss of life may be, it had to be done to protect the task force. Diplomacy doesn't solve everything in this world, especially when you try to reason with desperate dictatorial regimes like the junta at the time. Sometimes you really have to use the stick when the carrot fails.

TL;DR: Diplomacy was tried, Task Force was sent out as means of diplomatic pressure, diplomacy failed, war ensued, Belgrano sank to protect UK fleet, don't try to reason with mad regimes.

What unseemly haste?

How long do you think the country should have waited before sending ships to deal with an invasion that had already occurred?

More to the point: Why are you talking about ""unseemly haste"" when we're talking about the action itself? You've gone from implying that Britain shouldn't have gone to war at all to saying that ""Oh, we should have, but not so quickly"".

Do you even know your opinion? And what for that matter is ""Calculated opportunism"" even supposed to mean? When it comes out of your mouth, it just sounds like an empty political buzzphrase. But unfortunately, opportunism does actually mean something already.

So perhaps you can explain *what this opportunity was that Thatcher was taking advantage of?* Are you claiming that she wanted to invade Argentina all along and that their invasion was the perfect pretext? Or are you claiming that she would have told the people of the Falklands to suck it had she been in a stronger position electorally?

&gt;Had other options to war as a means to ""preventing British citizens from having their homes invaded and placed under the control of a regime they never asked for"" been given sufficient consideration...

When another country invades you with troops and planes and ships, what other responses are there other than ""Repel the invasion with your own troops and planes and ships""?

It also *does* compare itself to others and is always looking to adapt and improve, sometimes successfully, sometimes not but it does try.

Could it do better? Yes. Does it show bias sometimes, maybe, but it also tries very hard to correct itself when it does.

We wouldn't do that to you. Ever. The Falklands war is a very minor thing here, and generally we view the need to keep military forces on the islands and an irritating necessity. 

We have absolutely no desire to see lives wasted over sheep farms again. 

Unfortunately, it's a huge political sticking point that the Falklands are British. The population want to be British, Argentina's claim is best characterised as weak, and British soldiers died to protect them. Our government simply can't release them, and has the overwhelming support of the people that there is no reason to. 

Despite the fact we'd rather not have to bother with the forces there, the idea that we might actually lose them is never seriously entertained. What makes us very sad is that your government continues to stir up popular sentiment about the islands as a nationalistic decoy from the real domestic problems. At best, this drags both of our countries in to a silly position, and at worst, it could see hundreds or thousands of our countrymen die again. 

The only way Argentina could keep the islands would be the near total destruction of the Royal Navy. I don't think Argentina has the capability to do that, but even if it could, that automatically means a huge number of wasted lives, British from the ships and Argentinian from trying. 

Hence this top gear episode is really viewed with a kind of sadness that there seems such an endemic desire to make the Falklands Argentinian, throughout the population. ",0,1419858927,null,0,false,0,cn89i2r,t3_2qomkp,t1_cn89i2r,t1_cn85jz6,null,1425167500,47,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,47

We already force companies into what are, from a purely capitalist perspective, unfair situations of for example forcing them to deal with maternity leave. In ""pure capitalism"" maternity leave as a concept is an abomination, so we already do not live in a purely capitalistic society.

And sure, it can be said for the Kop too - I've sat on the back row of the Kop and it was awkward to see stuff that happened at the near end of the pitch let alone the other end. The difference is that being in the Kop gives you the experience and atmosphere of being in the Kop, which I would argue makes up for it (though not right at the back, those seats are shit). 

If you're going to cheer on the team and enjoy the atmosphere, the Kop is the best. If you're going to watch the game and want a decent view, then it's either the Centenary or the non-obstructed seats in the Main Stand. I feel in the Annie Road you don't really get either.

It's not terrible, and the fact that it's tiered and none of the seats are *that* far away from the pitch means there aren't really any awful seats like there are at the back of the Kop or behind the pillars in the Main Stand, but if I was only ever going to go to one game at Anfield it wouldn't be anywhere near the top of my choices to sit.

A [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/457000/457033/html/nn2page1.stm) says that the Argentinians had ""12,000 [...] soldiers on the Falklands"", which obviously excludes naval and air forces.

If we take the figure of 12,000 ""soldiers on the Falklands"" and similarly exclude the loss of the 323 lost in the sinking of the Belgrano (who weren't on the islands), we get a loss rate of less than 3%. Therefore, it wouldn't be fair to say of the typical solider that ""He probably died, or lost most of his friends."" I don't mean to downplay the losses, but it's clear that the psychological and societal impact of the war is far more significant than the actual casualty figures.

1. Argentines recognise the *junta* as a terrible dictatorship and think very negatively of it.
2. Argentines associate the Falklands War with the *junta*.
3. Argentines know that the *junta* invaded the Falkland Islands ('starting' the Falklands War) which involved sending unwilling, conscripted Argentine soldiers to the Falkland Islands.

Even a moron could conclude that the British would inevitably, if they chose to try and retake the islands, end up killing some of the Argentine soldiers.

First of all, don't think that everybody in Argentina hate Brits. Only local pseudo-nationalists do, these people have their heads filled with propaganda (thing at what our government excels). Some of them even insult the germans because of the way things went in the World Cup final.
Luckly, it's a tiny, tiny minority of people that think that way, so the chance to actually encounter one of them is near to none.

Now, about the Top Gear special, I don't know if the licence plates were a coincidence or not. I trust it was, I don't think the BBC would stain it's reputation by joking with such a delicate topic as a war. I'd dare to say, maybe the TG production should've double checked this, knowing they would be ending the trip in a place that experienced the war on the flesh.
However, I don't think they expected (and shouldn't have expected) such a violent reaction. I mean, everyone is entitled to their feelings, but violence isn't the way to go. There are civilized ways to express your thoughts and it's sad that because of those uncivilized assholes, a great chance of showcasing our country's beauties was blown.

Finally, I don't want to turn this topic into a political argument. Talks about whether Britain or Argentina is the rightful owner of the Falklands/Malvinas islands belong to politicians and politicians alone. After all, they do it for their own gain, not that they care THAT much about us the people.

What I'm saying is that it's obviously not easy to achieve if nearly half the country don't meet that criteria. That's not to mention the massive wages differences between different parts of the country, either.

My points are these:

* The threshold of £19k is too high.
* The fact that they don't even take into account the wealth of the spouse that would be moving here is ridiculous.
* They don't even take into account the location of the British national either, so someone living in wales or the north east where living costs and therefore wages are a lot lower would be greatly handicapped when it comes to trying to reach this threshold.

&gt;Britain could offer a million visas tomorrow, and they'd be gone within a month. We could off ten million visa even and they'd be snapped up

Well, of course. That has nothing to do with this discussion though?

The players:

**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why? I am leaving out the long time stars of the squad.**

Kane- I think this is the obvious one. He plays hard and finds the back of the net. This is something we have consistently lacked.

Davies- Davies will never be a world class player, but I think he has the potential to be a very good player. He works well on the left side, and finally gives the team some stability at a position we have been awful at since the 2009ish version of BAE.

Chadli- I think Chadli is a very good winger, and we are starting to see what he is capable of. I hope Poch starts giving him more time.

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

Lamela- He still looks lost out there. Makes way too many dangerous plays, and often disappears. The kid has all the talent in the world, but has yet to put it all together.

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Keeper- Lloris is world class, and I think Vorm is very good. Hell I would even feel confident with Friedel in the starting lineup against weaker opposition. 

**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Every position but keeper. That is not to say that we don't have great players, but if one player is out injured, I don't feel we have talented depth. I think we have made quite a few mediocre choices in the transfer market, and if we are not starting our best eleven I am a little worried.

**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Paulinho- I just don't see him as a needed piece in our squad, and he rarely sees the pitch.
  
The manager:
**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

not fully. He will need time to shape his club in a way that lets him implement his system. It may take a couple years till it is fully integrated. I think we are seeing his system in the attitude of the players, but not in tactics. 

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

Yes. Our club is/was essentially a dumpster fire. It will take a couple years to repair all the damage and transition players. If the club does not give Poch ample time then we will continue to be a dumpster fire and a shoe in for 8th in the PL year in and year out.

The competitions:
**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**
5th-8th place

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**
Capital One Cup Final

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**
Semi-Finals

false,Blubbey,null,null,"1) Still thinking, entirely depends on form. Lamela plays like against Burnley he's in, against ~~Man U~~ Leicester (cheers Smokes) he isn't. I would have no question however:

        Kane
  Chadli Eriksen

Davies Verts Fazio Walker

      Lloris

2) Chadli, Kane. Chadli's  a player (like Lamela) who you could see had something but didn't perform that well last year, this year he's improved massively. Finishing, crossing, getting half a yard, getting past players, link up play. Goooood stuff. Kane because I was unsure. Yes he was used a bit last year by AVB and Sherwood, yes he went on a good run in April but this season he's been fantastic. Runs his bollocks off, links up well, confident on the ball, can commit players, is reasonable in the air. So far proving my doubts wrong and I hope he keeps doing so.

3) On the whole Soldado, Ade, Lamela, Kaboul. I expected Soldado to kick on this year, hasn't done so. Ade's just meh, Lamela I expect more because he's such a talented player, so fucking frustrating that he can do so much more but he's not doing it consistently yet. Kaboul could be a rock but he's just done poorly.

4) Keeper probably. Lloris is fantastic and Vorm's a very good second choice as second choices go.

5) Striker. One good option, two others who are just not performing.

6) Need? Don't know. But BAE, Ade, more than likely Soldado, maybe Paulinho if he doesn't take his chances, *maybe* Lennon and Townsend.

7) No idea, depends on a lot. Fee, other offers, their team's positions, wage demands, club placement. For example Lacazette, assuming they get CL, probably won't come/will go to a bigger team. Berahino probably going to Liverpool (much greater fee), very much doubt Martinez or Higuain (that rumour's funny), Schneid's probably going to Arsenal if they're interested, J.Rod might not have recovered from injury. Who would want to join a club that's 1) more than likely not in CL and probably gets better offers and 2) is able to propel the club into CL positions?

8) Foundations I do. Fitness is getting there, quicker passing is coming, pressing's getting better, quick counters.

9) Yes. Always expect teething problems and time to implement things, good rotation, trying to win games even at Chelsea.

10) 5th-7th.

11) Because of the difference between the clubs, all pressure is on us in the league cup so I expect to get into the final but not beat the opposition once there. FA cup no idea, Burnley were good in the league and with rotation they could definitely win. But 4th/5th round wouldn't be a surprise but would be nice depending on the draw.

12) Fiorentina are a good side, tough draw. Again it's all about on the day. Quarters is probably the end game though. Don't see semis/final/winning it as a realistic option. 

13) I expected Chelsea and City top 2, Liverpool/Arsenal for third at the start of the season but now Man U third, Arsenal 4th.",0,1419866072,null,0,1419870785,0,cn8bsm6,t3_2qpovp,t1_cn8bsm6,t3_2qpovp,null,1425166404,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

And they're just the ones that bothered to come out and celebrate. I assume general support was even higher..

It doesn't seem like Argentina was dragged kicking and screaming into the invasion.

Maybe not at delivering a range of services, but selecting specialised companies to deliver specific services has great potential for reducing costs whilst improving quality above that delivered by a slow, inefficient, and expensive, public sector body. 

Profit motive is no bad thing, and profit in this case comes from repeatedly winning government contracts, which is a process that is dependent on quality of service. I work in a private sector company which depends on winning work from other private sector companies - we have a profit motive, but that is what motivates quality. So look beyond the platitudes about ""profit"" and the bizarre obsession people have with ""privatisation"" and you may see that all of the most innovative, efficient, successful, and productive companies in the world are under a ""profit motive"". Profit is very strictly linked to results in every way imaginable.

**What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

Lloris - Davies, Vert, Fazio, Walker - Mason, Dembele - Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli - Kane.

**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

Lloris, Eriksen, Kane for obvious reasons.
Davies has been great since coming into the team.
Mason is quite good for a player I had no expectation of.

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

Kaboul and Adebayor has been our worst players I think, the former was a disaster at defense and a bad captain, Ade just doesn't look like he gives a fuck.
A lot of others were mediocre.

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Goalkeepers?
That aside, maybe left back with Davies looking really promising and Rose an adequate replacement.
Not 100% happy with any department, other than goalie.

**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Definitely CM. So many players and not a single one that's anywhere close top 4 level. Mason and Bentalab have talent but right now too young, inconsistent. In a 'real' top 4 club, players like Bentaleb would be out on loan and would be in the first team 2 years from now. 

**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Complete deadwood: Kaboul, Adebayor, Naughton. Maybe Soldado.

Players I wouldn't mind selling if a decent offer comes in: Lennon, Townsend, Rose, Paulinho, Capoue, Stambouli... a lot lol

Players who may benefit from a loan: Bentaleb, Dier, Chichires.

**What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

A quality CM is the first priority obviously. Maybe even 2 of those if we can!

Second priority: A decent striker to provide backup/partner/competition to Kane. Adebayor is finished, and it just won't happen for Soldado.

Could be nice:
Decent winger - Lamela, Chadli, Lennon and Townsend all have their pretty obvious flaws.

Most importantly - keep Lloris and Eriksen!

The manager:
**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

No, I do not believe his team is anywhere as good at the system as Southampton was. I believe he simply needs more time. The team is getting better after all.

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

At first I wasn't because the team looked bad and he picked awful players (like Kaboul who was really bad), but gotten better lately. Both his team picks and the actual play.
You got to give him credit for discovering and trusting in Mason, Kane, etc.

The competitions:
**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

Top 4 would obviously be Chelsea, City, United and Arsenal.
5 is probably the highest we could realistically get, assuming Southampton and Westham will eventually fall from grace.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

Those are completely unpredictable, as a knockout tournament, in one match anything can happen. If Wigan and Swansea won those, we surely can!

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

Depends on a lot of things, I think we are capable of reaching the highest stages. Not many teams in there are much stronger than us.

&gt;What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?

Lloris, Walker - Fazio - Vertonghen - Davies, Bentaleb - Mason, Lamela - Eriksen - Chadli, Kane

&gt;What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?

The young guys are obvious. But I am really happy that Eriksen appears to be continually improving. He has 7 goals already, all but 2 earning 3 points for us. Davies is also a big one, fans have been crying out for a competent LB for years and for the first time in what seems like ages, LB isn't going to be top of the shopping list.

&gt;What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?

I'm disappointed in almost all senior squad (non starting 11) players. Where is the drive to crack the starting 11? Poch played a lot of the fringe guys in the EL vs Besiktas and none showed even a glimmer of desire. Squad depth should give squad competition, driving overall quality up. Instead we see those who aren't top of the list seemingly giving up. Paulinho,  Dembele and Lennon are in the forefront of my mind. Kaboul and Ade don't escape either.

It is also unfortunate that Soldado hasn't been able to kick on with goals, embarrassing that transfer records Paulinho and Soldado have both lost their positions to youth options. 

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?

Keeper, defence and CAM. Lloris &gt; Vorm is solid in net. Naughton - Chriches - Dier - Rose sounds good enough as far as squad options are concerned as well. I think Lamela can back Eriksen up when required too.

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?

ST (depth), CM and RM (depth). Soldado and Ade, for different reasons, are not working out. I would hate to think what state we would be in if Kane was to get injured. Lamela is a bit hit and miss right now, when he is having a miss I don't think there is the strength in depth required to keep the attack sharp. Finally, for all our depth at CM I feel that Mason/Bentaleb lack the quality required for us to push on, I would prefer those two and a more prestigious player rotating over the two spots.

&gt;What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?

Clear out of clutter. Kaboul, Ade, BAE, Capoue or Stambouli and Paulinho.

Dembele, Lennon and Soldado out if replacements are found.

&gt;What transfers IN need to happen next summer?

I would like to see a player come in that can cover RW and ST. Someone to backup Kane and Lamela, Shurrle immediately comes to mind. 

I would also like a strong midfield passer to partner Bentaleb/Capoue/Stambouli/Mason. Cabaye would be a great option in my mind.

Not going to judge him this soon

It might help to think of the space as 'communal' rather than bespoke for business. It can be used by business but also anyone who wants to host an event or has some other need for the space on a temporary basis rather than ""we need a set of offices, let's get people to pay for it"". 

I appreciate you individually might not want to contribute to this, I actually empathise and am not sure it's any use to me either. 

However for those involved in small-business / creative spaces / communal spaces in the Birmingham area, it's a nice project to see running and could be used to host easily accessible events / projects / businesses in Digbeth area - making it very accessible. 

I guess that's the drawing power. If you're involved in that kind of project then it's great. If you aren't then it isn't. Can't say fairer than that.

                         Lloris

             Walker, Fazio, Vert, Davies

                   Mason, Stambouli?

                Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli

                        HurriKane

* What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?

Obviously I've been impressed the most by Harry Kane. At the start of the season no one expected him to be our starting striker, but he's already overtaken last season's top scorer and is well on track to be our first 20 goal a season striker since Defoe the year we qualified for the Champion's League. He's got a great footballing brain, a deadly long shot, he's a threat in the air, he's good at dribbling, and he contributes so much to the defence. 

Mason has impressed as well. When I saw him being subbed on against Forest I thought 'who is that?' He's cemented himself in out starting XI and has looked very good, especially when paired with Capoue. He hasn't looked any more out of his depth against the top teams than anyone else, and although his finishing was poor, he was dangerous against United.

* What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?

Adebayor has been the biggest let down. From our top scorer last season, to useless this season. But I suppose that's his nature - completely mercurial. Perhaps Soldado too, because I remember thinking this could be the season he regains his form from his time at Valencia.

Lamela has looked good in flashes but I expected much, much better from him.

* What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?

Goalkeeper. Lloris is one of the world's best and consistently bails us out. Vorm is a very solid, reliable back up goalkeeper. Friedel is far above what you'd expect from a third choice goalkeeper.

* What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?

Stiker. Harry Kane is brilliant but he can't be expected to play every match at his age. If he gets injured, we're fucked. Soldado can't finish and Adebayor is as good as gone.

* What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?

Adebayor. Needs no explaining.

Kaboul. He's surplus to requirements. Jan and Fazio are our starting CBs. Vlad is more flexible than Kaboul, being able to play at RB and probably DM as well. Dier is young and has lots of potential. Veljkovic could also be in and around the first team next season.

Paulinho. He doesn't offer enough. Possibly Dembele as well.

* What transfers IN need to happen next summer?

A striker who can also fill in on the wings. He needs to be fast because we lack the pace to open up defences. Possibly Lacazette?

A deep lying playmaker with strong defensive qualities, who is a guaranteed starter. Schneiderlin or Cabaye, maybe?

* Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?

I think we're starting to see his system but it is yet to be fully implemented. In particular I think we're struggling to dominate possession and the midfield against bigger teams.

* Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?

I've got my doubts but I'll stick by him. I think there's a lot of promise to his management and his system. He's got a plan B, unlike AVB. He's media friendly, unlike Sherwood. He's attractive, unlike 'Arry. He's a good manager, unlike Ramos. 

* Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?

I'm going to be really optimistic here and say 5th. I think we're looking better every game and our improved fitness levels will help us as other teams get worn out towards the end of the season. Southampton are beginning to fall from the top 4 already, and West Ham won't stay up there. Liverpool are really struggling and Everton aren't looking great either. We can definitely push for 5th, if any two of Kane, Eriksen and Lloris stay fit.

With that said, I wouldn't be disappointed if we only managed 6th or 7th. This season is about getting used to Pochettino so we can hit the ground running in 2015/16.

* How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?

I think we'll reach the final of the Capital One Cup. All we can do then is hope for some magic. I think we could do well in the FA Cup if the draw isn't too harsh on us, because we have good depth.

* How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?

With luck, we can maybe reach the quarters or semis? I'd love to win it but don't see that happening.

* Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?

I think the top end of the table will end up looking like:

1. Chelsea FC
2. Manchester City
3. Manchester United
4. Woolwich Scum
5. Tottenham Hotspur
6. Everton FC
7. Liverpool FC
8. West Ham United

I talked him up a lot over the summer, I'm glad to see he's playing as well as hoped he would. Townsend - I think he's made some solid improvements, especially lately.

Same for central midfield. We've got a striker and a half, and one central attacking mid worth talking about. Three right wingers to one left, though I think Townsend should be considered a left sided option. We could use a left winger who has got some pace and a good cross, a quick striker who can create for himself a bit, and a real playmaker in the center of midfield. Not to mention a backup attacking mid to spell Eriksen. Center back depends wholly on the development of Dier and Vlad. Right wing is alright unless we shift Townsend left. Then we could do with a right winger instead of a left. Could sell Azza and one of the CMs, and Kaboul if we think Vlad and Dier are vaible options. Ade if anyone will take him, but really just to dump his wages. I'm happy with Poch, we need to let him do his thing and shape the squad to his needs.

Suarez wasn't a typical transfer, was he?

He started quite slowly for all of his hype from Netherlands. Was exciting player but many fans were not happy with his end product until Rodgers came to Liverpool. He then dropped many of his tricks and started to focus on his end product which resulted in more 'boring' (as boring as you can call Suarez playing) playstyle but shit loads of more goals.

**What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

Lloris | Davies, Vertonghen, Fazio, Walker | Mason, Bentaleb | Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela | Kane

**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

Harry Kane. Scores goals, great movement and hold-up play, puts himself about, a real asset to the team.

Ryan Mason, there's a touch of Luka Modric about him. Makes things happen.

Hugo Lloris. Wins us games, simple as that. 

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

Soldado, still firing blanks. Paulinho, not offering enough. 

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Attacking midfield. Lamela, Chadli, Eriksen and Kane can all do a job in essentially any of the 3 attacking-midfield positions of a 4-2-3-1. Not to mention Townsend and Lennon who offer depth. 

**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Central midfield. We're overloaded with incomplete players. Capoue offers an element of what we need in his ability to break up play, Dembele's dribbling and intelligence is another element of that, Paulinho's willingness to get forward is another part of that, Bentaleb's composure is another important element of a central midfielder, as is Mason's creativity and drive. But we can't play all of them!

**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Soldado, Kaboul, Adebayor, Paulinho, Dembele. 

**What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

A CB of Poch's choice and a ST of Poch's choice.

The manager:

**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

No, we've been passengers too often in games. In my opinion Poch's system is to always dictate games, be it through high-pressing to turn over possession or through direct attacking play. Against United and Leicester, to name but two occasions, we've simply ridden our luck and sat back. 

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

We're still in the Carling Cup, the Europa League and not far off 4th- you can't ask for much more considering the time he's had. I'm very happy with his philosophy regarding promoting youth and the fitness regime he's got the squad on seems miraculous. Performances could have been better but I'm sure that will come with time and transfer windows where he can tinker with the playing staff. 
 
The competitions:

**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

Haven't given up hope that we'll finish 4th. Heart says we can do it, especially given Liverpool's slump and Everton's crap season. Head says we're not ready yet. Prediction: 5th.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

Final of the League Cup where we'll smash Chelsea 4-1. 3rd round exit in the FA Cup to Burnley after a rash Adebayor red card challenge.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

We're gonna win it. 

**Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?**

assuming your offer is to coach teams, the situation is:

- you're coaching all the 4k players on a team to at most the skill that you are

- this offers minimal difference to them, as they're still going to beat teams lower than them and lose to teams higher than them. imo there has only infrequently been a time in ukdota when two teams are extremely evenly matched, the differences in skill are too high.

I think the level of fuckup you have to pull to not be given an offer after an interview is extreme. Anyway, with that in mind.

&gt;-What was the interview for (course) and at where (Uni)?

Sheffield Uni - Electronic Engineering    
York - Electronic Engineering   
Bristol - Electronic Engineering    
Surrey - Electronic Engineering    

&gt;-What did you do in preparation?

Looked over the course syllabus on the way to the interview

&gt;-Who and number of people that interviewed you?

1 of the lecturers, at one there was a PhD student in as well, but I think that was more to learn about how interviews are done than anything

&gt; -What kind of question did they ask? (about you or portfolio)

Why the course, why the uni, experience I had, aspirations etc.

&gt; -Will they ask your views on current events?

Would be surprised if they did

&gt;-Any surprising questions?

Not really, spent a while chatting about football with one guy because I was from the town of the team he supported

&gt;-Duration of the interview?

20-30 mins

&gt;-What kind of questions did you ask at the end?

Asked what kind of projects students of theirs had done for the dissertations, or if they had already talked about that I asked for more detail on one of them

&gt;-How did you feel at the end of the interview? (did you feel you did well)

Wasn't sure, I didn't think I'd fucked up but I didn't think I'd done well

&gt;-Did you get an offer?

false,pupeno,eu,EU,"I think the military government killed about 10000 people so, you are correct. Don't think that this is ignored. There are lot of people in Argentina protesting against those that participated in that government. 

There used to be a law that would absolve you of any guilt if you were following orders and everybody except the upper echelons got away with it (and those in the upper echelons essentially live in house arrest... often quite comfortable). One of the groups in Argentina would track those people down and paint the walls and pavement around the house so as to out them to the neighbors.

It was common also for these operations to target a family (and friends) and essentially imprison, torture and kill (disappear) all the adults in the family. Some officers then would take the kids and claim they were their own. There's an organization that is tracking those cases and disclosing them to the kids (now adults).

It's a really fucked up situation and the armed forces in Argentina are not popular (some loved them, but a lot hate them).

All of this doesn't stop being able to gather a few angry people and organize them to throw rocks. This is a general problem that affects politics in Argentina and not just a few british visitors. I went to peaceful protests that had nearby cops and crowd control as you can often see in protest anywhere. You can protest in front of the congress but there will be cops forming a line making sure nobody walks into congress. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Then a bus would appear and a bunch of 18 year olds with their t-shirts wrapped around their faces so as to stay anonymous would join our protest and start throwing rocks and the cops. The cops would take it for a while but eventually things would escalate and they'll start tear gassing the crowd. People like me, your normal folk that is dissatisfied at the government and wants change would leave and the only people that stays there would be the cops and these mysterious masked violent youngsters.

This is all rumours, but apparently this technique has been used to discredit protests (they just a bunch of violent assholes! look at them!), to dissolve them (after normal folk leave, violent people also leave and voila! protest is over, government is strong) or to show incompetence on the government side by having cops retreat and allow those violet youngsters to win (all show).

Essentially, imagine if the EDL was way more powerful in the UK and would hold office every other term and when they are not in the office they would infiltrate every peaceful protest and turn it into a violent confrontation and you can have a good idea of what's going on.

In one instance the crowd turned on those few violent ones, and they successfully stop them and continued the peaceful protest. I know of only one case.

I'm sure something similar could work for trains. 

I disagree about the ticketing system being easy, I travel a lot by train and it is bizarre. 

Example of just the walk up on the door prices for Birmingham to London

Out Return
  VT (any) peak = £79 single, £158 return†
      CR peak = £(51/56)/95
  LM peak = £40/65
  CR offpeak = £49/50
  VT (any route*) offpeak = £46/47
  LM offpeak = £26.50/27
  CR superoffpeak = £24.90/25
  LM superoffpeak = £19.90/20

Now the times you can use super offpeak and peak are completely different despite traveling between the same to destinations at the same time. 

https://traintimes.org.uk/brum2london/

At certain times its 'super offpeak' for one route while simultaneously being 'peak' on another route. This is made worse by the difference being up £80 + a fine for having the incorrect ticket.

All this is without including the myriad of rail cards, advanced tickets, split fares and online fares.

I've long said Schurrle has consistency issues and that was exemplified Sunday when he had to be taken off at half.  Salah is talented to be sure however I just don't think he is Chelsea quality and doesn't fit our style of play.  Willian does fit Chelsea however he is struggling a bit impose his will on the game like he did at Shakhtar.  Ultimately I feel right attacking mid is a weakness that deserves some attention in the transfer market either this window or in summer.

Schurrle deserves more opportunities to find his form as we go down the stretch but I don't see Salah being relevant without multiple serious injuries and would prefer Ramires over Salah anyway.

**The players:**

* **What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

  I think Poch believes he's found close to what is his starting XI for now. Though I'm not sure that it is our strongest eleven players, or that it'll be our starting XI in a few months (even without injuries). 

  I also feel like there's too much pressure to try and squeeze underperformers such as Lamela into the starting XI. There's no reason Lamela shouldn't have to sit some matches out and fight for his spot.

* **What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

  Kane - Has taken the step up to even lead the line on his own. He's not the best in the league, but he's working hard and improving every game.

 Naughton - I feel as though when he's been needed this season he's been clocking in consistently good performances (It's a bit unfair to be too harsh on him for his red cards he's recieved).

  Mason - Our most dynamic midfielder who works very hard to drive the team forward and create attacking opportunities. Should be very important in turning Spurs into an attacking force again.

  Capoue - Despite some slightly less impressive defensive performances, he seems to have improved this season and his passing was very good earlier in the year. Will probably get first team opportunities again soon.

  Chadli - Still goes missing in games, but he is providing a goal threat when other areas of the squad are coming short.

  Eriksen - Our most talented outfield player, and it's very evident. He does his best when he has more time and in fast paced games he can struggle to find the space, but you can rely on him in the final third, especially from free kicks.

  Lloris - At least the second best goalkeeper in the league It would be interesting to see how he did with a strong defence behind him. 

* **What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

  Chiriches - For a defender, he simply doesn't think enough. Goes hurtling forward too often and hasn't got the turning ability to defend at full back against good wingers.

  Kaboul/Vertonghen/Fazio - They've all had their errors this season. I'm not buying into the narrative that the latter two have less errors in their game, as I've been watching and that's not what's been happening from my standpoint. They've all been error laden, and if it's getter better it's certainly rather slow.

  Rose - I still get the feeling he's not got a great temperament. Has dissapointed me that he hasn't stepped it up as much as I'd hoped.

  Adebayor - Whilst his personal problem may be a factor, it can't attribute for all the non-performances he's put in. Still a better option than Soldado, but he could have done so much more for us this season.

* **What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

  Cental Midfield and Goalkeeper

* **What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

  Centre Back, Left Wing and Striker

* **What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

  The only player that NEEDS to leave if Assou Ekkotto who is just sat around collecting ~40k in wages. Must be shifted for everyone's sake.

  Other than that I imagine one of Soldado and Adebator will be gone in the summer, as will one of Kaboul and Vlad. Paulinho probably should be, but I can imagine him sticking around the squad several years more than necessary.

  We'll probably also lose Lloris.

* **What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

  No-one NEEDS to come in, but I expect to see us get a GK (assuming we lose Lloris), a CB, a LW and a ST.


**The manager:**

* **Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

  For brief periods in games we're able to play how he wants, but often we're unable to. Just another wait and see I guess.

* **Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

  He's got our players fit, he's demonstrated the tactical awareness to deal with games against big teams differently than small teams (e.g Arsenal, Man U matches) which is a big bonus. Demonstrates a plan B, which is something I'd worried we wouldn't have.

  We have yet to play free flowing football in too many matches, which is a shame, but things are coming along.

  Overall, it's too early to tell, whilst the football hasn't been great there's time to improve for Poch.


**The competitions:**

* **Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

  5th.

* **How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

  Can't see us beating Chelsea if we get to the final of the COC, but I'm sure I'll be convinced otherwise if we make it there and we line up against them.

  Expect us to bow out of the FA cup, I doubt we'll end up competing on all four fronts, we haven't got the team for it.

* **How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

  Tough game against Fiorentina, as long as we put in a good show against them that's the most important thing. I'd rather glorious defeat than for us to go out with a whimper.

  We probably haven't got enough to get to the final.

* **Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?**

  I had 1. Chelsea  2. City 3. United 4. Liverpool at the start of the season and seeing as Liverpool aren't keeping up their end of the bargain, there's no reason that we can't compete for fourth with Arsenal if we tighten up at the back.

It's not about me trying to sound amazing or anything egotistical like that. A lot of coaches out there don't have high MMR and haven't won anything, and I would simply aim to bring a team around the 4k MMR mark up to at least 4.5k and hopefully higher if the individual player commitment and skill is there. It may seem asinine, but I suppose it comes down to my decision if I want to pursue this action.

Your point is very fair about who'd want coaching from someone who's under 5k, and the answer is simply that there are a lot of people out there who want to break the 4k mark and are struggling. With a few simple (to you and I) tips they can increase their MMR, but I want to focus on how to do it as a team. It may sound like a stupid idea, but I wanted to offer that within ukdota by way of putting something in to the community. I thought that offering some free service would be welcomed even though I'm clearly not in the highest league in the UK player-wise.

As it stands, though, the 'quiet' people out there are drowned out by just... flamers whose only contribution to this subreddit is to remind people of how low their MMR is compared to them.

Also with regards to the 'tier 2' thing, I think I talked more in one of the earliest comments that an individual player's skill can make a huge difference, but you have to get to that stage first, which is why I wanted to talk about 'team' stuff. As a personal example, I put responsibility on my draft to play to my core players' biggest strengths so they can exert themselves on the game, whilst also trying to keep their strongest players down (which takes knowledge of who the dangerous players are).

The car choices are usually relevant like this- such as taking British cars to India. And then how does Clarkson's story relate to the other cars?


Having seen the special and read all of the sides of the argument, I still think they decided to do an Argentina special, because it fits in with all of the other controversial destinations they've been to, and someone spotted a car for sale with that licence plate, then they picked the ""manual V8"" selection to fit around the car they bought. Then they were going to play it up for laughs like the usually do, but vastly misjudged the hostile reception they would have received in the (ridiculously jingoistic) Argentine media.

What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?
Lloris, Davies, Super Jan, Fazio, Kyle W, Eriksen, Bentaleb, Dembele, Kane, Lennon

What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?
Kane. More than his goals, his attitude has been phenomenal. Every game he puts a shift in, then another to compensate for the rest of the team.

What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
Lamela. So much talent but so little end product. I blame him as much as I blame our coaches. They have got to be teaching him the right way to be doing things, yet somehow it never materialises on the pitch. Is our coaching too weak? Probably.

What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
Goalkeepers. Tell me again why we bought Vorm? Will be another disgruntled player looking to put in a performance for his new club against us when he inevitably leaves in the summer.

What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
Up front. We have one player that can score when most teams have about 3.

What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
Adebayor, Soldado, Lamela (if his season doesn't buck up).

What transfers IN need to happen next summer?
A top striker. That's all. Leave the squad and only replace those leaving if needed.

The manager:
Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?
Pass. 

Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?
Knowing we only keep a manager for 6 - 12 months means that we start judging them almost instantly. So far, not bad. This is one of the worst seasons for the premier league and we should be higher up the table but everyone has dropped points. But he's done the best with what he's got. Would be keen to see how he does with a better squad.

The competitions:
Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?
5th

How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?
Beat the Chavskis in the final of the league Cup.

How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?
Semi final

Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?
Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal, Man Ure

There were no trick questions but I was asked for my own opinion/interpretations of a few historical events. You won't be asked about current events, it's not relevant bordering on inappropriate. The interview was mostly academic but we talked briefly about my other interests too.

false,CopenhagenCalling,null,null,"Lloris: 10
Best player today. Kept us in the game and is the reason we got a point. I was sure Van Persie would score and Lloris also stopped Young from getting the goal of the week.

Davies: 7
Really solid, both on and off the ball. I followed him at Swansea and im surprised he has been this solid for us defensively. At Swansea he had problems with his positioning, but so far no problems for us. Maybe its because we are used to watching Rose, who isn't the best defensively.

Vertonghen: 7
Still not the old Vert we know, but getting close to that level. Can't remember him making any errors and was calm on the ball. I think he is getting better and better.

Fazio: 6
Was a beast when the ball was in the air, but Bambi on ice when it was on the ground. Not friends with the ball today and he always has one or two big errors in him. Could have cost a goal, but could also have scored. It's weird that he comes from La Primera, but plays like an oldschool english centerback.

Chiriches: 6
Was better than expected, although he got skinned by Young a couple of times. I wasn't as worried as im usually am when Chiriches have the ball, so thats a positive.

Stambouli: 5
A slightly below average game. I have no idea how he can keep Capoue out. Okayish defensively, although i still don't know why he can't be more aggressive. Also god damn he is slow. Makes Scott Parker look like Usain Bolt. I thought he would get a red card.

Mason: 3
Completely overmatched in midfield and one of the worst games he has had for us. Could not pass to a teammate if his life depended on it. 58% pass completion. Could this be the lowest in the league for any CM? He needs a rest on the bench. Should have been subbed off.

Eriksen: 7
Didn't create enough and Carrick did a good job on him. Should have done more to get away from Carrick. He also didn't look as good without the ball as he had done in other games. Should have tackled some more when he was deeper, but he was good when closing down De Gea. He is still by far our best player on the ball. The only one of our 5 midfielders who could actually pass to a teammate, often in situations where he was under pressure. Should have gotten the ball more. Sometimes he should have done more to get open, other times our other players failed to make a simple pass to him. I thought his set pieces was good.

Townsend: 6
Classic Townsend performance. Runs with the ball and it actually looks like something is about to happen and you think to yourself,""he's a decent player"". Then he makes the wrong decision and it ends up in nothing. I have never seen a player with so little end product as Townsend. He is so bad in the passing game, one-two passing just dies with him. No tempo at all. His shots is either straight at the keeper or into row z. To his credit, he did have a couple of decent crosses(one from a setpiece if i remember correctly). Townsend should seriously work on becoming a LW, because he is just not smart enough to play as an inverted winger.

Chadli: 5
Went AWOL and was basically like Eriksen, just a little worse. I don't really remember him doing anything in the game, neither good or bad. 

Kane: 8
Our best outfield player. Didn't press as much, but got stuck in when he was deeper. He was good with the ball on his feet, but not so good at holding or winning headers in open play(something he will get better at, against lesser team he is good at that). We could probably have used Adebayor alongside Kane to hold up the ball. He will be really fucking good when he learns that.

Subs:
I don't know why Pochettino waited so long with the subs, but Dembele looked really good when he came on. Lamela didn't really do anything. Some players could have or was close to a lower score, others close to a higher. That second half bumped most of the scores.",0,1419874717,null,0,false,0,cn8fyew,t3_2qn4ld,t1_cn8fyew,t3_2qn4ld,null,1425164393,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

An entirely Civil matter, the appropriate thing to do would be knock on the angry woman's door and politely request that she move her car to allow you to leave..

Another option (in a front wheel drive car) would be to jam your handbrake on as firm as you can, full lock the steering wheel out into the road, select 1st gear, rev the engine like a madman, drop the clutch like a brick.. 

Lots of squeeling, smoke, wheelspins, and general yobbery.. But you might well find that the front of your car has just shimmied out enough to get on your way ;)

Lloris, Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies, Bentaleb, Stambouli, Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela, Kane

MOST IMPRESSED:

KANE: obvious. He is a complete forward and gives you everything you would want except for blinding pace. He is doing this at 21. To be this good at 21 is indicative of a player who will be truly special

ERIKSEN: obvious. The teams best player

LLORIS: obvious

BENTALEB: Bentaleb has been our best central midfielder this year. Our strong form early on was with Bentaleb in the lineup. The worst doldrums against Newcastle, West Brom, Stoke was without him. He offers good defensive shielding, moves the ball forward, is mobile, a good passer. Basically he does everything at at least an average level more than can be said for any of our other CMs. His return has coincided with the teams performance picking up again especially with regards to pressing.
Lamela: Leads the team in EPL assists and has had moments of brilliance. Yes he has been poor at times but considering how young he is, and how useless he was last year I dont know how anybody can see his flashes of brilliance as anything but a massive improvement on last year and considering his age a good sign for the future.

FAILED TO IMPRESS:

Ade, Kaboul, Naughton, Soldado, are all players who no longer have much of anything to offer Spurs and should be moved at when possible. 

STRONGEST POSITION:

Keeper. Vorm is the backup and would start for more than half the teams in the EPL. An embarrassment of riches

WEAKEST POSITION:

Central Midfield. Bentaleb is the only CM I feel good about being a starter for a top 4 contender. Rest of CM is just a bunch of not good enough players of varying strengths/weaknesses. Team needs a true destroyer in the mode of what Sandro once was.

OUT:

Guys I mentioned above. Players who are older, without upside. Paulinho needs to go too. One of Capoue or Stambouli once a true destroyer is brought in.

THE MANAGER:

Poche shows competence, has a good system, recognizes weakness and makes efforts to address them, rewards good play with more chances. The team has shown real improvement as time has gone on. I firmly believe he is the guy to get Spurs where they want to go.

LEAGUE: Between 5th and 7th. Where specifically is kinda irrelevant.

LEAGUE CUP: Will make the final. Will beat Pool, but lose to Chelsea.

FA CUP: Just for fun I will say quarters. Utterly dependent on the draw

EUROPE: Round of 16

-What did you do in preparation?  
Nothing special beyond my normal A2 and STEP preparation

-Who and number of people that interviewed you?  
The interview consisted of an hour long exam followed by a twenty minute or so discussion of my answers with Prof. Tong and another fellow (can't remember his name). Some of my peers were interviewed by Prof. Sir Timothy which would have completely terrified me!

-What kind of question did they ask? (about you or portfolio)  
Just about the exam. I had to justify any steps that weren't perfectly proven and was given prompts where I had gotten stuck and they then expected me to complete the problems on the spot.

-Will they ask your views on current events?  
They really didn't give a shit about anything apart from the maths.

-Any surprising questions?
Nope.

-Duration of the interview?  
Exam: 1 hour  
Interview: 20 minutes

-What kind of questions did you ask at the end?  
Not given the opportunity.

-How did you feel at the end of the interview? (did you feel you did well)  
Thought I had fucked it up completely.

-Did you get an offer?  
Yes. A\*A\*A at A2 and 1,1 in STEP.

And to be fair, to say that no-one in SF is a Marxist is a bit of a stretch, Gerry hardly knows the political opinions of every single member in the party. Sure Fianna Fáil had a socialist at their helm at one point ;). 

I would disagree with you that they are outliers in the group. The Danish People's Movement Against the EU is part of GUE/NGL and they are just a eurosceptic coalition that doesn't define themselves as socialist or even on the left/right spectrum. Although your point stands about not being members of PEL, but the Dutch Socialist Party aren't members either and nor are Podemos. I don't think the Nordic Green Left Alliance would necessarily welcome a non Nordic political party into their alliance. 

Ming is also member of the GUE/NGL and policy wise he would be way more of an outlier than SF, a party that calls for a 32 county socialist republic. [Literally in the first line of their blurb about themselves](http://www.sinnfein.ie/what-sinn-fein-stands-for)

&gt;Months before the Cambridgeshire South MP sealed the property deal, he “flipped” his expenses claim to his Georgian flat in London, where he spent thousands more, including £750 for a Laura Ashley sofa

&gt;He also claimed the full rate of council tax on his second home, despite being eligible for a 10 per cent discount, suggesting that he failed to ensure “value for money” for taxpayers, as required by the parliamentary Green Book. 

&gt;July, 2005, Mr Lansley submitted a bill for £520.53 covering 21 hours of garden maintenance

What? fucking really? Gardeners on Expenses? the fuck...

&gt;Later the same month there was a bill for £632.40, comprising £231.10 for voile curtains for the sitting and dining rooms, £173.80 for a roman blind for the kitchen and a loose cover for a small chair, which cost £227.50. All three invoices were addressed to his wife, Sally. Mr Lansley also tried to claim back the cost of a £116 barbecue and another £63 for plants, only for the claim to be rejected because plants and garden furniture are banned from claims.

My wife works as a childminder. She get's £40 per child for a whole day. 

So there's costs. Initial training costs about £1000 up front. If you're lucky your council will cover that. 
Then there's fees for ofsted, first aid courses and insurance. Electricity and gas to keep the home warm all day. Any parents out there will testify to just how that jumped up when they had their first add to that the costs for running a dish washer all day and cooking 2 hot meals for them.
Kids need to eat fresh fruit and veg so that's priceier than you'd guess.

Then your house insurance goes up because you're running a business. They always seem to base the premium for that on how many people visit each day, which childminding sucks for. Yes, some of them count the 3 year olds...

There's also all the toys they need, art and craft materials etc....

There also seems to be a crap ton of other courses. Some cost money, all take time. Many are at dumb times e.g. starting at 1800. Why's 1800 a bad time? Well, given that parents need to drop off before work and pickup aafterwards a whole day for a childminders is 0800 to 1800 - a ten hour day just for contact time and you can add another 2.5 he's per week for accounts ofsted paperwork, lesson planning (yes, ofsted require this for under 3s).

There are other outliers in the group but they aren't as big as SF is.

That same blurb also talks of the essential nature of private enterprise. They're Keynsian at best. They're more concerned about the past than they are about a socialist future. 

And SF does not fit that bill unless they're going to call themselves out on a lot of things. 

For SF to get me on board they'd have to break with the past a good bit more, come clean on a lot of stuff, ditch their old guard leadership, get serious on radical democracy, advocate more for co-operative enterprise over private enterprise, modernise their social policies, read some Marx, reach out more internationally to other parties, reach out to the protestant working class, calm down on the pushing for a United Ireland for now.

i get why he left 100%, the team was going south, he saw that (which is also why pepe also wanted to leave earlier than he did) and he made his jump. i mean cmon folks, if you're being paid 70k/week, wouldn't you take a 130k/week raise without 2nd thoughts? and on top of that, chelsea will always be competitive with RA as the owner b/c he'll spend spend spend, so why not jump at that opportunity? it would have been cool to see suarez and torres play together, instead of buying carroll, but it wasn't meant to be, and we sold both players for a combined 120m..torres not only netted a 30m profit from his purchase and sale (not including wages), but he also helped us fund a player who made us 50m in profit in suarez (not including wages)...maybe im just an optimist, but the sale of torres, as acrimonious the terms and conditions were, was the perfect thing to happen to liverpool. it probably was a factor that helped to steady our ship (out with gilette and hicks players, in with FSG era)...so all in all i hated the whole move, but i respect him for being honest when asked these questions. there will always be a special bond between him and liverpool fans, and as pissed as fans are and will be, it's because we truly loved our #9 from sunny spain...

false,[deleted],null,null,"The players

**1.) What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

Lloris, Walker,Fazio,Vert,Davies/No one has claimed midfield yet/Lamela,Eriksen,Chadli/Kane

**2.) What Player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

For obvious reasons **Harry Kane** has been very impressive. I don't think anyone would've predicted 15 goals even all season let alone half way through.

**Ryan Mason** for much of the same reason as Kane because at 23 I simply believed Mason was a Championship player destined to leave the club with no noise. He's been pretty good for us and a welcome surprise.

**Ben Davies** all last year I was dying watching Danny Rose gift goals and was a huge liability. That was the clubs number one target was a replacement left back. When we got Davies it was a player that I wasn't overwhelmed with a feeling of relief cosidering we'd been linked with Coentrao and Alex Sandro and a couple other bigger name left backs. But Davies has made a huge impact in my mind and has been great for the club

**Fazio** Simply because I knew nothing about him and he's come in and looked a great Center back pairing with Vertonghen.

**3.) What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

These might be a little harsh but if I'm honest these are the guys that haven't impressed me this year.

**Andros Townsend** coming off the hype last year. People claiming he was a ""Robbenesque"" player. He hasn't shown much improvement in his game than how he looked a couple years ago. He's a fine backup as long as he's not giving the ball away constantly but from what I'm seeing he doesn't look like someone who will be long term first team player for us.

**Soldado** is tough. It's just weird that 21 y/o Kane can come on and put up 15 and this 29 y/o veteran 20 goal a season La Liga striker can't score. I want to believe but he definitely has failed to impress.

**Kabul** he was given a golden opportunity. Gifted the starting job. When he was named captain I was flabbergasted. Failed to seize the opportunity and is now fourth choice in my mind.    

**4.) What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Goal Keeper

**5.) What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Central Midfield and Striker. Central Midfield because there isn't a dominant force there. There's no one I watch in our midfield and say ""wow he's really amazing"". Sometimes I say it about Dembele because of his dribbles but he doesn't fit Poches quick passing system. Striker because if Harry Kane goes down we're going to drop a shit load of points. Hopefully we can pick someone up in January or over the summer.

**6.) What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

**Paulinho** recoup some money, stop paying his wages. 

**Adebayor** I think he's a fucking head case. We pay him too much. He doesn't get on with coaches and managers. Inconsistent as hell. 

**Naughton** I just think his time is up at Spurs. Was never really good enough. An okay backup. But with Yedlin coming in and the way Dier and Chiriches have shown they can cover right back I think he's definitely off. More likely in January. 

**Lennon**. I like Lennon but he isn't part of our club moving forward anymore. I think we sell him and bring in a younger promising talent that fits with our team and can progress the club forward. 

**Kabul** His best days are behind him. Could never stay healthy. Always looks a liability for us. 

**7.) What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

**Central Midfielder**. It'd be huge if we could get Schneiderlin but he may be out of reach for us. But we do need a midfielder who can be dominant. Be controlling. Be that rock in midfield. 

**Versatile front four player** like a Jay Rodriguez. Can play left and striker. I'd really like to see Heung Min Son who can essentially play all four forward positions. To replace Lennon, provide depth, give ourselves options and versatility contrast to Townsend.

**Striker** You need two good strikers at least to finish top four in the league I believe and I think we've found one in Harry Kane. But we need to reinforce the position. I say we hold on to Soldado as third choice and rotation player, and bring in someone to compete with Kane for starting striker. Lacazette might be out of our reach, and same with Bony but those are two players I'd be happy with obviously. Maybe Destro or I don't know there are a lot of options here. We may end up with Berahino. The jury is out but I do believe we need someone there.

The Manager:

**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

Yes and no. He's definitely drilled in the fitness aspect and he's brought our tempo and mentality up. I don't think he has the players that can really make his system be as effective as it can be.

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

Yes. He's brought entertaining exciting attacking football to the club. I think he's done a good job putting his thumb print on the club in the short time he's been here and only expect the club to get better as he brings in more players that can do the things he wants this team to do.

The Competitions:

**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

5-7. Anything is possible but I think those are most likely.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

Obviously being so close to being in the league cup final my heart starts racing just thinking about it. Would be absolutely wonderful if we could somehow pull it out. Chelsea are some bad men though. The F.A. cup we have as good a chance as any. Obviously I think teams take that one even more seriously. Hopefully we can have a good run.

**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

I see this as maybe our most important competition (obviously we need to rack up as many points as we can in the Prem). I think with some good draws and strong performances this would be our best shot at Champions League. Still a really tough competition against good teams.

**Who do you think will make top 4 this season?**

1.)Chelsea 2.)City 3.)United 4.)Arsenal

If I had a choice, if I have kids I will never put them in a nursery.

We don't need to wrap them in so much cotton wool. (Ironically, when I shouted at a kid to stop running because he was about to trip over something and faceplant into the tarmac, I got disciplined. Go figure.)

I read an article a few years ago about a Danish mom and and English mom swapping nurseries, and the Danish one sounded like heaven; they even went out to play in the rain. The rain! Imagine that. Never happen here.

1) Palgrave Road is an estate just opposite South Wing (If thats where you'll be based!) It's reasonably priced and work will be on your doorstep. They seem to be expanding it too but with houses, not flats. It's all a part of a big development they are building at the moment. http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/property/bedford/palgrave-road/

2) I can think of one new ""Vegetarian only"" restaurant in Kempston, the next town along. It's only recently opened so I will find out the name of it for you. Other than that, I've yet to find a restaurant in the town that didn't have at least two or three veggie options - You certainly won't starve :) Holland and Barretts and Pumpernickel in the Harpur Centre are health food shops which would help a vegetarian out too. http://pumpernickel-online.co.uk/

3) Bedford Park is popular for runners, they have a 5k race every Saturday morning under the ""parkrun"" brand. Other than that, many people run on the streets and seem to get on just fine. A little further out of the town there is the Priory Marina, a country park based around a couple of lakes which is great to run around. Our local running club are the Bedford Harriers, a lovely bunch. www.bedfordharriers.co.uk

4) Food is reasonably priced as far as I know, our supermarkets are constantly engaged in a price war. We have the European discount stores now too, Lidl which is in Kempston and Aldi which is in Putnoe. Both would require transport to get to - are you planning on driving when you are here or will you be using the buses?

5) We do indeed have two football clubs. I think Bedford Town football club is the more famous of the two but I could be totally wrong, I'm not too au fait with football. We are fond of rugby too, the Bedford Blues games get a good turnout.

6) I'm afraid I don't know the answer to this one! 

7) There is a comic book shop in the town centre called ""Close Encounters"" which has a Batman statue outside you can't miss :) http://www.closeencounters.co.uk/

8) The nightlife is OK, you have 3 clubs on the main high street called Play, Hi-Fi and.. something else I can't remember on St Peter's street. The clubs change hands a lot so usually have a different name every couple of years. A little off the beaten track are The Pad which is more rock music, it has a great Silent Disco every so often. Esquires is good for live music and local bands - they have had some big names performing over the years too, especially for such a tiny place.

There are plenty of bars and pubs too, Yates, The Rose and Vogue on the High Street and smaller wine bars such as the Auction Room and The Flute.

I hope this helps, PM me if you have any more questions!!

false,Your_Personal_Jesus,null,null,"The players:

What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?
Lloris, Davies, Vert, Fazio, Walker, Bentaleb, Mason, Eriksen, Kane, Lamela, Soldado


What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?
Kane: He's the next great England striker. I said it at the start of season when no one really believed it, and everyone's seeing it now.

Eriksen: I must admit, I'm not the biggest Eriksen fan. He has his faults, and he seemed to be getting a pass that none of our signings get. But he's proven himself to be a real talisman late in the year, he's not perfect, but he's always a threat and he has that it factor.

What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
Capoue: He has all the physical, but both Tim and Poch have now dropped him kinda out of the blue. He needs to give more.

Ade: Ade is as Ade does. Has everything you could ever want in a striker, everything mentally you don't want in a footballer.

Kaboul: Love love loved him in his younger days, but he's gone kaboom.

What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
I think our best back 4 + GK (Lloris, Vert, Fazio, Walker) is actually really really good. Everywhere else I'm still not quite sure.

What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
Right Wing. Love Lamela, but he doesn't work there. Townsend isn't an inside forward. Lennon is competent, but can be improved upon and doesn't quite seem to fit.

What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
Dead weight out. Capoue, Kaboul, Naughton, Ade, BAE. Everyone else is really up to personal preference.

What transfers IN need to happen next summer?
A high profile player. We need that fear factor at the club that a real star brings. Everything else will fall in line I think.

The manager:

Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?
I don't think we use the same system, nor do I think we should. Poch is learning to manage at this level, just as the players are. We may never reach the heights of Bielsa-ism like a Chile, but right now it's mix of that and classic Spurs push-and-run culture, and that's who we are. 

Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?
He's finding his feet, but he's his own man and he has a plan. Can't ask for much more. Being the fittest team in the league is our calling call, I can't remember the last time we've truly had our own identity as a club.

The competitions:

Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?
5th, Arsenal will pip us as usual, but we're better that every other non top 4 team, including Pool.

How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?
We're going to Wembley! Can't see us not passing Sheffield to the final, and anything can happen there. The FA is anyone's guess, we may be too stretched for that.

How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?
I've convinced myself we're winning it. Pochettino has a plan, we have the depth for both competitions, we need it to progress as a club. Why not us?

Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?

Davies Fazio Vertonghen Walker

Kane - he's absolutely exploded in a huge way for us. 
Chadli - fantastic attacking player
Eriksen - as above
Lloris - keeps us in games we have no business being in. 

&gt;What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
Adebayor - awful
Paulinho - awful

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
Keeper, no question. 

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
I would have said striker before Harry Kane rose to the challenge, now I'd say fullbacks. 

&gt;What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
Paulinho, Adebayor, Soldado (as much as I hate to say it), Dembele

&gt;What transfers IN need to happen next summer?
International-quality striker, defensive midfielder. 

The manager:

&gt;Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?
I think it's very much underway.

Absolutely. Our fitness is through the roof and we're doing really quite well - especially our younger players.

I think we can challenge for 4th. 3rd if we hit a run if excellent form. 5th is extremely realistic.

League Cup - it'll take a miracle for us to win it.
FA Cup - I foresee a run in it, maybe to the QFs but that'll be as far as that goes.

**Strongest Position:** GK. Easy selection: Lloris, with a backup of Vorm, Friedel, and McGee. I'd take that any day. 

**Weakest Position:** Has to be Attacking 4. Kane, Chadli, Eriksen, and to a degree, Lamela, are doing fine, however I find that we lack much talent when we need the depth to come in. Townsend I still think will turn it around, he seems to be getting better, though slowly. 

**Sold:** Adebayor, Paulinho, Bobby, Kaboul.

With Kaboul and Ade its a matter of changing the guard. They are getting old and really haven't contributed when needed. Don't see a reason to keep them around when they aren't performing.  

As for Bobby and Paulinho, its a matter of business. Soldado hasn't done what was needed of him and we can't keep granting him amnesty. As for Paulinho, I just don't think he has much use. I would sell him unless he shows some overwhelming evidence as to why he should stick around. 

**Bought:** 

Schneiderlin and Lacazette . Both still young and both are incredibly talented. They would enhance our squad quite a bit. 

Also, Berahino might be nice. I'm not fully sold on him though I would say my opinion sways more towards the positive side. As for replacing Kaboul, we just promote Veljkovic when he gets back from Boro. 

**Opinion on Poch:** The jury is still out. Right now since we are finally seeing what he was trying to do all this time I am viewing him in a favorable light. I think he's got a tough attitude that is bringing some stability to the club. He doesn't have the disruptive attitude that AVB and Sherwood seemed to have. Gets on with the players as well as the management (it seems) and isn't afraid to let the players suffer hard truths about their form (what I'm assuming happened with the dropping of Kaboul and Adebayor). I want him to continue proving to me that he was the right choice because I personally always wanted the manager choice to be FdB instead of Pochettino. We'll see how everything works out. 

**League Position:** 4th-7th

**Capital One:** Finals

**FA Cup:** Hopefully at least the Quarter Finals. 

**Europa League:** Same as FA Cup. 

**Top 4:** Chelski, City, Manure, and Us or Scum in 4th. I don't see Liverpool or Everton as a real challenge if they keep playing the way they have been. West Ham and Southampton are bound to start losing. ",0,1419882953,null,0,false,0,cn8klki,t3_2qpovp,t1_cn8klki,t3_2qpovp,null,1425162226,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Therefore it makes the argument that ""it's too costly"" seem a bit weak.

yes it is,their job is to get you off the ball without fouling you. Its way too hard to determine if a player purposely trips over someone or not, so if the player does in anyway trip over someone its a foul. If this defender was more experience he'd shuffle his body properly to get the ball off cesc without fouling him. Look at the top defenders, JT, Kompany, they all do this. 

Get this intention shit out of your head dude. No one can know what the player intended and it doesnt matter. The only time intention matters is when handballs occur.  When the commentators of the game, the fans of the opposing team and every fucking pundit says its a penalty, just take the hint and accept that its a penalty. 

Its harsh I know, but that's just what the game is. At the end of the day fabregas stopped from a goal scoring opportunity BECAUSE he was obstructed. He was fouled and he was tripped. Penalty.

false,Blaster395,eng-somerset,Somerset,"Ha-Joon Chang is not a very competent economist, despite his fame and position.

The crux of the problem is that Ha-Joon Chang has very, very strong political biases and it completely gets in his way of actually producing any worthwhile stuff in the field of economics. He believes that economics is not a science (it is), and he believes that economics is too important to be decided by experts (the public understanding of all fields of science is so poor that I wouldn't trust them with any branch of it).

His main criticism of the field of economics can be summed up as this.

* Many economic institutions push conservative-backed economic ideals instead of liberal ones because ... reasons.

* Liberal-backed economic ideas (specifically the branch of liberalism that Ha-Joon Chang supports, which is actually more akin to either 1800's era conservatism or anti-globalization branches of social democracy/socialism) are correct because ... reasons.

In reality, economic institutions push correct theories, which in the case of the stuff Chang covers is to support Free Trade and Globalization, both things that Chang opposes. Competent economists accept this regardless of their political leanings, while Chang and a vocal minority disagree with it and use ""neoliberal"" every 4th word to try and sound clever. 

It does nothing for the field of economics, but it does get great results in number of book sales. A book that says ""The way we are running the world now is actually pretty good, here are a few minor things we can touch up on"" sells a lot less than ""We are heading towards &lt;insert apocalpytic scenario here&gt; and to fix it we need &lt;insert fringe ideology that lacks evidence for being an improvement here&gt;"".",0,1419885556,null,0,1419885763,0,cn8m3wn,t3_2qqetg,t1_cn8m3wn,t3_2qqetg,null,1425161480,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Coutinho has played very well IMO. I think he really wants to score and his shots have been fairly good. 

Sterling has been absent probably because he is not a striker. 

Moreno has impressed on the offensive side. I have a neutral opinion on how he has done defensively.

I'm covering a town of 50 thousand people with 4 Police officers on a night shift. There are court cases getting thrown out because we can't get CCTV/recorded evidence back in time due to backlogs. Our public enquiry office has to shut for 45 minutes every single shift, because when the civilian staff want to take a break, it falls below the legally allowed staffing levels. 

The only van we have that isn't broken, has a broken radiator, loses power above 65mph and has no heating. It was -7 last night, and so the only van we have isn't viable in the winter time.

The government is about to force through more cuts, and you're probably about the see the break down of Police organisations across the nation, besides your major areas like Glasgow/London. These places have millions of cops.

Moreno's movement was fantastic for that goal, he just drifted around their box like a ghost and nobody seemed to even notice him. I don't know why Henderson was on the far side of the pitch putting in a cross but I ain't gonna question it.

Sterling has looked exhausted and fed up tonight, nothing has gone to him, Fernandez is dragging out of him and causing shit every time he gets near the ball and he's clearly getting sick of it. Needs to keep his cool and hopefully if a chance goes his way he can take it.

Shelvey shouldn't be on the pitch. I love him, but that was a red card by the laws of the game now. It was pretty deliberate too, he clearly knew he was going to hit him. Disappointed the ref didn't catch it/didn't care.

Coutinho has been very good, seems a catalyst in everything today.

false,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?

Hard to gauge right now. Liverpool look like they're coming back to form, but I don't think their side is better than ours. Everton has slumped too far behind this season to be a contender for our spot, and West Ham will get shown up by the big boys. Has Southampton beaten a side that finished above them right now? 

I'll say fifth, but only like two points will separate us from sixth.

&gt;How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?

I think we'll make it to the quarters of the FA Cup. Hard to tell right now. Likely finalists in the League Cup, but I don't want to celebrate before we even play Sheffield United, so there's that. 

&gt;How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?

I wish English clubs would take it more seriously. 

Right now, the scariest teams are probably the Italians. Napoli and Roma are pretty much squads built for the CL, and that's just frightening. As a fan of Napoli, any given front four (specifically Higuain, Callejon, Insigne and Hamsik, if/when he gets back to his old self) that they have outshines Spurs' in terms of goalscoring ability. So if we can manage to get Napoli or Roma, and maybe even win, we can start with the upvote parties and so on. 

&gt;Who do you think will make the top 4 this season?

City, Chelsea, United, Arsenal. It's an unopopular opinion to say that City will win because of how good Chelsea has been, but they're still hot on their trail with Aguero, Dzeko and Jovetic out. I've said it last season and I'll say it this season- City's level of depth is a model that we should use, even on a smaller budget. 

&gt;Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?

We're starting to see signs, but we're still not all the way up there. I wish more games like Everton came up, where we not only push them into their final third, but can dictate the tempo as well. The positive thing is we're getting hard to break on to. Did anyone else see Paddy Mcnair trying to hoof it to Falcao or RvP and Fazio just kick it back to anybody higher up than him yesterday? Incredible that even when the system's not fully implemented, you can see bits and pieces of it all over the pitch. 

But this is football, and let's give him the season and judge. 

&gt;Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?

Poch is probably the best we could've done, in hindsight. The parallels with him and some of the players themselves-young guy who's moving from elsewhere to try to make the next step in his career-is really refreshing. Fuck the results, but we feel like a unit again. Redknapp was greedy, AVB seemed too distant and controlling, Sherwood seemed too talkative, butt I can't really see any of this with Poch other than maybe controlling all aspects of the play. 

I posted an article maybe about a week ago, where Poch said something about our academy being better than Southampton's. Even if it's not true, he goes on to say something along the lines of ""when you step inside of the training grounds, you can see the U-8s playing and looking up to the U-18s and U-21s"". That sounds like a family, really, and I'm glad he's bringing in some academy products and has faith in them, even on a bad day. 

&gt;What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?

Eleven Harry Kanes. 

In all seriousness though, it's got to be Lloris, Walker, Fazio, Vert, Davies, Capoue (or Bentaleb, toss up really), Mason, Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela, Kane.

&gt;What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?

See flair. Toss up between Harry Kane and Eriksen. Kane because he's almost on his way to 20 goals (I know most were in Europa, but I don't care) and the season's not even finished. He's already got a great footballing mind about him and tries to do everything, which is refreshing. The best part is that he's one of us. Eriksen because we're seeing him take the jump from ""one of the best number 10s in the PL? Debatable."" to ""definitely one of the best"". 

&gt;What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?

Lamela at first, but he's learning and has been in good form and puts in stronger defensive work as of late. Soldado and Paulinho are the only two I really want gone. 

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?

Stubbornly, I'll say CB. Chriches is mistake prone, but he's so good on the ball for the position that he plays, and it's just fun to watch him play. After that, we've got young Eric Dier, who I think will start in a few years for us. Kaboul is already expendable at this point if the ITK is true, isn't he?

&gt;What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?

Striker and left forward. We're relying on a youngster and Chadli who's good, but looking at Eriksen and Lamela, he doesn't really come with the bag of tricks and can disappear for long stretches before scoring. Those two are absolute musts over the summer, but the reinforcements don't have to be starters.  

&gt;What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?

Soldado and Paulinho. There's a place for Capoue IMO, but I don't know why he isn't being played.

&gt;What transfers IN need to happen next summer?

I'll go with Lacazette and Andre Ayew. Fuck man, Dries Mertens spends time on the Napoli bench when Insigne's playing, and I think we can get him if we wanted to as well.

If you think you'll need access to the money sooner, say five years or less, then you're looking at either fixed rate bonds or a normal savings account. The returns are much lower, but your money is safer and generally easily accessible (although with a bond you'll have to wait till the term ends before you can reclaim the money).

We get

1) 2 x (myself and missus) Mobile phone insurance (has paid out for a broken iPhone screen with no fuss) - this meant a large cost was reduced to the £25 excess. 

2) travel insurance (incl. winter sports) - practical as we ski a lot and have family abroad.  Gives me peace of mind should
My expensive equipment be damaged by an airline for instance. Or that if we get hurt outside of traditionally e11 card coverage etc.  

3) breakdown insurance - have not tested/needed. Pretty sure car finance has it chucked in too.

We also get no fee withdrawal of cash (subject to visa rates I think). in Europe. Use occasionally when I have business day trips to the continent. Otherwise I use a Caxton card which is better value.

You get other benefits I think - but those are the ones I'm aware of. 

Overall it's not bad value if you look at it for a purely phone &amp; travel insurance standpoint. I guess also it means you can claim for small things without it affecting your no claims on say, household insurance. 

New paying for it for a year and a bit now.

On the other hand Bond is Scottish, could Elba credibly be Scottish? The accent doesn't matter, the type of Scottish that Bond is can often have an English accent, Rose Leslie for example.

Is it tokenism? The Sony emails are not selecting him based on acting talent, they're saying let's fill up cinemas by having a black Bond.

I don't believe that at the moment we get what's best for *anyone*. Politics is stagnant and vapid at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Democracy is about everybody having their say. If a certain demographic don't bother to participate because they feel their participation is worthless, when in reality it is their lack of participation en masse that makes them feel this way, then there is no reason why things can't be changed to encourage them a bit more.
&gt; 

How? An unlimited source of information with a vast variety of views and opinions that they can refer to at any time? Every party having a youth section that they can join and participate in? A means by which they can engage in political discussion 24 hours a day? Sorry, I'm being a bit facetious, but these weren't options that other generations had, and now the amount of ways to learn about anything politcal is staggering. There used to be half a dozen daily newspapers and the odd TV programme. 

What more is needed?

They run, don't worry. :) Take the bus from outside Temple Meads (literally just outside) and stay on for around 20 minutes. Get off when you see [a glorious building with a big fountain.](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Queens+Rd,+Bristol,+City+of+Bristol/@51.4578994,-2.6089011,3a,75y,327.04h,87.77t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sExCdbA1Zd0QKa7UHD9dPrw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x48718dc52119fd05:0xc7e1520e03ddffa7?hl=en)

It really helps if you have an iPhone/GPS enabled phone so you can get off according to the map.

If you're really not sure, just ask anyone on the bus or even the driver. Most Bristolians are lovely and will gladly help apart from the occasional cunt.


&gt;I plan on staying at the Hodgin House[2] , the first coupla days/dazes/weeks. Is that a reasonable plan or would you advise against that? I can't seem to find any real reviews, hence my enquiry.

Hodgkin House is reasonable. It's not the best and it's not the worst, but the flexibility they offer in accommodation arrangements would be perfect for an international student. It'll keep you going whilst you get your feet around the city, get familiar with the place, and to find a more long-term accommodation plan. :) Unfortunately I can't tell you whether the *quality of service* itself is any good as I never stayed there as a tenant. I'm sure it'll be *OKish*. If it doesn't work out, just come back to /r/Bristol and let us know - Someone will be able to advise.

&gt;What's the water quality like in your beloved city? Can you actually drink the tap water? Or do I have to get six-packs from the store every other day?

false,usrname42,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"I went to this talk, here are some (disorganised and long) notes:

Austerity has been bad in short and long term

So how come the Conservatives are seen as more competent than Labour?

Labour have failed to challenge the Conservative narrative.

Conservative say that labour caused the crisis, redefining crisis as fiscal rather than financial. 

Claimed that fiscal crisis was caused by excessive welfare spending - Britain living beyond its means.

But deficit pre recession was very low, 1.6% on average over 1997-2007 - a permanent small deficit is economically justifiable, for example if it's used for investment.

Nor was there a significant increase in welfare spending.

Deficit rose in recession, but this is natural

Labour didn't want to talk about their economic record - it would force them to take a more radical position on the financial sector.

Labour has now bought into Conservative concern about the deficit - earlier some Labour figures criticised the pace of austerity, but this didn't work.

The basic problem was that Labour didn't challenge the moralistic view that borrowing is bad.

In pre-modern world most borrowing was for consumption, so over-borrowing = over-consumption. This is no longer true, but we still carry the idea that debt is immoral.

The idea has changed for businesses and individuals (to an extent) but not governments. 

It's also not a burden for the next generation - firstly borrowing may reduce future debt, but secondly, anyone in the next generation who holds government bonds will benefit.

So it's a distributional issue, not a generational issue.

Even the basic Keynesian argument has been rejected by most people, because of these problems and the old fallacy of composition.

People don't understand that your spending is my income, which makes it difficult to make more complicated arguments. 

People also conflate the deficit with spending - households cannot change their salary, but governments can increase their income rather than cutting spending. 

Labour didn't manage to reinvent the welfare state, so it's been seen in negative terms. It can be a benefit to innovation — people fight harder to oppose automation if they have no alternative. 

So they are seen as defending an outdated, unaffordable system.

More generally, Labour have no alternative vision for the economy.

Despite a 30% currency devaluation, we still have a major current account deficit - second highest in history.

Labour should have changed the terms of the debate rather than working within the debate.",0,1419890005,null,0,false,0,cn8oocd,t3_2qqetg,t1_cn8oocd,t1_cn8ku3y,null,1425160283,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;It was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times.[33] The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character.[34] The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud.[35] The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.[36]

false,bleepbloop12345,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;how is having a job exploitation?

Within a capitalist economy wage labour is always exploitation. Imagine you own a factory that produces widgets; the raw materials for each widget cost £2.50 and once they are assembled by a worker the finished widget sells for £10. The person that owns the factory - the capitalist - has made £7.50, but clearly they have to pay some of this to the worker who actually did the work. 

Obviously if they pay them the entire £7.50 then they have made no money themselves, and thus have no reason to exist. This means that they must pay them **less then the full value of their labour!** Not only that, but they must pay them as little as they possibly can because any business that doesn't do this will be undercut by other businesses, this is the nature of a market economy.

So, what's the alternative? Within a socialist economy the workers would own the means of production (anything that is used to create value, such as factories, offices, workshops) themselves and they can recoup the full value of their labour. No exploitation, no oppression, no social classes. 

[Richard Wolff explains it much better than I can, if you want something in a bit more depth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIgGOYKhs)

&gt;how is buying a hoover exploitation?

It's not, as I explained wage labour is exploitation. 

&gt;as long as the ""oppressed"" were free to work elsewhere or buy other hoovers, i don't see the problem.

While you certainly can change jobs - although this is becoming increasingly difficult - you cannot opt out of exploitation within the capitalist system. ",0,1419890400,null,0,false,0,cn8owcu,t3_2qnvsv,t1_cn8owcu,t1_cn8kysv,null,1425160179,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Bad:**

- Jazz is not good

- Shelvey was not good

- Fabianski was not good

- Liverpool were good

**Good:**

- Gomis looked exciting out there

- Got to see Routledge's ass

**What to take from this:**

- Liverpool played very well, but two of the goals were the result of ridiculous flukes. I thought we were taking it to them the 2nd half before Fabianski screwed us.

- We NEED Ki. I get that this is sentimental for Shelvey, but he is supposed to be our HOLDING MID and he was playing higher than Siggy. I've really lost patience for Shelvey. Fool me once, fool me twice etc.

- Jazz is just not going to work. Rangel wasn't much better, but he was better. We have to get fullbacks

- Gomis looked dynamic, but he has to create chemistry with Gylfi. They had a lot of trouble finding each other out there.

- Take a second and realize how far we've come. We are infuriated that Swansea failed to win against Liverpool at Anfield. They played quite well and we can't forget the resources they have.

Shelvey has talent but does not have the bottle. We didn't follow the runs and they just overloaded us in and around the box. If Fabianski has come out calling for that corner, he has to get his head away from the ball.

Monk should not tolerate that elbow throwing too - he shouldn't be in the lineup for QPR.

Don't blame Fabianski for any of the goals really. Lallana's first was a fluke and I guess the Liverpool man derserves it for some great pressure, I hope it doesn't knock Fabianskis confidence. 

Fernandez did great to marshal Sterling for most of the game. Very proud of him for not going to the floor when the idiot struck him in the face. He's English so I don't expect retrospective action.

Dyer/Britton should have followed Moreno into the box, it was some great movement from Sterling to pull both Williams and Fernandez away.

Jazz was a bit erratic. He maybe should have read the first goal a bit differently, but Courtinho was off his shoulder and technically that was his man.

&gt; If you look back at the Bonds we've had the actor seems to need real charisma and panache, and it's clear he has that.

Agreed on all fronts and yet - look at the fuss it's causing. There's a very strong sentiment that Bond was written as a white man's part. That's just 'who Bond is'. 

Are there no white actors to play the part? Surely there must be someone suitable. Why push the issue and cause the fuss? 

I don't consider this an issue of 'equal racial opportunities' as we're discussing who might be suitable for a fictional character. If the part demands a white person: so be it! 

I would say exactly the same if they decided to consider a second Django Unchained film for instance - but Django suddenly became Hispanic or Asian. Sure there are Hispanic and Asian actors who could play the part, but that's *not who Django is*. 

When discussing the world of fictional characters it's important to remain faithful to that character, rather than swapping skin colour around for no readily apparent reason other than having a strong black actor to hand. Idris is *very* talented in The Wire, Pacific Rim, Prometheus.. that's fantastic, I have no doubt he'll have great work ahead of him. But if Bonds part is for a white character then that's OK too.

My girlfriend and her father is American, he thought we lost the Falklands war.. this was a guy who served in the US Navy. He also had no clue about the recent politics so I'm guessing it doesn't make it to US media. 
Also, during previous world cups I've had friends who've wore Argentinian football shirts. So Argentina might not be viewed as bad as you think, it's just the issue of the Falklands really. Hopefully that makes you feel a little better although I completely agree with what you're saying. 

I understand the media issue, before the internet was a popular news source things were quite similar in Britain. Many news papers here are still very much so fabricated but luckily we have always had quite reliable news broadcasts. In fact the BBC quite often report against themselves which is quite rare for a media organisation to do. 
The older generations that do not use the internet for news still relies on news publications for information. The kind that most people on /r/unitedkingdom quite rightly hate.

That's really interesting. I didn't even think of this really because I don't think any territory outside of the British Ilse were every mentioned during my entire time at school. Just goes to show what certain countries believe is important to talk about in education.

That's a fair point to make! I'm not on a high horse whatsoever I just don't think the referee was unfair all game. 

The way I see it the game has regressed into pretty much a non-contact sport. Some referee's are more lenient than others and apparently that's acceptable. Even fifa tells you which referee's tend to be lenient leading me to believe there is no distinct standard if you get what i'm saying ? 

There used to be a time where football was a contact sport and you could tackle as hard as you want. Now it seems to be up to individual referees as to how much of a contact sport the game is! 

I think there should be a group of retired referees, who review games under a particular standard. It's the only way you can get a unified set of rules as far as I can see.

Sorry if I came across as high and mighty, I just personally know referees and have reffed a game or two myself and damn is it hard to know if a player is diving or not these days especially inside the box. 

What's even crazier to me is that there seems to be a different set of rules inside/outside the box ? Why should one tackle be a foul if it's outside the box yet the same foul inside the box won't be given!

But my understanding is that post-match bans are implemented to cover incidents that the ref did not see. It's important for the game for the ref's discretion to be trusted, right or wrong, so the FA is unlikely to overturn something the ref claims to have seen and chose not to act upon. Some games are very cordial and if one player gives a hard tackleout of nowhere, he could be booked. Other games are very physical and a ref will let more slide. 
  
Every retroactive ban I've seen has been sentenced because the ref was out of view of the incident.  
  
Think about it, if a ref's decision could be overruled by the FA every time, why even have refs give cards? 
  
 
  
IMO, Sterling and Shelvey each deserved a red card for their actions. However, if the ref (in clear view of both incidents) decided not to pursue action, then the matter should be done.

false,Dan787,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire,"Just to clear up some facts for those interested:

The Boeing 747 has four sets of ""main"" landing gear, as well as one set of nose gear. The rightmost set of main gear clearly had some sort of serious fault (which the aircraft will have reported to the pilots shortly after take-off) and therefore did not/was not deployed (not sure if they can be deployed independently on the 747) on landing. This can be seen on the photos of the aircraft from below - some people have pointed to the ""wonky"" left set of gear, but this is its normal position, so that the rear wheels contact the ground first.

The aircraft can be seen listing to one side in the photos of the aircraft on the ground. Clearly this is not how the aircraft is supposed to sit, but that is the extent of the seriousness of this problem. Aircraft are designed with redundancy so that they can perform safely with one or more failed systems (in this case, a set of landing gear). The airport was closed and fire engines were released as a precaution, but that is all.

BBC news reported the aircraft circled low over sussex (i.e. Gatwick) to burn fuel before landing. This is incorrect, it actually burned fuel high over the sea, as per normal procedure. Any circling low over Gatwick was for personnel on the ground to observe the landing gear and report back to the pilots if/how they had deployed.

I'd recommend it, Just remember to get to the Eurostar station early as you have to go through metal detectors, we didn't account for that and turned up 10 minutes before the train left, had to get hurried through it was all quite embarrassing and very stressful.

Maybe it would be better to call it a 'measuring bowl' than mixing, as you would do this with any tea.

I have known one family that (somewhat pretentiously) mixed their tea that way from an old caddy into the mid 20th century.  Both black teas, of course, the one side was always Darjeeling, which they found too heavy, so they cut it with a little Lapsang Souchong or Old Tree Yunnan.

e.g. There are people who now own their own hairdressers and beauty salons - but by all other reckoning they would be working class, background, educational level etc. However in the past, a business owner would be seen as middle class at the very least.

There has been social mobility in the UK, and the ""working class"" if such a thing really exists anymore, definitely does have life better than in the past.

However, there is no doubt that if you are born poor you are way more likely to die poor, if you don't go to private school you will struggle in the corporate world, and that a persons name, accent and background still matters.

I remember when I was a kid we would be given out maps that showed the Tierra del Fuego province as ""Tierra del Fuego, Antartic &amp; Islands of the Southern Atlantic (read: Falklands/Malvinas)"". [Ushuaia, where this incident occured, is marked as the of all three (note the same coloring is used).](http://www.portalplanetasedna.com.ar/archivos_varios3/mapa_politico_argentina.jpg) This is further enforced by the many references to the Falklands/Malvinas throughout our every day lives. As the TG crew saw, there are thousands of signs that say ""Las Malvinas son argentinas"". We have stadiums called ""Islas Malvinas"". Whenever the politicians are struggling they will always ask Britain to open negotiations to score easy political points. You get the idea. This constant mentioning of the islands in all facets of life make the issue very raw for us, especially in Ushuaia.

In fact, as many of you noted in the other thread, the government funded channel now produced a fairly biased [children's cartoon describing the war (subtitles are sarcastic).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKkcTpCur7g) Unfortunately there is no such thing such as unbiased state-sponsored  programs in Argentina. The government purchased the football rights so they can air state-propaganda to a very wide audience at halftime. The commentary by the Public TV is basically fanatical of the party in charge. All of this at the tax payer's expense, of course. 

As the OP noted media in Argentina is of extremely low quality and the few independent news outlets that exist are very small and don't reach a large audience. Often they don't have enough material to be published daily and instead are on a weekend schedule.

The issue of self-determination is not very important to us. From our perspective, the islands were in our possession. The British then invaded them and took them from us. The usual view is that the children of these invaders do not have a right to self determination since their forefathers were there illegally in the first place.

This is not to say that no one sees past this. Of course some do. There have been OP ed pieces calling Argentina's claim to the islands as ""colonial"". That children's cartoon came under some criticism from parents (whose teachers were showing it at class time). Some people are exhausted that the government mentions the islands whenever things go wrong. But overall there is an entrenched feeling amongst most of the population, actively pushed by our government institutions, that the islands are ours.

**TL;DR** Argentines are raised believing that the islands are Argentine from a very young age due to an overwhelming amount of propaganda that tells us it is so. The islands are part of our national identity. Most of us incorporate this knowledge before we have the ability to critically think about the issue and never question it.",0,1419898655,null,0,false,0,cn8ta5q,t3_2qomkp,t1_cn8ta5q,t3_2qomkp,null,1425158081,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

If she argued that you shouldn't park there you could point out that there aren't any rules about that and you were just popping to the shop.  Maybe you'd have to sympathise that living opposite a shop does mean lots of people stop there and obviously she would like to park in front of their house, who wouldn't?  If you were feeling mean you could say it was the kind of thing you guess should be considered when you buy a house (bad luck if the shop opened after that)(or if she kicks off).  Basically, though, try to reason with her.

If she wouldn't answer, or slammed the door or whatever, I'd continue to try, maybe leaving it few minutes before knocking again and try to keep my temper.  People aren't usually that twattish unless they're stressed about something.

Interestingly, I spent a few very entertained minutes in Paris a couple of years ago when a guy whose car had been blocked in in this way simply drove back and forth into the cars either end of him until he could get out, he was just crushing the bumpers to get the extra few inches he needed really.  The bumpers all looked fine when he left, apparently they are good for 5mph or so.  Apparently that's how you could deal with it in Paris.

Might not try that myself unless it was an emergency.

If she continues to be totally unreasonable and refuses to move it I would say that as you're been made unable to move your vehicle, if you can't find the people to help you, either the driver of the other car or someone who could move her car, you'd have to call the police, then call the police (101 if you don't know your local number *not* 999! ^token ^note ^for ^the ^stupid)  They wouldn't deal with it quickly but I reckon they would come in the end if she continued to refuse and they would, pretty obviously to me, make her move it.

Whether the value they create is manifested in physical form or not they're still labouring in the MoP for less than the value of their labour.

&gt;or produce without any means of production other than creativity.

Example?

&gt;Are Formula 1 engineers getting hundreds of grand a year working class because they are just producing a car using the production facilities provided by their employer?

Yes. No matter how much they make they're still being exploited and they're still labouring in the MoP.

&gt;Too simplistic an answer

Perhaps, but sometimes the right answers are simple.

He has not solidified himself as a top striker yet because consistansy is key. A lot of players have had great individual seasons.
