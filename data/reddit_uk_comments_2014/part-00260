true,Drilski,null,null,"1) First Past the Post. Elections operate on exactly the same mechanics as those in the US: whoever has the plurality of votes in a constituency wins the seat. The Greens have (like the Lib Dems) very diffuse electoral support, so they never get elected. It takes something like 34000 votes to get a Tory elected, 32500 to get a Labour seat, 110000+ to get a Lib Dem a seat and 285000 to get a Green elected.

2) Thatcher is a legend to (http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3158/Margaret-Thatcher-19252013.aspx) 1/3 of the British public, most of the Tory party and, a fair bit of UKIP and, behind closed doors, some Labourites and Lib Dems. The people who look down on her in this country are generally the ones for whom she wrought nothing but personal misery and long term unemployment, along with the modern left who absolutely hate her. 

3) I don't really understand what you're implying. The UK experiences multiculturalism in a very different way to Americans. For the average American, their city will be Whites of European Descent, Hispanics, Blacks + a larger than average concentration of a smaller minority group. For the average Briton living in a major city (and indeed across most medium-large towns) they will be in contact with a vast array of different nationalities and ethnicities on a daily basis. You have to understand, the US does not have a large relative Muslim population. For many Americans, Islam is something in the Middle East. In Britain, Islam is a religion that is adhered to by an increasing number of British citizens born to first or second generation immigrants. Unless you live in a very white area (i.e. a village in the country) and never leave you will almost certainly be in contact with someone who adheres to Islam (strictly or not) on a pretty regular basis. There is a very real threat that we are currently nurturing home grown extremists who are now being trained in Middle Eastern conflicts, who can then come back and sow dissent and radicalisation. 

The stances on this vary. Personally I feel rehabilitation, education and increased intergration are the way forward, but ""just deport them all already"" or something a shade less extreme is not exactly a viewpoint relegated to neo nazis.

4) Look up his approval ratings and find out. Beyond ""lol Tory Eton boy what a fucker"" and ""weak ass who won't drag us out of Europe"" there's hardly a crystalised view of what he's like. He's been dealt a pretty shocking hand in terms of coalition government, shitty economy, rising threats to NATO (whilst being forced to cut down on defence spending) and his lunatic party and the press still banging on about Europe and all the other stupid shit that pleases Daily Mail readers but is fucking useless policy. 

5) Because the NHS is:  
-cheaper than American healthcare  
-better than American healthcare  
-more egalitarian than American healthcare  
-more accountable than American healthcare  
-more adaptable than American healthcare  
-not just out to make money.  
Private healthcare is shit for the majority of people in countries where it's the norm. The British public thankfully regard ""I had an accident, now I have to sell my house because I can't afford the medical bills"" as an unacceptable outcome.

6) No, sorry. UKIP *are* a party of racist, unrealistic, hypocritical fools who do nothing but pander for votes with the money fed to them by a Yorkshire businessman who really hates the EU. Farage is a con artist who's been playing up his ""bloke"" persona to pander to voters who feel most MPs are out of touch, despite the fact that the man is a walking embodiment of the business-funded crass ideologue that the public hate when they're from one of the major parties. They are a protest party, buoyed by the real failure of the political establishment to connect with voters, a favourable press climate and easy money from ardently anti-EU donators. 

UKIP will never be in government. Now, they may influence the Tory party to head rightwards (indeed, Cameron's promise of an EU referndum is already a tangible effect on the political landscape) but if they ever win more than 10 seats in the Commons (and even that's pushing it to the extreme) I'll happily eat a pile of shit.",0,1409850826,null,0,1409851008,0,ck92xhu,t3_2fe3fp,t1_ck92xhu,t1_ck8mtbu,null,1427198652,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

&gt; Immigrants get the message that they've moved here because our culture is superior to theirs

In my city, Bradford, which is beaten only by Marseille in terms of percentage of Muslims, immigrants came here to work in wool mills. During the industrial revolution immigrants from the country to the (then new) city did those jobs. Then immigrant Irish. Then people who mostly came from mountain villages in Kashmir (but identified as Pakistani) did it. All of them were treated like absolute shit from beginning to end. They definitely got the message that they were deemed inferior. 

That wasn't multiculturalism. That was ""you go sit in that corner and don't speak to anyone else"". And it was enforced too. The bumpkins got it, the Irish got it and then the Asian immigrants got it. And so they stuck together while we heaped blame on them for refusing to integrate.

Best thing about the UEFA Cup/Europa League was the fans and obscure trips to European cities.

I still remember the PSG fans, they were fucking nuts. This was 6 years ago, so before their takeover. I've never seen a police presence like that at a game at CoMS. Riot police everywhere.

I met a mate outside the ground, and we'd missed the kick off by a few minutes. When we got through the turnstiles we could hear a big commotion coming from the stands, so we walk to the entrance of the stands and have a look before we head for our seats in a different part of the ground. We look down to see several dozens of PSG fans trying to get at the City fans on the other side of the police cordon, and the whole away end facing our direction. Lots of pointing and gesticulating, but the police pushed them back. Set the tone for a funny night.

They were loud and raucous all night.

The game was terrible, and it was more entertaining watching what they got up to in the away end.

Not long after that incident the riot police game in and strengthened the police line.

By the time halftime came around things had calmed.

Then loads of them started climbing over the back of the stand like chimps to get onto the concourse (instead of just walking up the steps), I watched as the riot police belatedly clattered them with batons to get them to stop and come down.

Well, [here's](http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/india-backs-russias-legitimate-interests-in-ukraine/) a bit of reporting on the Indian position, but it's worth noting that 58 countries (including all the BRICS) abstained on the 27th March UN resolution.

&gt;what do you think the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement in 2012 was?

An association agreement, not EU membership nor even necessarily a legitimate path to it.

&gt;You'll have to explain more here becuse at the very skeletal definition as I understand empire you need to have the imperial power, controlling a large land man, and the most autonomy any of the subunits are going to get is at bet some sort of puppet state. 

I think we'll be here all day if we're going to discuss imperialism, neo-imperialism, hegemony, etc., but the US/UK/EU between them have large numbers of military bases around the world, troops stationed in many countries, a few active wars, several more proxy/covert wars/police actions/black ops, and have invaded, destabilised, overthrown,  'brought democracy to', assassinated (or attempted same of) leaders of, etc. more countries than pretty much any other 'power bloc' in history, including the old Soviet Union and all other communist powers combined.

Another Irish problem just after we sorted out the last one.

Meaning:

 - We've created a situation we refuse to understand.
 - It's fuelled by guerrilla warfare, which isn't really very easy to train an army for because you can't tell the difference between soldiers and civilians and there's never been a formal declaration of war because there's nobody to formally declare war against.
 - What makes this a particular PITA is that if you kill a soldier, you are likely to make an enemy (and hence a soldier) of his brother. If you kill a civilian thinking he's a soldier (very easy to do this when they're all dressed the same and living together), it's pretty well guaranteed.
 - You can't solve the problem by locking up terrorists rather than killing them because locking someone up for something most of their nearest and dearest don't see a big problem with just creates more terrorists.
 - ""We don't negotiate with terrorists"" doesn't work very well when literally every person you might have any sort of discussion-with-a-view-to-compromise with has some sort of terrorist connections.
 - It won't be resolved until several generations later when everyone's long forgotten what they're fighting about and someone who's prepared to turn a blind eye to historic terrorist connections comes to the table.",0,1409854229,null,0,false,0,ck94pno,t3_2ffx8s,t1_ck94pno,t3_2ffx8s,null,1427197718,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,MacBrolaf,null,null,"Hey guys. I am an Irishman and watching this whole debate has been quite intriguing. Firstly, I am a republican, and I am for soveriegnty of all nations and peoples and believe that self determination should be at the core of all Modern concepts of statehood.

To me there is one aspect of this entire debate that says to me that Scotland indeed needs and deserves independence. The aspect I am speaking about about is the attitude of Westminster towards the debate.

The very fact that Westminster feels they have a say about how Scotland should be governed is to me, the most stark illustration as to why Scotland needs Independence. The money and effort they have put into a campaign to try and Influence the outcome of a referendum involving another nation is abhorrent. The Scottish question is exactly that, a question for the Scots, not a question for Westminster. Yet Westminster led a campaign not of information, but a campaign of subjugation. They have been spreading fear about what would happen if Scotland voting yes. This fearmongering only illustrates how weak a genuine position the pro-union side has.

As an irishman I can relate to this debate quite easily. Scotland took a route that could of been one taken by Ireland. That is Home Rule. Ireland was close to taking home rule but for the event of the easter rising causing Irish opinion swinging toward independence. The reason it went this way was because it was evident at the time, that the UK had no genuine interest in bestowing the Irish people with unmolested rights and genuine self determination. We move a century on and the UK have shown a similar attitude towards Scotland. They sew seeds of fear and partake in a campaign that does not Highlight the positives of staying in the Union, but fabricating negatives about leaving the union. This fear mongering is a deliberate attempt to subvert the right of self determination of Scotland.

The issue with currency, european union, resources , infrastructure etc are are surmountable issues. There is no difficulty in resolving these as every self determining government across the world deals with these issues day to day. 

Scotland will of course be accepted into the EU, the EU gains nothing from freezing out Scotland, and besides, they are probably more likely to be in the European Union 10 years from now as an independent state instead of part of the UK.

The UK are acting as if this is the first time that a nation has broken away, but as an Irishman I can tell you that our country only benefited and grew as a nation since independence, I am sure our Gaelic brethern will prosper likewise.",0,1409854759,null,0,false,0,ck94zrv,t3_2fciy6,t1_ck94zrv,t3_2fciy6,null,1427197586,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

My point was that ""jokes"" like your lower this debate and we should raise it, that's trying to be rational not a 'concern troll'. 

You mention the ""polite and rational"" debate you mention but you have shown in two comments that you have no interest in this and you are the only one making this debate less pleasant. 

I could go back and quote you and go through the points you put up and we could go back and forth but what's the point? It'll make you more angry and it'll make me more despairing. I'm sure if you provoke me enough I'll get irritated and make point against point until we both are sick of it but that's the other irony - calling me a troll while your ""joke"" was only intended to get a rise out of people on a post where the guy had been asking for advice on where to get information. You chose to take a shot at the opposition instead of helping and you got your rise, people downvoted you and I replied. I should have just downvoted you and moved on but I didn't. 

I'm sorry if my comment was patronising, it probably was. Frankly your snide joke (with the proper meaning and that's me being patronising again, sorry) was intended to lower the tone in a thread and so i am sure that me triying to make a point about polite debate was lost. You chose to be unpleasant. Your second response is just abusive and confirms my original point. 

The only thing I was say in case anyone reads your message and thinks it is correct is that this is *not* a political debate. We are trying to decide the mechanism of our government, the leaders of the two campaigns share far more similarities than differences and on both sides there have been political alliances from people with different views. I know people with exactly the same political views who disagree, I know people who are wildly different who agree. 

After the vote we then have to have an election to see who we want to lead us and THEN we will make political decisions. The referendum decides independence or not, general elections choose the political ideology we are governed by. Elections are where we choose the politicians who will represent us, how the country could be run and each policy that will go forward is not up for debate here, only general views about what the country might be in the future. 

That's all, feel free to disagree and call me whatever you like, it wont change anything - if you want to discuss sensible I am happy to do that too.

During those 7 years they imported thousands of doctors whilst those 10,000 couldn't get a placement.

On top of this the rules on qualifications are... a bit weird. My sister's friend received nursing training from New Zealand without a degree, received far less training than nurses receive here and they hired her on the NHS with her qualification. Yet if she was native, she'd need to have done 3 years of a degree. Also being from a preferred country she did not have to perform any conversion training. This is a massive loophole, she objectively received less training then she would otherwise have received. I'm not saying this makes her a bad nurse, I think the requirements push out perfectly decent people who just aren't very academic, but have the right attitude and nurturing spirit.

They also hire nurses from the rest of the world with even less qualifications and indeed it is very difficult to prove if said qualifications are even legitimate. It's only recently the government has started mandating proper checks on this which are essentially being waived due to the enormity of the task.

I don't quite understand why we mandate such stringent training requirements then hire foreigners without those requirements.

I think it's because it's expensive to train medical professionals and the government simply can't be arsed. Especially given we have a quota on the number of people who can do medical training which lends credence to this.

Also, I don't remember if it was your pod or another one (I spent like four hours in the car yesterday, and listened to four different podcasts), but in regards to strikers it's all down to Harry Kane. He's get a good look at some point this year and when he does I think he'll take a permanent spot in the starting XI. He does everything well. He's a more complete player than Adebayor, better in the air and more versatile than Soldado, and has better instincts overall than either Adebayor or Soldado, combined with comparable raw skills. In his relatively few opportunities last season, he posted more goals/90 minutes than Adebayor (.54 to .49), almost tripled Ade's shots/90 minutes (2.89 to 1.05), and almost doubled his key passes in the box (.72 to .4). Comparing Kane's numbers to Soldado's will just make you sad about Soldado.) Adebayor probably has better pure striking ability and Soldado certainly has a solid track record, but for me it's only a matter of time before Kane's greater overall effectiveness becomes undeniable.

&gt;What does the UK being unlikely to vote for a more left wing party than labour have to do with his statement?

It makes a huge difference as to how likely social reform &amp; justice is to come about in scotland.

Currently the UK votes in people like the Tories, and Labour who are slightly leftier Tories, who impose things that are bad for poor people. If Scotland was independent it would no longer be ruled by this government. It would be ruled by it's own government which would never be Tory because voters in Scotland are much more left wing. This is really basic stuff.

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;So much anger, so much rudeness when I was polite and respectful of your position. 

No you weren't. In a roundabout way you all but accused me of 'incitement to hatred' and 'attacking the no campaign', when all I did was make a casual joke that, at the very worst, even if you take me totally literally, was incitement to gawp at an Orange Order parade. 

You hide your snide, patronising ad-hominem shit behind your anodyne sentences, while demanding that I accept that you're pleasant and rational, but you're neither rational nor pleasant. You just choose to hide your epithets in non-sequitur tangents and fabricated accusations is all.

&gt;Your second response is just abusive and confirms my original point. 

No it doesn't. I was never abusive, or incited any hatred towards people in the No campaign, or even the Orange Order in my original post, and I wasn't abusive towards them in the second post. Or in this one. I aim the abuse squarely at you, /u/fringely. 

If you weren't so hellbent on twisting my words, you might note that there's even a point while I agree with what you said about the No campaign, while simultaneously telling you to fuck off. I don't mind unionists or No people at all. I do mind being accused of inciting hatred or attacking people though.  

&gt;You chose to take a shot at the opposition instead of helping and you got your rise, people downvoted you and I replied. I should have just downvoted you and moved on but I didn't. 

Well I wasn't trying to get a rise so much as a quiet chuckle at the almost undisputable fact that the Orange Order march on the 13th will be the biggest and best-organized Unionist demonstration of the referendum campaign. It's also a perfectly good, informative, answer to the OP's question - he might well be interested in such a demonstration and nobody else here thought to mention it. I'm half-tempted to go along and see what an Orange Lodge march looks like meself, and compare with the Apprentice Boys parade a few weeks back. I wasn't actually sure whether I was downvoted because people here don't share my sense of humour or because the No people are embarrassed by who their bedfellows are. So it goes.

&gt;i'm not sure if you are aware of the irony of accusing me of straw manning

I'm not aware. I didn't put any arguments in your mouth. You did go off on a tangent about incitement to hatred and attacking the No campaign, after all, for no good reason, and I chose to call you up on that nonsense. I don't see where I straw manned you.

I mean, I accused you of underhanded ad hominems, while throwing a few blatant - and well deserved - ones your way, so I would understand the irony there but straw manning? You'll have to explain that one.

&gt;One thing for sure is that I am now far more leaning towards no than I was this morning as you have been abusive and unpleasant. 

You've been abusive and unpleasant too, in your own condescending, sleekit way, while self-righteously pleading that you're the calm voice of reason (something I don't accept at all). I think being honestly abusive beats your form of abusiveness any day of the week.

You can vote whichever way you want. Given how you managed to extrapolate a whole world of attacks and incitement to hatred of the No campaign (as opposed to verbally abusing you, personally, of course) out of nothing much at all, I suspect you were just looking for an excuse to be a self-righteous prick and say this stuff anyways; I don't think me calling a cunt a cunt is likely to have changed anyones mind!",0,1409858194,null,0,1409859340,0,ck96u2e,t3_2fcb4f,t1_ck96u2e,t1_ck955x9,null,1427196727,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0

The fact that a French bank would get heavily fined by an American court for trading with the boogeymen in Iran, Cuba and Sudan is hardly a way of reassuring me that the basic capitalist fraud at the heart of our financial system is being in any way addressed.  This is just US foreign policy under another guise.  In any event, from their own lips, this isn't going to have much effect on them as a bank:

'BNP said in a statement that it will retain its licenses and expects “no impact” on its operational or business capabilities. In 2015, the lender will clear U.S. dollars through a third party. The Bank of France said today BNP can withstand the fine and dollar clearing ban.'

Lloyds got a mere £105 million fine for the LIBOR scandal [according to the FCA](http://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/lloyds-banking-group-fined-105m-libor-benchmark-failings).  Stealing from each and every one of us (and making massive profits from it, way in excess of the fine) is 90 times less serious than doing business with Cuba.

true,Firefox7275,null,null,"A good serum will contain proven actives for a specific dermatological issue, will generally be thinner consistency than a moisturiser and are not necessarily hydrating (although they can be).

The Skin Essential Actives KinNiaNAG serum is formulated for acne and anti ageing; niacinamide is useful for hyperpigmentation, boosts ceramide synthesis and helps with acne. I found this serum very gentle even for my reactive skin and it is RAVED about on some skincare forums. For it to be reasonably priced you'd want to DIY using the SEA kit which makes three serums IIRC.

If you want to be able to purchase products in drugstores or supermarkets, some the Simple Kind to Skin and Olay Total Effects products contain niacinamide with other skin friendly ingredients. Some great offers at present.

If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

true,purfling,null,null,"My experience of primary school history included a lot of stuff about the Celts, tying in with the year we did on the Romans. I do get what you're trying to achieve though.

Debating religion is a good idea, but it's hard to create a curriculum based on debate unless you have a set list of topics to debate, which would be fairly restrictive anyway. Also, it would end up as a few of the most outspoken members of the class debating with everyone else being bored stiff. Another thing is that I can see that causing bigger rifts in the classroom with the potential to get quite nasty.

In terms of language, I don't really agree. Most of the Spanish in the world is spoken in South America and parts of the USA, and most of the people in Britain only use it when they go on holiday and even then most people will reply to you in English. Chinese I agree would be good in terms of business, as would Japanese, but both languages are very different from English. It is a lot easier to learn German or French in the classroom because you can directly translate English words and sentences into these languages following sets of rules that you can learn as opposed to Chinese and Japanese which have some fairly abstract concepts in terms of language, including the inflection of your voice as you say a word changing its meaning.

I agree that governments should appreciate their teachers and that teachers do seem to strike quite a lot, but overall I don't think it's too disruptive in the long term, and they do have a right to strike on conditions and pay.

I don't think there is a simple solution to bring everyone together to be honest. Showing how we've all helped each other out is one of those things that looks good on paper but gets everyone bored pretty quickly.

I agree on your position that schools should be treated as a place for development and that they should be important in any government. Permanent exclusion wouldn't solve anything, because then you have a group of people going out into the world with the only thing they know how to do being bullying other people.

Parents, as far as I can tell, are already encouraged in most schools to take an active part in the education of their children, but any that already don't want to help probably won't whatever you do. They may also see it as you trying to tell them how to bring up their children, which I don't think would help the relationship between the school and the parents.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

Oily skin can denote irritation and/ or dehydration, the skin pumping out excess sebum in a desperate attempt to protect itself. My scalp and face became less oily the week I quit using all sulphate surfactants (in everything foaming such as shampoo, shower gel, hand soap,face wash, even toothpaste).

The Simple refreshing face wash contains cocoamidopropyl betaine instead of SLS/ SLES, but ideally even then it would be best to stick to once daily (water wash or gentle toner only in the AM). Also some of the Simple products contain niacinamide which is useful in acne hyperpigmentation and boost ceramide synthesis, so helping skin remain hydrated. Some also have bisabolol which is anti inflammatory and anti bacterial so *potentially* helping active acne and reducing the severity of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

What you could try, if you still want to go via train, is splitting up the journey. Tickets cost more into main station (and bath/Bristol are defs counted as such) so by splitting up the journey ie penzance to Exeter then Exeter to Bath you might save yourself a bundle.

My brother is a teacher and he said the one thing you have to be really careful for is the school abusing the money they get. If you're awarded a full time TA they're given money for that but they do not have to ring fence it and its just added to general funding. Many schools unfortunately don't use that money to pay for a TA for an individual child but rather will have one TA in a class overseeing a few SEN kids. That way the school gets to use the money elsewhere whilst still box ticking ""full time TA"".

Unfortunately there is no set standard and the policies and quality vary massively. Some are like my son's and are outstanding, others pay lip service to get the funding and tick a box. Sounds like this is a particularly shitty school.

Well, if the French had secured their own borders at the point of entry, the situation would not exist. Given how difficult it is to travel as a normal, legal passenger I am always amazed when these stories appear. In the UK, if a traveller enters the country and ""loses"" their documents, it is very difficult to deport them. They can be detained, searched and investigated. This is the main foundation of the illegal immigration story in the UK. As the ""country of origin"" or ""home country"" cannot be determined (impossible without papers, though getting slightly better with the introduction of electronic measures at the borders). Those arriving through illicit means (back of lorries, boat, etc) can't be traced through e-borders. This leaves two options - leave to remain with no permission to work (and benefits in some cases), or detention. Both ways cost money, yet there are no demands for France and the Benelux countries to assist in funding this, despite them being the likely ""origin"" of these people.

If the immigrants are being denied entry to another country, why should the denying country be responsible financially for them within the origin country? If the French do not wish for these people to remain in France, they should deport them. If they have the same issues as are present in the UK regarding tracing origins without paperwork that's their problem. If their borders were secured effectively, it wouldn't be nearly the problem it is.

The people of France are waking up to the problems being caused here, and are demanding that something be done. Instead of dealing with the problem of poor incoming border controls, the politicians stamp their feet and demand the UK fix the problem. I doubt anyone in these camps is French.

tl:dr - If you can't secure your own borders, don't bitch when a bordering country do a better job at keeping denied immigrants out.",0,1409860126,null,0,false,0,ck97w6u,t3_2fffga,t1_ck97w6u,t3_2fffga,null,1427196234,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A few years back there was a lengthy article published about the UK opting out of an EU project to standardize the arrest process and the rights you have if arrested, but the main focus was on how soul destroying being a police station solicitor was and how the coalition was ignoring this plight by opting out. So I looked into this and found out that the reason we were opting out was that we already had stronger rights than the EU proposal called for, and there were conflicts between the way out legal system worked and the proposal being made.

As bikers, we *do* need to assume the worst is going to happen. I believe I read on this subreddit ""ride like everyone is out to kill you"". That always makes me slow down at crossroads, junctions, and anywhere else something *might* cross my path, even marginally.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"You have valid concerns about Mignolet, but I think those aspects are given far too much consideration when compared to shot stopping. Mignolet will help Liverpool retain points with his shot stopping, since he'll face a lot of situations that would often be clear goals. The problem with Rodgers's system is that it can go fantastically wrong if Stevie misplaces a pass, or Skrtel/Sakho/Lovren all go for the same header (as we saw). Having a keeper who can make the impossible save is really important for us.

Further, his distribution seems fine to me. He doesn't misplace a ton of balls, and clearly, watching him play and watching the 'keepers warm-up in pre-season, BR just asks for his GKs to be able to hit the short lofted ball to the fullbacks about 15 yards short of midfield. He does that often. Does he misplace one or two occasionally? Sure. But a lot of keepers do. We don't need Reina-esque passing from Migs, because we play Stevie every game. Mignolet's job is to get the ball to Gerrard directly or to the CBs who can give the ball to the fullbacks or Gerrard.

Yes, he has problems with his judgment on crosses and he needs to improve. I'd argue that was a snowballed effect in his first season that stemmed from a game or two against tough sides, but I think it's a valid beef.

Overall, though, Migs is a good, young keeper. I'm not sure there are any other targets who fulfill both requirements we could get.

Shame you didn't do that. 

To explain it to you again, what you did was plead with me not to incite any more hatred or attack the No campaign even though I never did anything like that in the first place. It's a variant of the old 'Have you stopped molesting children yet?' type attack, which in turn is a baseless ad hominem smear (usually for comic effect, mind).

Of course, the correct and reasonable answer to 'Have you stopped molesting children yet?' is not to attempt to reason on the questioner's terms with a 'yes' or a 'no'. The correct answer to tell the questioner to go fuck himself, with an optional punch in the face administered, according to whether that's allowed in your ethical framework.

Seems that you don't like being told to go fuck yourself when you do something gofuckyourselfworthy.

&gt;You're not worth arguing with, whether you were trying to be unpleasant to start with or just made a joke which came across as a sneery attempt to smear people you didn't agree with, you're abusive and unpleasant. 

Heh, well I'm taking a leaf out of your book, except at least I'm *honestly* abusive. You start off being abusive and then whine that because you're not using actual swear words, you're not being offensive and abusive. Tough. I go by the content of what people say, not the form, and what you're saying stinks.

&gt;You have shown yourself as a sad little man who can't argue and so swears instead, that's what children do.

Now what you're saying makes sense.

I've got to be honest here and ask: what did you expect? It's the Guardian. It's not designed to be read side by side with the Economist or the FT. 

Every now and again, the print version comes with supplements from other papers. I've read select articles from the New York Times and the New York Review of Books. That's broadly the editorial line it's going for. The Guardian also loves the London Review of Books. 

As a Guardian reader, you probably don't need (or want) me to tell you what I think of the Economist or the FT. I actually used to read both when I was a college student and believed what I was taught on my A level economics course. I look back on my 18-year-old self probably the same way you do Guardian readers. 

As far as the state of the Guardian right now, well, I think it's basically fine. CIF online is a real tip, though and I'd gladly wish Ebola on many a CIF columnist. 

The root cause of the social justice wankfest is that, well, print media is dying a slow death and online versions of papers aren't doing much better ... hence the clickbait to draw in advertising revenues. Do you read the comments below the line? For every frivolous SJ article (as the CIF editors themselves acknowledge them to be), there are hundreds of comments bemoaning the hijacking of CIF by SJWs.

The reason is that cities need low wage workers - cleaners, shops, fast food, etc. If people don't live close enough then their travel costs make it impossible to work for such a low wage. 

If we moved people out to areas where the rent meets your acceptable level of housing benefit then the cost of commuting to work would make it pointless. Plenty of low paid jobs also have odd hours which can make travelling even more difficult.

You can't just move poor people out of London so you can either increase wages which means the costs of those services go up, or you can subsidise them with housing benefit to enable people to live in those areas.

It's just not as simple as putting all the poor people on a train to where it's cheaper to live - cities need them.

true,fringly,null,null,"Except you *were* attacking the no campaign with your joke. Inciting hatred is your terms and not what I have accused you of in any way, I am not going to argue against things I have not said. 

First you went in with your little dig about the orange men, a small insult out of place in the thread. You earlier said that it was a ""perfectly good, informative, answer to the OP's question"" but we both know that it isn't and that isn't why you commented. You commented because you support Yes and wanted to make a joke about Better Together. You did it by referencing Orange men which in Scotland you well know brings an air of sectarianism into the conversation and that is another thing which only serves to divide the country. If you claim that you didn't mean that or didn't understand that was what the joke would do, well I wouldn't believe you, as you use terms like ""baseless ad hominem"" so you well knew the buttons you were pushing. 

You then brought up ""prominent Better Together members have been comparing pro-Independence politicians to dictators, and nationalists to Nazis and spreading rumours about 'carnage' on polling day - MUCH closer to incitement to hatred than my silly wee jibe."" I just tried to look it up and as far as I can see it was a labour politician and a blogger who made some stupid comments and then a lot of press from the Yes campaign saying that these comments were part of a bigger attack but no actual evidence just a lot of outrage over two idiots who made stupid comments and have lost their jobs and been publicly shamed (and rightly so). There was a comment by Alastair Darling about ""Blood and Soil"" nationalism which was not true, he did not use the term and there was a retraction by the New Statesman. Unless there was something else (and please do link if there is) then your comment was simply not true and was another attack on the No campaign so why not just face up to what you said and understand that by saying that ""Better Together members have been comparing pro-Independence politicians to dictators, and nationalists to Nazis"" when it is not true probably *is* inciting hatred as you're using extremely provocative accusations to make people angry. Accusations that are not true. 

If I am wrong, if there have indeed been many people who have said these things then please do link this to me and I will apologise and withdraw this point. 

Maybe you don't see what you're doing, maybe you see this as completely fine just as you obviously see me as being ""sneering"", when from my perspective I have been trying to have a conversation with a person who would rather throw insults around than reasoned arguments and just fall back on saying that I have double meanings to everything I write. 

Maybe you read insults into my words but I am trying to write as plainly as possible so that my meaning comes across clearly. I'll state my point again and if you disagree well so be it. 

I think that the debate over independence should be carried out without attacking the people on the other side. If you want to attack their reasons and disagree with them then fine, if you attack the people then you should be removed from the debate and that goes for either side. After the vote we have to work together and if we hate each other so much from personal attacks then we'll lose sight of the important and very real issues we have to face. 

You have attacked the people who disagree with you for no good reason and that is what I object to. I hope that at least you'll have the decency, if you work or go to school with people who disagree with you, to respect them enough to keep your abuse to the internet.

2.  Completely ignores road signs indicating the upcoming juntion, shown by his consistent speed as he approaches it (97mph).

3.  Reckless overtaking manoeuvre just before the junction approaches most likely leading to his lack of visibility to drivers using the junction and therefore their inability to react.


The speed and the overtake so close to a junction led to the demise of this man.  If the bike wasn't there, the driver using the junction would have had more than enough time to complete the manoeuvre safely.

I have seen people point blank refuse to accept that more women kill their children kill their kids than men or the unemployment rate of Bangladeshi women.  They have their politics and they will not accept any ONS or census or any source of statistics that show other wise. 

My beef with this book is that Noone has read it.  The amount of hype is out of the world and people will use it as a source despite having not read it.  It is their Bible, because they have heard that it supports insanely high taxes with data.

That's not going to happen at the Jobcentre, though.

But none of those Job Clubs were based at the Jobcentre offices. They were private companies with dedicated, un-jaded personnel who weren't under pressure to sanction you for every slight infraction.

I've also been placed on a four week course where we were stuck in a single room from 9 - 5 with maybe a couple of breaks and *no* capacity for jobseeking. This was the predecessor to the Work Programme and it was a pointless exercise in makework and number crunching. This four week conference was to satisfy the part of the provider's contract which said they had to find us a four week work placement. Instead of providing actual work, we were stuck in a conference room and left there, with the occasional talking-to or quiz.

It would be very easy to make this scheme work, but not with the way the Jobcentre works these days. Instead it will be an oppressive, counter productive weeding out process, with the 6000 people involved slowly picked off and sanctioned as the Jobcentre staff get more and more frustrated with all the chavs and wasters cluttering up the place, demanding help they can't give and looking for jobs they haven't got.",0,1409865463,null,0,false,0,ck9aqte,t3_2fhmrx,t1_ck9aqte,t3_2fhmrx,null,1427194813,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

People on housing benefit in London live in social housing, the value of the property might be x amount a month but that's money moving from one government department to another. That money isn't (for the most part) going into the private sector.

You get the same help in Leeds as the people in London get. In neither case do the people getting the benefit, get the cash in their pocket. They just get somewhere to live. The places you get in Leeds are also infinitely preferable to the poverty traps that are the London housing estates.

I don't disagree with the notion that people who want the option should be given the help to move. That's not government or local councils policy though is it. Nor is it appropriate in all situations. The vast majority of people on benefits do work in one form or another, or want to work, or are too ill to work but hope to return to work at somepoint in the future. In many cases it's not appropriate to force people to uproot their entire lives and move across the country.

The reality is that the entire system does need an overhaul, however at the same time actually caring about the needs of the people, both in London and the rest of the country should be central to that shift in policy. Not this us vs them mentality which the owners of the country have managed to whip people in to.

I am not the SENCO at the school in question. My actual relation to the whole incident, is that the original post details my partners son. I wrote the OP because we are disgusted at how the school, and SENCO have not handled the first two days of the new school year well at all. Even more-so, that a teacher, who is also the schools behaviour 'guy', has seen the reports from the days so far, and he is involved in a meeting tomorrow, to discuss how he wants to deal with the behaviour. This is all seemingly being dealt with, on his end, as if it was any other child in the school. Which infers that the child could be punished for something that they are wholly unable to mitigate, which makes me unwillingly want to look down the old 'discrimination' road. For extra detail, the child is also requested to attend the meeting, as well. This is not likely to bode well at all, for anybody, but there was seemingly no choice on that matter.

As for TA's, the child doesn't officially have a TA. I believe this is due to a statement not being completed, or finalized. There are motions in place, to construct an EHC plan. I believe it's currently waiting for the relevant body to hold a panel?

So once immigrants have made it to Europe, either by sea to Italy/Spain, or by land from Turkey, they can travel more or less freely. The countries of entry (usually NOT France) don't give a shit provided they toddle off to Calais. So France are pretty shafted.

None of this is remotely the fault of the UK, of course, but you can see why French politicians want to pick a fight with us.

Everybody here came to Reddit via another site.  I don't go to /pol.  I wouldn't have heard of /pol if it weren't for Reddit.  The impression I get of /pol is that it is no more than a couple dozen people.  The only people I definitely know who go to /pol and spend a lot of time there are the people who, ironically, post all the screenshots complaining about what they've seen in /pol spanning weeks.  It's not some Machine City out of the Matrix over there. In terms of hive activity it's more like the back kitchen of McDonalds.  But even then, so what?  It's not like there's an strict Reddit-registry standard to uphold.  

Then take all that and forget it.  Because it's not even relevant.

Let's, for argument's sake, say that ""cultural enrichment"" is meant as a truly derogatory term for cultural behaviour.  There is no mention of 'brown person', so that's a leap beyond your own mind has made.  When they say those words then you can complain, at the moment it's akin to you complaining because they're using political correctness in a way you don't like.   What it is is a criticism of a culture.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

You tried to get out, and I pulled you back in!

&gt;Except you were attacking the no campaign with your joke. Inciting hatred is your terms and not what I have accused you of in any way, I am not going to argue against things I have not said. 

I stand corrected. How wrong I was! I'm so sorry!

I mean, I generally expect someone, especially someone who, despite the evidence, repeatedly claims to indulge in rational debate to have some sort of coherent thread to their arguments. I naturally assumed that when I was told to think about what I was saying in paragraph A, and that I was entreated to not attack the No campaign in paragraph B, and that we shouldn't incite hatred against people who disagree with us in paragraph C, that this was a coherent thread of thought and that you thought there was some sort of link between them - and me, being me, I filled in the gaps with the, I see now, completely unjustified assumption that there was some sort of link between the paragraphs - that you had linked my harmless jibe with not thinking about the effects of what I was saying, and linking that with attacking the No campaign, and linking that with the possibility that I would 'incite hatred against the other side'

Now you tell me that not only was there no link between you lecturing me on incitement to hatred with what had gone before, but that you never ever brought up the phrase at all, and that the words 'If we incite hatred against the other side then we start off the next day in the worst possible way' didn't happen. Or at least, they bear no relation to 'inciting hatred', a completely different and separate form of wording that was purely my invention out of nowhere. I wonder how I could have ever made any kind of psychic link between you complaining about my post and you lecturing me on not inciting hatred.

No wait, the other thing. I'm not sorry at all, and now it seems you're backtracking. Badly. 

It was you that brought up the phrase 'incite hatred' and it was clearly, and obviously meant to associate me with being the kind of person who would do that. Otherwise, why would you even bring it up? Do you randomly chat with strangers about the weather and then warn them that they shouldn't go about committing ethnic cleansing? When you're asking someone to pass the salt, do you also point out that the world would be better off if they didn't rob grannies at knifepoint? Is that the kind of pleasant, rational guy you are?

Of course not. You were trying a sneaky guilt-by-association tactic.

&gt;why not just face up to what you said and understand that by saying that ""Better Together members have been comparing pro-Independence politicians to dictators, and nationalists to Nazis"" when it is not true probably is inciting hatred as you're using extremely provocative accusations to make people angry. Accusations that are not true.""

The main quote about prominent unionists comparing Nationalists to Nazis would be that of Lord Monckton, quoted as saying ""[They have begun to look much more like a national socialist party than they have a Scottish Nationalist party](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/the-snp-have-begun-to-look-much-more-like-a-national-socialist-party-than-t.25062128)"". Comparisons between SNP politicians - Alex Salmond in particular - and dictators are commonplace. [Wings](http://wingsoverscotland.com/alex-salmond-dictator-comparison-bingo/) has collected a whole bunch, mostly from elected and unelected politicians, including a Hitler comparison. How widespread this is is up for debate, but my point wasn't that this was the norm. In fact, I did state outright that despite instances of this sort of thing happening (likely on both sides) that the referendum argument was very gentle by the standards of these things. I was comparing what I said with the rest of the debate, to shed light on your ridiculous overreaction to my joke.

&gt;You have attacked the people who disagree with you for no good reason and that is what I object to

I've attacked you. You deserve it. If you object to that, good. 

I've made the mildest of jokes at the expense of the No campaign. Hardly an attack, and the No campaign deserves the comment - let's face it, what I said was the unassailable *truth*. I'd challenge you to find a larger pro-Union gathering, or one more orderly (hundreds, if not thousands, of orangemen and musicians marching in straight lines) than the one that's about to happen on the 13th. I'll defend my joke not only on the grounds that it was not particularly offensive, but that it was also, literally, actually, factually,  *true*. (Funny is a different matter of course!)

If the No campaign is so insecure that they consider a jocularly phrased statement of fact so distressing that they need to expend billions of electrons lecturing me on my tone of voice and on the need to avoid incitement to hatred, then they must be *really* fucking scared about what's going to happen on the 18th.

It's been all too rare for England to have a positive, tactically sound method to approaching games. Hodgson's rigid 4-4-2 is all he's ever known and it's wank, we all know that. He seemed to have gotten it into his head before the World Cup that the peoples' choice formation was 4-2-3-1, so he did the populist thing, despite not knowing how the fuck to set up defensively in a 4-2-3-1; and so we were more defensively vulnerable than we've ever been under Hodge. Instead of persevering with the 4-2-3-1, which did make us better going forward, and working on the defensive element, Hodgson sulks and says ""I did what you lot wanted (badly), now I'm gonna go back to my thing"".

Before that, any time we've had a good system, we've become derailed through England's ""cult of the individual player"". Capello had a good system going when England qualified for the World Cup in 2010, and then tried to change it up because Rooney was having a very good season for United as part of a fluid front 3 from the left rather than an out-and-out striker.

This is true with the Euro question. ALL member states MUST enter the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) with a view to joining the Euro. The reason the UK still has the pound is because we were unable to maintain the mechanism in the past and were allowed to leave the ERM. Scotland will not have this. The EU does not negotiate on this point with new members - which Scotland will be - although you can negotiate for more time/a wider track you must be in the ERM at some point.

""But what about debt?!"" No currency union means the UK gets dumped with all the debt accrued, correct? Well, no. Debt with nations is nothing more than a gentleman's agreement. You don't get arrested for not paying it, there's no court and no laws. There's only trust. The UK will say that Scotland now owes some of the debt, and if you want your interest you have to ask them now, here's our share though. Scotland says, ""Nuh uh!""

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

So Scottish culture is going to be very accessible (or ""watered down""!) in the student circles. In my experience, it involves getting steaming (drunk) 5 days out of 7, an awkward sexual counter for one flatmate per night out, ring of fire/other inferior drinking games, and so on and so forth. 

The point being, the student experience is much the same as most countries (except perhaps the US, with your ridiculous drinking age.).

Yes. Absolutely. They should have seen an approaching vehicle, estimated how soon it would arrive at the speed it was traveling, and judged correctly if it was safe to go.

The driver did not do these things, either through inattention, or inability.

Did the bike rider's speed make it harder to do those things? Absolutely, the bike rider is also at fault here and not an innocent victim.

Is the driver an innocent bystander that did nothing wrong? Absolutely not. They put their car in front of an oncoming vehicle without first having determined if it was safe to do so.

It was not safe. If they could not determine if it was safe they should not have moved until they could.

He's also not as overzealous as Ceballos (who gives the ball away when he gets a little too confident) and Mason also looks as strong as some of the senior players.

* Young man Josh Onoma will probably have some first team playtime in a few years (3-4), at least in cups or unimportant Euro games. Seems like an exiting prospect, one for the future! I could see Mason and Ceballos becoming fringe players by the end of this season perhaps. Sadly, I've kind of stopped believing in Carroll tbh, and I think a mid/bottom-table club would suit him better. I'm afraid all three of the U-21 players mentioned *could* be off next summer if they don't improve.

A Fleadh is different because there are hundreds, if not thousands of fleadhs, The word means party; It could be in any format. For example the Ardoyne Fleadh, is rooted in Ardoyne its unconnected to the other fleadh's; it is largely a concert based event. Then there is the [Galway Film Fleadh](http://www.galwayfilmfleadh.com/), which is a film festival.

Then there are the [Fleadh Cheoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleadh_Cheoil) which is a competition run by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann

&gt; 
&gt; There are various stages to the competition. In Ireland there are county and provincial competitions leading to the All-Ireland Fleadh. In Britain there are regional, then national stages of qualification for the All-Ireland. North America has two regional qualifying Fleadh Cheoil. The Mid Atlantic Fleadh[1] covers the US eastern seaboard, eastern Canada and the Maritimes. The Midwest Fleadh[2] covers the rest of North America from Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta and Detroit to San Francisco.

Its most famous for the informal pub sessions that take place around the town where the competition is being held. The first time the All-Ireland Fleadh was held in the North was in Derry in 2013. It was covered by both the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03lp845/feilte-is-fleadh-episode-3) and [RTE](http://www.rte.ie/player/6c/show/10313861/).

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

From the video the car starts to move when the bike is about 5 hazard lines away. Each hazard line and space is [9 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223667/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-05.pdf). So the bike was 45m away when the car pulled out.

45 m at 97 mph takes [1.04 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+97mph).

45 m at 60 mph (the speed limit on a de-restricted single carriageway) takes [1.68 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+60mph).

45 m at 50 mph (about half the speed he was doing) takes [2.01 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45+m+at+50mph).

So the bike's excessive speed means he arrived 0.64 seconds sooner than he otherwise would if he'd been doing the speed limit, or 0.97 seconds sooner than if he'd been going at around half the speed. Look at how far across the junction the car was when the bike hit it. Would it have completely cleared the lane with a safe gap less than a second later? I don't think so.

So the car couldn't have to got out of the way in time. Could the bike have stopped in time?

The braking distance at 60 mph is [73 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312249/the-highway-code-typical-stopping-distances.pdf). The bike was closer than this when the car started to pull out.

The stopping distance at 50 mph is [53 m](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312249/the-highway-code-typical-stopping-distances.pdf). The bike was closer than this when the car started to pull out.

So even at half the speed the bike would likely still have hit the car. He'd probably have lived, but the car put him in a position where he had to take evasive action.

So can we please stop with the ""it was the biker's fault for going too fast"" bullshit now? The car driver caused the accident, the biker made it fatal.

Thanks.

&gt; The root cause of the social justice wankfest is that, well, print media is dying a slow death and online versions of papers aren't doing much better ... hence the clickbait to draw in advertising revenues. Do you read the comments below the line? For every frivolous SJ article (as the CIF editors themselves acknowledge them to be), there are hundreds of comments bemoaning the hijacking of CIF by SJWs.

This is something I agree with entirely. All papers are facing the same issue, but some are handling it better. The Times and FT went behind a paywall and so far that seems to be working OK for them, the Telegraph is kinda doing the same thing. The Guardian seems to following the Mail however. It wants to remain free so the only option it has is ad revenue, and the only way to increase that is to increase page views. And that means that printing stuff they know their demographic wants to read at the expense of actual journalism. Other papers aren't immune to this, but the revenue model of the Guardian means that they have to actively pursue that in order to stay financially viable.

Hence, my comments about CIF escaping and becoming rampant. And it's a shame, because they are good at actual journalism. ",0,1409873351,null,0,false,0,ck9em60,t3_2fggex,t1_ck9em60,t1_ck991nv,null,1427193007,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

true,JohnnyButtocks,null,null,"I agree with some of what you say but I think you have missed the mark in a few vital places. 

Firstly, most of those in the yes camp aren't actually seeking a clean slate. We want to retain a lot of the good things about the UK. In fact it has been one of the most glaringly illogical arguments from the main parties in Westminster, that the Yes campaign wants to retain all the good things, and only get rid of the bad... As though was a daft strategy!.. 

They have in fact accused the SNP of not really wanting to be independent at all: ""you want to keep the pound, the Bank of England, the monarchy, that doesn't sound like independence to me!"". The implication is that unless we are seeking to wipe the slate completely clean and cut all ties, we are just being fussy and throwing a tantrum over nothing. I of course want to maintain the good ties between the countries of Britain where at all possible. It's only sensible.

Secondly, and more crucially, I would put it to you that the evolution of the governance of the UK has been anything but gradual. That attribute is admittedly true of the core institutions of stability and continuity (the head of state, the rule of law, the articles of the unwritten constitution etc) but we aren't rejecting those (though as you know, Scotland has maintained its own separate institutions, which go back hundreds of years also, so the forces for continuity will remain intact whatever happens). What people like me are in fact rejecting is the temporal, volatile political system of Westminster, wherein every decade, we swap teams and elect a new super powerful person to steer the country in whatever direction he/she chooses based on his/her personal ideology. Attlee gains power? Within 5 years we have been transformed from a laissez faire liberal nation to a welfare state. Thatcher gets into power? The opposite happens just as quickly. One government builds council estates, the next sells them off for pennies on the pound. The Scottish parliament was designed to avoid this kind of divisive, fickle governance, by adopting a system of proportional representation. I think most agree that this has been a great success. Yes voters are not saying ""let's get rid of everything"", they are actually looking at the Holyrood assembly and saying ""I think I'd like more of that"".

The speed of the ambulance was well within the normal speed limit but the bike was caning it. Big crash, biker dead. My colleague was suspended until the court hearing, and got very little support from work, in fact he'd just cancelled his union subs about a month earlier and the union wouldn't support him even though he'd been a member for about 20 years. Anyway he was not convicted of anything and the biker's family apologised to him as they knew the bike was going too quickly and that my colleague had been pretty traumatised over it, and that his career had been up in the air for about a year.

My colleague said he thought he'd looked well enough to see anything but just didn't see the bike. This shook us all up as we felt that it could have been any of us hitting a bike. Shit just happens.

I said, ""I know you!""

He replied, ""no you don't"".

I said, ""Wait... look, you're with them guys... you're the Grange Hill lot! You're Zammo!""

He said, ""All right, you got me, but please... can you get me a 1/4?""

Naturally we told him to fuck off, but he begged us and promised us that it wasn't a wind up. 

Eventually we agreed to score for him - he had begged us so much that we could hardly get done for entrapment - so I did.

I gave him the dope, he bit me off a good 1/16 and thanked us both profusely.

Hand on heart, true story.

EDIT: It just occurred to me that it might've been a wind up... for all I know he produced that lump of dope on stage during their performance to show kids ""just how easy it is to score""... but I didn't attend their show and never saw the guy again.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

&gt;*For every million smokers who switch to e-cigarettes over 6,000 lives a year in the UK could be saved, according to the University College London team.*

&gt;*Meanwhile another group of London-based experts has attacked criticism of e-cigarettes as ""misleading"".*

&gt;*Last week the World Health Organization called for e-cigarette use to be banned in public places and workplaces.*

&gt;*The WHO said this was because they could increase the levels of some toxins and nicotine in the air.*

&gt;*Its report also warned about the risk of e-cigarettes acting as a gateway by which non-smokers might start smoking real cigarettes.*

&gt;*But the UCL team said the numbers of non-smokers using e-cigarettes amounted to less than 1% of the population, according to the Smoking Toolkit study, a monthly survey of smokers in England.*

&gt;*Prof Robert West added that even though some toxins were present in vapour from e-cigarettes the concentrations were very low.*

2) Over the 28m of braking while he slowed by 30 mph his average speed will have been 15 mph slower or 45 mph. 18 m @ 60 + 28 m @ 45 mph takes [2.06 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=18+m+at+60+mph+%2B+28+m+at+45+mph).

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

I'll try not to be too patronising I promise, but I'll use the current crisis as an example of diversity issues.

Why do you think the Eurozone failed? the banks? No, the banks and their bad debt were merely the trigger, it failed because of diversity.

Let me explain..


Imagine that the banks collapse is just a common cold, each country gets infected by the same virus, but they all display different symptoms and therefore need different treatments, but they all only have access to 1 pill, the Euro!


Greece is first one to get seriously sick, turns out they have a culture of not going to the doctor often, they do a lot of drugs and generally don't care about their health till they are really sick, like now! Turns out that the Euro actually helps them, because they've never had such a pill before, it makes them feel better, at least for a while.


Now Germany on the other hand, have a culture of going to the Doctor regularly to get their flu jabs and exercise regularly etc etc

They show different symptoms to Greece, but have to take exactly the same pill; the Euro!, not only that but if Greece doesn't get any better, they will start feeling worse because the pill will get weaker and will make you feel even more sick.

Anyway you get the picture, its 1:16am and I have work in the morning..


TL/DR: Diversity affects the economy because it brings more  diverse problems. Scandinavian people, because of their low diversity (90% white middle class) and low population share many of the same problems and therefore can work together to solve them better.

This is why right wing nuts like me think that smaller more local governments working together tend to work best. (ie; Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapour, Macau, Austria and of course Scandinavian countries) because they have less socio-economic problems to solve, and are more likely to work towards a common goal.

This is why comparing Great Britain, a multi-cultural nation with a wide range of people and issues cannot simply take up Norways government and expect it to work in 20 years, thats just silly talk.",0,1409876621,null,0,1409877023,0,ck9g4rb,t3_2ffu9r,t1_ck9g4rb,t1_ck96z0l,null,1427192230,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Most accidents don't result from one person making one severe mistake - they result from two or more people making small bad-habit mistakes at the same time. I think I read somewhere that, because it usually takes two or more mistakes at once, quite a small change in the frequency of bad habits makes a disproportionately large difference to the number of serious accidents.

It's impossible to punish everyone for small mistakes every time they make them - usually nothing bad happens and no-one knows a mistake was made (and who would pay all the lawyers?). But if you let yourself get into bad habits, you know the risk you're repeatedly taking - not just of being in an accident, but also of being a lesson to others.

true,MeetOnACloud,null,null,"&gt; voters in Scotland are much more left wing.

I'd love to see your reasoning on this: it's an often repeated statement but all the evidence suggests that it isn't true.

Dundee University's Five Million Questions project [surveyed](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/05/scotching-a-myth-scotland-is-not-as-left-wing-as-you-think-it-is/) Scottish voters' attitudes to immigration, welfare, and the EU - and it turns out that they're pretty much in line with British voters.

The Scottish and British social attitudes surveys show largely the same thing. In certain instances, Scottish attitudes are slightly more progressive than British attitudes - but in these instances the historical survey data shows that the gap is narrowing. See a PDF of the data [here](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/scotcen-ssa-report.pdf).

The Scottish aren't more left wing than the British, they just hate the Tories more - rather like a lot of northern England. The second that a viable right-wing alternative to the (Scottish) Conservative Party comes along, they'll pick up votes from people who tactically switched to the SNP, Lib Dems, and Labour: as the European elections recently proved.

What better way to create a viable alternative to the Scottish Conservative Party than with independence?

I phone this number and a bored guy basically tells me I have to wait 3 days now because it's not coming before then and that I have to deal with it and it's not my problem. He gives me another number to ring, and I'm on the line for 10 minutes listening to music.

12pm strikes. The phone starts making a beeping noise. I hang up and redial.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

Even if the bike was travelling at the limit, he'd need 300 feet to stop, which is almost twice as much as the distance between the bike and car when the car started rolling slowly across the road!

The driver admitted that he didn't see the bike at all, or the other car. The driver was not paying attention. The biker was not a ""smudge in the distance"" - here's a picture provided by Lucifa42 down the chain. http://i.imgur.com/UeTl1ec.png &lt;-- That's how far away the bike was when the car started moving.

&gt;Yes you should be aware of your surroundings but you are not accountable for the risks taken by others. I'm sorry, that's just how I see it.

How risky the biker's action were are irrelevant, because the car driver DIDN'T LOOK for him. The biker didn't turn into the car, the car turned into the biker. The car driver killed the biker because he didn't pay attention and didn't see him. The fact the biker's actions significantly contributed to the likelihood of an accident occurring doesn't mean that the car driver didn't commit Death by Dangerous Driving, but it was taken as a mitigating factor to the offence.

Level 3 - This is driving that created a significant risk of danger and is likely to be characterised by:

* Driving above the speed limit/at a speed that is inappropriate for the prevailing conditions OR
* Driving when knowingly deprived of adequate sleep or rest or knowing that the vehicle has a dangerous defect or is poorly maintained or is dangerously leaded OR
* **A brief but obvious danger arising from a seriously dangerous manoeuvre** OR
* Driving whilst avoidably distracted OR
* **Failing to have proper regard to vulnerable road users**

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; The amount of tax avoided is not the amount that was due, legally none of it was due, and from a moral standpoint the amount is highly debateable. 

This betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of the legality of tax avoidance.

A lot of schemes are sufficiently complicated that whether they actually work or not *(which legally is a question of fact)* is only settled when a court makes a finding of fact.  

There are two elements that are relevant and worth knowing here:  Firstly the initial finding of fact is often not final.  It'll rattle its way through all of the courts and may not become final until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted.  Secondly it's not always an issue of complexity or uncertainty so much as that avoidance users are incentivised to put off the final decision as long as possible.  *(This may well change when advanced payment is fully in force.)*

&gt;There are benefits to the UK from some of these tax rules, they are in place to encourage certain types of investment abd spending, they are abused but tax avoidance figures include the times they're used as intended. 

The estimates of the tax gap explicitly exclude avoidance schemes which are believed to be functional.  This was something the Parliamentary Accounts Committee criticised HMRC for a year or so ago.

The only tax lost through avoidance which is included in the estimates of tax lost is tax in respect of schemes which HMRC believes is due but which ultimately a court decides was not.  Although I would suggest that there is probably far more which should be included and hasn't been identified by HMRC.

&gt;If the government isn't demanding this money using it's power to form the law then I can't see any way you can say with certainty how much if any of that is really owed.

The government is committed to cutting back on the number of Civil Servants including tax inspectors to an extent the greatly exceeds any intent to collect the lost taxes.  

If you ran a business and there was scope to make sales of an additional £40bn you'd hire extra staff to fill some of those sales, wouldn't you?  But that's not what the government is doing.  Ideology is more important than the financial well-being of the state to these people.

Tax evasion is easy enough to classify.  I claim I incurred expenses I never actually did.  We can probably pretty readily agree that's evasion and it's potentially actionable as a criminal offence.

At the other end, you indulge in an avoidance scheme that works.  This may not be how the law was intended to be enacted, but the legal view is that it works.  This is legal avoidance.  If we don't like it it needs a statutory fix.  We change the law, it stops working, but until we do your avoidance is legal.

The problem is the complex grey area stuff.  Let's take an example that's not too complicated.  Chris Moyles claimed he made a huge loss training in used cars.  Structurally the **[scheme is complicated](http://www.taxation.co.uk/taxation/system/files/article_files/moylescashflow.pdf)** but that's mostly just to hide what happened.  Basically he claimed to have incurred five million quid of fees t0 borrow seven and a half grand.  He didn't buy or sell a single car.

HMRC's position might be summarised as approximately, ""You're 'avin' a giraffe!"" largely because it's unlikely they can write out and say, ""You're seriously taking the piss with this one!""  The afore mentioned tax dodger's position was, ""I think the scheme works!""  Actually his position was, ""Can I have my day in court in secret, so no one knows I'm a tax dodger?""

Until a judge makes a decision the legal position with regard to whether the avoidance functions is unknown.  In this case the judge determined that Mr. Moyles did in fact possess a notably tall mammal.  *(Interesting side note:  A giraffe has the same number of neck vertebrae you do.  They're just much longer.)*

Once the decision crystallises that factual situation this is not *(and in fact has never been)* legal avoidance.  Further it is not evasion.  

We could almost do with having three categories which would make this stuff explicit:    
Avoidance:  Valid.    
Avoidance:  Disputed.    
Avoidance:  Not valid.

Since we lack this the language tend to fail us without significant explanation.  But the short version of this is that the statement, *""tax avoidance is perfectly legal""* is not true.

It's a Kelptocracy either way. The IMF has given them a shit load of loans to keep their ecconomy ticking over during the civil war and they will rob them blind to get it back. IMF loans mean that you need to accept IMF ideology which includes the dismantling of the welfare state and privatisation of all industry and government services. Come winter many Ukrainians aren't going to be able to pay their gas bill as the IMF have already demanded that they remove all state fuel subsidies, even for the poor. We will of course blame Russia for this when the time comes, just wait and see...

The EU deal was fucking awful, basically the removal of all trade tariffs meaning that they had to compete with well established EU competitors in receipt of EU subsidies and who were able to vote on EU policy while Ukraine couldn't. It was a shitty shitty deal for Ukraine and it would have been utter insanity to accept it. All the downsides of EU membership with absolutely none of the positives. The deal was not for their benefit, that's why we got so butthurt when they rejected it. 

When the EU deal failed NATO were actively involved in the coup, with large sums being provided by USAID and NED to fund the process. The coup was violent from the start, with firebombs being thrown at the police guarding the central government buildings. I'd like to see you try that in London to see what sort of reaction you'd get!

This is a part of a wider campaign to expanda NATO. Just two years ago support for joining NATO in Ukraine polled at less than 30%, the population did not want it. I guess that's all changed now, how very very convenient. NATO has been involved in half a dozen coups in the region over the last ten years (the colour revolutions), each time expanding into the new puppet state. 

The new PM is utterly corrupt: In 2006, John Herbst, US Ambassador to Ukraine, described Poroshenko as a ""disgraced oligarch.""[93] Later that same year Sheila Gwaltney, Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Ukraine, said that ""Poroshenko was tainted by credible corruption allegations.""

We're both Americans and I'd never heard of it before, but she picked it up as if it was in her blood and she was just totally obsessed. Which isn't bad! I have my own obsessions and I now love this show quite a lot. But she didn't introduce me to it slowly or let me try an episode. She donned a trench coat, showed me all her favorite episodes from Series 1 (now, my least favorite episodes... we approach the show very differently and seem to appreciate entirely different aspects of it) and quoted along with some kind of toy K9 by her side while spewing history &amp; trivia in between episodes. I thought she'd gone nuts! lol

Since then, my husband's film professor encouraged him to watch the show while we were dating, he became a huge fan, and he got me hooked with Series 5 — but not before I (jokingly, I think) threatened to break up with him if he made me watch it, recalling how my friend forced on me this show that I just didn't get. Well, I got it this time, and I've since fallen in love, learned about the history and come to respect, appreciate and admire it very much, but it wasn't too long ago I swore it was some crazy British show with fans like my friend who worshipped robotic dogs!",0,1409885536,null,0,false,0,ck9kn18,t3_2fe7yi,t1_ck9kn18,t3_2fe7yi,null,1427190127,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,somescott,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;I don't understand why you think there's been no negotiation.


It's a Westminster policy not to pre-negotiate any terms of Scottish independence or make any contingency plans, despite the fact governments routinely plan for even unlikely possibilities. The currency stance is not born out of negotiation obviously, it's simply a party political pledge aimed at helping the No camp.


&gt;This is true with the Euro question. ALL member states MUST enter the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) with a view to joining the Euro.

There is an obligation to join the euro. Sweden has no ""opt-out"" and views the obligation as voluntary and so has not joined and is showing no signs of wanting to. The EU wants to encourage members to adopt the single currency, not force them.


&gt;The UK will say that Scotland now owes some of the debt, and if you want your interest you have to ask them now, here's our share though.

No that will not happen. The Treasury has already stated they will honour the entire sovereign debt if it comes to that, for reasons of trust as you talked about. While it could be argued that Scotland will be seen as less trustworthy for ditching UK debt, that's only the most simple view. Scotland being denied it's share of an asset such as the pound and then refusing to take on debt as a way to cushion the formation of a new currency and compensate itself is not the same as a country going bankrupt and refusing to pay, like Argentina. Add to this the fact that any Scottish currency is going to be very valuable anyway due to oil and it's clear that ditching the debt, while not ideal, is much better than being denied the pound and still taking on the debt and is unlikely to have a long term impact on Scotland.",0,1409889787,null,0,false,0,ck9momy,t3_2ffzmh,t1_ck9momy,t1_ck9cv4l,null,1427189173,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You put Khedira and Matic together, and give Cesc the freedom of the park to attack and we have a much better side.

Right now with Cesc and Oscar(or Willian) playing together we are not getting the best out of either of them. Both are getting put in situations where they have to cover for the other and has led in all our games so far to not being able to control the midfield.

Everton obviously had their chances, Burnley was definitely in the game when we played them and Leciseter was a fairly open affair as well.

We have been leaving Matic exposed far too long and it has been telling in his performances this year. With our current style he is basically playing as a lone defensive mid and has Cesc and Oscar trying to help him but neither obviously a proper defender.

This is how a really cool monster/villain jumps the shark and becomes a silly trope. 

When he said that 1934 was ""time locked"" and he couldn't go back to that time without ripping the place apart or something.. I said ""ok.. that's fine.. So wait a few years, wait a decade.. whatever, go back and get them.

I mean, he met Amelia when she was a kid, and had no issues with ditching her and coming back 15 years later or something.. And didn't he drop Amy and Rory off once and then come back like 5 years later?

It just had major plot holes.

An easy way they could have covered this, would have been that when the Angels send you back in time, you as a person are ""time locked"". Something they do to you solidifies you in the time stream so you can no longer time travel. This is because if you could jump out of time again, the ""energy"" they get from sending you back would need to be removed or dissipates or something, but it can't because the Angels already used it.

Sort of like Eating a Hamburger, in the present, but then the cow is saved in the past, and that ground hamburger that was digested by you and used as energy to function somehow needs to be taken away. (just an off the top analogy that isn't very solid in itself).

So that's 7 players to cover 4 positions which isn't too too bad. Hopefully we make it to January without having to play Monreal at CB. My personal opinion is that we should bring in a starting DM who can also be our 4th CB ( someone like carvalho, who we are rumoured to be going back in for in January).

I think perhaps that you should try putting fewer gears in the sequence, so that it would be less cluttered. Also, make the gear movements slower. Also, reduce the amount of fog, as the fog seems to make it very difficult to see where one gear ends and the next begins. This sequence has potential to be really good, but there are a few things that you need to work on first. The fact that you've posted only a six second clip isn't terribly helpful for your case, as it doesn't really give us an idea of what the whole sequence will be like.

no. tax avoidance is legal. if it is illegal it's tax evasion. if a scheme is incorrectly used the courts will order the tax to be paid, it would not be a criminal matter.

&gt;There are two elements that are relevant and worth knowing here: Firstly the initial finding of fact is often not final. It'll rattle its way through all of the courts and may not become final until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. Secondly it's not always an issue of complexity or uncertainty so much as that avoidance users are incentivised to put off the final decision as long as possible.

all adding to the uncertainty of the tax owed figure, my point exactly. worth adding that until a court has case law or clear legislation to go off there is no legal precedent that these schemes should not be legal so to count any that have not been decided as ""owed"" is not really reliable

&gt;The estimates of the tax gap explicitly exclude avoidance schemes which are believed to be functional. This was something the Parliamentary Accounts Committee criticised HMRC for a year or so ago.

believed. and functional or not these schemes are meticulously formed to follow the letter of the law, if not the spirit of the law.  

&gt;The only tax lost through avoidance which is included in the estimates of tax lost is tax in respect of schemes which HMRC believes is due but which ultimately a court decides was not. Although I would suggest that there is probably far more which should be included and hasn't been identified by HMRC.
 
believe, suggest. none of these terms suggest a reliable estimate can be made. HMRC is not a court of law their actions have proven a complete lack of regard for the actual tax law time and again, and frankly any estimate they make of anything is highly likely to be wrong.

&gt;If you ran a business and there was scope to make sales of an additional £40bn you'd hire extra staff to fill some of those sales, wouldn't you? But that's not what the government is doing. Ideology is more important than the financial well-being of the state to these people.

there is not scope to make this tax, there is scope to start a costly legal battle with no guarantee of a victory against companies whose resources are vast and who are on schemes specialized accountants were paid a lot of money to make watertight

if you ran a business where there was believed and suggested to be possible scope for an extra £40bn but it's dependent on who the courts sided with after a very costly legal battle and it cost you £10bn to make a legal case you would think twice about it.",0,1409899900,null,0,false,0,ck9pvkb,t3_2fg0un,t1_ck9pvkb,t1_ck9if2x,null,1427187649,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The dots are politically inconvenient and to connect them would lead to outrage. Drink you tea now.

Because I really don't see it. I don't think there's anything hateful about those messages. Exactly who are they hating on? ""enrichment experience"" is an allusion to the motivations of certain acts. The cold harsh truth is that some acts and individuals who are the focus of topics on here (e.g. 'terrorist acts') *genuinely* do see what they're doing as enrichment (where to enrich something is to ""improve or enhance the quality or value of."") 

It's been explicitly stated in the Rotherham scandal that a big contributor was that people don't want to be seen as racist.

He said: ""If the Yamaha had been driving at 60 miles per hour the collision could have been avoided. PC Brooks said there was no reason why the driver of the Clio, Benjamin Austin, had failed to see Mr Holmes approaching on his bike. He said: ""Witnesses behind Mr Austin say they had seen it and were aware of its presence.""  
...  
Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson said Mr Holmes had lost control and collided with the Clio.

He sentenced Austin to a 12-month community order, with 130 hours' unpaid work, and disqualified him from driving for 18 months. He also ordered him to pay a £60 surcharge and £200 costs.

The sad truth is that we cannot afford a welfare system as expensive as our current one - we never have been able to pay for it. Instead each government has for decades raised money in the capital markets which covers the annual shortfall but has interest payments which reduce the cash flow each successive year until paid off. We currently spend more each year (~£40bn) on debt payments than we do on education. That should give you an idea of how fucked the system is. It is also more than we spend on the military and ~40pc of what we spend on the NHS. Can you imagine how much the country could be improved if that money were available for something useful?

Rant nearly over, you can fact check against the budget document or one of the websites that puts it in nice graphical format. 

Remember - capitalism put a man on the moon, gave us the internal combustion engine, flight, medicine (it's those evil big pharma companies that make all our medicines) and your boring iphone.

The nightlife is excellent.

There's quite a few traditional pubs, and if you're in halls, most social events will probably focus around clubs. 

I have no idea about the fine arts scene. I think the university's art society runs sessions of life drawing and other things? Your best bet might be to chat to them during Fresher's fair. I think Hopkinson's Vintage and Antiques next to the train station have exhibitions going on, and there is an art gallery in town but I've never been in.

With your student card most buses are £1. They don't give change, so you'll probably start to hoard pound coins. It's about a 20 minute bus ride from Broadgate Park to the Victoria Centre. There's also Beeston, which is a half an hour walk from L+W Hall (the furthest), which has Tesco along with other small shops. I recommend the pink Thai restaurant called Sukho Thai for cheap but excellent food.

FTR I'm taking about vapes here, the cig-a-like are IMO useless. 

I have nothing but positive things to say about e-cigs. I feel better, my skin looks better, I breath easier, I sleep better, I can taste food, I can smell properly, the list goes on and on really. I've even taken part in the UCL ecig studies they're doing. The results have all been positive. 

I can't believe the WHO and various others have launched an all out attack on e-cigs and vaping. ( well I can actually, a lot of it is down to Stanton Glantz in the US and his one man anti-smoking anti-vaping crusade + the fact they're in the pockets of big pharma ) their arguments against are verging on pathetic compared to the benefits.

It's difficult to judge speed of oncoming traffic. You assume 30-50 mph on roads like that....

You're looking at the oncoming traffic, the road you are turning into and your rear view for any dodgy drivers, you're left hand side to make sure you have left enough space for people to pass you. 

You would glance at the oncoming traffic and make assumptions based on distance.

plus bikes are small so noticing their speed is in fact higher then first thought in your peripheral vision is less likely.

Why wouldn't you catch a train to London for the weekend if you lived in Birmingham? Or catch a train to Manchester at the height of the Madchester scene?

As someone who has lived in Canada and the UK, everything in Britain is a pain in the arse because of the population density and lacking infrastructure. You spend so much time fucking around at each end of the journey and maybe stuck stationary in traffic in the middle that what seems like it should be a short and easy journey isn't. And if you think holiday traffic is bad where you live, I can promise it would be nothing compared to Britain on a bank holiday weekend.

In new world countries driving and taking trips on public transport is simple and stress free in comparison to Britain. Even in major cities it is generally a far easier exercise. It's easy to find a park and park in it, the roads are wide and have good visibility and navigation is simple. The roads in Britain are a constant stress and the road system is almost designed to make you go the wrong way by mistake if you are in an unfamiliar area.

People do travel on trains a lot to cities for nightlife and entertainment, but from smaller towns/cities to bigger ones, not usually between cities. If you live in Birmingham there's not much point going to Manchester. It's not like someone from Boston visiting New York or vice versa, it's like someone from Des Moines visiting Kansas City. Despite what you'd imagine cities in North America have more individuality and cultural variation.

As for Lord Monkton, yes, that is a clear comparison and I am glad that he is nothing to do with the Better Together Campaign, just a UKIP guy who is trying to get press. Still these are not ""prominent Better Together members"" just people on one side of the debate where there have been unnecessary attacks on both sides. 

If you want to look at the Yes campaign, we could talk about the abuse JK Rowling got or Jim Murphy - there are people on both sides who do this debate a discredit and  you and your joke are a part of that. Your arguing that the joke is true so it must be fine is missing the point but that's where we are in this thread and it's not going to get better.

You did draw me back in, you continue to attack me and it's still unjustified and only goes to show what an unpleasant person you are. Aside from any argument we have, you think it is acceptable to talk to another person like this? I called you a child before as my insult and you have more than proven it. If you want to debate like a grown up then act like one.

I'd just like to add one final time that I am not a ""No"" supporter or the no campaign. I'm not arguing that either campaign is better than the other, I am saying that both need to speak and act sensibly.

I actually think that the two of us, independence aside probably agree on a lot more than we disagree on and in other circumstances we'd have been happily talking with each other. You've gone from your joke, to just out and out attacking people you don't agree with me and others and I still object to that.

This is the key point. Liverpool can afford to gamble, they had over £100m to spend this summer, and if Balo fails, they can still revert back to their proven players and ship him off- and it has only cost them £30m or so (and that is if they get no money back). 

We however cannot afford that. If our big striker fails, then we don't really have a plan B, and we don't have the money to write it off. Romo may cost us £10m per year, but we know exactly what we are getting in return- a reliable goalscorer with a good attitude who will only get better.

It seems a couple of people have finally realised they had been sold a vision that doesnt exist and now they can't get out.

EDIT: Phone posting is bad as doesnt give a lot of room for explanations which I will flesh out here.

The people who went to fight for ISIS are arguably the most fanatical of the radicalised, disaffected muslims in the UK, who have effectively been raised under cult-like conditions. This is probably the first time they've been left to themselves and have realised that although up until now they've been drinking the kool aid quite happily, actually following those instructions to the letter are quite unpleasant when you're hacking people into bits and getting soaked with their blood as a consequence.

In much the same way that ordinary germans either didnt know or didnt want to think about the concentration camps in germany, being confronted with the full horror of their actions changed the tune of a great damn many of them. 

Now that some of these UK born fighters are having this realisation, is it better for them to come home, effectively repent and give up all the intelligence they know of ISIS and maybe go home to their houses and mosques and provide a more moderating influence in opposition to the extremist preachers who are still selling that vision to other young impressionable minds? 

Or is it better for them to simply stay out there as part of an army killing people?

Im not saying they should be free of prosecution, surveillance to make sure they're not an ISIS plant or get an easy ride anyway.

No, I would say those words have a very clear definition. There are examples of people disagreeing with an act being labelled as racist, but that doesn't make the meaning of the word any less clear.

&gt; Don't forget - anybody that ever asked the question why most convicted Rotherham gang rapists were Pakistani were called ""racist"".

Not true. I would like to understand why most of those rapists were of Pakistani heritage. Nobody has ever called me racist for that. If you haven't done so already, I recommend that you read Professor Jay's report into the Rotherham abuse. There is a lot of misinformation surrounding the case.

&gt; I didn't try to kill Jews. It didn't happen in my lifetime. So, again, I ask you, why is it important today.

Because it would be nice if it didn't happen again.

&gt; I'd love to see an example of a Jewish person confronting a black person over racism in the black community. Otherwise I call bullshit on what you just said.

Just to be clear, you are saying that unless you can see an example of a Jewish person confronting a black person over racism in the black community, you refuse to believe that my Jewish friends and colleagues oppose racism in all its forms, or that Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner was a high-profile participant in the #weareallhuman campaign this week?

From what i hear his shot stopping is not as good as Mingolets but his distribution and positioning  are top drawer so imo Valdes seems like the better option should we sign him .",0,1409912645,null,0,false,0,ck9s6ns,t3_2fj35z,t1_ck9s6ns,t3_2fj35z,null,1427186501,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

It's not completely related, but River and the Doctor had an exchange in one of the earlier seasons where she said that he ""leaves the brakes on"", which gives it the distinctive wheezing noise.

I'd argue the pub/bar/club scene here is as good as anywhere in the country (especially if you prefer the pub part) and punches well above its weight considering the size. As others have said too its a compact city where everything in the city centre is walking distance or a quick bus ride at most. Public transport to all but the most far flung places further out of town is regular and reliable. You wouldn't need a car at all just living in the city and on campus. A bike, two feet and learning which of the many buses goes where will serve you perfectly fine.

There's the Nottingham contempary that usually has some interesting stuff on but the art scene won't be as extensive as the likes of London obviously. Great local music scene and a fair few historical places to get around in the area though, and some of the nicest natural areas of the country are within reaching distance - peak district etc if you're into that.

As for work, plenty of shops and call centre work around assuming your visa will let you work. If as the other bloke said it's limited to 20 hours a week that should be more than enough assuming your housing and tuition overheads are already sponsored.

  /u/girlwithnousername found a really decent place that everyone got to easily last time round (I know, I was late) for pub quiz, and it had a nice selection of food to boot, so unless anyone else has any better idea this place is pretty ideal, and is well placed at being right next door to Borough tube station, and a 5-10 minute walk along a straight road down from London Bridge station, which serves all the major tube lines, a fair amount of good overground things too, and this place is *stupidly* easy to find.

I mean I'm not saying that you would stop any benefit, but that you would change it from being a variable payment based on where and what you live in, to a fixed payment that the individual has the choice to spend from 100% of that benefit on housing to 0%. You would get it even if you lived with parents, just a nice little bonus in that case.

It would mean the opposite really, people would prefer to minimise rent if it has a personal financial impact, so rather than rent larger properties which they're unable to afford to improve and/or maintain people may choose to stay living with family or live together with friends.

This would ease pressure on social housing as people work out they're better off financially (substantially so) by sharing. This incentivises developers to convert low-quality roomy housing stock into higher-quality apartments well suited to sharing. Where we're stuck at currently is despite an increase in demand for single and dual occupancy dwellings, you can't really make any money off that because all of these underoccupied family homes means the profit is catering for the people who NEED a family home.

Hence why you get these little three-&amp;-four-bed-in-a-box homes; you can sell it to families at great markups who have no other choice because they've got kids.

Work this together with a land value tax and the market for property starts to flow and sort itself out without any need for rent control, public sector house building (though this would be good anyway), or 'landlord taxes'.

The very real issues (I'd argue cultural rather than religious) are becoming obscured between those seeking to portray this as a regular occurrence and evidence of the 'sins' of Islam and the failure of multi-culturalism, and by those seeking to diffuse tension by vagueness.  The term Asian risks being inflammatory, seeking to unite a very range of communities to be tarred with the taint of these serious crimes while failing to examine why it is occurring within the Pakistani community.  

However that is not to doubt this has become immensely racially charged.  I know this sort of thing occurs in East Asia, as I meant someone at University to whom, on a much smaller scale it occurred.  Young Pakistani men /Indian Muslim (I mean that in the sense of the descendants of the Mughals who follow Islam not merely because those who follow the faith) have become used to a certain high caste status with Hindus and now western girls seen as lower caste.  They feel able to take advantage of these girls because of the cultural stigma involved in a full relationship and seeing them as not requiring respect.  

Such a cultural norm takes time to iron out and without prevailing on closed communities and promoting better education may continue for generations to come.

Never let it be said James Dyson is only looking after James Dyson.

I'm not sure what his issue is, the EU is banning the sale of any vacuum cleaner using more than 1400 watts, and eventually 900 (neither affects Dyson). The big bad German cleaners have to adapt regardless, and it would be unfair that this ban came in immediately and as harshly as he'd like.

It seems Dyson's just annoyed he doesn't have the monopoly.

true,Tarambor,null,null,"For any child with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder which now includes Aspergers), the first couple of months of a new school are the hardest because they don't cope well with changes and they're going to somewhere where absolutely everything is completely and utterly different. Unfortunately the way ASD kids deal with it a lot of the time comes out as bad behaviour when comparing it to a normal child however someone who has been around ASD kids for a long time can usually recognise it for what it is. Had that in McDonalds last week, kid kicking off, everyone around the family tutting and I just asked if he was autistic as I recognised what was going on. 

You need to get that SEN statement sorted as soon as possible. I cannot stress how important it is for getting everything sorted and into place. 

There is only one way to deal with the behaviour:

1) The child needs a TA. The child needs to be told well in advance of a lesson who is going to be there, what is going to happen in as much detail as possible. This reduces the stress on the child because kids with ASD don't cope well with the unknown. All the teachers the child is in contact in need to be instructed on what to expect and how to deal with it. Removing the child from the situation, giving them somewhere quiet and safe to calm down is all that is required. Physical restraint is a waste of time as it only makes things worse and should only be used if they're going to harm themselves or others.

2) The child needs to be given a specific person and a specific place they can go to if they're having trouble coping and they need to know who that is. In my son's school it is a small building block known as the nurture unit with a small group of teachers and TAs in for the full day and he knows he can go there at any time which lowers his stress levels. Stops them running off and locking themselves in the toilet.

3) The school needs educating about ASD. Kids with ASD tend to not like people getting close to them and invading their space and they tend to deal with it by lashing out. It is something they do completely sub-consciously. Noise and light are triggers for them. Changing routine, even changing what is being taught in the class that lesson can be a problem if they're not warned in advance. Also because kids with ASD take time to process things, if you ask them immediately after an event why they did something or what happened you won't get the right answer. It can take a few hours before you finally find out what the real trigger was. 

As you're the partner of the parent I'm going to tell you something to try that is mentioned a lot on the NAS forums. There's a company in the UK called [Victoria Health who do a product called Behavior Balance DMG](http://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Behavior-Balance-DMG/3366) - use the spelling as posted, not UK spelling of behaviour. It comes in [pill](http://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Behavior-Balance-DMG/3366) and [liquid](http://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Behavior-Balance-DMG-Liquid/2431) form. What it does is contain a mix of vitamins which have been found with about 50% of autistic kids to help them cope with normal life. Doesn't make them drowsy, you're not ODing them on Vitamin B. Its not cheap but its worth a try and is quite popular as can be witnessed by stock shortages from time to time. As it only works for about half the kids only get one bottle worth at first. Try it and if it works you and the school should notice an effect very quickly within a few days. You should find that the violent episodes die down considerably or even stop altogether. There will also be changes at home which you may not notice at first until you sit down and look back at what he's doing and go ""oh that doesn't seem to be bothering him any more."" If that happens then continue but if there's no change don't bother after the first week. It either works in the first week or not at all.

We were lucky and it worked with my son. It changed him from someone who was throwing stuff around in a class because he couldn't cope and who was looking at having to go to a special needs school to a boy who still has the odd episode at school but has managed to stay in mainstream with maybe a few outbursts a term. It has also helped him outside of school massively as well. We knew it was definitely the Behavior Balance DMG because we once ran out when they couldn't get new stock from the USA and within a few days he was back to how he used to be. We'd not mentioned to the school we'd run out and they asked us if we'd stopped giving him it so they'd noticed as well. Soon as we started again he was fine. He was on it for about 5 years and now we only give it him if he has a period where he seems to be having a particularly difficult time. It seemed to just give him time to learn how to cope with dealing with normal life and all its uncertainties.

I am not the biggest expert on Valdes because lets face it when he played at Barca they were very rearly on the back foot in games so he didnt really have to do much to prove how good he was .

A good goalkeeper is one that can stand around for 89 minutes picking his nose but when he needs to make a vital save he pulls it off perfectly. 

Going by what you've just said it stands for every single world class goalkeeper. Pick your top 10 goalkeepers and you'll find that there's probably only 1 (Lloris) that DOESN'T play for a club that are never on the back foot

I've recently been calling HMRC to solve a fairly minor tax issue and I've found phoning when their lines first open works well. I have a headset at work so I phone through that and wait it out. Not ideal but waits are 20-30 mins. It's pathetic but Urgh, not much you can so.

Once you do get through to them, if they are being obtuse, simply say 'you can be helpful now, or I will go via my MP and get the information I need anyway - your choice'. Be polite but forceful. When they did not want to give me info I did this and they changed tack instantly. 

Second solution is to write recorded delivery, copying in your MP. Who will then write to them as well.

Good luck. They are real buggers to deal with. Won't get any better unfortunately with the illustrious Mrs Homer in charge (of UKBA and DFT fame).

The nightlife was amazing and excellent with busy bars and student clubs almost every night of the week. Especially if you live in the halls you'll always find people going out every night - they even sold tickets in the lobby so you didnt need to wait in line at the club. 

Dunno about fine arts.  Though i recall there was an art gallery in the castle. And I think other stuff inside Wollaton park (Batman's manor).  Both pretty small though.

Bus - as other have said 1 pound, and they came often. ~20 min to get to city by bus. A lot less by taxi. Taxi's were actually very popular in my time there - you'd fit 6 people in a 6-8 pound taxi to the city and back (so 1-3 pound for transport every night out).  Which made getting home after a night out very easy. 

Rail - you can get a rail pass as a student, which makes all your train trips 1/3 the price. Very much worth the price if you plan to visit london or anywhere else. It was fairly cheap to get to other cities. 

Edit:: Forgot to add, if you live on campus, almost everyone else will be 1st years who are mostly 18-20yr olds that have finally left home for the first time and are going out for the first time too.

This is a fairly common argument and one that completely misses the point. The issue isn't whether or not e-cigs are *bad* for you. I'm sure they are to some degree. As I'm also sure coffee is bad for you to some degree. The issue is that e-cigs are many times better than cigarettes. This article suggests by a magnitude of 20x. I'd go so far as to say that's being conservative.

Furthermore. The e-liquid that I use is all pharmaceutical grade stuff that you and everyone else on this forum has been ingesting for decades with no known issues. There are **no known carcinogens** in 99% of e-liquids.

Cresswell and Jenkinson giving us width as complete wingbacks. Between 55' and 70' Downing and Carroll would come on as subs. Downing would drift to the left to take up his more traditional role as a winger, feeding crosses that Carroll can knock down for Zarate or Valencia to poach from. I'd love to see Carroll and Zarate playing off each other at some point this season I just have a feeling that tired defenders would not be able to cope with Zarate and a fresh Andy.

The only drawback is Downing is currently in such fantastic form it'd be a shame not to give him 90 minutes.

&gt; but I'm generally confused about all the terms and figures they list

&gt; British propaganda is regarded has having made the most extensive use of fictitious atrocities to promote the war effort.[19]

&gt; One such story was that German soldiers were deliberately mutilating Belgian babies by cutting off their hands, in some versions even eating them. Eyewitness accounts told of having seen a similarly mutilated baby. As Arthur Ponsonby later pointed out, in reality a baby would be very unlikely to survive similar wounds without immediate medical attention.[20]

&gt; Another atrocity story involved a Canadian soldier, who had supposedly been crucified with bayonets by the Germans (see The Crucified Soldier). Many Canadians claimed to have witnessed the event, yet they all provided different version of how it had happened. The Canadian high command investigated the matter, concluding that it was untrue.[21]

&gt; Other reports circulated of Belgian women, often nuns, who had their breasts cut off by the Germans.[22] A story about German corpse factories, where bodies of German soldiers were supposedly turned into glycerine for weapons, or food for hogs and poultry, was published in a Times article on April 17, 1917.[23] In the postwar years, investigations in Britain and France revealed that these stories were false.

&gt; A notable example of atrocity rumor concerns a family who receives a letter from their son, who is imprisoned a German POW camp; the letter says that he is being treated well and fed sufficiently, and that the stamp on the letter might be of interest to ""Alfie"", the youngest son. Because the family has no son by that name, they become suspicious, and underneath the stamp they find a message saying ""they've torn out my tongue!""[6] Prisoners' letters, however, bore no stamps.

Going to space is one thing, but building hotels, colonising Mars and moving asteroids around is another game, it seems like Branson is living in a fantasy land, meanwhile real engineers at SpaceX are actually doing useful work.

* Join your local library and/or use your university one. QUB students can get free software such as Office, SPSS, Matlab from the library for their laptops/home PCs. There's also a good DVD range which they can rent from.
* The art crawl! The first Thursday of every month a lot of the art galleries stay open late and have their new shows on. There's also free booze. The idea is you go to one, grab a drink and look at the art, finish your drink and head to the next place. It's a young enough crowd and a bit of craic as everyone's doing the same thing.
* Speaking of booze certain cab companies around Belfast will bring a carry out to your gaf if you end up with a dry house party after the bars close. It costs a bit but it can save a party (which is of course priceless).

You'd realise that although they find 2 nasty chemicals which are also in ecigs, there's another 8 or so nasty chemicals in tobacco that aren't found in ecigs.

There's also this from the discussion:

&gt; Therefore, clinical studies are needed in order to determine whether such levels of carbonyls may have the potential to cause disease to EC users.

They also mentioned how PEG based juices contained no toxic carbonyls

&gt; An interesting finding of our study is that no toxic carbonyls were detected in a single sample with reduced content of VG and PG. In this product (A6), the primary solvent was polyethylene glycol (PEG). 

Also regarding:

&gt; The levels of formaldehyde in vapors from high-voltage device were in the range of levels reported in tobacco smoke.

I'm not sure how they came to that conclusion based on their data:

&gt; #Our study found that the amounts of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in vapors from lower voltage tank system ECs were on average 13- and 807-fold lower than in tobacco smoke, respectively.

&gt;  Our findings show that increasing voltage from 3.2 to 4.8V resulted in 4 to over 200 times increase in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone levels.

so 1/807th of the amount of acteldehyde compared to tobacco at low voltage. 200 times that amount at high voltage equates to 200/807ths that of tobacco.

Regardless of how you interpret this research, nowhere does it even begin to imply that any of the juices were anywhere near as bad as tobacco. It proves that ecigs are, at worse, a lesser of 2 evils.

Nobody is saying that ecigs are healthy, or will improve the health of non-smokers. The whole argument is that ecigs are *less harmful* than tobacco.",0,1409920621,null,0,false,0,ck9u102,t3_2fj66w,t1_ck9u102,t1_ck9tdry,null,1427185641,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I was saying the same thing about Clara last season (basically that she was a normal girl, and not some incarnation of an old character), as people were still posing crazy theories about her up to The Name of the Doctor. *One person wrote in all seriousness that Clara was just inside the Doctor's Head, a figment of his imagination.*

The clue that makes this mystery different is Missy saying that the Doctor is her Boyfriend. With the suggestion of intimacy and some wordplay: Missy - Miss - Mistress - Master, I can understand that line of reasoning, even if Moff keeps saying that he's not keen on doing a *Master* story.

After Into the Dalek, I heard one Who podcast host support the ""Master theory"" by saying that Missy's Heaven was actually a Tardis, and that Missy was snagging characters into it the same way the Doctor grabbed Journey Blue out of her fighter ship before it was blown up.  There's a big flaw there. The Doctor grabbed Journey Blue before anything happened to her. Missy grabbed the Half Face Clockwork Man and Gretchen (Babysitter #2) after they'd seemingly been killed, however in Missy's heaven they were restored whole.

I reckon (but not very strongly) that most of the confusion of most early communist systems transplanted collective ownership to state ownership. So the two things get confused together, even though  - in practice - state ownership of businesses is primarily of benefit to the political elite, not the general population.

In post-war period to mid 60's Birmingham was thriving on a massive scale. For that entire period the level of employment exceeded 99% (barring one year); and the level of pay exceeded the national average to a degree that it was outperforming London and the South East on that measure. This for a region with manufacturing and industry as its base of operations, though the service industry was booming too.

Central government effectively built large council estates outside of the city-proper, dumped people into them, and destroyed the residential and historic character of the city in an attempt to disperse labour. They argued that the prosperity of Birmingham was likely to damage the industry of the North. 

They tried to do the same to London, but decided they'd actually consult the public on their plans, unlike with Birmingham. They failed manifestly, London is all the better for it. Birmingham is a shell in comparison to the city it would have been, it did nothing to help the north, and instead now we have an even more significant geographical disparity than we begun with.

Except - in practise - this isn't actually true. When implemented properly, nationalisation of key natural monopolies does benefit everyone.

I personally don't oppose responsible capitalism, but I do maintain that natural monopolies should lie under democratic control, because this does benefit everyone.

You are really underestimating Khedira here. Khedira, first off he is a great great passer, he competley blows Rami out of the water in this category. And while Ramires might be faster, Khedira is 10x more intelligent when it comes to positioning, interceptions, etc. You don't need to be the fastest player on the field if you know how to control a midfield/defend. That is why Terry has been so great in the back, even without pace.

Khedira is a better midfield player to Ramires. This has been proven for years. I really didn't even know people thought otherwise. When it comes to being a box to box player few people are as good as Khedira.

true,grollcool,null,null,"&gt; This is the exact reason he failed at Barcelona and towards the tail end of his Arsenal career.

Not at all. Are you serious man? I watched a lot of Barcelona last season, the reason he failed is because they tried to play him too deep. They wanted him to take over the Xavi role but he couldn't, he was better suited in more advanced positions. Hence why they bought Rakitic to replace him, and he has been playing the Xavi role pretty well so far.

&gt; His best position is clearly CM, and both Mourinho and Cesc have said as much in recent interviews[1] .

You must be misunderstanding, he would be playing as a midfielder still? What do you think he would have been, a winger??

&gt; Height shouldn't be a factor

It doesn't have to be a negative factor, but you are kidding yourself if you think height isn't a positive factor in a midfielder.

&gt; We're 3 games in. I'd like to think were capable of giving them a wee bit of time before jumping to conclusions.

The games only proved what I thought would happen if we played Cesc alongside Matic. Cesc and Oscar are not typical box to box midfielders, both like to get the ball up the pitch, they are always going to have moments where they get Matic exposed.

But still if we consider it to mean a national populace, then the state is not equivalent. State ownership is a means of transferring control of production to an elite. Socialism should mean control by the communities, which means direct involvement, not kowtowing to our political masters. Modern communists may still advocate it as ownership by the community, but it isn't. That's just fantasy, proven by history.

It's not quite the same thing but I quite liked a a modern take on anarcho-syndicalism (which my google-fu is letting me down on finding): instead of tearing things up and trying to implement new organisations, instead focus on connecting an empowering individuals directly on the shop floor within the context of the structure that already exist (the unions etc).

Sort of a 4-2-1-2-1, with Zarate and Ravel play fluid roles off the striker. Zarate would be slightly higher up the pitch with the freedom to drift wide, and Ravel would be more of a #10 making through passes and ogling forward when needed. The only problem with this one is the lack of wingers to service the striker, so we need a striker who can score with his feet and takes up good positions in the box for passes (think the Poacher role in FM).

I think this is very solid defensively with Kouyate, Noble and Song in midfield. In attack, Song has the freedom to bomb forward, and one of Noble and Kouyate will stay around the halfway line while the other goes up to help the attack.

true,Ray_Sondetra,eng-kernow,Kernow &amp; Kent,"&gt;One thing I will say is that e-cig's initally can seem complex but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very easy. 

Couldn't agree more and to be honest I first visited /r/electronic_cigarette over a year ago and I was so overwhelmed with the technicalities of the whole thing and the whole subreddit being based on the assumption that you even knew what these terms meant that it put me off trying altogether.  It was one of those situations where I posted a noob like enquiry and received rather hostile responses.  I'm an IT Tech/web designer so it's not like I'm unable to comprehend a tutorial.  It actually really put me off.

I tried one of the ones that look like cigarettes and I could see the potential but it just didn't cut it.  Then I bought a basic proper electronic cigarette from a guy on a market stall, with menthol juice (for I used to smoke menthol fags) and that was it.  I was done smoking.  I was never interested in flavours.  I just wanted it to taste like my cigarettes used to.  And it did. And, more importantly, it gives you that hit at the back of the throat.

I still use a standard e-cig (I can't stress enough NOT the ones that look like a cigarette) but a higher quality one.  All the cheap e-Bay ones stop working after about a week or you have to keep fiddling with them.  A decent one is worth a few extra quid but no need to spend loads.",0,1409925477,null,0,1409925659,0,ck9vpw6,t3_2fj66w,t1_ck9vpw6,t1_ck9svgn,null,1427184852,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Do away with Fuel Duty Escalator for a start, also work out how much of Taxation is being used to pay for the PFIs that have been signed in the last 10 years?

Introduce Rental Control and implement building 'limits' (by this I mean a Bedroom is defined as XYZ, rather than one I saw that fitted asingle bed into it (touching the wall on three sides) and you could open the door at the bottom to get into the 'bedroom')

Introducing Rent Control would allow the Welfare budget to be shrunk, since it pays out far too much money which is effectively money straight into the landlords pocket(which the Govt then gets 20% back...)


Council housing? Imagine if instead of paying out £5billion per year (imaginary figure) in 'Rent' this was put to councils to build Council homes, this would give a stock of housing for the poorest to be housed in, since the council own it, no need to pay rent on it (that would be covered by Govt) and instead would only cost 'Running costs'

OR to be clearer

Council own property, No rent being paid means 0 Income on it, but also only maintenance outgoing (which is easily budgetted and controlled)

Currently Landlord owns house, Tenant pays? Income for landlord, no loss for Govt (status Quo) however tenant not paying? Negative balance to Govt to pay for the rent.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;It would only be incorrect if it stated or implied that they were the only ones who LSE apologised to, and, of course, it didn't.

Well,the title *implies* that the welcome email was directed specifically at East-Asian students and that LSE apologised to East-Asian students. Without reading the full article, that is what people would take away from that title. The BBC title does not make this implicit connection like your title does either.

From the sidebar: ""try to keep your titles more or less verbatim if it is linking to a news site. Let commentators make their own decisions on an article.""

Possibly a better title would be ""LSE apologises to students, including many East-Asians, after a welcome email appeared to address them as Kung Fu Panda"".

Please don't take this as a personal slight. I thank you for linking the article, it's funny and interesting. Just that I initially clicked thinking that the situation was worse than it was. I thought that someone had really fucked up by sending the Kung Fu Panda email to a mailing list of East-Asian students, or that the Kung Fu Panda mistake only appears on the emails sent to East-Asian students, which I'm sure you would agree would be much worse than the actual situation.

Just pointing out the difference for the benefit of other Redditors who may read the title and react before reading the article (as is common with all of us, myself included).",0,1409925946,null,0,false,0,ck9vwoq,t3_2fjicy,t1_ck9vwoq,t1_ck9v8yv,null,1427184764,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The media would lose their minds if a manager openly refused to let a player link up with the England squad, particularly if it's Liverpool because we're a scally northern team and the national press is controlled by wankers whose life aspirations include bitching about Thames Water hosepipe bans and immigrants. That being said, it would be nice to see someone take a stand against the dinosaur that is Hodgson.

true,oldmasters,EN,england,"I completely diagree about Khedira's passing, he probably is a bit better than Ramires, but it's not a huge difference. He rarely hits long passes and usually just gives it to Alonso or Modric (and even then, doesn't have a great pass success percentage -http://statsbomb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Khedira-2013_graff.png). And his pace absolutely would matter. Terry's only able to compensate because he's surrounded by quicker players like Cahill, Azpi and, yes, Ramires, who was a crucial part of our ability to resist the counter attack last season. Fabregas &amp; Ramires may have lacked a little tactical discipline against Everton but I don't think we need to bring in Khedira to solve it given how little else he brings to the table. Khedira was important for Madrid because they had no one like him, but he's a fundamentally limited player. Excellent at blocking off passing routes and protecting space, but not as good at actively pressing hard like Ramires is.

Regardless of arguments about who's the better player though, this would completely disrupt our team dynamic. The real world isn't FM, continuity of squad is important and bringing in Khedira would oblige us to play a Matic/Khedira/Fab midfield in most games, which would be terrible and static.
