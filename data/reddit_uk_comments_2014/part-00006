All of these cuts are just to lower the budget deficit, meaning that we don't spend more than we make as a country, that's the goal.

When that is achieved (if ever) at the cost of welfare recipients, we still have this growing debt we need to service.

I'm not sure what the point I'm trying to make is exactly, but there seems to be a lot of coverage regarding the budget, but nothing about the debt which is a towering monster of a problem compared to a few billion quid spent on housing and bus passes. 

Can't the banks bail out the government now that they're back to money making ways? I'm sure the answer is no on this one, but the real question the goverment needs to answer is what is the long term solution, what is the UK economy going to look like in the years to come. 

Maybe answering that question will show the ineffectuality of what the current government is doing without a long term plan, because all they are doing is making poor people poorer without really making any difference to the big picture or the long term.

That said, the problem with this specific guy is the idea of legislating offense caused which is entirely subjective.

 In all cases i think it should go down to harm caused and clearly walking around naked is going to invite scrutiny but if you can't really show any intent to harass, attack or any actual crime, with the exception of not wearing any clothes in public, it becomes quite hard to define it as a crime.

true,Snay,null,null,"Yes that would be incorrect; the points system works on a maximum for a single offence but you can stack points for a number of offences at a single incident. Many drivers seemed to get points for failing to identify the driver. When you get a speeding ticket from a GATSO, the police only know the registration of the car, which the use to find the registered keeper (the person who's name appears on the V5 logbook, usually the owner). However that doesn't necessarily mean that the owner was driving at the time of the offence.

The police will send out a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) which compels the registered keeper to identify the driver. If you fail to identify the driver, the registered keeper can be prosecuted and receive 6 points and £1,000 fine. Then, if the police can verify that you were driving (usually from the GATSO pictures, a witness or that nobody else was insured on that car) then they can also prosecute you for the original speeding offence, so that's another 3 points, bringing your total to 9. (Although it is worth noting that in special circumstances the magistrates can up that to 6 points for a speeding offence, pushing you to a grand total of 12). 

So this **could** cut down the number of speeding incidents down from being caught speeding 15 times down to 5 times (theoretically). You can hit 5 speed cameras on one stretch of road in loads of places, so this could all have happened on one day, without more information this is pure speculation. 

There is, or at least used to be, some dodgy advice out there that suggested that the police couldn't compel you to name yourself on a NIP (they can) or that they would drop the case if it was too difficult to find out who was driving (they won't), so I know a guy who got nine points and a massive fine for following internet lawyer advice.

When it came to putting ""E II R"" on though, there was a bit of a fight, because in Scotland there wasn't an Elizabeth I, so how could we have a second? Before when a monarch had used a name from before the Acts of Union, they bore two regnal numbers, so James VI of Scotland was James I in England and so on - Elizabeth was the first since the Jameses though, and folk weren't happy. A few post boxes were blown up, and the RM decided to play it safe. 

So when Charles takes over, assuming he doesn't call himself either Elizabeth III or James IV or something, it'll be interesting to note if the RM go back to putting on the monarchs or not.

Consider the comparison to the people that use the terms pro-lifers, anti-lifers, pro-choicers, anti-choicers in the abortion debate.

Science doesn't dictate that nuclear plants should be built. Science doesn't provide that GM crops must be used. It doe not provide a binary answer on any single issue. People can disagree for ideological reasons and still follow the scientific method.

There is an ideology hidden in here (I've expanded on this elsewhere in the comments). There are assumptions about how society will grow and what the priorities will be over the next 50-70 years. There are assumptions on how we will be living and what our energy requirements will be. Opposition to that ideology does not equate to a failure of reasoning.

A lot of Welsh people are phenomenally rude, I run a shop, and when I politely say ""I'm sorry, I don't speak Welsh"" to my customers, I often get greeted with a totally changed attitude, a huff and a puff, and then spoken at rather than to.

I have English, Scottish &amp; Kiwi friends who visit and have tale after tale of being treated absolutely fine, until they open their mouths and are heard speaking with a different accent.

I went climbing Snowdonia last year, stopped in a pub on our way back run by a very rude man who did nothing but slag off the English, particularly those from Liverpool. When I told him my parents were scouse, he made a rude jibe at me and walked away.

I'm not saying all are, the majority are not, however there are a lot, certainly where I live, enough to make a mark and be noticed.

On the subject of road signs, I read/write/speak very little Welsh as I said, but I still think it's plain dangerous decking out road signs with the Welsh first. We, as humans, are taught to read from top to bottom, with relevant information such as roadsigns, containing what we need to quickly glance, process and act upon.

Where do parent's rights end and where do mine begin? If you are in a public place you are limited to the rules and rights of the state. If we agree that naked guy isn't a threat, isn't causing harm, then do you have the right to stop him entering an area with children? 

If you agree that he should be stopped from entering, you are advocating ""parents rights"" superseding everyone else's rights both in private and in public. This sets a pretty dangerous precedent, with ""For the children!"" being the warcry for every suspension of rights from that point on and counteracts a lot of the arguments to allow naked rambling - children can be in any public place.

Because it seems to me most if not all police states come out of something drastic - civil wars, economic collapses (not like 2008, I mean post war Germany"" or military coups. They then use social problems and security as excuses to massively ramp up their patronage lines in the police and military as a means of maintaining political support, whilst restricting public resource distribution as a means of acquiring dependence. This has to happen quickly for two reasons:

1. the police and army will depose the government, or at least won't protect it if things don't happen quickly enough. Particularly them getting paid, fed, equipped and tasked.
2. People will engage in far more effective popular protest if the government isn't quick in disrupting supply lines, forcing dependence for sustenance. 

No police state has ever been born slowly. It has always been through some drastic fundamental event that broke existing social structures. Look at North Korea, Russia, Eastern Europe, Germany, Nearly all of Africa and South America, most of the middle East. It's a successive list of coups, revolutions, collapses, civil wars and invasions.

If a couple divorces on legal aid there is massive pressure on them to mediate until there is an agreement which can simply be rubber-stamped by the court.

Although I accept that it must happen in some cases, I have literally never met a solicitor who wanted to drag out a divorce case. They don't pay well, you're dealing with people who are under immense stress which inevitably rubs off on you, and it is rarely anything other than tedious.

I would also point out that the cuts to legal aid don't just hit divorcing couples. I've left the legal profession to do something more interesting, but because of my specialism I still get called in to do cases as a consultant.

I work in mental health law, representing people who are detained under section against their will, in most cases without having committed any kind of offence. For years the government has undermined this area of the law, so now a solicitor simply can't afford to do a good job - they are paid a fixed rate regardless of whether the case is simple or complex, and that rate has been repeatedly knocked down from its already derisory starting point.

These are people who often don't understand why they're in hospital, have no idea whether it is lawful or not, and cannot put forward their own case at an appeal. The legal aid cuts mean these people are often saddled with totally inexperienced paralegals who have a vast caseload and cannot give their case anything like the time and preparation it requires.

That's a massive jump of logic not based in any fact.

[Unemployment rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate) - Poland 10.6%; UK 7.4%;

I think plenty of people don't get something major here. Goods production in the world uses prices suitable for mostly rich countries (so the ones with highest requirement of those). This means that in countries where currency value is low it's much worse to obtain certain goods.

Now, the example from Poland. You earn there for example 2,000zl (I think minimum now is around 1,3k). This is probably at the approximate level of a job in UK for earning around 1.5k GBP. Current GBP-ZL is around 4.9.

Now, prices of certain things in UK (first) and in Poland (I don't count expensive places):
* rent - £600 - 700zl;
* bread - £1 - 2zl;
* buying house - £200k - 200k zl;
* PS3 - £350 - 2000zl;
* fridge - £600 - 2000zl;
* car - £10k - 40k zl;

and so on. This means that's its simply easier to live in UK, even if you don't earn that much.

A few of the comments have suggested that there would be quite a few legal implications towards your idea however I believe you are definitely on to something. Surely a more healthy alternative would be for rail companies to have buy back systems and schemes. So you go to a ticket machine with your return once you're home and feed it in, and it gives you say a tenner. So you've just managed to get back a tenner etc but then the train company can then resell that ticket. Not at full price, no that would be silly of them, but at a discounted price.

Similar to a picture I regularly see on FB and reddit the ""pending coffees"" thing, where people buy and pay for a coffee for those less fortunate. In a similar fashion it could be possible for it to be a case of going up to the ticket office and asking ""do you have any Blackburn - York tickets pending?"" And then the guy behind will say, Yes we've just had someone sell their ticket, that will be £15 please.

true,theyeatthepoo,null,null,"&gt;If one wants to claim the precedent of history (""As a percentage of GDP the UK's National debt is historically speaking very low"") I think it is important to establish whether the circumstance is unique. You can legitimately argue for fiscal expansion to stimulate the economy, but to claim that this has been done before when citing war spending is a little off.

I was never explicitly citing war spending, that was a reply to your comment that higher debt occurred purely as a result of war. That was false regardless, the UK has had higher debt than it has now from 1720 to 1880 and from 1915 to 1972. I understand that the influence of empire &amp; War are an important factor with regards to those dates, but the majority of the time that we have had a higher debt for has been spent at peace. So i'm not citing war, i'm citing war &amp; peace, the expansion of empire &amp; the collapse of empire, Labour, Wigg, Tory, Liberal, Coalition governments, Austerity, Economic booms, recessions.  It's a pretty generalized situation in which Debt did not only rise because of War. 


&gt;Because GDP growth was negative in 1944 and 1945 despite increasing debt (by about -4 and -5% respectively). It is not a sure thing that increased government spending leads to increased growth. See also Italy and Japan during the lost decade.

I was not citing GDP, that's quite a limited way of measuring the impact of national debt. I was also not suggesting that it's a sure thing that increased government spending leads to increased growth, of course it depends where that money goes. Debt is also not a necessarily accurate way of measuring government spending. 

&gt;They have consistently reduced top tax rates. Which is not the same as a reduction in tax take- next to no-one paid the very highest rates historically. Modern top rate bases are very much broader and generally generate more revenue despite lower rates.

Your misquoting me. I said 'America continually reduced tax's' not 'America reduced tax take'. You also have to take into account that the spending of tax dollar's become more regressive. Less on projects that redistributed income and more on the military industrial complex for example.

&gt;Real terms increases in take home income have been growing more slowly (16% since 1975) but not declined. Also note that this is ameliorated considerably when one a) equivalises and b) takes account of labour market composition, which has been shifted toward lower waged groups (women, minorities) with rapidly growing incomes. It's a Simpson's paradox type thing.

Once again you are misunderstanding me. I did not say that real term increases in take home income have been growing more slowly, i said that living standards have decreased for the majority of the population. This is absolutely true. Since the neo-liberal regressive tax regime of the 1970's was begun; the gap between the life expectancy of the rich and poor has increase, Math &amp; Literacy skills have decreased, Infant mortality among the poor has increased, Homicides have increased, Imprisonment has increased, Trust between the population has decreased, Obesity has increased, Mental illness &amp; drug addiction have increased and social mobility has decreased. These are the results of an increasingly unequal society that is so because of the reduced tax's and regressive spending. The same can be said, but to a lesser extent, of the UK. These issues, among others, always increase or decrease and society's become less or more unequal. Even within countries or within states. 

Besides the 16% increased in take home income does not take into account rent etc, meaning that people earning the average wage today also have lower living standards because they have less disposable income. 

Also, looking at other measures there is also more evidence that living standards have decreased. Looking at the Change in Real Family Income by Quintile between 1979 and 2009 we see that for the bottom 20% this has gone down by 7.4%. The contrast is stark here if we look at what the results of this same measure where between 1947 and 1979 when we had a more progressive tax system. Between these dates the bottom 20% Real family income rose by 116%.

Also looking at wages. Between 1947 and 1972 the average hourly wage went from $10.18 to $17.88 but between 1972 it only went from $17.88 to $18.63, obviously not keeping up with the cost of living meaning that by this measure living standards have also gone down. 

Labour market composition is simply not a factor because the results are the same when looking at white middle class men or white working class men alone. They are also the same if you look purely at jobs and not at workers. Their living standards, judged by disposable income, average wage  etc, has stagnated since the neo-liberal economic regime's of the late 1970's came into place.",0,1389094095,null,0,1389094410,0,cejht6a,t3_1uj5em,t1_cejht6a,t1_ceinq1t,null,1431836450,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On a heavily congested motorway it works differently; because the car spacing is so small, rather than being absorbed any abrupt change in speed is magnified as the cars behind have to over-break (human reaction time) in order to slow down in time, and it passes back like a shockwave through the fast-moving traffic. This is why speed limits on heavily congested motorways actually help the traffic move more quickly; any small problems are less likely to cause the entire carriageway to screech to a stop. It also helps reduce the chance of collisions, which are another major source of traffic.

The two simple things to sort out the budget are:
1. Capital gains tax on 1st homes. This would stop any future house market price rises.
2. Remove the 'triple lock' and start means testing older people for benifits.
These two would really start to fix the budget deficit, much more than most things that have been suggested by Osborne recently.

If the problem is youths burning cars we find a way to stop this happening - you think its more policing and introducing consequences to their actions - I think it is figuring out why they are burning cars and to understand and solve that problem. Otherwise we just treat the symptoms and never cure the disease.

&gt; We've tried the ""progressive left"" policies of not restricting the little darlings freedoms

The vast majority of these kids come from impoverished backgrounds. The fundamental tenets of Leftisit ideology revolves around *economic freedoms*. Please, explain to me how we have seen people having more economic freedom in a world in which wealth is concentrated into the hands of fewer and fewer people?

The average impoverished youth can look forward to their youngest, healthiest days working in some shitty job that is completely unfulfilling and soul destroying. Alienated from the world you seek to protect so badly, this individual sees life as one big theme park with basic desire fulfilled here and simplest pleasure explored there. With no feeling of control over ones destiny, and sold an ideal of a life that you never have gradually you'd probably start to take pleasure in the destruction of the rules that others value so much - it is the truest form of control.

If these rules don't benefit you, what value do you see in them? These are rules you take for granted like *ownership* and *do what the police man says*. Imagine if you've seen these rules have your family taken apart and your world destroyed. Do you think you'd just sit around all day and talk about how great the queen is?

&gt; But if you have a better suggestion how to control mindless vandalism and mobs terrorising local communities, please feel free to expand your ideas.

Well, your perception of terror is unchanged by the increasing overpolicing of every aspect of society; from the restricting cloths people wear to the places they can stand to the very media they look at when they get home. We control them all. Maybe this control is necessary, but by your standards it will never be enough.

&gt; It is all very well for highly paid professors in colleges, and certain politicians to thinks all it takes is to give ppl a bit of work. These classes removed from the real world never have to worry about money. For them work is merely an occupation, i.e that they are not bored during the day doing nothing! They translate their own personal desires not to be “idle” to the wider world, as for them, finance is relatively unimportant.

&gt; But for most other people, work is all about earning money to live. Because for most other people that is the only way they are going to get any. as Social Security certainly isn’t going to cover most ppl’s cost of living anywhere. Being unoccupied, and bored during the day is the very least of their problems.
And if ppl are not able to get the money they need, they will feel useless and depressed.

&gt; Most of the depressed young ppl are depressed not merely because they are not “occupied”, but they have nothing.

I think a point does need to be made about rape in the media, and banning songs being played in a student union, especially potentially triggering songs (the lyrics of Blurred Lines contained phrases that have the potential to be very triggering, 'I know you want it', for instance) which would tremendously ruin someone's night out and make a lot of people feel very uncomfortable.

&gt;**Erich Alfred Hartmann** (19 April 1922 – 20 September 1993), nicknamed ""**Bubi**"" (the hypocoristic form of ""young boy"") by his comrades and ""**The Black Devil**"" by his Soviet enemies, was a German World War II fighter pilot and is the highest-scoring fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare. He claimed 352 aerial victories (of which 345 were won against the Soviet Air Force, and 260 of which were fighters) in 1,404 combat missions. He engaged in aerial combat 825 times while serving with the Luftwaffe. During the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his damaged fighter 14 times. This was due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure. Hartmann was never shot down or forced to land due to fire from enemy aircraft.

&gt; r/Sotland is overrun with posts about independence. It is almost always over 40%, contrary to your suggestion otherwise.

I checked [23 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1svhfn/meta_will_this_subreddit_continue_to_cover/ce1ukws) and it was 32%, and [2 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1psyq1/and_that_was_it_in_essence_he_despised_the_first/cd5y80u) it was 40%. It will vary, of course - it comes and goes.

The other claim that's often made is that /r/Scotland is overrun with pro-independence accounts that only ever post in that sub. The [last time I checked](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1psyq1/and_that_was_it_in_essence_he_despised_the_first/cd62jlq) that didn't seem to be true either.

Could you explain this bit: 'the rule is for the outward part of the ticket. The outward journey is only valid with the return ticket'

So you're saying that if I were to buy a 'return ticket', I'd need to (according to T&amp;Cs) show the **return** ticket on my outward journey for the **outward** ticket to be valid? If so, wow. That is insane.

I kind of understand it if it's an advanced ticket, as you book it in advance and usually it's for a certain train at a certain time.

I understand the terms and conditions and don't ever intend to attempt to sell a return ticket (not worth the time and hassle imo) but it seems that even though I'm a paying season ticket holder, I'm continually harassed by the train system I have to endure daily.

&gt;**No true Scotsman** is an informal logical fallacy, an ad hoc attempt to retain an unreasoned assertion. When faced with a counterexample to a universal claim, rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original universal claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule.

(I'm a recreational pilot and like to help keep flying these old vintage planes, but that's a different topic, anyway, I know a lot of pilots from different airlines, longhaul, short haul, private jet etc).

The A380 the 747-8.  These are planes for Hub and Spoke.

For a lot of people getting there in the quickest manner possible is what is wanted, not always the most direct.  People going to somewhere in the middle east say, won't mind a 2 hour stop in Dubai if it means they get to the meeting or whatever on Tuesday, rather than taking a direct flight the next day.

Ok if I'm planning a holiday, I'll probably decide to fly on Thursday rather than Tuesday, so I can get a direct flight.  But most people don't.  Heck it used to be the clear divide between charter and schedule.  Last time I was in Banjul, I needed to get back to London ASAP.  I could fly a 2 stop route today, or wait 3 days for a direct flight.  Ended up sleeping in Brussels for 4 hours whilst suffering from the runs..... Not fun!

Now some people say that as more and more people fly, we need more planes like the 787, cheap to run, not too big, easy for an airline to sell every seat.  Some claim that these are just as low cost per seat as an a380.

If we are to have a hub, why for a second should it be Birmingham.  The argument for London is obvious, demand.  Heathrow as is, is busy, really busy.  Like NATS brag endlessly about the 98% utilisation.  They claim it's more efficient thanks to them than some 6 lane runways in the rest of the world (it has two, which are so close separation is harder than newer airports).  So despite the problems, the huge cost of a landing slot.  Why do airlines go there rather than Gatwick?  They know they can sell more tickets.  Why is that?  Because it is an established destination.  It is really hard to find good figures for how many people use connecting flights at LHR.  But if we want to have a 'Hub' then it should be as close to the biggest demand as possible.

The fact that the rest of the UK is lucky enough to be so geographically close to what would be the west Europe hub should be the way of looking at it.  It would be very bad for Paris and Amsterdam for example.

The thinking is that it is best for both the national interest and the parties prospects if they serve the full term, providing stability and an environment for economic recovery. The LibDems had to prove that they were a party of government and that coalition government works . 

According to an online poll by Ashcroft (http://www1.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2014/01/04/lord-ashcrofts-mega-poll-has-ukip-on-16pc-the-highest-his-surveys-have-ever-recorded/) 35% of the general public would prefer a government with the libdems taking part (15% con-ld, 20% lab-ld) compared to 31%Con and 34%Lab. 

I have a feeling if the LibDems were to call an election now it would not serve their electoral prospects and they would suffer for it (needless to say I would lose a fair bit of respect if they were to do so).

So if you are making cider...
(Also, sucrose(table sugar) and glucose(brewing sugar) are found in apples in roughly the same quantity [ edit: although table sugar may not be as refined, so for very large quantities there is a potential flavour to look out for])

In the future you can look forward to experimenting with golden syrup, honey, brown sugar and treacle (with an intentional flavour, where-as table sugar and brewing sugar will make something taste dryer like a dry white wine, which is usually a desirable effect if you are increasing the alcohol content significantly).

Keep in mind that at this early stage variations in temperature can have a really more significant effect on the quality of the finished product, sometimes more than changes in simple ingredients variations such as what type of sugar you use. It's hard to know what caused what unless you have really exact conditions.

I'd recommend a first timer to not use too much extra sugars (or any) until you get confident at temperature control - more sugar and attempting higher alcohol are tough tasks for yeast, so they can produce more off flavours, especially under the wrong kinds of temperature.

true,JRugman,null,null,"There's some huge holes in the proposal that this guide unsurprisingly completely glosses over.

1. Does the £47 billion cost and 7 year construction period include the delivery and operation of all the high speed rail lines and central London terminals that are neccessary to keep the airport running? (answer - no)

2. The developers propose that the £45 billion value of the old Heathrow airport site be 'partially captured', but don't suggest how this would be done.

3. What kind of time frame is suggested for the redevelopment of the old Heathrow airport site, which is meant to provide housing for 300,000 people and 200,000 jobs? Consider that the airport currently provides 136,600 direct and indirect jobs in London, which would all be either lost or relocated at great expense. Consider also that previous estimates of the development potential of the Heathrow site have been much lower (80,000 homes / 43,500 jobs according to TfL).

4. Do they seriously expect 172 million passengers per year and a hundred thousand or so workers to all travel to the airport by rail? That would mean building a rail line with a capacity more than double the busiest line that currently operates - double decker high speed trains running every 5-10 mins. You're also talking about feeding almost all these passengers straight into Kings Cross, Crossrail, or HS1, all of which which will struggle to cope with the extra traffic. 

5. According to the National Air Traffic Services, an estuary airport would result in more planes flying at a lower altitude over central London, since they'd be heading west on take-off and would need to avoid the airspace of other London airports. It would also mean landing approaches being pushed eastwards into Dutch and Belgian airspace, who would probably want to reserve it for their own airports. Even if they were open to the idea, diverting the main flightpaths serving northwest europe would result in an increase in fuel use and emissions by airlines using them.

6. If the main goal is to reduce noise suffered by residents under the Heathrow flight path, then for £50 billion you could buy out and rehouse everyone inside the 57dB noise contour, unifying Windsor Great Park, Hounslow Heath, Osterley Park, Kew Gardens, Gunnersbury Park, Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common … if not further into London … as a nature reserve.

The main question that needs to be resolved is whether London even needs a hub airport. Other airports in europe are geographically better placed to receive air traffic from growing BRICS economies, so if you're talking about competition with europe then we're always going to lose out. We've benefitted from the access to US markets, for which London is much better placed than any other major EU city (Eire excepted). The recent interim report from the Davies Commission made it clear that the need for a UK hub airport is not as urgent as the corporations behind Heathrow Airport or Boris Island would have us believe.

The main beneficiaries of an expanded hub airport serving London would be the owners of the airport (which may, like Heathrow, be as much a foreign-owned mechanism for tax avoidance as it is a place for people to fly to other countries) and the major airlines serving long-haul routes. The problem with trying to capture a share of a global market is that the companies involved are likely to be based outside the UK, so the economic benefit to the UK may end up being marginal.

How much faith do we have in the projections of massively increasing demand for air travel over the next 50-100 years? Given the constraints on fuel and space that may be faced, is it not better to add capacity incrementally (which is a clear possibility at Gatwick and Stansted), and focus our national infrastructure planning on projects that actually serve the people of the UK?

Some people use a [blow off tube](http://www.howtobrew.com/images/f54.gif) in the earlier stages instead of an airlock (I just use some standard syphon tubing for that).

Also, temperature control is pretty important - too hot and you'll notice the kick of the alcohol and get worse hangovers and a thinner tasting cider - Too coldand the yeast will drop out, although often it will just take longer. For most yeasts about 20C is perfect, so if your room is consistently that then that's great. Fermentation produces heat as well though, so if your room is 18C then a jumper should actually do the job of keeping the cider warm enough.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I clicked this link and you said in the post ""The front page is currently 66% independence-related links"". 66% not 40%. Sounds like around 60% is the typical number.

If you scroll down you'll see I got the percentages the [wrong way round](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1psyq1/and_that_was_it_in_essence_he_despised_the_first/cd60i2h), and my math wrong. 10 out of 25 were independence stories, so it should have been 40% not 60% (I'm not sure why I posted 66+44, as percentages don't work like that ;). Mea culpa.

&gt; Just have a look at the top submitting users. Nothing else gets through the tide.

He does post a lot, but the page you linked to says there's about 11 submissions a day. So at most half the front-page.

If you look at his last 25 [submissions](http://www.reddit.com/user/spooz/submitted/) then I would say these were on independence:

* Better Together urged to reveal what No vote would mean for Scotland
* Scots funding 'faces huge cut after election'
* David Cameron has come under renewed pressure for a public debate with Alex Salmond
* Is 2014 the Year Scotland Finally Gains Independence?
* Scottish independence: Nicola Sturgeon says economy is key to referendum
* Scottish independence: Cameron urges ‘No’ vote
* The Conservatives should embrace a yes vote for Scottish independence now
* Quotes of the year
* 2014 is the opportunity of a lifetime for country, says Salmond
* Scots need more than hype and hope
* David Cameron defends 'comatose' Alistair Darling's leadership of campaign against Scottish independence

These were not:

* Over 1300 addresses flagged as 'risky' by Scottish Ambulance Service
* In pictures: Flooding across Scotland
* Famous Scots and their New Year’s Resolutions
* Scottish Government praised after slashing flights
* Scotland's dentists increase by a third under SNP
* Scotland Hogmanay Fireworks
* New recycling rules come into effect for Scottish businesses
* 100 residents evacuated from Dundee flats after landslide
* A holidaymaker has suffered life-threatening injuries after being gored in the neck
* One in every 100 Scots will have visited food bank

And these are political, but I would not say they were ""independence"" stories:

* SNP ministers warn lairds about need for 'radical' redistribution of Scottish land
* Thatcher made ‘secret cuts’ to Scottish budget
* First Minister's 2013 New Year message
* one hundred weeks of scotland

Primarily because I would say land reform, '80s cabinet briefings, the First Minister, and a photography project are not really about independence (the photography project maybe, but it doesn't look particularly partisan - it's just documenting Scotland this year).

So I make that 11 independence submissions out of 25, or 44%. Sometimes he probably posts more, sometimes less, but I don't think it's fair to say that independence is all he posts about.

FWIW I don't know spooz, I'm not some kind of sock puppet, and I do think he's guilty of having tunnel vision at times over what independence might mean.

Same name of dead relative? Peter Bishop vs Peter Tyler? OK, could JUST go with that, even though peter is a very common name.

 same common enemy? Not sure which Fringe enemy you're on about here, but the only probably similarity really is that they're both extremely clever (and male and human). Not exactly the most original of things for either of them. 99% of enemies are evil geniuses. Being up against an idiot would just be quick and easy, wouldn't it?

&gt;monster of the week episodes identical

Er...So has [almost every single other TV out there also followed this format](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek), be it monster of the week or just story of the week. Unless you have this one really really really looooong story, you cannot escape from using this.

this is something that we will be finding out in at most a few years time, this is not some far off event where they will be able to claim the situation changed in the meantime, it is in the SNP politicians best political and personal interest to be as truthful as possible about what can happen with independence as they hope to be living with it not too long from now. 

* claiming that EU accession can be negotiated from within the UK (which as of yet no one has disputed) is often mentioned so i assume that they've been told this will happen easily enough.

* adoption of the Euro not being necessary, already has real world examples where planning to one day begin using it can mean from 5 years time to 5000 years time. 

* Schengen though, they've been a bit iffy on that front, some people are most concerned that Independence would mean a physical border on the border rather than being part of the common travel area with the UK and Ireland.

* the CoFR is never mentioned by either side, maybe its because having to argue against that name would make you come across as some kind of pantomime villain, however i actually cannot see an Independent Scotland wanting to keep this anyway, the Scottish parliament has it built in to its process that no law can be made contradicting EU law so it already respects this.

The problem is not the current government, as much as I like to think of them as a bunch of hateful bastards, but that they are creating tools that shortens the path for anyone who actually want to abuse the power substantially.

It's both making abuse easier, *and* making it more tempting for people who have uses for these powers that *they* believe are justified to do what it takes to get into a position to use them.

That they powers have not been abused enough *yet* is a really bad reason for having them. If there's any way they *can* be abused, then safeguards ought to be put into place. And a good place to start would be to substantially narrow the scope.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;For all your talk of ideology, there is no reasonable alternative to using electricity, and we need to think sensibly about what options exist for safely and reliably generating whatever electricity we will need.

There is no alternative to using electricity, no. But that is not the debate, absolutely no one is arguing otherwise.The questions about how much energy we use and how we use it. The answers to those questions are influenced by ideology and hence determine if nuclear power is a good choice. 

For instance take commuting. Consider the number of people travelling into work by train or subway. Also think about the amount of power required to heat and cool and light office blocks. Consider the times at which this takes place (regular demands, but hitting the system at the same time). Also note that commuters go to work in cities and cities are usually far away from where renewable power generation takes place. 

So, everyone uses a lot of power at the same time at a place far away from wind and waves and dams. A lot of power is used to get them there. Current predictions for renewable power suggest that it will be unable to meet these demands, what do we do?

Nuclear power can be argued to be a solution, allow load balancing in the network and can be built fairly close to cities (closer than some windfarm up the Highlands).

However an environmentalist could argue that we should reduce our overall energy consumption and balance the usage across the network (as opposed to transporting into the middle of cities) by cutting down on commuting. How many jobs actually require an office presence 9-5, 5 days a week? How much of the commute is a societal construct and to what extent could the internet be used to replace it (e.g. telecommuting)?

Depending on which view you take (or somewhere in between, or somewhere more extreme) means you have different considerations for the lifetime of the plant. Are we talking about extending a coal plant for a decade whilst renewables pick up and we reorganise society? Are we talking about a period of 70 years where commuting increases? Nuclear compares favorably to coal like for like, does it do so at 7:1?

And that is just one factor.

In the media, mostly when people reduce the debate down to ""pro-science"" and ""anti-science"" they are hiding their ideology by appealing to some sort of higher entity. All this discussion and nuance is ignored. It is not scientific. People using those terms often come across as shills and/or idiots.

The Nazi's spent 15 years preparing the German people before they got enough of the vote to be able to engineer their takeover, during which they had *aggressively* built up paramilitary organisations and stepped up harassment and persecution of opposition groups. They spent another 5 years solidifying their grasp, and gradually ramping up the oppression before even many jews realised how bad the situation was (witness the number that were still *there* when the Kristallnacht happened in November 1938). It was not an overnight change.

In Russia, Lenin and others spent a decade before the formation of the RSDLP, and a further two decades afterwards, building support before they were able to carry out their coup.

Those are the dedicated lines and terminals that would allow passengers to check-in before getting to the airport. Because they would be considered 'airside' (i.e. the part of the airport that you enter after going through security check and boarding control) they wouldn't be able to stop at any other stations. I'm talking about the cost of connecting the airport to the rest of the public rail network, which would involve upgrades to most stations on the designated lines to handle the increase in traffic, just like we're currently experiencing in London with Crossrail.

&gt; 4) 172million I would suppose is the maximum capacity, not what they would expect it to operate at. My understanding is you want a fairly big buffer in case of delays, which is the problem at Heathrow. Also some large percentage being connecting flight passangers - a quick google says some 37% of Heathrow are such.

True, there would be connecting passengers who wouldn't need to leave the aiport, but if the demand for aviation is from people wanting to visit London, then we should expect to provide good transport links to and from the city. And lets not forget the airport workers, who will need to commute on a daily basis.

Currently, 25% of Heathrow passengers use public transport (Picadilly line, Heathrow Express, or local bus), which is 17 million people. The distance from Heathrow to central London is 30 miles. If you're planning an airport with a capacity in mind, then you need to design every part of the infrastructure required accordingly. If the expected max capacity is 178 million people by 2050, then even with a rail usage of 50%, you're still looking at a major transport problem that needs to be addressed. Factor in the 60 mile distance to central London, and you're looking at what those of us in the business call a planning clusterfuck, which has barely been touched on in the current proposals - which is exactly why Mr Davies asked for more detail about what the backers of Boris Island intend to do about it.",0,1389102847,null,0,false,0,cejjerr,t3_1um94m,t1_cejjerr,t1_cejiulh,null,1431837295,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Personally I think all religions are a pile of bureaucratic crap designed to control the behaviour of large numbers of people using a select few.

But Muslims have been particularly slagged off and put upon in recent years. A few of them deserve it. Most of them don't. And so ...

* Promote Islam as a comprehensive belief system

  It's a belief system like Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism are belief systems. I don't see the word ""only"" in there. Why shouldn't they promote it? We're still free to ignore it and believe whatever we like.

* Absolutely no compromise in changing or abandoning normative Islamic practices/concepts.  

 Key word: normative. Provided they operate within the law and don't transgress any discrimination laws, fine.

* Engage in society via debate, discussion, peaceful protests and civil disobedience.

 ...And **not** violence or terrorism. Isn't this what most of us do, as a society?

* Unity regardless of political or religious differences. There is more to unite upon than disunite upon.

 Seems reasonable. I see nothing frightening in this.

* Produce capable Muslim representatives who can deal with the mainstream media.

 Because without them, Muslims keep getting mis-represented and moderate voices are never heard.

* Stop apologising for crimes that have nothing to do with Islam.

 No problem with this

* Continue linking “extremism” and incidents like 7/7 and Woolwich to foreign policy.

 I'm not so sure about this one. They shouldn't assume there's always a link. But disturbing? No.

* Political activism in accordance with Islam.

 Again, it depends on which bit of Islam they accord with. But they're not exactly promoting extremism.

* Muslims should excel in their field of studies and work, so they can get into positions of influence.

 This will help them integrate and become normal members of society, instead of always being the disaffected underclass. It will also encourage others to do the same. Don't all we all need positive role models?

* Do not wait for your group/organisation/party to be attacked, speak out and defend you brethren regardless of your differences.

 Again, remember that Muslims feel like they're constantly under attack. You only have to pick up a few tabloids to see why. I don't see anything wrong with them speaking up to defend each other.

Maybe everyone else can see a thinly-veiled Islamist sub-text here that I am too blinkered to acknowledge. But it seems to me they're just trying to establish a self-confidence and a robust defence against all the negative publicity they're getting these days.

But the way in which those teams set out to defend, you said it yourself, they sat very deep and the space between the two banks of four was minimal enough to not allow anyone to roam between them off the ball and they defended narrowly. 

It's the infamous parking the bus tactic, that's when the 4-4-2 can work against any other system, simply pack everyone into an extremely tight, deep and narrow defensive block soak up pressure and look to hit for one goal on a counter and then back it in some more and see out the tie 1-0.

If Spurs played like that the 4-4-2 would work. But, they don't and if they did everyone associated with Spurs would be absolutely furious.

So it does boil down to playing the formation well, yes, but what you want the team to do is tied to the formations you can play. Spurs weren't interested in dropping the line deep against Arsenal, they wanted to challenge them in an open match, which they did, with the wrong tactics and they lost the game.

Ajax plays their system, 4-3-3, high line, high possession game based on short passing and waiting for the right chances to go on goal against any team they come across, but they have the right players to play in that way, matched with the right system, with a large amount of understanding between the players to do it.

People think of London Heathrow, its the worlds busiest airport (mind you the frogs are on our tail!) and people know they will always be able to get to England easily.  That's great and everything, but compare that to Amsterdam.  Shiphol is bloody busy when you think how tiny Amsterdam (heck the whole of NL is).  It is the 16th busiest airport in the world.  How big is Amsterdam?  Like 2 million or something.  It's utterly tiny.  But just think what a benefit that is for international commerce.  Anyone can get to Amsterdam!  Tourists still make up about 70% of flights, so it also helps drive that side of the country too.

Having air links really helps.  My parents live not far from Newquay, when an airline route changes, their friends in the hotel + bar + etc trade know all about it.  This is for a tiny little turbo prop plane from an operator based out of Plymouth, you can't get smaller fry.  Imagine what a difference it makes having a few 'Super' come in every hour, 24/7.

My time right now is currently being split between London and Sydney.  Despite the awful flight time, I'm spoiled for options for flying there, I mean there are soo many routes.  All of them stop in a hub. Do I want one night in Bangkok? Hong Kong?  I know it's not going to be LA, fuck that place.  If I've time, why wouldn't I stop there?  It really helps to break up a long flight, even if I only spend 6 hours walking around.  A good leg massage in BKK, maybe venture to a tech city in HK.

Being closer to the hub is a really big benefit, as more people can get there more easily, that has big benefits for businesses choosing to have head quarters.  The Thames location is great, except for the whole wildlife thing.  We could see many good little connecting flights for Scotland, Cornwall etc.  With a good HS link and cross rail, people in Bristol say would be getting there in about 2 hours.  I can see the benefit.  However this is an ambitious project, which needs someone with a desire to spend and vanity to pull it off.  Boris I think lacks enough of it.  Ok, so Luton, Standstead and Gatwick would become almost closed (or just super cheap to compete) but think about how many flights there are currently from Manchester to London?  A few, but which airport?  Not at the time you want for your connection, you don't want to be in LHR for 4 hours buying shit coffee.  Have just one big hub airport, all the spokes can link there (for intercontinental stuff).

true,Gravity13,null,null,"This response is just as vacuous as Moffat's recent writing, it's no wonder the show is progressing in the direction it's progressing, the fans are *you.*

Your whole entire post could be summed up with one TL;DR

&gt;Moffat's show is about the Doctor.

But it just needs to be filled with space and filler, praise that is fitting of this more modern version of the show... how could RTD compete against a man willing to pit the universe on the line each and every time!?

Before I become too ironic though, how about some substance?

*It's not about what the show is about.* It's about clever writing. samuelng pinned that but failed to make it his thesis. I can't blame him, though - because who the hell are all these new characters? It's no wonder he says it's all about the doctor, that's the only character that we really *know* by the time Smith's magnum opus is due. *The disservice!*

[nevermind that it doesn't even seem to make any sense whatsoever. In a universe where there's no rules there's no need to be clever and craft a story, you can just throw a story out there and force it on people, I suppose]

But it's not about that, to the contrary. *It's not about the doctor.* It's about creating entertaining drama. The entire last episode was forced sentimental rubbish. Who are all these characters? What clever arc or angle was conceived? What the hell did I even watch?

Compare to RTD, who by no means - is not the greatest writer of our ages - yet his version of the show poked fun at itself with overly cheesy and ridiculous low budget manifestations because what it ran on was not action or an unending escalation of amped up (yet rehashed...) antics, but rather... **heart**.

Moffat is a man with super clever ideas. The angels. The silence. He comes up with these awesome things that fit great into the Who universe. But he's not an idea factory and he's lacking creativity, which, in my opinion, cements him as an inconsistent writer who just happened to write a few good episodes / plot arcs.",0,1389105426,null,0,1389106827,0,cejk4bd,t3_1ue0nw,t1_cejk4bd,t1_ceh4h8x,null,1431837633,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

However if in the time before the hearing the driver has notched up more than 12 points, a discretionary ban will be considered on the total. This means that a ban could be considered for someone who has, say, 15 or 18 points.

I imagine that in most of these cases, the drivers will have not been done for speeding, but for offences under s172 of the Road Traffic Act. This is where drivers fail to respond to a notice stating that they have been caught speeding/running a red light/using a mobile. The offence carries 6 penalty points and I have seen many cases where drivers just let the letters pile up accumulating many, many points in the process.

Where there are far in excess of 12 points, magistrates are recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines to exercise their discretion and impose a ban. However there will be times when they decide not to, for example in the case of people who require their car for work or looking after their families. This is especially the case letting their insurance expire accidentally) rather than offences where there is a direct danger to the public such as speeding.

If the court exercises its discretion and does not ban, it could lead to a whole load of more points before the driver comes back for a second hearing, hence all the drivers with a large number of points.

Plus, the DVLA can be very slow in sorting all of this out, making things even worse.

It certainly isn't as big as the gap in wealth and income that we see.

Also, if there were a level playing field from birth then it would be a true meritocracy far more so than it is now. The wealth of your parents determines your final class, moving up or down 2 rungs of the social hierarchy is pretty uncommon ; moving up or down 3 might as well be a fairy tale. Unless there is something intrinsically better about rich people, I'm pretty sure we can agree that something else is at work here.

I remember a comment on reddit, that I wish I had saved, written by a a guy that went to public school.

Both are high risk / high reward, as neither has PL experience and both would demand quite a price tag.

Rhodes was last sold for 8 million pounds to Blackburn in the summer of 2012 and been scoring a lot for them so they will probably only sell for more than what they payed for him. 

Finnbogason has reportedly raised interest from the likes of Everton, Newcastle and AC Milan and Heerenveen manager Marco van Basten has said he will not come cheaply. 

If Defoe is sold to Toronto he will still play for us until March, so that would give either of them some time to settle, but Levy might not be keen to buy another young player untested in the PL at this stage.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"None of these things happens in a vacuum. I agree with you that upheavals are necessary. The thing is *they happen*. Regularly. The point then is that a group that has put in the effort to slowly build their base will have a good shot at eventually getting their chance. No group suddenly appears out of nowhere to take control of a government, because they'd get shot down instantly. But groups do build their base and stand ready to take advantage.

By the time the Bolsheviks got their chance, the Czar had already abdicated, and the reformist socialist SR party led the government. The February 1917 revolution had come and gone - Lenin got there two months late. 

But the Bolsheviks had spent 20+ years building a party organisation designed from bottom up almost like a military unit, with extensive experience in subversion and propaganda. And they had spent just as long working on their influence amongst workers in the big cities. 

Without that, they'd have been an insignificant little group of revolutionaries in cities awash with revolutionaries (with assorted splits, there were at least 4-5 self proclaimed revolutionary socialist parties vying for influence in Russia after the fall of the Czar) squabbling over day to day policy. There was no Czarist government to overthrow anymore. The sitting government was elected. 

Despite that, Lenin came back to the country to a situation where the Bolsheviks had the influence to set up their own parallel power structures in the Soviets (workers councils, independent of the parliament) and eventually start grabbing power. Germanys desire to get Russia out of the war (and hence allow Lenin to travel unimpeded through Germany), and the SR led governments weaknesses just provided an opportunity many of them had been working towards for their entire adult life.

I think we're in agreement for the most part, perhaps different on the relative importance. I see the major upheavals as mostly inevitable - a movement that is growing its influence has quite decent odds of being at or near its peak influence during some crisis or other. The question is not so much if there'll be a crisis as whether or not a given movement will manage to build support enough to take advantage of one (SR and the Mensheviks and several other groups were just as present in Russia in 1917, through crisis after crisis, but they were not nearly as well prepared, and soon they were amongst the oppressed).

There are a few different types of life assurance policy. The main ones are either term life, or whole of life. Term provides cover for a fixed term (typically 10-30 years), whereas whole of life cover will provide a (mostly) guaranteed payout upon your death, and subsequently is likely to be more expensive. 

There are a few sub categories of term assurances, differentiated by the benefit terms. A flat or level term policy comes with a fixed and pre-agreed payout. A decrease term policy will pay a diminishing benefit as the term progresses, making this type of policy ideal if you are interested in covering your mortgage or other debts should you die prematurely. 

I would suggest that you first decide why you want cover and what benefit you are looking for. This should make your comparison easier. 

I'm no expert, although I have studied life assurances at a professional level so I'll try to help if you have further questions.

The above was more of a rant about the term and underlying
concept of being ""anti-science"" as used in the media and as
demonstrated in this thread.  I am sick of accusations of
anti-science (... hate the term) being made against anyone who is
in opposition to some project when it is blatantly obvious the
person making the accusation is quoting some press release and
has no real knowledge of the matter (for the record, I
don't know anything about nuclear vs coal). Thoroughly unscientific deification of capital s
Science.

There are situations where the term is correctly used (homoeopathy)
however things like energy planning are so large in scope,
dependent on so many factors and have so many different solutions
that blanket accusations of being unscientific are ridiculous.

But back to the Greens. As I said earlier, I am not involved in
the green movement and base my opinion on the Scottish Greens who
are distinct from those of England and Wales. Maybe the
accusation towards the English &amp; Welsh greens is justified, however I think there is a great deal
of parroting going on regardless.


&gt;Beyond this, your numbers don't exist. 

No, they don't. 

I provided a example where a problem could have two different
solutions. I made no attempt at scientific arguments, I was only
giving the outlines for ideological ones from which a scientific
approach could be applied and different outcomes reached. The
point I want to make is that science does not offer One True
Solution. Two different proposals **can** stand opposed to each
other, both backed up by scientific reasoning dependent on what
the priorities are. 

Say you need to cross a river. You can swim or you can build a
bridge. Is saving time more important than keeping your hair dry?
Is there one, and only one, true solution?

Its usually death/rape threats and its usually over a period of time. Here's the relevant bits (bolding mine) but its worth the read in my opinion:

&gt;THIS SUMMER, CAROLINE CRIADO-PEREZ became the English-speaking Internet’s most famous recipient of online threats after she petitioned the British government to put more female faces on its bank notes. (When the Bank of England announced its intentions to replace social reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on the £5 note, Criado-Perez made the modest suggestion that the bank make an effort to feature at least one woman who is not the Queen on any of its currency.) **Rape and death threats amassed on her Twitter feed too quickly to count, bearing messages like “I will rape you tomorrow at 9 p.m … Shall we meet near your house?”**
&gt; 
&gt; Then, something interesting happened. Instead of logging off, Criado-Perez retweeted the threats, blasting them out to her Twitter followers. She called up police and hounded Twitter for a response. Journalists around the world started writing about the threats. As more and more people heard the story, Criado-Perez’s follower count skyrocketed to near 25,000. Her supporters joined in urging British police and Twitter executives to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; Under the glare of international criticism, the police and the company spent the next few weeks passing the buck back and forth. Andy Trotter, a communications adviser for the British police, announced that it was Twitter’s responsibility to crack down on the messages. Though Britain criminalizes a broader category of offensive speech than the U.S. does, the sheer volume of threats would be too difficult for “a hard-pressed police service” to investigate, Trotter said. Police “don’t want to be in this arena.” It diverts their attention from “dealing with something else.”
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, Twitter issued a blanket statement saying that victims like Criado-Perez could fill out an online form for each abusive tweet; when Criado-Perez supporters hounded Mark Luckie, the company’s manager of journalism and news, for a response, he briefly shielded his account, saying that the attention had become “abusive.” Twitter’s official recommendation to victims of abuse puts the ball squarely in law enforcement’s court: “If an interaction has gone beyond the point of name calling and you feel as though you may be in danger,” it says, “contact your local authorities so they can accurately assess the validity of the threat and help you resolve the issue offline.”
&gt; 
&gt; In the weeks after the flare-up, Scotland Yard confirmed the arrest of three men.

Should I look at what I can pay on a monthly basis or what the final pay out amount is?

Also should both of us get insurance or a joint policy? I worry about a joint policy because it pays if one of us dies and then the coverage is over and the pay out tends to be smaller. But to get the same coverage on us both would be a higher cost.

Scotland leaving would probably restart the idea of devolving power out of that area and across the country - certainly in [the north](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-blog/2013/jul/26/scottish-independence-northeast-england).

It's from quite a partisan site, but [this image](http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/samaritans1.jpg) shows the effect that removing Scottish votes would have on the UK general election outcome. Over the last 67 years those votes changed the result exactly twice (the size of majority did change, but in general most governments get most of their legislation through irrespective of the size of their majority: that they have one is all that counts).

Am I misinterpreting this to mean there are people who think that Tennant's pre- and post- Doctors were different, the way Nine and Ten (or any other two Doctors) are different? I don't see that anywhere in his performance.

&gt;And the Doctor has often ended up in situations which could result in permanent death; regeneration isn't a guarantee against every form of trauma.

From an audience standpoint, I don't think there has ever been a situation in the entire five decades where there was any real danger that the Doctor would not regenerate. Part of that is the conceit of dramatic works - central (not just major, but central, as in 'the name of the show') characters are almost never killed. Sherlock, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Superman come to mind, but they were all resurrected in one fashion or another.

I agree heavy devolution is probably the best idea, as I suspect the issue that English politicians pussyfoot around is the fact that we need Scotland, too; not the other way around as they so aggressively like to say.

The problem is that if you're at the point where so much power is being devolved, it raises the question ""why not become independent anyway?""

I see things like the NHS, education and housing as being closely tied to government - all of these things are already devolved to Holyrood (correct me if wrong), and in some cases I'd argue that the policies/services they provide are even better.

If the idea of being in a ""foreign"" country worries you, how so? You speak the same language and most Brits share some or at least appreciate the culture of Scotland.

In the first 20 min he made one great counter attack from our side after a corner, laid off several passes to Cissohko on the left wing, continued his run several times and was in the attacking 18 yrd box to receive many passes. Headers to Alberto and layoffs to Aspas in the attacking 18? Yep. Winning corners for us? Yep. In place to receive headers on the goal line? Yep. Open and left asking for passes on top of the 18? Yep. In our defensive 3rd of the field? Yep. This all just happened in front of my eyes. Just watch the first 15 min of the game.

I would say Germany was more militaristic/agressive than other powers. This is seen in the appointment of agressive commanders to senior roles such as Admiral Tirpitz becoming head of the navy. I'd also ask which other countries were the instigators of as many international crises as Germany was.

On the Schlieffen Plan. Yes every country had a plan of some sort. However a key point of tge Schliffen Plan was that *its basic premise was the need to strike first. The British and French plans were both conceived as reactions to German invasion.

If they gave A-H a blank cheque just as a form of brinksmanship why did they not accept proposals for a diplomatic conference. The whole point of brinksmanship is that you force opponents to negotiate. Not that you declare war. Furthermore the agreement was a private one so it did not have value as a threat.

On your claim Germany couldn't accept negotiation from Britian I would point out they had done so before in the Morocco Crises. In those cases they had accepted arbitration. Also even if I accept your reasoning the fact Germany couldn't step down due to pride this doesn't clear Germany. It just means the war was started by their obstinacy.

When you claim no historian has ever blamed the war squarely on Germany you're wrong. I would point you towards the eminent Fritz Fischer who saw WWI as a German war of agression. Of course these ideas can be challenged but claiming no historian has made them isnt true.

Finally yes Germany did not want war with Britain. It miscalculated on that point, howver their agression frightened Britain into war. Furthermore this still leaves them as the prime instigators of the war with France.

&gt;The **Assured Shorthold Tenancy** is the default tenancy for most dwellings in England and Wales. It is a form of Assured tenancy with limited security of tenure, which was introduced by the Housing Act 1988, with important changes made by the Housing Act 1996. The assured shorthold tenancy is now the most common form of arrangement which involves a private Residential Landlord renting a property to a Tenant.

Spent my formative years in a marxist organization, so I early had to take a view on the Russian Revolution, since, as the joke goes, when two marxists meet they'll have three different views on what marxism involves. And the Russian Revolution is high on the list of contentious subjects. 

In my position the October revolution was a coup, the Leninist party model fundamentally flawed as it practically invited wannabe dictators to take advantage, and Lenin made a fundamental mistake when he ignored basic marxist theory in his eagerness for a revolution - Marx already in 1845 outlined his reasons why  in his view a well developed capitalist economy was an absolute pre-requisite for a successful socialist revolution, and of course Russia did not have one (this places me as a ""left communist"" - see also Lenins ""Left Communism - An infantile disorder"" - or liberalist socialist, depending on who you ask and the phases of the moon.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"His time should have come fucking months ago. He had that brilliant performance in Europa and fucking everyone thought that was the chance to give him a good run of games in the PL, but nope, back as an unused fucking substitute.

Townsend and Lennon combined have two goals and zero assists. I realize the assist statistic isn't without its flaws but you would hope by now one of them would have created something of note.

At this point I just don't know how useless our attacking players have to be to get Lamela a run of games. Lennon and Townsend have both looked decent at times, yet I feel like Lamela would have at the very least doubled the current goal production coming from that position. Now that we're playing with two up front we don't even really have a good system for him to thrive in so I don't see it getting better under Tim Sherwood (who seems to be getting us linked with players like Shane Long and Steven Fletcher). 

Why are we willing to let certain players persist in the side through some growing pains but not others? Why was Townsend given like 10 full matches in a row all while producing fuck all other than some vaguely threatening dribbles and a penalty dive or two? 

Unless there are some Giovani dos Santos drunken shenanigans going on, I'd say we're on the cusp of botching this one completely.  

I've asked this many times. How the fuck can one adjust to the Premier League without actually fucking playing in it? Are our managers under so much pressure that they can't even risk developing young talent for fear of losing their job?

That's every politican ever though.  Those that want to be in power are not the people you want there; true whatever colour their lapel rosette is.

Every coalition will require the least influential party to compromise on some of their policies, otherwise the country would grind to a halt.  You think the Greens wouldn't sell out some of their environmental policies to get a seat at the table?  

&gt;They've completely reversed their position on almost everything.

This is partly bad luck / timing; Cable was the guy to look to in his Business role, he had the will and clout to do some good - but he fucked all that up by publicly saying he had it in for the Murdochs.  Once he was out the picture, the Tories were bound to be all over the Lib Dems.  I think Cable could have really forced some concessions from the Tories and made it a more balanced coalition. 

I thought the coalition could be a good thing, some Lib Dem social policies mixed with some Tory sanity over Trident and Europe, but hey-ho.

Given Argentina's track record the fairest solution would be to tell them to fuck off. That way they can concentrate on domestic issues, and the falklands can continue not being slaughtered or pushed out of their homes. Is that not fair?

And Hong Kong had little to do with resources. Their strength is their financial sector... Getting rid of them was hardly fair either, we screwed over the people living there just to please China.

But you admit it wasn't and there really wasn't anywhere near the amount of compromise there should've been.

Most politicians are in it for the power, and end up breaking their promises, but some more than others. The things the lib dems are currently voting into law, are against many of their core principles. Most lib dem voters feel completely betrayed. 

Completely agree about Cable, it's a shame his honesty cost him so dearly. 
He had integrity, good ideas, and during the tv debates he was a clear winner. If only he was the party leader things could be so different right now.

&gt;Every coalition will require the least influential party to compromise on some of their policies

That's better than no compromise, and I'd hope whoever was in coalition would learn, from the what is going to be the lib dem's worst election in years.

edit: I see now what you are referring to. From Wikipedia:

&gt; From the 2013-14 season, Premier League clubs cannot make a loss of more than £105 million over a three season period (including 2013-14, 2014–15 and 2015–16) which is an average of £35 million per year. Any club that loses more than £105 million in that time faces possible point deductions while clubs making any loss up to the £105 million limit will come under tighter financial scrutiny from the Premier League. Clubs are restricted on how much of the Premier League Central Funds they receive that they can spend on player wages. The limit is £4 million in 2013-14, £8 million in 2014-15 and £12 million in 2015-16. However this only applies to clubs that have a wage bill higher than £52 million per year in 2013-14, £56 million in 2014-15 and £60 million in 2015-16.",0,1389126046,null,0,1389126306,0,cejt4s1,t3_1umo3b,t1_cejt4s1,t1_cejstsq,null,1431841950,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I hate to say it, because Petr is the reason I started following Chelsea, but we need to think about our future and Thibaut needs to feel like he is a valuable player for us. He will have offers from everywhere and we need to make sure he will stay with us and will want to stay long-term.

true,theterminizer,num24,,"I've told this story before so apologies if you've heard it. Hi, I'm one of those American fans. I live in Portland, Oregon, home of the Timbers. My interest in soccer mostly began with the 2006 World Cup (though I followed the national team somewhat as a teenager in the 90s, in the days of Alexi Lalas and Cobi Jones and Tony Meola), I started going to Timbers games in '07 and I watched the 2010 WC intently, even scheduling my honeymoon around the final rounds (going to bars at 9am and the like).

I'd tried for a long time to take an interest in the PL, but it was so hard without any sort of connection. Both sides of my family are originally from Wales so I've always had an interest in all things Welsh, and would watch the national team when I could. I first saw Gareth Bale play against Scotland when he took over the game and essentially won it singlehandedly. I was completely amazed by him and loved seeing such a supremely talented Welsh player.

Right about the same time, Clint Dempsey moved to Spurs, joining Brad Friedel. There you had the best American playing overseas (Dempsey), another American who was one of the longest tenured players in Premier League history (Friedel), and the best Welsh player all on the same team. For the first time in my life, there was an English team that had a group of players I actually cared about and wanted to see succeed.

I took my first trip to Britain in August and got tickets to the home opener. Tickets went on sale on July 25th, at which time Bale and Dempsey were still on Spurs. I arrived in London on August 5th, three days after news broke that he was leaving Spurs, and not just leaving Spurs, but heading to the team I hate more than any other on the face of the earth, Seattle.  Meanwhile, rumors were swirling around Bale, but I simply could not believe it was going to happen. Every day I checked the news and there was nothing for days. He was missing practices and friendlies with vague injuries but a transfer was never confirmed. Day after day I waited but as match day approached, it was clear that transfer or no, he wasn't going to be in the lineup. And of course Friedel had long since been replaced by Lloris.

Having followed them for a year, played a ton of FM as them and gotten to know the entire squad from top to bottom, I realized that it was no longer about a handful of players but that I had developed a real connection with the team and seeing them in person just cemented that. I can't really explain it; I'd tried to support PL teams before but I'm not the kind of person who can rationalize myself into liking a team. It either happens or it doesn't, and something about them just stuck with me. I liked the makeup of the squad, I liked the style of football they played, and in some ways, getting stuck in at the time I did, when the team was undergoing such a radical transformation, I felt like I was getting in on the ground floor with them, rather than just latching onto an established squad. I was going to grow as a fan with the team. I stuck with them when my favorite players left, I stuck with them through the turmoil of the early season, and it'll make it all the sweeter to have supported them through the tough times when they inevitably right the ship.",0,1389131218,null,0,false,0,cejvrgr,t3_1uls2e,t1_cejvrgr,t3_1uls2e,null,1431843244,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

In my opinion, this is divisive where it would be better to drop arbitrary labels and discuss policy based on merit rather than blind loyalty to party ideologies.

&gt;In a series of tweets, writing under a pseudonym, Sorley told Criado-Perez to ""f*** off and die you worthless piece of crap"", adding ""go kill yourself"" and ""rape is the last of your worries"". Another of his messages said: ""I've only just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried!""

&gt;In a separate set of messages sent to Criado-Perez, the court heard, Nimmo said to her, ""shut up bitch"", and ""ya not that gd looking to rape u be fine"", followed by ""I will find you [smiley face]"" and then the message ""rape her nice ass"".

The court heard that Nimmo also targeted the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy with the message: ""The things I cud do to u  [smiley face]"", calling her ""dumb blond bitch"".
&gt;Alison Morgan, prosecuting, said that Criado-Perez had received abusive messages from 86 Twitter accounts including those accounts attributed to Nimmo and Sorley.

&gt;Morgan told the court: ""[She] has suffered life-changing psychological effects from the abuse which she received on Twitter. In particular the menacing nature of the tweets sent by both defendants caused her significant fear that they would find her and carry out their threats.""

Threats should be taken seriously and considered reason for an investigation, but a single instance of a vague, poorly worded tweet should not be grounds for a prison sentence. If you were able to gather data on every death threat on the Internet and every death threat on the Internet which was carried out, I expect most 12-year-olds on their Xbox or trolls posting anonymously don't follow through. 

If it had purely been insults the police should have had nothing to do with it, unfortunately death threats with similar juvenile intent fall under the same category as letters written in shit on human skin detailing a murder plot.

&gt;I can easily give you dozens of things saying UK is not that superior, starting with its weather.

Our weather is good. Bit of flooding now and then. But no hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, tornados, earthquakes, volcano's or other devastating weather or environmental phenomena.

I'm with the high-horsers on this one, indicating should be second nature, *especially* on a route you're familiar with. Yeah sure it's not life and death if you don't indicate, but it's just a considerate thing to do, and there's no real reason not to.

As for the Oldham game I don't think him being subbed was a statement about his skill or lack thereof.

BR wanted a central playmaker to pull strings and make creative passes to the offense. Moses isn't meant for that, he is meant to carry the ball down the wing and send it in or lay off to Cissokho and get in the middle himself. He did perfectly fine for this task, and was subbed off for a team-wide change in strategy, not a player for player specific replacement. In contrast I think Aspas being subbed for Suarez was a one for one replacement, and a direct statement about Aspas by BR.

I'm, sure at one point Britain valued the family unit. Being in a relationship and having children demanded that you take responsibilities for your action, that you are steadfast in the face of troubles and that you persevere. 

These values have been eroded by liberalism and consumerism (corporations trying to sell us something). We are the generation that does what it wants without due consideration for consequences, is consumptive, self-centered and irresponsible.

Tesco  
Morisons  
Asda (I would put Asda and Morisons on par, Asda was bought by Walmart a few years ago, but it hasn't changed much.)

Most, if not all, of these have dedicated ""FreeFrom"" sections for allergy sufferes. Regardless all food items are required to have ingredients listed on them, and most have a special allergy warnings section. This means it is easy to check on foods in the rest of the shop.

Presumably his telepathic abilities.

You are entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks' holiday a year if you work full time, or a pro-rata amount if you work part time. This is called statutory holiday. This minimum includes bank holidays and public holidays (they aren't extra)

* https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights

Do the calculations here:

In your written contract, does it say that your holiday allowance is less than the statutory minimum? I'd be very surprised? Is this some U.S company which is unaware of UK employment law? Big company? Little company?

You have a few options. 

* Start looking for work elsewhere now - probably best to do anyway since these chaps don't sound like very nice employers.

* Once you're sure of your ground, you *could consider* chatting to your boss again, and explaining that you think it's best if you don't go with the holiday arrangements that he is proposing since they would place the company in the position of breaking the law by breaching   the 1998 Work Time Regulations, which implement the EU's Working Time Directive.

By 'party members' the Huffington Post wants you to imagine UKIP politicians, who are standing for election, or at least members of the party who have some amount of power or influence, and that these members have some sympathy for the BNP. 

This is not the case. They quote three people. The first is an influential figure, but he only quotes statistics of BNP votes, and says UKIP should now expect those votes. This does not mean that he agrees with the BNP's point of view, nor that he believes the party will pander towards these voters in particular. It's similar to how, I'd assume, Labour members discussed gaining votes from ex-Lib Dems after the coalition. I doubt they discussed changing their political stance to be more like the Lib Dems.

Yeah of course. As others have pointed out to you I will also say that of course I have been on the bloody tube.

Are you trolling? I am not implying that you are immature for not wanting to see genitals I am implying you are immature for making a big deal out it if you did. I don't *want* to see naked people walking around in public either - the difference is I don't really care if they choose to do so as it has no effect on me whatsoever.

&gt;Perhaps what you can't seem to grasp is that other people don't share your views on nudity...

My view is that it isn't a big deal. If someone is offended by nudity then they should look the other fucking way. Good god we have tits on page 3 of a national neewspaper and you are causing all this fuss about the remote possibility of seeing a naked person (read man) in public. *Get over yourself*. Also the votes are completely meaningless as I replied down in a grandfathered post - you will find main replies to OP espousing similar sentiments to me with many upvotes. If that matters...

&gt;I think we're done. I can't see you do anything besides try and justify your genitals and how everyone else should endure the sight and proximity of them. Good luck with that, but I think the consensus already is that in doing so you're taking away the choice of everyone else around you and that means you're one selfish son of a bitch. Good luck to you.

You are a bloody idiot incapable of abstracting out your argument to anything other than ""genitals in your face"". It is ridiculous.

1. To assuage the regional airports and gain traffic from other parts of the country there would need to be a direct high speed link north to the regions.

These would both be in addition to the proposed link to central London and, putting these two together, could provide an alternative route north to HS2.

true,sjhill,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"Right, let's see how much it actually costs to shoot one badger...

Start-up costs - couple of hundred quid for a FAC - paperwork needs done, copies of documents and so on.

Rifle, [according to this doc](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/200909/pb13922-shooting-guidance-20130517.pdf) it has to be .22 centrefire, sadly ruling out most .22lr rifles for £150 quid or so... so we're talking something like [this .308](http://www.gunwatch.co.uk/guns/8805-Savage-Arms-111-for-sale) which is overspec for badgers, but you could also hunt deer with it... so that's £300. In addition, let's say £50 for a couple of boxes of ammunition, to get you comfortable with the weapon, so we're up to about 6 or 7 hundred quid.

Now, I can't just go busting caps one someone else's land, so I need (ideally, written) permission to shoot, usually this is free, but let's say it costs a bit of money for their time and my time to arrange this... £30 an hour, each, because we can, and I'm pulling numbers out of my arse, so we're up to £800 tops (I've thrown in a bit of petrol there too). 

Any half competent land owner will know where badgers tend to live, so it should hopefully cut your canvassing times down, so let's say you charge a day rate of £300 - obviously you're not guaranteed to get a badger on your first visit, so let's say 3 days... £!000 or so, including travel, some pies, some more ammunition...

One badger, plus startup costs £2k tops, with subsequent badgers at, say £1000 a head, would still be cheaper than whatever the government have come up with.

I should also say, as a scientist, and farmer's grandson, the badger / cattle tb thing is mostly bullshit, and foxes are more of a menace to livestock than badgers.",0,1389138905,null,0,false,0,cejzfo8,t3_1um9us,t1_cejzfo8,t3_1um9us,null,1431845020,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

the fact that people would have sherwood rather then louis van gaal, who is a fucking god father of football managing astounds me. as much as i have enjoyed the change in the past couple weeks give me van gaal at the end of the season all day long.

And fwiw, I agree with him. Immigration is about economics AND society. Immigration certainly helps the country economically, but it can cause social problems and upset a lot of people if it isn't managed properly.

Lloris's biggest strength is not his ability to deny a goal, but his ability to deny a goal scoring opportunity before there even is one. He's so fast off his line that he stops what would be clear cut chances against other keepers. However, what this means, coupled with the high line we've played, is that when players do get a chance on goal, it tends to be a very easy one. Most of the goals that Lloris has given up this season are goals that no keeper would've stopped. He might not have the save numbers, but I would say that Lloris has prevented more goals than any other keeper in the league (not in total, because then keepers with a ton of saves behind shitty defenses would obviously be highest. More of a ""Goals prevented above average"" type situation. American baseball fans will understand that more than most).

&gt; A recent statute - the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 - provides a scheme where those who had been convicted of the section 11 offence (and similar offences) can apply for their entire criminal records to be removed if the facts of the case would no longer count as a crime. It would be as if the offence had not been committed at all. These are not pardons – they go much further: the 2012 scheme removes the taint of criminality altogether, and with no fussing about not affecting the conviction or the sentence.

&gt;But the 2012 scheme is only for those still alive. However, there is no good reason why it cannot be applied retrospectively. It would have the merit of consistency. And if the concern is that some convicted under section 11 (for example those being grossly indecent in a public place) would be wrongly exonerated, then perhaps a similar requirement for an application could be put in place.

&gt;Turing’s conviction was just one of about 75,000 under a vindictive law. But here is no logical reason why his should be regarded as a unique case. The actual wrong done to Turing was also one done to many thousands of men, and so any righting of that wrong must apply to those men too.

&gt;If Alan Turing is to be pardoned then so should all men convicted under section 11 if the facts of their cases would not be a crime today. But a better posthumous gesture would be to simply extend the 2012 scheme to all those who are now dead. Removing the criminal records completely of all those prosecuted who would not be prosecuted today on the same facts would be a better legislative gesture than a single statutory pardon, if there is to be a legislative gesture at all.

http://www.newstatesman.com/david-allen-green/2013/07/putting-right-wrong-done-alan-turing

So that everyone who was convicted under the law has the conviction overturned. I don't know if anyone convicted under it is still alive today, but even if they aren't there will be some relatives or friends of theirs that certainly will be, and no longer having their relative or friend being registered as a convicted criminal for something that should never have been a crime in the first place is not silly. 

It's also about showing that homosexuality is in no way a punishable offence and strongly condemning the countries past criminalization of it. It's not like this law was in place hundreds of years ago; the Sexual Offences Act decriminalizing homosexual acts only came into place in 1967, and even then both partners had to be 21; it was only in 2000 that the age of consent was equalized regardless of sexual orientation.

It's a bit different to other convictions for what are no longer crimes in that it was criminalizing an entire demographic of people, and was within living memory for some people. If there are other convictions that criminalized things in a similar way then they should definitely be overturned, but it doesn't mean that convictions for a trivial action in the 1700's that would no longer be considered a crime needs to be sought out and overturned.",0,1389141248,null,0,1389144728,0,cek0iir,t3_1umhej,t1_cek0iir,t1_cejtkz8,null,1431845515,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

and I cant think of one id agree with, furthermore the problem only comes when society decide they have a right to demand to not be offended

and the idea that you have to follow whatever rules a majority place upon you is exactly what leads to this kind of protest, if someone said they found your breathing offensive you wouldn't hold your breath while you try to convince them it's acceptable, you would quite rightly tell them to go fuck themselves and carry on breathing

I too am saying that FPTP is an awful voting system. It is simply a matter of fact that not all votes are equal in the UK. I just gave Bournmouth as an example based on your flair. You probably could find somewhere in Scotland where the vote was worth more (although probably in a fight between Lib, Lab and SNP rather than Con so less interesting in terms of deciding who forms the Government). Shitty FPTP.

&gt;Would an independant Scotland still use FPTP? 

No. See [616](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/9348/15)

The devolved parliment currently uses [AMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Member_System) and would continue to.

&gt;FPTP is a flawed voting system that I'm all for changing, IMO it would be easier to change with Scotland's liberal/left-leaning votes.

The AV referendum is been and gone. It is all very well to talk about Scotland remaining in the union to assit in taking it in a different direction, but what is the reform being proposed? Where is it going to come from? If the threat of dissolution wasn't sufficient to start talking about federalism, what will be?

However, we have a goalkeeper in Courtois that is already on our books, contractually obligated to play for us, on a comparable level to Cech (with the undeniable potential to be one of the best keepers of the decade), and your best way to deal with the selection dilemma between him and Cech is to sell Courtois in the hopes that Blackman will get better or that we can buy Courtois back in the future?

We have to plan for the future and Courtois is our future in goal.

I think the best, or at least easiest, way forward is to bring Courtois back and have him and Cech share the goalkeeping burdens (league vs. cup matches, etc.) and evaluate their performances and let the best player play. If it happens that Courtois displaces Cech then so be it. I hope Cech would accept a less-vital role in the club. It would be great if he could become basically a player-coach and help in Courtois' development.

Caught me out there, I'd forgotten that. AMS is what I've always wanted the UK to have :(

The AV referendum was a Tory plan to propose a confusing voting system that's arguably no better than FPTP. They knew it would never pass.
It's nothing like the reform lib dems proposed. But reform is being proposed, and there is support for it across all parts of the UK. The majority voted against the conservatives, and Scotland leaving is going to reduce that majority.

Gerrymandering is where constituency boundaries are intentionally changed to improve a particular parties votes, it doesn't really apply here. I intentionally used the non-partisan words ""liberal/left-leaning"", not labour.

And you've ignored my previous point about protesting, petitions, etc. The Scottish can still make a difference to the country, and in general I'd like you to, the fact that you already use AMS for your devolved parliament shows the progressiveness of the Scottish people.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;I'm talking about global power. The West is a declining global force, Europe and America are stagnant and facing debt crises. Putin told us we couldn't invade Syria, and Iran is laughing at us. Russia, China, Iran, and South America are the new power centres.

I appreciate China is a rising power and ultimately holds the balance on a lot of international issues, but go back 10 years and they and every other country you've named were vastly behind the west on every level.

The UK's influence is declining - but at no less of a rate than the rest of the western world. The rising nations mean a redistribution of sorts, we don't need to be involved as much because there's more nations available to help. This spread obviously causes nations, like the US and UK, to have their sphere's of influence reduced. But there is a difference between that and the relevance of a country. It isn't becoming less relevant; no more than America isn't becoming less relevant.

What we offer to the world in terms of geographical location, culture, political influence, intelligence services, military specialisation and a whole host of other services is paramount to our influence and last time I checked, none of that has changed drastically.


&gt;The UK is running out of oil and ramping up poverty rapidly. Half of the country is an economic wasteland, the other half is ready to go rioting as soon as the fuse is sparked again.

So many people are already saying goodbye to Mata because we've hit a good run of form and he's hardly featured. But as soon as we hit a poor run of form, I guarantee people will want him back in the side. If injuries start to hit, he'll be back in the side.

It may be expensive to put up all the 25kV infrastructure, but the actual electrical supply is much much more efficient. Now I see why they want third-rail gone ASAP.

Thank you for all the links, they were really interesting reads.  
That first *Has third rail had its day?* article from the Rail Engineer appears to imply that a lot of 750VDC equipment will be life-expired within ten years... and Network Rail are seriously considering a full 25kV upgrade instead of sinking more money on DC equipment.  
Assuming the Basingstoke 'electric spine' pilot goes to plan, is it realistic to think the entire rest of the Southern Region can be upgraded that quickly? Picturing the regional railway lines surrounding me, that's masses and masses of entirely new infrastructure on tracks and in tunnels that have never had overhead cables before.

The other interesting thing about the 'electric spine' pilot is that at the moment, all passenger Southampton-London Waterloo traffic is third-rail all the way. Does this mean they will have to use dual-voltage trains and switch to pantograph use at Basingstoke? This already happens on First Capital Connect's Brighton-Bedford *Thameslink* services (at London Blackfriars, iirc), I guess.

But - about two and a half miles outside of Southampton Central towards Basingstoke, so on the new Electric Spine route - the *Coastway West* line to Portsmouth and Brighton branches off. That is also entirely third-rail at the moment, and Southern's trains are not equipped for dual-voltage work. Not only that, there's no convenient station like Basingstoke to stop at to raise/lower pantographs. (The junction is at St. Deny's, but few fast trains bother calling there).  
Maybe the easiest thing to do is to put up 25kV wires for the Electric Spine freight pilot, but keep the existing 750VDC third rails below for current passenger services.

The £27,000 you mentioned may be true, but doing this criminal work is the way young barristers cut their teeth and pay their dues before going on to earn much, much larger salaries.

The same is true of many other highly paid professions, such as medicine. I too have experienced this. Advertising is generally regarded as a well to highly paid job, but my first few years as a junior copywriter paid me a whopping £10,500 a year. I knew one junior team who worked for a premier league agency in London who were paid just £6,500 a year. They will not be earning that salary now, I can assure you. This is the nature of many professional positions. Put up with a few years of shit for the rewards to come later.

With barristers, this is called 'pupillage', and there is nothing new about this whatsoever. The pay has always been relatively low for pupillage (although it can be as high as £35-45,000 pa). This only lasts for six months by the way (the first of the 'sixes'). In the pupil's second six months, they can start earning from their own work. This is when they start to get a taste of those much bigger incomes. This is not news, and I find it shocking that this generally lefty subreddit is starting to cry into its beer on behalf of fucking barristers.

Take a look around reddit, on news sites (in the comments) etc. and you'll see people constantly attacking each other for being 'left wing' or 'right wing'. It inhibits debate and discussion and turns it into 'us vs them'. That is counter-productive in a democratic society based on rational production of policies.

3. Yes, they do believe these to be the best options in Westminster. But when these ideas are discussed outside of Westminster, by people who have only a passing interest in politics, the labels 'left wing' and 'right wing' inhibit debate based on the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of doing things, and instead reduce the argument to 'right vs left'.

My argument is specifically against the use of labels, by non-Parliamentarians, to describe an entire person's political views. I argue this because these labels do not contribute in a positive way to political debate in my opinion, because it detracts from the discussion of policy and instead turns into argument devoid of reason, based on dogma and party loyalty.",0,1389145289,null,0,false,0,cek2djs,t3_1ukdsc,t1_cek2djs,t1_cejyaa4,null,1431846542,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Zero Room was used by the Fifth Doctor following the regeneration of his fourth incarnation. In order to generate enough power to break free of Event One, part of the structure of the TARDIS needed to be ejected. Unfortunately, the Zero Room was one of the areas destroyed. Using the remaining walls of the room, Nyssa was able to construct the Zero Cabinet. It had the same properties as the room, which allowed the Doctor to continue recuperating while he was within it. Nyssa and Tegan found the cabinet light enough to carry, in part because the Doctor used levitation to negate his own weight. However, if the Doctor did not concentrate on keeping himself levitated, the cabinet became heavy and would plummet to the ground. (TV: Castrovalva)

You cannot compare unilateral decisions to militarily intervene/invade another country with the eventual occupation of an aggressor country at the end of the war that they started.

Add a sprinkle of either dill or chives (entirely up to your own tastes) and a pinch of cayenne pepper. 

Then, add a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice, blitz more. Add 4 tablespoons of thick double cream and blitz for one final time for at least a minute. 

The double cream will whip quite nicely, making the consistency smooth and almost mousse like. 

Line a bowl with clingfilm, then line that with smoked salmon strips (optional, but adds a nice touch), and empty the mixture from the blender into it. 

Smooth it out flat as you can, then put clingfilm over the top, press down gently and put it in the fridge for at least 4 hours. It'll set as it chills. 

Once it's set, take out the fridge, get a plate slightly larger than the bowl you've put the salmon butter in, take the top layer of clingfilm off, put the plate on top, tip the whole lot upside down and give the remaining clingfilm a gentle tug to turf it out.

Not saying he (Bertrand) **will**, just that it's more possible than most people here seem to think. Not every player looks like a superstar right away. Some players need time to grow and settle in and I think if Bertrand is eventually given a solid run of games he will step up and impress. When Cole got injured last season and Bertrand had a guaranteed left-back spot for a few matches until Cole returned, I thought Bertrand looked very good on the attack, and solid **most** of the time in defense.

In short, the fact that you are interested in QPR at all tells me that you are not obsessed with finding a team of mercenary players and fans that cry if their teams do not qualify for Europe every year.  You, my friend, are looking for the full football experiences.  Welcome to QPR, and be prepared for a ride that will take you from maniacal highs and gut punching lows, to absolute shell shocked moments of disbelief.  Like promotions?  Demotions? Board room intrigues?  Brushes with financial calamity? Strange personalities?  Guns being brandished in the board room?  Kung-fu fights against the Chinese national team?  Welcome to the greatest team in football, a true life-long passion.

Like you, I am an American.  I started following QPR in 1985, totally by accident.  I am a huge fan of the The Who and bought Pete Townshend's *White City* album as soon as it hit the shelves and was immediately struck by this line: 

&gt; Down to the refuge, near QPR, I drive to committees in my German car

I did not actually know what QPR was (and remember, no Internet and Google for random students in those days), but I was pretty sure it was something like ""Queen's public road"" (since he was driving on it).  I finally saw QPR listed in an English football magazine that I picked up in Harvard Square and decided, immediately, that they had to be my club.

I followed the team the only way that you could back then, occasional snippets in the papers or football magazines, but it seemed to get harder and harder as the team slowly drifted down to the third-tier in 2001.  While QPR's fortunes seem to be becoming more and more dire, a funny thing happened though, the Internet really made it much more possible (and fun) to follow a team, even from a distance.  All of a sudden there were fan groups and message boards, YouTube videos, and finally Reddits.

I can only tell you that I have never been more welcome on the Internet than dealing with Rs fans around the world.  Over time I have swapped beef jerky for jerseys and scarves and received packages of programs and Rs gear from wonderful folks.  I have still never made it to Loftus Road, but my boys are getting older and hope springs eternal.

true,serrapaladin,null,null,"Congrats on your offer. I was in a similar situation, having a conditional offer from Cambridge and several unconditional ones in the US. It's not quite as simple as accepting everything and choosing at the end, but you also don't need to worry about ending up nowhere. What you should do depends on whether or not Cambridge is your first choice.

Cambridge won't expect you not to pursue other options. If Cambridge is your first choice, you should definitely accept the offer and look for a backup. Since you will already have filled out a UCAS application, you could also apply to other schools in the UK. Depending on your subject, UCL, Imperial, LSE, Durham, Warwick and a few others are also excellent universities, probably comparable to US schools in the top ~15. The UCAS deadline for these is in mid-January, and most won't even ask for an interview. You can choose Cambridge as your primary offer and any one of these as a backup (with a lower condition on your AP scores).

Dealing with US universities is a bit more complicated, as they don't like students going back on offers. Most US schools will require you to accept your place well before August, so you'll need to accept your best US offer if you want to be safe. As opposed to Cambridge, most US colleges will require you to pay a non-refundable deposit to secure your place or have some fees for late withdrawal. If you meet your conditions and choose to go to Cambridge, you lose that deposit.

I reneged on my US offer in later July after having accepted it, and had to pay a fee for late withdrawal from my housing contract of $500. If you plan on stringing a US uni along until August, be prepared to pay some sort of fee if you end up going to Cambridge.

If your first choice is a US school, you should tell Cambridge that you won't be taking your place as soon you have been accepted at your first choice. Since UK A-level results are only released in mid-August, declining an accepted offer before that is usually no problem. With the ability to shift people around between colleges and accepting people that narrowly missed their conditional offers, Cambridge is somewhat more flexible.

Another option to consider is asking for deferred entry to your US uni of choice. That way, the worst thing that can happen to you is having to take a gap-year between school and university, in which you can travel/work.",0,1389156449,null,0,1389159281,0,cek7c8o,t3_1uo7qo,t1_cek7c8o,t3_1uo7qo,null,1431848882,7,false,cambridge,t5_2qh8u,7

true,HungryBook,cnty-uk,Insaniquarium,"Just to clarify from the above member's post - you should have a minimum of **28 paid annual leave days a year, which INCLUDES the bank holidays** - so you should have those 20 you can take anytime PLUS the 8 bank holidays.  If you are expected to work bank holidays, then your total entitlement should be stated as 28 days, not 20.  (Actually, on this front, the page on gov.uk mentions about '28 days' but then also goes on to say about bank holidays don't need to be paid - you might want to check with ACAS on that before quoting us all on here...)

Take a look here:  https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights
