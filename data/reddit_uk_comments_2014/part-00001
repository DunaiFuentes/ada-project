I'll go back to my original example of a man and woman only meeting each other after their child travels back in time to introduce them.  I just don't see how it can logically work.  The man and woman have to meet and have a child before that child can then travel back in time and start changing things.

I'm actually ok with the ending of the Christmas special because I can chalk that up to the timelords changing the Doctor's timeline - which we know they have the power to do.

So a 1 hour journey by car becomes over 2 hours by train.

They also don't seem too bothered that a large section of the country can be easily cut off by rail when it rains a bit (the junction near Exeter flooded again a couple of weeks ago, and that's with Network Rail closing the line to put in flood defences).

They're also not bothered that the line around Dawlish is frequently disrupted by the sea and that the line itself is at risk of falling into the sea eventually. If this was anywhere else they'd probably have a nice shiny new inland line. 

The government will ignore this (and the reports that suggest SW rail usage is through the roof) and build the white elephant to the north instead, however they will generously allow all of us to pay for it in our taxes and rail fares.

It's that it doesn't take into account the soul-destroying effects that mental illness can have. It's saying to someone suffering from depression ""Cheer up! Smile! Have a positive outlook on life"". Mental illness doesn't just sap away happiness, it saps away *rationality* and motivation, which is precisely what people need to execute plans like yours.

To someone with serious depression, emigrating to another country is probably pretty far down the list after ""getting out of bed"" and ""eating healthily""

*Now*, that's not to say that someone still shouldn't take responsibility for how they feel. Healthy eating, exercise etc. will help and with determination they can still make something of themselves.

Mental illness isn't just something to push out of the way to get to your goal, it's a weight strapped around your ankle that sucks you down and the heavier it gets, the harder it becomes to shake free from it.

I'm doing pretty well for myself now - self employed, bringing in an acceptable wage, decent skills - but there are still days where things just seem that much harder.

I guess if you're lucky enough to have the mental strength to push through (or have a good network of family and friends to support you), you can ""deal"" with such things in the best way you can. Others don't seem to be as fortunate to have the mental strength or personal connections to do this though. Some people would see unemployment as the ""trigger"" to make necessary life changes. Others might just retire into the dark and refuse to come out.

Especially if someone has the notion ""Nothing in life I do makes a difference"" embedded in their heads, it's hard to make life-changing decisions without the fear that you'll just be kicked back down again.

I don't know, it's a tricky one. ""Take control of your life"" is something everyone should try and do, and there certainly are ""lazy"" people who just don't want to make the necessary adjustments.

They get taken to A&amp;E.  Talk about the contrast.  From the paramedic who reads up about their medical history and understands that this isn't just the ordinary illness we get the triage nurse who is so badly managed, so poorly set up, that people with fractures are going ahead.  The patient is left to be violently sick.  They have now lost some of their medication, a stroke is now imminent, the systolic rises to over 200.  Nothing.   Fuck that hospital A&amp;E.

The point is the paramedics and the ambulance service were frankly brilliant.  But the A&amp;E was very poorly managed.

If you want to end it all, right now, take all the strenght you have to put some time between now and doing it.

Even just tell yourself you will do it in 5 minutes... Or you will do it at 7PM (cant kill yourself at 6:48 right?!)

This distancing yourself from the act was what made me book the flight and get the fuck out of there. Just putting some time between now and ending it all.

That being said, I agree a lot of serious moments with Tennant do bug me. However, rewatching the series again and again I came to the conclusion that his performance would have actually been fine with some stronger directing and a little more restraint with the writing.

Imagining Tennant acting under a more cinematic style like Smith got in his tenure really paints a whole different picture for how I would enjoy his acting. Likewise, the dialogue he got always felt so melodramatic and heavy handed. Again, some restraint in the writing would have done him wonders.

I think my favorite moment of his would be in *The Water of Mars*, the scene where he loses it and declares that the laws of time are his. He starts off low and ramps up very nicely to his last line ""they will obey me!"" where you can see he really loses himself in the moment. He put genuine strain into his voice for the line but didn't really *shout* it out, which was nice.

At which point I took 1 months u/e benefits whilst i found a new job. But i had been paying taxes for over a year by then, so I didn't feel too bad :D

As a side note, speaking English is a golden ticket in a lot of foreign countries.

The first job I got was a shitty temp job in a call centre calling English speaking countries, shitty job, but they needed native English speakers.. I was amply qualified.

Then I got some shitty cash in hand jobs teaching English where, again, the only qualification needed was ""is a native English speaker""

Eventually I learned enough German to land a job in an internet company working on a UK arm of a big German website.

true,tclayson,english,Cambs,"If you can afford to overpay your mortgage from the outset its probably better to reduce the term of your mortgage. Taking your example, a loan of £100k over 28 years at 4% (circa £500 a month) means you pay back £166,391. Overpaying by £20 a month brings that figure down to £161,169 and reducing your mortgage term to 26 years instead of 28 brings it down to £161,007. Not a significant difference, but the 2 years off your mortgage term might make a significant difference. You will pay off your debt much quicker.

Its a good idea to rely on an overpayment though when you think you can't afford a higher amount. You can set up an automatic overpayment and then just cancel it if you can't afford it anymore, or stop it around xmas when you could use the extra cash etc.

Don't worry if your mortgage doesn't have an overpayment option. Get the best rate you can, shorten the term as much as possible (whilst still keeping it affordable) and save what you would overpay each month.

One granddad suffered a stroke. It was a major one but it looked recoverable, it seemed to affect just his muscle control. In hospital he contracted Pneumonia, he didn't have the strength to fight it off and died. There was no post mortem, autopsy or tests of any kind carried out to determine what kind of infection he had to trigger the pneumonia.

Doing my own research found that Pneumonia is fairly common in stroke patients but it's very unusual for it to happen as quickly as it did after being admitted. Just weren't given enough information by the doctors and we'll never know if it was unavoidable or not.

Other granddad also had a stroke that had a severe impact on his mind (lost most of his ability to read and write, his speech was impacted and all his emotions were amplified in a way that made him almost childlike but with 70 years of memories) and he lived a good, happy life like this for around 10 years. He eventually got diagnosed with terminal cancer.

In the last few months, before the end-game hit and was moved to a hospice (cannot praise hospices enough, they provided a peaceful, dignified way of spending your final days and my relatives were treated with immense care), he had some spells in hospitals.

I'll probably never know the full details of what happened in those hospitals as it's a really tough subject for my dad but I do know some of the things. He was placed in a mixed ward which my grandad found utterly humiliating with some of the tests he had done and some of the things he needed help with, when he was due to be discharged, he fell to the floor when being moved from his bed, breaking bones and prolonging his stay. I don't have specifics but from what I've been able to get from my dad, throughout his entire stay my dad got the impression that the nurses didn't care for him and that he had to really strongly push to get nurses to provide him with basics (because of his stroke, he couldn't easily ask communicate to passing nurses).

I doubt that has much to do with it, because Canada has the same rule, and scores higher than the UK. Although I'm not sure whether you can trust the HDI, because America scores number three, which sounds like a lot of bullshit. They don't even have an implementation of universal health care like the NHS. Health care is predominately private. Furthermore, post secondary education costs aren't subsidized, which means going to university is astronomically expensive.

I spent a good ten to fifteen minutes explaining that there are far more twenty/thirty-somethings avidly keeping track of new trends, limited editions, regional exclusives, and rare smoke within the handmade cigar world. Mr.Hammond seemed to take great interest in this, though nothing of mention has been noted in the article, likely because it's contrary to the theme of the project he had been given.

&gt; Furthermore, I flat out didn't use the ""Failure"" quote at all. And the ""Wine"" quote, was more than a touch selective. We were discussing the fact that whilst there are unfortunately compartively fewer female cigar smokers than male, they tend to be some of the most knowledgable, as after all, they enjoy the same fine smokes that the men do - as Churchill would aptly of put it ""Easily impressed by the best"". I then jested that we all enjoy the same wine.

I could be wrong but I just don't think AVB was as egocentric as people make out. With Ade as well don't forget that his brother died and then he was injured, then Ade struggled to find a place in AVBs 4-2-3-1 system as Soldado and Defoe were already competing for that spot. 

Again with Eriksen, he started most matches then got injured but the pundits like to make out that AVB didn't like to play him at all and it's only Sherwood that's come in to right all AVBs wrongs.

Don't forget fees for the mortgage, solicitors, conveyancing, searches etc which can easily add another £1000 or more to the costs. The help to buy scheme may enable you to borrow a further £20k towards the deposit, but even then £70k doesn't go far in the UK especially down south. In my town you need about £100k to buy a grotty studio flat.

Rent is really a waste of money. The £700 you can save each month will be eaten up by rent, council tax, utility bills etc. Your best bet is to stay at home, keep saving and try to get a better paid job. You are not really in a position to buy now and if you move into rented accommodation you never will be (until your earnings increase significantly).

&gt; Perhaps there are fiscal benefits of immigration to the UK - but how does that trickle down to those seeking work or food or shelter?

In absolutely the usual way.  Immigrants to the UK pay far more in taxes than they claim in benefits, leading to the sad irony that some benefit-claiming people who'd like to see fewer immigrants are in fact benefiting directly from their presence.  


&gt; You may also be right that people wouldn't all try and live in one place

I don't think it's a maybe.  I think the fact that large countries such as the US have a distributed population, or the fact that not everyone in the EU has suddenly moved to Germany or whatever, makes the point fairly clear.


&gt; but so what? As a country we're sustaining hard times for all but the upper classes - that's no secret - so if we've established there are finite resources (and there are) then any increase in population without some large scale resolution of the aforementioned issues of food/shelter/work is going to put further strain on the situation.


You're asking some good questions about the intertwined issues of economic growth, population growth, natural resources, unequal resource distribution, etc.  These are problems the whole world will need to get a better grip on if we're to have a century less fucked-up than the last one.  But I fail to see why, for you, these issues seem to mitigate solely against continued immigration to the UK.  

The UK is a long way past being self-sufficient for food.  If for some reason we wanted to be self-sufficient for food we should have had radically different policies on population and agriculture some time ago.  But that's OK: we live in a world dominated by trade and we're happy to trade stuff we produce for food.  So I can't take your ""food"" point very seriously.

On ""shelter"" you have a point though.  The UK housing market is a mess; the way zoning and greenbelts work in this country is pretty much designed to protect the interests of those who already own a lot of real estate.  So I agree with you that any increase in the UK's population, whether it comes about through natural increase or immigration (which are roughly similar inputs at the moment, actually) will require, at the very least, serious reconsideration of our housing policy, with obvious spillover into the banking sector.

As for the ""work"" point, I don't think there's much to that either.  Immigrants are rational actors; they come here because of a realistic prospect that they can get jobs.  If that proves not to be true, they tend to go home again.  And the kind of jobs they might be doing include things like looking after old people in care homes and thereby solving the UK's looming demographic crisis.  


&gt; This is not to say I'm entirely against the reform of Bulgarian or Romanian immigration.

Well, I'm glad to hear it.  It doesn't seem very fair to me that you have enjoyed the right to go and live in Bulgaria for some time now but the reciprocal right was not there.


&gt; What I am doing is asking the same question that I have since my first comment: resources are finite. How do we sustain an increasing population? How do we sustain an increasing population and support those choosing to come here for a better way of life?

On the finite resource point I agree with you.  But it's a global problem.  I do not think there's much to be said for taking narrow local approaches to solving that problem.  In the extreme,  you might be able to take the UK to an isolationist and zero-population-growth scenario but then eventually have it threatened by burgeoning populations elsewhere that are desperate for resources.


&gt; If you can answer that then by all means go ahead and then tell the government because I think they need to know. 

Smarter people than me are giving good advice to the government and whoever else will listen on topics such as food security, the effects of growing wealth inequality, the costs and benefits of immigration, etc.  You know as well as I do that the problem is not that nobody knows what to do, it's more that the people we have put in charge of making decisions are looking at four-year re-election cycles more than they are looking at the long-term outcomes for human happiness.

Then the Polish hordes descended according to the newspapers, and suddenly everyone assumed I was Polish for several years - people just jump to conclusions that confirms what they believe.

My starkest example of just how little facts has to do with anything: My ex is black, and also an immigrant. Our neighbours have BNP sympathies (racist political party) and have had conversations with her about how they think everyone should go back to their own countries, and how they don't really like blacks or asians. 

But here's the thing: *Except* her, of course. And me. And their various black and asian friends. And the local shop keepers and GPs etc. They're never anything but friendly and nice apart from the odious political sympathies. 

It's always some nebulous ""others"" that steal their jobs and girls, yet whenever they come into contact with these ""others"" they quickly transform into normal people that no longer belong to ""the others"".

It saves them from dealing with the disconnect between the reality of that they see, where they have no particular reason to dislike foreigners, and the ""reality"" they are being told about where the reason times are tough is because of hordes of immigrants. 

It's an easy, convenient excuse. Even more so because the big political parties have burned a lot of them badly by lying to their faces too often and not addressing their fears properly but just brushing it off, making it incredibly easy to prey on them.

Adding an extra few tens of thousands of people to the unemployment figures is probably not the best thing to do in the middle of a recession.  Especially when a lot of them may have been caring for someone for decades and have no marketable skills.

The building programme would be short term, so maybe a few thousand jobs for a few years but hardly a massive jobs boom.  As far as staffing goes, that's likely to cost more than simply paying family members to do the job.  Even at minimum wage that's £1000 for every 24/7 period of care, 16 times as much as paying carers allowance. The only way to actually save money there is to have each staff memeber looking after more than 17 people, which given that they are likely high-needs individuals is going to cause problems.

But the immigrants clearly can live on such a wage so it is possible. They are just as human as us, they don't require less food or whatever.

As for raising a family, I don't see why all jobs should have to pay wages sufficient for that when many are aimed at younger workers without families.

The fact is the market sees no need for such well paid jobs or else they would exist, and I don't see how the government is meant to intervene to stop that.

I agree there are jobs that need doing though - really the government should end the housing crisis through a massive building programme of decent homes (possible to do relatively cheaply now via new pre-fab technology, they would even have decent insulation etc.) and public works like the Severn Barrage.

If it was up to me businesses would also be co-operatively owned such that each worker is paid relative to the value they add rather than simply the least they can possibly be paid whilst the surplus is taken to shareholders who don't do any work and executives who have a nebulous 'value'.

I don't like how people are presently being exploited but I think the freedom of someone to live and work where they please should be a fundamental right, one that is just as useful to Brits as well.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; And most of the Polish people I've met (I think they've made a good testcase) seem to be very hard working people.

One of the things that really annoy me when people complain about the Polish immigration is when I can see first hand why the person in question is affected. 

I've *tried* so many times to use some of our neighbours who are builders to do stuff in our house. I don't care about price difference - the convenience of having a neighbour I've known long enough that I can trust them with a key and go to work while they do their thing is in theory worth quite a bit to me.

But what I *do* care about is then actually getting things done when it is agreed. I can use our neighbours, and maybe stuff gets done some day, maybe, if the planets aligns just right, in between them complaining about not getting enough work. Or I could hire someone else who will do things on the dates I'm paying them for, and sometimes that would end up being some Polish guy and our neighbours would get all their fears confirmed and whine to their mates.

We've had plenty of excellent British contractors do various work as well, so it's not about where they're from. 

But the British contractors who do the work well and on time rarely bitch about not getting enough work. On the contrary, we keep rotating between the good electricians and plumbers we've found over the years, for example, because they keep having to turn down jobs because they're too busy. Odd that.

(The exception where I will exercise my right to be bigoted and stereotype all English building contractors in one go is sealing floors and ceilings - for some reason most English builders seem to live under the bizarre delusion that injecting silicone or other similar fillers and sealants is sufficient to handle any leak no matter how big, and if it still leaks that's very odd and certainly not down to their incompetence and just means you need to inject more crap; repeat ad nauseam)

The fact that Young had already played the ball before Lloris took him out means nothing, in fact late challenges are usually more harshly punished than normal ones. Young jumped a long way to avoid Lloris and was still clipped, and Lloris's challenge was reckless with the studs showing and his feet high in the air. If Young hadn't jumped, Lloris would have tackled him about halfway up his thigh, which would have been a straight red and a stonewall penalty. We got lucky, simple as.

We should not try and sweep this under the rug, instead we should be worried that Lloris's decision making when he comes out of his goal has been really poor ever since that incident with Lukaku. He was at fault for the second goal Southampton grabbed against us, and he was lucky he didn't cost us a win yesterday.

The biggest problem with exam culture is we only teach that which can be examined. If we threw out examinations tomorrow and rewrote our syllabus we'd end up with something very different. For instance you can't really examine the ability to prove something in maths. You can certainly set a regurgitation exercise whereby somebody recalls a set proof. However sitting down with an abstract model of something and proving that it behaves a particular way (i.e. without having the proof already sat there in a text book)? Can't really examine for that.

Coursework was a partial answer. You can judge with coursework material that cannot be judged with an exam. That is why we had to get rid of it. Somebody might learn something.

Education is failing because a century ago stuff that you could examine was at the heart of new fields of employment. The ability to regurgitate facts and apply rigid methods is great on a production line. Fewer and fewer fields look like this. Most fields deal with stuff where there isn't always a good answer, or there are multiple answers with very subjective judgement calls.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think ultimately it will be Eriksen in a CAM role with Lamela on the right and Andros on the left (remember he played his full career on the left until recently). Chadli and Lennon will continue to be cogs that fit as needed dependent on the situation. 

In the short term i think Lennon is playing at a level to deserve time on the pitch, and while i don't think it is a permanent solution the lopsided attack is working as well. As much as we all love to say that Lennon is the weak link (as we have for the past several seasons) because he can't finish, he has a horrible final ball, all he does is sprint etc, the guy continues to show that for all the flaws he may have in his game, we just play well with him in the lineup.

I like how Eriksen has been playing on the left, but the lopsided formation at the same time concerns me. Because we seem to be removing some of the defensive responsibilities from Eriksen and allowing him to roam the pitch to create we are putting a huge amount of pressure on Rose at LB defensively. 

Against a team like Stoke it wasn't an issue (also helped that Stoke looked bad even for Stoke) as John Walters couldn't take advantage of the space that was available. Fryers was easily able to deal with the rare attack that actually came from Stoke. It just worked in our favor.  

Against United we saw Rose get run ragged by Valencia and Januzaj and our central defense play a massive game to counter that pressure. But you can imagine that virtually every team we have coming up will attack the same way if we put that lineup on the pitch and the matches we have coming in the short term (City, Arsenal, Everton, Swansea) can all exploit space on the left.

Short term, what we are doing seems to be working, but it leaves us exposed.

Focussing on punishment, in my opinion, assume that when someone commits a crime, it's because they're evil, and have no hope of changing. This quite frankly isn't true, and paints with far too broad brush strokes. People can change, and if, 40 years after a murder, someone is reformed, I see no reason to keep them in prison.


Also, I'm pretty sure nothing in the ECHR ruling stops someone being in prison for their entire life. If someone is set to be released, then says 'I'm going to kill loads more people when I get out and have no remorse', they won't be released.

So update us on what your plans are &amp; I can give you a bit more information (kiwi here, know many people have been through various stages of this process) 

Your husband cannot live &amp; work in the UK indefinitely- he is subject to immigration control. Marrying you, however gives him another visa option- spousal visa. Depending on his age he can also apply for the working holiday visa- that has restrictions though, so it all depends on your long term plans. 

Secondly- as far as the marriage. 
Decide first where you are getting married, then get the information from that council.  Each might have slightly different application rules. A quick google search says  People subject to immigration control wishing to give notice of marriage will need to do so at a designated register office. Essex Register Office in Brentwood is the designated office for Essex. Telephone 01277 233565. 

So- before anyone can help really we need to know: Are you planning on living &amp; working in the Uk long term? Where do you want to get married?

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Firstly, you can estimate the total benefits bill based on statistical measures of the population (e.g. proportion disabled, proportion not paying income tax/NI as a proxy for unemployment), and compare to the actual bill. This gives you one estimate for the fraud rate.

Secondly, you can extrapolate from the ones you catch using the standard techniques from epidemiology (based on Bayesian analysis) and treating fraud as a disease.

With both these fraud rates in hand, you can come up with a figure like ""between 0.05% (the amount we catch) and 0.9% (upper bound given the two estimates) of the benefits bill is paid to fraudsters"".

And the reason we don't do something about it is twofold:

 1. These are estimates; it's possible that we actually catch all the fraudsters.

 2. The cost of catching a fraudster is non-zero; if fraud is (say) £1,000 million a year, and eradicating it completely would cost £100,000 million a year, it's not economically sensible to eradicate fraud.

In practice, you may be prepared to spend more on reducing fraud than you save from doing so, simply to stop fraud being a worthwhile from the fraudster's perspective; however, once the expected net gain[1] from any fraud is less than zero, you don't want to spend more on eliminating it completely, as the money is simply wasted.

[1] Expected net gain defined here as ""(fraudster's estimate of the chance of being caught) times (fraudster's estimate of the penalty for being caught) minus (gain from the fraud)"" - so if the fine for being caught is £100,000, there's a 1 in 100 chance of being caught, and the fraud gains you £1,000, the expected net gain is 0. Increase the chance of being caught to 1 in 10, and the expected net gain becomes -£9,000; decrease it to 1 in 1,000, and the expected net gain becomes £900.

Positive expected net gains are bad - the fraudster will simply keep committing fraud to gain the money; note, though, that the expected net gain is set by the fraudster's perceptions.",0,1388671407,null,0,false,0,cefge9k,t3_1u5nva,t1_cefge9k,t1_cef1x5s,null,1427891950,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Councils are a lot closer to where people live.  Tipping a councillor, or council, even winning one, is far, far easier than a national party or central government.  That, and some county councils wouldn't be implementing it, or trying to, and that inequality is going to wrankle people across the county border too.   County councils and local decisions have every reason to fear the electorate more - or should do.  Across county councils in England 3/8ths are hung with no clear majority, and Labour were royally punished in 2009 on the back of the Europeans and expense scandals with, IIRC, only one county council.  The electorate snaps back at more local levels.

Of course if decisons like this were being left up to the local authorities and devolved to county councils (or their equivalent in Wales/N.Ireland/Scotland), then you'd have to devolve some fiscal powers and allow them to retain more of the locally raised revenue.

If you really, really want Councils building new homes like crazy you'd take out any Westminster targets or influence and tell them that the local authorities retain more revenue from the sale and development.

I would prefer that we just leave Jan in the middle, he has done as asked for us, now lets get him back to where he is strongest.

Really, we can take the chance of being exposed on the left in some matches. But i would hope that once we start getting a healthy squad back Sherwood would adjust his strategy depending on opponent.

The answer to that part is yes. The courts can't possible have an idea when or if a criminal will be fit to regain a place in society. They can't know how a person will change during their time in prison. Some use the time to better themselves and feel bad for what they had done. Others (more than half) come out with new found knowledge on how to be a better criminal, taught to them by other criminals while in prison. I think longer sentences, without *any* chance of early release would either act as a better deterrent or at least it will keep the scum off the streets for longer.

People can argue this, but my problem with Rory being Amy's emotional diving board is that she needs him at all.
All of the companions in Matt's arc seem to be unable to exist without the Doctor, or (excluding Clara) each other. 

Amy exists only for the Doctor and Rory; the Doctor has her childhood, and without Rory she wouldn't have had any avenue to express her grief at the fact that, oh, I dunno, she was imprisoned for nine f-ing months and the evil space gov'ment took her baby.

River, wonderful, beautiful woman that she is, was transformed from a mystery to take on the role of a companion's child, fashioned in the Tardis, made with the sole purpose of destroying the Doctor, who turns and saves him and then proceeds to make her life in prison completely about the Doctor, and even the main reason she becomes an archaeologist is to find the Doctor.

Clara. Lives and dies to help the Doctor. Throughout all of his lives.

And poor Rory has it worst of all, because for the longest time his only real role was the boyfriend or the fiancé. We knew nothing of what made Rory Rory, except for the nurse bit. In a way, Rory's development is a lot like Mickey's. We know nothing about them (in detail) at first except where they work and the fact that they're surprisingly devoted to their companion girlfriend. You sort of get to see what their flats look like once, maybe. And when their family is introduced, it's as a lone individual, like Mickey's gran or Rory's dad. 

I always felt like this lack of depth with Mickey was supposed to be part of what made him pitiful, and when he overcomes that, he (much like Martha) leaves the person he loves for his own well-being; but Rory is strong and brave and admirable and devoted, devoted, devoted.

To a question what's my nationality I would say Polish but if I get naturalised in UK I would say I'm both Polish and British. When I come back from a holiday in Poland I feel however that I'm at home now....

I'm pretty sure plenty of Poles already enjoy British culture.

I think the question here is exactly what the culture is and what particular people enjoy the most. You will see me going to cinemas, concerts and watching a birth of the Prince George but I won't be attending local pubs (if that can be somehow used within culture) nor going to Notting Hill Festival, simply because I don't like such things.

Poles may not be fully engaging with the culture because of different reasons: money (it is very often quite expensive), time (they normally work full times and during days off may prefer more resting than going out somewhere) and language (if you can't understand things it makes it less important to see/read something).

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Spurs.  Sherwood has them playing some good football now, they look confident and assured in their game, the players even look like they're enjoying themselves.  Oh and he made Adebayor into a monster again basically overnight.  They looked on their back foot against United yesterday and Lloris had to make a few great saves to win them the match but their counter attacks were fluid and lightning fast, they finished their chances well.  When they had spells in possession they looked almost arrogant, a sign that they believe in themselves.  They've got great quality throughout and they're starting to click together well, I think they're going to go on quite a run for the second half of the season.

United is in such a strange way at the moment.  It took them going 2 down to Spurs yesterday before they even started to care about the game and then Rooney spent most of the rest of the game chasing Webb around yelling at him.  They're leaking goals (not really normal for United) pretty badly and not scoring much either though probably because RVP is out and Rooney is playing a more withdrawn role (WTF Moyes?!).  And hell Welbeck can't stop scoring now, what is the world coming to?  They have issues in midfield for sure and Evra is having a real nightmare of a season so far.  I'd expect them to try and sort themselves out in January and then come back fighting hard for the second half of the season.  As much as I love to see them lose and I hope they get shafted with Europa League action next season (this really seems worse than no European football at all lol), losing isn't something they really do these days.  The Moyes factor changes things as Fergie could do the impossible, but the players won't forget how to win overnight.  Before the Spurs loss they were starting on a run and they'll feel hard done by with the way they absolutely bossed the last 20 minutes of that match.  They'll be in with a shout when the season comes to a close.

Everton are playing really well too, Martinez is a hell of a manager.  They are scary, but IMO going to be pretty inconsistent as the season wears on.  They don't have spectacular depth to speak of and a few injuries could really derail them.  Baines coming back is huge for sure as much as I hate admitting it they're a really fun side to watch this season, but I don't think they'll quite nip their way in.

Even after 1989 it wasn't really good. In fact, it seemed for many like much worse (unemployment rose very high). You could buy many more things.... you just didn't have money for them.

There's an attitude with motorbikes that everything else on the road is probably ignorant to you, and as such - *you and you alone are responsible for your wellbeing*. It's a bit brutalist, but it works. There's no 'I had right of way..' or 'He shouldn't have done xyz...' it's just part of the motorcycling culture that you are responsible for yourself (there's also a bit of quasi-anarchism going on there too). You should always be able to reflect on a 'near miss' and say what you could have done better, even if it was completely not your fault.

I got up, stand next to a door but bus just went by my bus stop. Luckily some grandma was getting off at the next stop so I looked exactly at what magic she was using to have the bus stop :) In Poland buses in my city stopped at each bus stop. I think British solution is better as what's the point for a bus to stop if nobody is there nor anybody goes out of a bus?


Water taps without mixer!!! God, this is the most illogical thing in UK, especially when ""extremely hot"", ""extremely cold"" options of water you have. You don't see it in Poland at all. I still don't understand why people buy, install and use those things. At my current place of living the first thing we did was to switch taps to the ones with mixer. However, a guy didn't change it in basin in the bathroom because of some ""technical problems"" (he wasn't Eastern European but Irish) and I have a pain every day when washing my hands or brushing teeth.


Impression of British people. Generally positive. I however remember a guy, a mechanic, who was originally from Cyprus (I think) who have lived here for many years (like 20 or 30) who told me at the very beginning of my stay in UK that I need to be careful with British people as they say nice things to you to your face but as soon as you turn your back they want to stab you. I haven't experienced anything like that myself but on many occasions felt that for British person being completely sympathetic is just a rarity. I think with Poles, more of them will tell you to your face they don't like you. British person will say something like ""he's ok"" while actually thinking ""I don't like him"".

2.  Lloris tackles the opponent recklessly or with excessive force.  This could have been called as a penalty, but it would have been a really weak since he brushes him with his hand.  The cleats aren't an issue.

true,TIA568B,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I'm sure you're used to hearing this, but I'm going to say it anyway, stick with it and things will get better. 

I've been there and it's not nice, I had a mix of depression and anxiety with no job, a firm idea of what I wanted to do (IT), but I was lacking the experience and qualifications to do it and had no interest in doing anything else. I was signing on and it was a struggle to jump through the hoops at the job centre and even having to face the advisor was a bit of a challenge, maybe with the recession etc. things have changed slightly, but when I was going to the job centre they weren't equipped to deal with people who had brains or those suffering from mental illness.

Seek help if you haven't already, be it friends, family or even just your doctor, I ended up on anti-depressants for a year or so which really helped with me being able to function socially, part of the package was a shrink and an occupational therapist, the shrink was useless for me, but the occupational therapist at least helped me get somewhere with the job centre by getting me referred to a special advisor who was a bit more understanding.

During my time going to the job centre I was accused of being on drugs by one of the advisers due to my lack of eye contact, was sent on a one week course full of people with criminal records where they ""taught"" us how to read papers for jobs - I didn't go back after the first day as I couldn't take the hostile environment, was told to apply for a variety of jobs that I wouldn't be able to emotionally handle, told I'd never get a job in my chosen field and was sent to a place for people who have had brain injuries (I've never had one, but I guess in their eyes depression is the same thing) who told me there was nothing they could do to help me find a job, but I had to keep going due to job centres orders. I'm sure there was plenty of other things, but they're the ones that have stuck with me and still piss me off.

Eventually I found a 20 hour a week temp job where I was forced to have some limited interaction with people, from there I was able to overcome a bit of my anxiety and gain a bit of confidence and ultimately move into a full time job elsewhere that was somewhat relevant to what I wanted to do, I stuck with that one for a while, learnt a bit, got some decent experience, made some good friends who I still keep in touch with, but ultimately jumped ship just before the company went under to go work in a call centre. 

Working in a call centre was something the job centre kept suggesting to me previously, but at that time it was unimaginable, I quite enjoyed it for the first 6 months or so, learnt some good skills and overcome some of my anxiety when it came to talking to people and managed to boost my own confidence and self respect and through luck (90%) and attitude (10%) I was able to score my current job in IT which I love and would have killed for while unemployed, I've been here a while now, I've managed to excel at it which has been a massive boost to my self worth.

Writing it down I'm making it sound too easy, finding a job doesn't magically make depression go away, getting from where I was to where I am now was a roller coaster with a lot of misery along the way, but I'm now happy and if I can do it anyone can do it.

Firstly, the reason our taps are like this is because our plumbing is old. generally cold water comes from the mains and hot water from a hot water tank.

This was illegal. Now its just a historical thing.

Secondly. You're using your taps wrongly. Brushing you teeth obviously just use cold water. But if you want to wash your hands I really don't see how it makes any difference, it takes a while for the hot water to come down the pipe anyway, and by that point you're probably done washing your hands anyway.

Went to the local college and did a year of engineering, got an apprenticeship (a proper one that actually paid proper money, not these slave-wage new bollocks).  Was laid off a couple of years later after the company folded.  Went back to college for a couple of years and studied software engineering and design.  Got a job selling ISDN equipment just in time for broadband to be the new thing and got laid off again.  Drove a forklift for a couple of years.  Got a job in IT with the local council and spent the next 10 years years or so moving between companies with every increasing salaries and positions.  I pretty much walked into every job I applied for; sent a CV off, get an interview, get job.  That easy.  Had to jack it all in when my wife got really sick in 2006. 

Watching my kids try to find work - any work - at the moment is heartbreaking.  My eldest son's been out of work for just over two years and my youngest son has never managed to find a job since leaving college last year.  My son-in-law took a job stacking shelves in ASDA as it was the only place hiring, and my daughter has started uni in the hope that things will be better by the time she graduates.

 The reason why Petric and Cole weren't playing presumably was because they were signed into the season as free transfers so wouldn't have had any match fitness, which meant that they'd be useless in a game. Signing those two was just a desperate attempt at getting strikers on the books. As for Maiga...well he was just having real problems locating the net.

The second issue is not the long ball tactics from Allardyce's, it's the complete lack of any sort of 'plan b' if they're not working. Most teams can be undone by some direct football, but when it isn't working, we need a way to mix it up and keep the opposition's defense guessing.

I would be hesitant to claim that players aren't happy as there is litterally no way of knowing this and you have to work on assumption which is daft and unhealthy. Is Nolan's second red another indication of severe issues with motivation? Or is it that he's frustrated, not particularly bright and rash in his challenges?

The point is for the Conservatives to have headlines about how good they are. And so they've created a false threat (the ECHR has ruled we can't lock up prisoners for life) so they can pretend to save us from it.

The ECtHR was quite clear that they were fine with people being locked up for their entire lives. What they objected to was the process by which, at or shortly after someone was given a life sentence, a judge (or in some cases, politician) could order that the prisoner have no opportunity to have the length of time they server in prison reviewed.

The prison term (not the sentence) simply has to have some ""prospect of reducibility"" and possibility of review, the key thing being not to deprive people of hope.

So if a person is considered dangerous, then even if they do apply for a review of their prison term (i.e. try to get parole) they will fail.

  In the mid-80s I was a department store photographer and Saturdays were our hell days, the one day that all the families could come in for the group photos.  9 hours of screaming children, angry dads, frustrated moms... I would come home exhausted and emotionally spent.

One night I collapsed on the couch and surfed my 4 channels (pre-Fox, had the Big Three networks and a PBS - couldn't afford cable) and stumbled onto Doctor Who on PBS.  Not just any Doctor Who, but the first episode of the Key To Time series (considered some of the best, at a time when Douglas Adams was a writer and script editor).  I was hooked, and for months the promise of coming home and collapsing with Doctor Who is the only thing that made my Saturday bearable.  I actually came to love how difficult those Saturdays were, because in an odd way I felt like it made Doctor Who more special, like each week I earned it (the same way that beer after work feels somehow a little tastier)

Fast forward a few decades.  I'm a professional stand-up comic, on the road traveling 3-6 nights a week - always driving.  After a last show on Saturday night I would feel relived if I ""only"" had a 3 or 4 hour drive back home - I was desperate for something to make all that driving more bearable, so I started to search.

One day while surfing, I caught a reference to a Doctor Who audio play, Shada.  It was even based off an old, unused Douglas Adams script, and it was wonderful.  From there I discovered another BBC produced story, The Death of Time (I mention it in case you don't know about it - certainly not canon, but very entertaining)  And from there, on to Big Finish.

Suddenly all those long drives seemed inviting - there was an intimacy about the experience.  Hurtling through darkened landscapes at 2 a.m., the world reduced to the forty-foot reach of my headlights and the old voices, new worlds, and timeless humor of the plays. 

Even now, when I hear the throbbing background rhythm of the Dalek heartbeat I'm transported back to a long overnight drive through North Dakota, listening to Dalek Empire, the flat plains around me now seeming  tragic and devastated, as if flattened by the invasion's onslaught.

true,devineman,logo,,"&gt;That's why Txiki Begiristain is the director of football operations. So that Manchester City can follow the Barcelona model

Txiki is our DoF because he is big mates with Soriano and Marwood was so out of his depth he made the Marina Trench look shallow.

Soriano is our CEO because he managed to convince Khaldoon that he was a major reason for the success of Barcelona. 

If he was a major reason for the success of Barca, he'd still be at or around Barca.  He's a guy who got a decent public image by writing a book after got kicked out of Barca by a vote of no confidence then bankrupting a Spanish airline.  

Neither Soriano or Begiristain has anything to do with the Barcelona mode, they both joined in 2003 just in time to harvest the fruits of other people's work and claim credit for the entire thing.  People should actually look at their situation.  Soriano claims that he doubled Barca's revenue but unless he happened to have trained their youth team that took them to constant CL Finals, he essentially watched it grow.

Begiristain walked into Barcelona and immediately bought about 10 players above the age of 28 and a few over 32.  In fact in the entire period he was there he constantly bought this age bracket, the ""legends"" that we see at Barca were pretty much already there but just so happened to finish a journey whereby they went from Barca B to the first team whilst he was in charge.  It's not a difficult decision to not sell a 17 year old Lionel Messi.

My problem with these two has always been that they are Harry Redknapp of Directors.  They have wonderful PR campaigns carefully orchestrated and managed by their people to make them come off in an extremely favourable light when in reality they spent their time mainly bumbling around and lucking into the greatest team that ever lived. 

If you are looking at Txiki Begiristain as proof that we will be developing our youth system, I'd say you're looking entirely up the wrong tree.

Yes it does.  People have no right to drive a motor vehicle on the highway.  They have a licence only, that's the law.  And nobody is going to introduce legislation to reverse that, ever, because there needs to be a simple method of removing people who drive dangerously on the highway.

I finished working at ARM a few months ago after completing a year-long technical placement. While I may not have as much working experience against which to compare my time at ARM as other people, I've worked in technical roles in other companies in the past so I feel that my views are reasonably fair. 

I'd say they're a fantastic company to work for. The culture of the company is geared towards being open, friendly, professional and--perhaps above all--technical. I was always impressed with how deeply technical the management were, not to mention those in ""technical"" roles. Knowledge sharing seemed to be quite well encouraged too, with people being happy to help out co-workers from other teams if they were particularly experienced in some technology.

At least in my division, I found the offices very relaxed to work in, with the employees being given quite a lot of freedom in managing their own work and projects. The offices themselves were nice and modern too. There weren't thousands of the ""yay creativity"" things that they seem to have at other tech companies, however. There were some new consoles and pool tables, but they didn't get used a great deal.

Could go into describing other areas, but it'd be better to know what kind of things you want to know about.
If you're thinking of applying there, I definitely recommend doing so.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; I just find it impossible to accept that not one of those 969 deaths did not involve police wrongdoing. And if that's the case, why hasn't anybody ever been prosecuted?

Well, I can only comment since 2000 ish. I've had the misfortune to be involved in a death in custody, only on the periphery, thank god, and yet I went home 12 hours late, with my uniform seized, after writing detailed statements on what i had seen and done.

The investigating bodies are LOOKING to find evidence. They WANT to prosecute. It's what they do. 

You may wish to believe that police are champing at the bit to kick prisoners to death in cells, it's simply not the case. You can correlate the rise of CCTV to the fall in deaths in custody if you like. I can point you to the repeated closures of custody suites where facilities are upgraded, potential ligature points removed, cells re-equipped, re-designed, refurbished. I can point you to the ten hours a year or more of training I had specifically aimed at reducing the risk of death in custody, spotting the signs of acute medical conditions and psychosis, all despite me not being an officer dedicated to custody duties.

Sadly, police come into contact with people who will die, all the time. Death in custody statistics includes for example people who are released from custody and die in hospital, or those who crash a car and die during or after a police pursuit.

I have witnessed one beating in police custody, ever. It was by Royal Military Police on an AWOL soldier. We had to throw them into their own cells, and call for more of their colleagues to take the three of them away under arrest.

So please, please don't characterise ""death in custody"" as you are without direct evidence. Don't quote numbers like ""1000 deaths in custody since 1990"" without recognising that that encompasses 1.4 million arrests a year, probably over 30 million arrests in the timescale you're talking about, or qualifying that ""death in custody"" whilst it invokes images of a prisoner left to die on a cell floor is far wider ranging than that. Some statistics don't differentiate between police custody and custody under Sec 2 of the mental health act, and I'm sure you don't need help working out what inclusion of people so dangerous to themselves that they have to be incarcerated does to THOSE statistics.

If you want to help, quit bitching on the internet, and go and train to be an independent custody inspector. You can put your energy to good use there.",0,1388684488,null,0,false,0,cefkub8,t3_1u87yt,t1_cefkub8,t1_cefk541,null,1431768496,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

This isn't going anywhere. You can't compare the infrascture of denmaek with the UK, they're fundamentally different. I cycled to school with my dad from the age of about 8, and alone from the age of 11, so it's prefectly possible to do in the UK.

You seem to be some kind of militnat cyclist insistant that the wolrd be bent to fit their view.

It was certainly better than the 1st one but it was still so mind numbingly ""lurchy"" going from a snails pace to RAAAAAAAAAWRRR every few minutes that toward the end I just wanted it to end as soon as possible.

Granted this really only applies to the ""Axis of Evil"" but coming from a country that's seen in many parts of the world as ""The lap dog of the Great Satan"" really isn't so good in my experience.  

The French, Irish, Spanish and all the Scando' country's don't get much hassle - If your a Brit, its all about about the whole war on brown people thing and why are we helping the Yanks do bad things.

Times change etc, but I feel like anywhere I want to go for a holiday now has a foreign office advisory notice slapped on it.

The other thing that rears its head frequently and niggles me are reciprocal visa costs.  British passport holders pay substantially more than other European country's for visas because we charge their nationals more to come here.

People need to realise that the property market and construction industry aren't things that you can just change over night. It takes time for things to happen, the property market is picking up but the house builders will go for the biggest returns first, that isn't urban housing.

Also investors are still jittery about urban housing too, lots of development companies went bust in the recession because of speculative building of urban housing.

The most recent really reliable account was in Sylvester McCoy's episode ""Time and the Rani"". He needs a code to leave a room, and upon being told it's 953, he says that that number is both his and the Rani's age. The most likely explanation for the more ""consistent"" new series ages is that he lost count by then, and restarted at 900 for the ninth Doctor. The aging from young to old McCoy and young to old Hurt should add up to at least 1500, so he could be about 2453 years old plus McGann's age when Eccleston shows up.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"I don't think they necessarily look *weaker* now.  I just think they still look unconvincing, but for different reasons.

AVB instilled loads of tactical discipline into his players, to the point where they were losing games because of it.  Just because the tactics meant they were unimaginative going forward doesn't mean they weren't there.  They were there too strictly.

Going forward, I agree, Sherwood has helped them.  But that's not a difficult task to accomplish.  I think Sherwood's success in attack is achieved by offering players more freedom to run and play passes *within the rigid structure that AVB enforced.*  This is why changing a manager often improves a team's results in the short term: for a bit, while the old manager's influence is fading and the new one is coming in, you sometimes get the best parts of both managers.  We saw this at Chelsea after AVB left.  AVB gave the side a rigid tactical foundation, and di Matteo provided the right man management.  That combination won the CL.  Once AVB's structure gets looser and fades from the team, I think they will have to adapt in attack or they will struggle.  At this point, I'm starting to see cracks, and I don't think Sherwood will have them adapt well enough or fast enough.  Mostly this is based on the lack of astute runs from some players going forward, and poor decision-making from players on the ball in response to teammates' runs.  Their second goal came from shit defending by ManU, and honestly, they should've finished off the attack a lot sooner.

Defensively, pretty much the same thing is happening.  For instance, midway through the second half, Evra was carrying the ball down ManU's left flank.  He wasn't moving particularly fast.  Some ManU player (Carrick?) was jogging behind in support.  Walker went out to cover Evra, and a Spurs player (Capoue?  Lennon?) came back to prevent the overload.  For a moment it looked like Evra would drop it to Carrick, and Capoue decided to run to track the run of Evra behind Walker while Walker went to the ball.  (This isn't what should happen, unless my grasp of tactics is wayyy screwed up, but it's also not the point I'm trying to make.)  Evra ended up keeping the ball, and for a moment both Capoue and Walker went to cover him, then seeing each other, both backed off, and then finally sorted it out.  Walker went to Evra.  Evra tried to cross, but he is shit so nothing came of it.  The point here (and it's hard to illustrate with words) is that there was a real screwup in communication between Spurs players on defense, and not the only one I saw in the game- not even close.

I'm not an expert by any means, and I could be misreading the situation here.  But from where I stand, there were cracks in Spurs' play.  United were the better team (and they weren't great either) and Spurs collected three points thanks to shit United defending, a few calls by the ref, and a bit of luck.",0,1388689415,null,0,false,0,cefn4c4,t3_1u6pf4,t1_cefn4c4,t1_cefdzmj,null,1431769559,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

To tell you the truth, I think Brits are not much different with drinking (especially that well known binge drinking and number of pubs you have) with a difference that Poles possibly drink stronger spirits (thus quicker damage).

&gt; Are you concerned Romanians going to under cut your pay by working cheaper and putting more people in smaller homes?

There is a risk they will do so (cut wages), especially at the beginning but since I think that from whole Eastern Europe didn't come such a lot of people (total 1.5% of UK's population) even if Romanian and Bulgarians were to add another 0.5% it won't be that much noticeable. Also, don't forget that NOBODY wants to work below what others earn in the same type of industry. Being an EU national means that eventually they will want to earn more and be equal with others or just within pricing distance which makes certain work competitive (rather than seriously undercut wages).

&gt; Are the Poles and Romanians going to go to war here?

Indeed, Britain is a nice place to live, but I'd hardly say it is ""the forefront of human development^(*)"" that you describe. It has its good and bad sides - just like anything else.

For me, the things that improve my life satisfaction, are better in Bulgaria. I love the warm summers and living by the beach, I strongly prefer Bulgarian food and want to be close to my relatives and friends. Another big consideration is that the cost of doing business here is much lower than in the UK - lower taxes, cheaper office space, cheaper labour. This is a huge advantage when competing in a global marketplace. 

Long-term prospects are also better. When I worked in London, I made a lot of money by everyone's standards. But I paid about 40% in taxes, then ~10k in rent and 1.5k in transportation costs. Working 10 years to buy a 300k 2-bed flat in Zone 2/3 didn't seem particularly appealing either.

true,legal_beagle12,swans2002,,"Initially, I had our Swans going into December's gauntlet with a few more points than what they ultimately yielded. The obvious blame here, rather than a single player or tactical error, is the Europa League. It's a poison chalice. I now agree with those that posit ""4th or 6th, never 5th,""  for smaller or mid-size clubs.

Part and parcel with the Europa League is the resulting fatigue and nagging injuries. Hang those issues as the backdrop going into late December, and I'm empathetic with what our Swans are going through. I suppose I'm most interested in how they handle the adversity and which members of the bench step up to the challenge.

Waking up at 6 a.m. for the fixture was on my mind all of New Year's Eve. Swans are appointment-television for me in the States. Seeing how City may very well be top of the table in the end, I wasn't devastated by the result.

I am forever interested in the feedback from the fans that have the ability to attend the fixtures, as you're able to see what the cameras don't frame. Any input is always appreciated.

I did receive a Swans ""away ball"" and t-shirt from the family for Christmas. Honestly, for my extended family to understand what the premier league is, what club I support, and where to buy my club's items is remarkable.

One quick anecdote:
I was wearing my Swansea winter jacket while attending a holiday party in the states recently when a guy made a bee-line for me from across the room. He quickly grabbed my hand and spoke in a thick Welsh accent. My wife was taken aback, to say the least but I was ear-to-ear smiling. I heard the word ""Swansea"" and quickly connected he was from the town and was delighted to see a supporter. He mostly wanted to talk rugby, which I know nothing about, but it was so awesome to meet someone from Swansea.

It's difficult to try and read the tea leaves for how the table will shake out. I can't figure out how much trouble we are in (if any).

I am in the minority in that I genuinely enjoy the FA cup, though I recognize (and understand) the eye-rolls from many supporters.

&gt;Anyway, I wondered where in the UK you have settled

Mostly London but also Slough.

&gt;have visited other parts of the UK - in particular the Lake District?

Of course I saw other places! Some only through driving job (like Scotland - I will definitely go there one day to see it properly!). Lake District not yet either. I just need more free time (and of course saved money) for it.

&gt;Also have you had any difficulty understanding the broad range of English accents - i.e. geordie, scouse, cockney, brummie and so on?

Oh yes! You should also add accents of foreigners (like call centres in India). I remember once calling to ask something in a company based in Scotland (it was actually a Council). Main reception - understood without problems. Reception at the department (garage exactly) - a bit of an issue. And then they connected me with someone working there at the garage. Gosh, that was real hard - but I managed.

I have a family in Poland south (they live around place where accent is ""Goralski""). One uncle there was talking something to me (when I was visiting him being a kid-teenager). He said something and I couldn't understand it. I asked to repeat and he did, exactly in the same way as before. I asked again and the same situation. Then I just decided to nod having no clue what he was saying to me.

When I was coming to UK I thought all will be talking with Queen's accent. Oh how was I wrong ;) Anyway, I think in time you can get used to different accents.

He then checks the American, French and other hells and he receives similar answers, then he gets to the Romanian hell and discovers that there's a huge queue at the entrance. Intrigued he goes there and asks:

- How bad is it here?

- Well they put you on the electric chair for about an hour, then you have to sleep on a bed of nails for another hour and then the Romanian devil whips the crap out of you.

- That's about the same as in the other hells, why are there so many people who want to enter this one?

- Because the electric chair doesn't work and no one comes to repair it, the nails in bed were stolen by gypsies, and the Romanian devil is a former senator who just drops by to sign of his presence and then heads down to the pub.

E cigs seem like a solution to that problem.  Maybe I'll buy one in a few years, once a bit more is known about the possible side effects.  At its core, nicotine is a legal and (in moderated amounts) enjoyable drug, so I don't have a problem with people using it in an apparently healthy way.  Even if all it does it get people off lung cancer sticks, that's a brilliant thing to do.  

It also makes me wonder about possible applications for other drugs that have unsafe delivery methods.  If Marijuana ever becomes legal, won't that be made more safe from an e-cig instead of a bit of paper?  And if other things screw up other body systems (injected things apparently mess up your veins, etc) then making that safer too might also be a good thing, so long as it doesn't encourage something with massive health risks anyway.

When compared to previous migration of Poles (after II WW) it was different then.

true,h33i0,null,null,"I havent watched much of the show since I was a kid, only bits of an episode here and there. I still enjoy the books a lot though. But you have to remember they are based on books written almost a century ago. Most of them primarily pre-WW2. That is not something that can be held against the television show, they are simply being a loyal adaptation. 

You have to understand that Agatha Christie was writing in a time described as the [Golden Age of Detective Fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Detective_Fiction), the detective writers at the time followed common forumlaic styles and came up with more and more elaborate and intriguing books that followed those styles. The style and writing of that period in time has as many detractors as it does lovers. It is simplistic, it is at times contrived but its well loved and ridiculously popular (Agatha Christie especially). 

A lot of the tropes you see were even invented during the era, but they are purposefully like that. They are complete opposite of the American [hardboiled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardboiled) literary detective style that was in vogue at the time. The Hardboiled style had more robust, cynical detectives fighting crime and (imo) more realistic attitudes. This is in contrast to the blood-free, light-hearted cosy style that is prevalent in Poirot. All this means that these stories are quaint, old and are pointedly not detective *thrillers*. They are not meant to thrill. 

The stories during this era by and large follow the same formula with every new story, and the whole point is how author can uniquely solve the mystery they created while still following the ""rules of the game"" (explained in the wiki link above) and giving the reader enough sufficient clues and hints so they can come to the right conclusion. The author will deliberately try and lead the reader down a different path(s), so when you get to the grand reveal (a deliberate trope) the reader is surprised to find they have the wrong person and when they are shown the guilty person, all the clues were there for them to see. Those are the hallmarks of the great detective books written during the time. It's as much about the journey as it is about the final revelation. The films follow this style but I guess to those unfamiliar with it, it seems kinda pointless. But for the readers of the book, it harks back to the original story structure. 

The poirot adaptations are *generally* meant for people who know and enjoy the stories of Agatha Christie. A lot of people read those books as children and its a way for them to remember those stories. She is afterall, the best selling novelist **ever**, yes ever. It's honestly not meant to be groundbreaking or change its tone or setting (like Sherlock). So the writers loyally adapt the books for people who loved and enjoyed those works to watch.

If you get an Antrim Road bus and ask the driver to let you know when you get to Belfast Castle (also worth a look) then you can't miss it.
If you want to see traditional old Irish pubs, the three pubs in the city which lay claim to being the oldest are White's Tavern, Kelly's Cellar and McHughes. All are worth a look.
My favourite city centre pub is probably the John Hewitt, and if you want to try some great local craft beers etc you can't go wrong. The pub is run by a charity and has a memorial to the Irishmen who fought in the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. A very interesting place.
For food (again, presuming you want places in/near the city centre) you should check out the Mourne Seafood Bar (beside Kelly's Cellar) but the food is also decent in the 3 pubs mentioned.
If you want to know more about the political history of Belfast then a black taxi tour is probably the best thing to do. They will take you to areas that wouldn't necessarily be 100% safe for you to just rock up to by yourselves.",0,1388693229,null,0,false,0,cefoy5o,t3_1u8u4m,t1_cefoy5o,t1_cefnq9r,null,1431770425,3,false,Belfast,t5_2rc51,3

The writings of people who wrote during that Golden Age era are incredibly similar because they followed the same style. That is why he doesnt suffer from the issues that you highlighted.

I would have to argue though that Conan Doyle writing is not more modern, not in prose or setting anyway. When reading Conan Doyle its noticeable in the use of his language and prose that this is a victorian writer, the same cannot be said of Christie. 

Christie prose has been lambasted for a long time. She is not generally taken seriously when talking about good writing, that does not however stop her from being ridiculously popular and coming up with - in my opinion anyway - great mysteries. 

To like one over the other is not really contentious. Sherlock Holmes is the most well loved and famous detective character created. You obviously enjoy it which is fair enough. It doesnt mean however the other is not without merit, it is just not to your taste.

I see cyclists routinely running red lights (which I consider to be unsafe as well as being illegal), riding through people crossing the road on all types of crossings, and inappropriately filtering through traffic.

I personally consider inappropriate filtering to involve cycling up the inside of large vehicles known to have blind spots, trying to squeeze through gaps that are too small (leading to at least one case of ""keying"" of a car's paint with the pedal), and trying to filter whilst the lights are changing within easy view of the cyclist.

I always found Conan Doyle to be a literary treat to read ever since I was a kid. Never found the appeal of Christie (or Poirot). It feels like a 20s/30s version of Stiegg Larsson or Dan Brown - the equivalent or airport pulp.

I think the poirot stories are very hack-ish. I don't see why being of the ""golden age"" excuses bad prose. I find it rather ironic that it's often referred to as the golden age but there is a literary famine in her works.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by narrow view of the world. I dont think you can really hold that against her. Her views are the same as people of her generation and status (Middle class person in interwar England).

Arthur Conan Doyle's writing shows numerous things that were ahead of his time. Remember that short about the ""yellow face"" (a woman who had an african american daughter) ? Agatha Christie would probably have a stroke if someone told her to write something like that. It's very clear that she was not only racist, but disliked all foreigners.

""Retired army guy"" characters are always idiots in her stories. Young women always seem to be spoiled brats. Even the crimes in the stories are extremely petty and revolve around some kind of inheritance related stuff. There's little to no creativity in the murders.

Arthur Conan Doyle writes about political stuff, management of a aristocrat's estate and even light things about foreign policy. Poirot and his crimes on the other hand deal with the petty and mundane personal matters of posh twats.

Nicotine isn't bad for you. Well, it is, but only about as bad for you as caffeine. And I don't see coffee or red bull being banned any time soon.

As for it appealing to non smokers, yes, that's an issue. Quite a lot of my non smoking friends have tried my e cigs, love the flavour, and often ask for a drag when I'm with them. As far as I'm aware though, none of them have gone out and bought their own. 

Appealing to children? Yes, also an issue. Alcohol also appeals to children. WKD is basically a child's drink, it's marketed to teenagers/young adults. So lets regulate it like alcohol. Put a strict ban on selling them in shops to minors. Make it a criminal offence for an under 18 to be seen using them.

Regulating it online will be a lot trickier. I definitely don't want to see online sales banned, the best e liquid comes from independent sellers online. But surely there's a way to check the age of somebody buying products online? Using their debit card info or something? I don't know.

Advertising is definitely over the top. I don't think TV or radio adverts should be allowed. I think the adverts they have in petrol stations (""The safer alternative to smoking"") is ok.

I definitely don't think it should be regulated to the same degree as cigarettes. It's tobacco that's the killer, and e cigs don't contain any tobacco. 

Basically, they're helping smokers quit in an effective way that's never been seen before, surely that's such a good thing that it outweighs the negative effects. 

Unfortunately, for every person who quits smoking, the government gets less money from taxes. The government doesn't want you to quit smoking. If it did, they would ban cigarettes. So, they'll come up with more and more bullshit excuses to get e cigs off the shelves, which is awful.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; It pains me to say it, but for me the first half of Tony Blair's premiership (maybe even 2/3rds) were about as good as it got.

I think this is pretty much exactly it.
It was a Labour government policy from the end of the Second World War until the election of Thatcher's Conservative government that the government should pursue a policy of full employment.  This was a good thing, but you have to consider it in context.  We may have ""won"" the war, but the UK was pretty much wrecked in the process and rationing continued until nearly the sixties.

The reforms the Conservatives brought about in the eighties laid waste to the economies of huge chunks of the country.  Given the comments I can tell I'm a little younger than keithb, but the background when I was growing up was the IRA blowing something up nearly every week and the rioting and violence that went with first the coal miners' strikes and then the Poll Tax.  Once you dump on top of that the recession of the eighties things were worse back then.

By the second half of Blair's government everything was in a downward spiral and things were already getting worse.  At first getting a job wasn't so much harder, but conditions got worse.  As more and more people were trying to get fewer and fewer jobs employers got meaner about pay and perks.  *(If you're of a mind that says free market economics is the right basis for an economy, this is exactly how it should work.)*

When the banks blew up in 2008 everything hit the wall.  The government threw money at the banks by the shedload to save them and nearly everyone else got hosed.  *(Arguably with the exception of people who have tracker mortgages.  (This is the point where if you believe in capitalism and free-market economics you should think the banks should have been allowed to burn.))*

Anyhow, yeah...  It's always sucked, there was just a brief period where things sucked a bit less.  It'll get better.  But try to remember that next time some idiot tells you boom and bust has been banished and it'll all be good: They're either lying or dumb.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Guys, you have lots of chances to date a Polish girl. Plenty of them dated, dates and even married all types of foreigners while living here (typical white English man included!). I would say it's not the other way around (polish guys being with foreign girls) that often because of couple of reasons but I'm not sure if you want to hear them all as you asked other question.

How to charm? I'm the opposite of expert but probably beside obvious things which most girls like, regardless of their nationality (politeness, gentleman, clean, caring etc), there may be some extra things. Knowing some polish words and sentences is a good start! Being keen on hearing all things Poland and Polish related may help as well. If you were to learn to cook something Polish and then asked her for a dinner and presented some ""Golabki"" or similar I bet she at least would smile widely - as you have shown interest not only in her but also of her country and traditions. Obviously sometimes there may be exceptions and certain girls may not be impressed by things which many other would.

Things to remember - Poles in general are traditional and family people. Don't leave here all the time on her own just to meet with your mates. Do things together (especially if she is keen). Too much sitting in a pub and leaving her alone may kill any relationship (regardless nationality) but if someone values family it can be an even quicker killer.

The A588 between Poulton and Lancaster is a very good road to ride on if you get a nice clear ride without much cagers. You can also carry on from there through Lancaster to Devils bridge.

When the weather gets better the lakes has quite alot of nice roads you just have to explore them.

true,Draegen,null,null,"OK, first answer. It won't be as easy as in Western Europe, but it won't be like going through Mali during a civil war either. It is kind of hard reaching the mountains using public transport alone, you need to rent a vehicle for that and I'd suggest you find someone who has a drivers license to join you. As for the language, young people speak English and some are better than others, you don't have to worry about that... it's part of the charm of traveling really.

I had a friend from Germany who came over by train. Once he arrived in Bucharest main railway station he had no clue what to do next, but he told me that people, even though most didn't speak a word in English, showed him exactly where to go, took him to the right train platform/bus terminal/etc and everybody helped him in a way or another whenever he asked for help. He arrived safe and on time and he was very pleased and excited by the fact that he received so much help.

Good places to visit: Bucharest will probably be your starting point, you need to take a few days to see and feel the city, its nightlife and party atmosphere, but when it comes to sightseeing Bucharest has little to offer. Transylvanian cities on the other hand have more historical monuments and are generally more laid back. Intercity train travel is easy, the trains are mostly new and comfortable, but you have to get used to our slow speeds and frequent delays. Alternatively, you can also travel by coach which is cheaper and a little faster, but less comfortable.

[Brasov](http://www.rcaobligatoriu.ro/images/orase/brasov.jpg) is a must see, especially if you like the mountains. It's about 200 Kilometers away from Bucharest and it takes a 2 and a half hour long train ride to get there from Bucharest. There are plenty of ski resorts around Brasov and the city itself is surrounded by mountains, you can get cool views of the city from the surrounding mountain peaks, such as [this one](http://static.infoturism.ro/destinatia/1295881489_7ef2f06ac70f263.jpg).

true,h33i0,null,null,"I cant speak for her prose but I dont really mind it. I know some people hate it, especially during her time. Her work has been sneered at by literary critics since forever. It's nothing new. A simple google search of ""Agatha Christie criticism"" will show you the wide variety of it.

 The golden age of detective fiction is called that because it began an absolute snowstorm of mystery fiction. Those authors made it famous. They created so many trope during that period, so many cliches, so many different mysteries. It's called the golden age for a reason. detective fiction has never since reached that level of work. Christie is simply the most famous of that generation. It doesnt mean she is the best writer, the dislike of her prose is her faults as a writer rather then the faults of a whole generation of writers. The only thing they had in common was following the style of writing and for pushing the boundary of the genre forward (which Christie did more than any other author)

She is the equivalent of airport pulp. That is why she is the best selling author ever. She was ridiculously successful in her stories (which is one reason for a lot of the criticism). But the criticism of her writing aside, she was instrumental in the detective fiction genre. Her plotting and use of suspense was in no short terms, genius. Many different times, she would create new tropes in the genre. e.g The narrator is the killer, Everyone is the killer etc Her extensive and groundbreaking work in the genre is why she is called the Queen of Crime. To dismiss her work simply because of the prose is a bit short-sighted in my view, as the prose is not the point (which is also why its loathed by literary critics). It's all about the story. 

Unlikely that she would have a stroke, she probably did read it. Most detective writers at the time read everything by ACD. He was the father of the genre. When she began writing her work it is very similar in style to old Conan Doyle, less mystery fiction more of the analytical procedural style of ACD. It did not last long though, her and her contemporaries began moving away from this procedural analytical style of ACD and began pushing the genre forward. 

You really really need to read more of her stuff if you want to make such sweeping generalisations  nor is she is not a closet liberal or progressive or anything. But you are doing her a great disservice. She wrote extensively and set a lot of books on the middle east and the orient. She wrote glowingly about the large amount of time she spent in the middle east and her pet love archaeology. She spent a large amount of her life travelling. Unlike Mrs. Marple she wasnt a dithering old lady stuck in a village (Although Mrs Marple did leave occasionally abroad too). I dont think you can describe her as hating foreigners. 

As for the your criticisms of the books themselves (about the characters, creativity of the deaths etc), you are judging a writer of nearly 70+ books on a couple you have seen or read. You dont get to write that many if they are all the same. Few examples I would say read are, Murder on the Orient Express, And then there were none, The Big four. Those three should at least deal with the suggestion that there is no creativity in her murders. She practically invented most cliches of the genre. Expand beyond Poirot, look at Mrs. Marple and the Tommy and Tuppence books as well. She is incredibly gifted woman in coming up with plots. 

The most ""racist"" she has ever gone in her writing was stereotyping of visual features (Jew with hooked nose), even this would recede as time went by. She reflected the culture she was from. 

There are books like The Big Four that take in a bit of a wider view of the world, but speaking on those issues was not her reason for writing. It's about creating mysteries (which she set around the world) that were complex and in the style of the time, not for discussing modern politics or issues at the time. If she has to, she will occasionally touch on the subject (Aristocratic estate finances are bad, killer wants inheritance, etc) but she will always return to the main point of finding the killer quite quickly.

For example it was commonplace in the 1950s for employers such as Ford to offer final salary pensions to their workers.

Because the typical blue-collar factory worker in 1955 had a life expectancy of 69 years -- i.e. you'd collect your pension for four years after retirement before popping your clogs, which employers could easily afford.

The real culprit that's done away with defined-benefit pensions is the health of the nation. Free and constantly-improving healthcare, better nutrition, and ever-increasing awareness of unhealthy lifestyle risk factors mean that today a typical white collar worker (who are pretty much the only ones left with defined-benefits pensions) can expect to live till their mid-80s.

Lloris won that match for us...without his saves in the last 15 minutes, we would have LOST that match, maybe by two goals even.  I agree it was a reckless challenge, but it wasnt a penalty.  If lloris got meaningful contact on young, it would have been, but lloris got a small touch on young's foot with the back of his shin, not nearly enough to give a penalty, especially considering it wasnt a goal scoring opporunity and the ball had been played. if absolutely no contact had been made between the two, young still would have gone flying in the way he did, as he was trying to avoid contact.  honestly, even if it was a penalty, serves young right for all his shameless diving, i hope he gets fouled in the box 100 more times without getting a penalty. he's scum.

true,Krystie,null,null,"&gt;She reflected the culture she was from.

I have no doubt about that, it's just that Arthur Conan Doyle seemed wayyyyy ahead of his time - Agatha Christie did not.

I see you mention that she brought the genre forward. But I would say she pushed it into a mire of ""cosy"" tropes that her works became a victim of. It's not a good thing when the bulk of a narrative is useless until the final parlor scene. I think the ""cosy"" detective fiction genre itself is terrible. I'm glad that shows like Murder She Wrote and Monk are rarely made anymore, and we get stuff that is more in line with Sherlock Holmes. 

The focus on analytics and forensics is evident even in the most banal of recent detective shows.

&gt;To dismiss her work simply because of the prose is a bit short-sighted in my view, as the prose is not the point (which is also why its loathed by literary critics). It's all about the story.

But the weak prose carries over into the TV series. So it's not just about the quality of individual sentences. It's problems with the delivery of the story and investigation itself.

Every story is: 

1. Poirot goes on a holiday/is a guest somewhere.
2. There's a lot of upper class social exchange
3. Something ""bad"" happens. We're shielded from the brutality of it.
4. Poirot interrogates everyone
5. Parlor scene.

In every single story, 1-4 is invalidated by 5. You feel cheated as the reader in hearing about nonsense and irrelevant small talk. If the characters made fart jokes throughout the story, (5) wouldn't be any different - it really is that inconsequential.

It's an extremely strict framework of storytelling. I just don't see how this is pushing the boundary at all. It's a study in hack writing.

It's like saying the teen slasher horror subgenre ""pushed the boundary"" of horror cinema, by introducing new tropes and a set framework.

&gt;It's all about the story

It's all about the story for Arthur Conan Doyle too. 

Every Sherlock Holmes tale was unexpected and often genius. Every poirot story is pretty much decided before it even begins. There will be a parlor scene, it will be about rich people and their rich people problems, there will never be any brutality or genius criminal.

What makes Poirot's stories so good ? Granted I haven't read many of the actual stories (just really disliked the prose to finish more than a handful).

true,NaughtyBadger,Wales,S. Wales - '11 Street Triple R,"Riding in wet weather isn't *too* different to riding in the dry. Obviously you will be more cautious of the road surface and keep an eye out for any potential risks, e.g. diesel on the road, manhole covers (not really an issue unless you're turning or accelerating hard), increased braking distance, potentially slippery ground when putting your foot/feet down when stopping, etc.

For the most part, a regular rider pushes their bike's tyres to nowhere near the amount they can handle in the dry, never mind the wet, so ""overbanking"" is probably unlikely, though there are many factors that come in to play.

When it comes to braking, you should be using your front brake for any serious stopping power. This stays true for wet weather, but be sure not to grab them in a hurry. Doing so could cause the bike to drop and could end badly (ABS is useful here). Using the rear brake is OK in moderation, but don't rely on it to stay in control if you push on it too hard as your rear could start to skid. As a result, allow plenty of time for braking and apply slow and steady pressure to your brakes (mainly front).

Countering wind will come naturally to you. As long as you stay relaxed and you don't stiffen your arms or become a solid statue, you will be fine. It's important to stay relaxed at all times when it comes to unsteady conditions such as windy areas and bump roads since your front tyre will need to go with the road surface every now and again.  
Suddenly emerging from a large wall, building, high sided vehicle or even a large pillar (think bridges) can surprise you with a sudden gust of wind, so be prepared to possibly be hit by a gust or two when suddenly entering a less protected or more open area.

As long as you're careful of your surroundings and confident with your bike, you should be absolutely fine.

I'd recommend checking out [RoadcraftNottingham](http://www.youtube.com/user/RoadcraftNottingham/videos)'s videos on riding in the wet and also how to handle heavy winds.",0,1388697414,null,0,false,0,cefqx1w,t3_1u98v6,t1_cefqx1w,t3_1u98v6,null,1431771423,17,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,17

When Ade is motivated he is more or less talismanic for a team...he was great when he first got to Monaco, City, Spurs and his loan to Real was fairly successful.

Truth is, if he could consistently perform at his top level we would never have been able to sign him.  He would have never gotten away from City unless it was to go to a team like Real.

When he isn't motivated he is a void on the pitch and has a history of being a pain in the ass to the team. 

I am hoping that, as dumb a decision as it was, AVB freezing Ade out of the team actually resulted in a wake up call to Ade. You have to figure that if AVB was so against having Ade on the team we would have tried to sell him. The fact that we couldn't sell him (and only seemed to have a single team with any interest) speaks volumes about how his market value had shrunk.  The fact that there was such a small market for his services may have served as a eye opener that as talented as a player is there is a level of bullshit that teams don't want to deal with.

AVB freezing him out may have opened up his eyes that he needs to actually work consistently, combine that with Sherwood reintegrating him and we can hope that we see the talismanic Ade from 2 seasons ago for the rest of the season because the alternative is the squad being stuck with the void that we were stuck with last season.

If somehow that figure was to go to let's say 10 or 20% then it is something to be worried about. That's why immigration from outside of EU needs to be tight (1.3bln people in India, 1bln in China - probably at least half would move straight away anywhere West if they had a chance).

&gt;Has living in the UK for 10 years changed your attitude to immigration?

Don't forget that Poland is a rather conservative country. In my city there were like 3 people who came originally from Africa (one doctor, one his son, one basketball player) but that never was an issue for anybody there (in fact getting to that doctor was a privilege as he was very good). In larger cities it was supposedly not uncommon for a foreigner (especially one which after just looking at you knew he came from overseas) to be subjected for some racial remarks. But this was probably years ago and is no longer a bigger case now.

I've noticed however that in UK integration doesn't always work. By using ""liberal"" views some put actual oppression of certain groups as legal (I'll say it - women and burkhas, abortion due to gender, arranged marriages etc). This just shouldn't be allowed or there should be proper programs fighting with that inequality. One extra thing I learned is that it's obvious that people who come from a country where war (so crime, killings etc) is something normal will most probably have an increased risk of copying their actions in the new country. UK can't allow to say it publicly now as it's ""racist"". I don't mean saying and treating differently someone who comes from country x specifically different but at some national, government regulated level it should be used to solve the issue and for example increase integration of certain groups of people.",0,1388698149,null,0,false,0,cefra01,t3_1u8a5s,t1_cefra01,t1_cefpuyc,null,1431771595,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I haven't had a real cigarette in months and I'm only using the cheap Nicolite e-cigs. I wanted to quit smoking because it was extremely expensive and it was making me feel like absolute shit. The e-cig is a great way for me to keep having the satisfying sensation of smoking sans the poisonous crap and the tar. Not to mention it's 10 times cheaper.

I have a friend who started using e-cigarettes despite never smoking a real cigarette in his life. Predictably he is now addicted to nicotine. He's a bit of an idiot. But as long as he never switches over to *real* cigarettes, I'm not going to freak out. Nicotine is about as harmful as caffeine and yes, you can get nicotine poisoning. You can get caffeine poisoning. Alcohol poisoning. You can overdose on paracetamol. *A lot* of legal substances are lethal if you take a large enough amount. 

Electronic cigarettes are safer than real cigarettes. I won't say they're safe. But they're *safer.* They don't have any tar or carcinogens. They have propylene glycol vapour with nicotine and that's it. My quality of life has improved dramatically since I made the switch. My lungs don't hurt any more. I don't get winded walking to the supermarket. My oxygen blood levels are back up to almost 100%. My circulation and my blood pressure are both optimal again. I'm *healthy* again. All thanks to electronic cigarettes making it easy for me to stop smoking real cigarettes as painlessly as possible. Am I still addicted to nicotine? Yes. But I'm no longer consuming the chemicals that were ruining my health and shortening my lifespan.

If the government wants to clamp down on electronic cigarettes or make them less freely available, the only people I'm going to blame are the tobacco industry lobbyists and the politicians who have been bought by them.

true,h33i0,null,null,"There is a simple misunderstanding at play here. There are different types of crime fiction. Christie writes one type of crime fiction (Mystery fiction), ACD is the father of another type (Police Procedural). You are not separating the two types. 

None of the things you stated can be taken as criticism of the Christie as they are central to the subgenre. The cozy settings, the lack of brutality, the reveal (not always a parlour), puzzle plot
structure, unpopular victims, murderer introduced early, all clues given. They are the motif of the whole subgenre. Not liking that is simply not liking the golden age style, that is all fair enough. You just have to move on. If you like reading detective novels, try more police procedural or hardboiled style detective fiction. 

What you dont seem to like is the traditional style, murder she wrote and monk hark back to that style a lot. If you would like to know why they are seen as pushing the genre forward there are a lot of studies and books on detective fiction. I can recommend some. Otherwise this will give you more information: 

[Here](http://www.stiba-malang.com/uploadbank/pustaka/MKSASTRA/CRIME%20FICTION.pdf), is a pdf thats can serve as a basic introduction to the whole genre. 

This is a thesis that argues with a lot of what you said. To quote it

&gt; Contrary to popular criticism, 
Christie and Marsh were surprisingly progressive and forward thinking on this subject. 
Chapter three considers how both authors employed setting to emphasise these changes. Both 
Christie and Marsh used foreign settings to highlight British society and its flaws, and Marsh 
used her New Zealand settings to consider the relationship between Britain and her home. 
The final chapter will consider why Golden Age detective fiction was so popular: what was 
the appeal?

It's extremely common to go over-time on the PhD, so you have funding for ~3 years at the princely sum of ~£14.5k per year (tax-free mind, not that there is much above the personal threshold at that level anyway) but most people take 4 years to finish. And by most I mean most - it isn't just lazy students... the problem is that the research groups want you to publish papers and you want to publish papers and that means you aren't getting the thesis written up which is very long so can take a long time to write.

Anyway the short of it is that you are funded for X months and most people take X+6 months to finish. So for 6 months you are living off whatever savings you were able to cobble together whilst on your lavish stipend.

Also applying for academic positions at the end can be a bit of a nightmare which can also require a nest-egg to live off as well.

Unfortunately they don't tell you this until after you start the PhD and often send the doe-eyed 2nd year students to talk to you at interviews rather than the jaded and bitter finishing students you find down the pub once you've begun.

Compare that to the inherently non-toxic LD50 of water, 90g/kg (90ml/kg)^[[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication), or 6.3L of water to kill the average 70kg male, and you can see how easy it is to kill yourself with nicotine vs how hard it is to kill yourself with water.

Water is not naturally a toxin, and does not have any real effect on the body besides changing the natural osmotic potential. Compare that to nicotine, which is a well-documented stimulant and highly effective nicotinic agonist, and you can see why your comparison is **fucking poor**.

^( * Fun fact: 70 cigarettes to die of a nicotine overdose, but I think you'd have more pressing issues on your mind if you did this.)

It was fairly difficult to find a full-time job until the John Major era. From about 1985 to about 1990 it was very easy to get part time or temp work - taking advantage of the property and credit boom, and the last years before offices were entirely computerised. You could literally walk out of one job and have another from the same agency the same day.

I had a lot of work as a filing clerk, unskilled building labour, temporary warehouse, and retail.

In the 90s much unskilled office work tailed off, with the exception of data entry and the rise of call centre work. Increasing certification meant there were entry jobs in construction but you needed to sort out your paperwork. Retail was still easy to get into, as was warehouse work.

Only people who seem to use are among the dregs of society! Why is it that only criminal gangs, chavs and overall bad people. Nothing good can come out of it. Leave it to the americans to want to turn all their citizens in to deluded junkies who steal and rob to feed their addiction.

This became a vicious cycle of even higher inflation leading to even higher pay rises, until extremely painful measures had to be taken to restore sanity to the economy.

The British were the first recorded Europeans to discover the Falkland Islands.  The Spanish had created a colony in what is now Argentina, and the British built a fort on the Falklands at Port Edgemont.  When the Spaniards who were starting to settle on the Falklands discovered the fort, all hell broke loose.

It was in 1832 that a rebellion (of sorts) against the attempt of Buenos Aires to establish a government led to Britain's reacquisition of the Falklands...and that is the source of today's problems.

Instead of recognizing the right of the local populace to self determination, Argentina continues to demand the islands for themselves.   Frankly, I doubt even a plebiscite would satisfy them.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;I honestly think nationalising some food production to produce cheap basics, bread, vegetables, etc. Then giving out a 'ration' each week, would be a good idea.

Food is cheap as hell. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

If anyone is going hungry in this country it's their own fault, not yours and not the governments. 

4KG of rice = £4.78

400g loaf of bread = £0.50

400g can of mixed beans = £0.70

1KG Frozen mixed veg = £0.75

1KG Frozen chicken breasts = £3.99

750g Mince beef = £5

In terms of getting what you need nutritionally it's impossible to starve in this country. 

&gt;Sounds a little communist I know, but I cannot think of a more efficient method of food production.

Which is absurd considering the one universal stumbling block for every communist country ever has been food production. 

Nationalized energy and/or transport I could maybe get behind, but food production is just ridiculous. It's not a large expense unless you make it one. 

Also, we're an importer of food. Very little is made here. You know what's more efficient than making people in the UK farm? Making people in bongo bongo land do the same work for 1/8th of the wages.

Bread and Veg for free would see a big rise in healthy eating, which in turn would save a lot of money on the NHS. Hell if you do it properly it might actually make money.

On top of that there would be less wastage, rather than throwing away a wonky carrot, shove it in the free section.

The most likely outcome I've seen is that Scotland could give up rights to any remaining North Sea oil in exchange for a reduction in their share of national debt. Current estimations put Scotlands share of the debt at [£81bn](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/feb/27/scotland-independent-debt-deficit) with £100bn extra in bank bailouts that would be owed to the UK.

Also [other estimates of debt are far higher than £181bn](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9018567/Independent-Scotland-would-have-270bn-debt-pile.html), interest payments on these debt estimates are £5-10bn pa.

You've also got to bare in mind that whatever way you look at it, at the moment Scotland gets a pretty sweet deal from Westminster, there are a lot of things England/Wales could press Scotland on, which they don't (charging EU students less in tuition fees than students from England is a prime example).

&gt; 0.5-1.0 mg/kg can be a lethal dosage for adult humans

My numbers were wrong, but in entirely the wrong direction. 70mg at the high end to kill a fully-grown human is trivial, and is 2.4ml of high-strength liquid, or 7ml of low-strength liquid.

&gt;Going by your own numbers, how is someone going to ACCIDENTALLY inhale 12 bottles of vaporiser? Never mind doing it over a short enough time to get a Cmax high enough to kill themselves?

Let's not forget that you can simply ingest nicotine. Well, taking these new numbers, drinking 2.4ml of nicotine supplement is fairly trivial I'd say, likewise would drinking 12 10ml bottles be both absolutely lethal and relatively easy. Making the assumption that ""nobody would ever consider drinking that stuff"" is bad practice, and a lethal mistake to make. EDIT: Lest we forget that nicotine is absorbed readily through the skin. A concentrated nicotine solution absorbed through the skin can very readily cause an overdose, and cannot be vomited out or readily excreted from the body - as with other methods of ingestion.

&gt;Don't forget we are comparing the relative dangers to pretty horrible chronic lung diseases.

No, we're considering the dangers of a new system which strips away all previous common-knowledge lethality, making it ""safe"" in the eyes of Mr. Joe Bloggs, hard-working man.

Actually, by questioning *their* freedom of movement, that's *exactly* what you're doing.

Aha. Of the **British**. So your concern about the well-being of those incomers was fake indeed. Doesn't that make you a big, fat hypocrite?

You know what? Let's have that debate. But I mean a real debate, not just one side spewing off half-truths and outright lies with the fire support of the Daily Mail. Let's consider what would happen to the NHS if it lost all the medical and paramedical staff from other EU countries, and at the same time had to provide health care for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Britons currently living in France, Spain, Italy or Greece. Let's talk about what would happen to your prosperity and success, if the City lost all of its foreign talent. Let's imagine what would happen to British research and education without the influx of foreign students and researchers. But let's think also about how most British industry and services would do with all those immigrants doing menial jobs, from Spanish baristas to Polish plumbers. Let's debate that.

&gt;  whether the EU really has the best wishes of the British at its heart

The EU has neither your nor anybody's best wishes ""at heart"". It is not a person, nor some shadowy cabal. The EU is a union of sovereign states of which we are the citizens. And it will become whatever *we* make of it.

On another note, I gave a marshall some verbal on Wednesday who was telling us to sit down. We'd been standing for less than 7 seconds, which I explained to him in simple terms.

I was in an awful mood, it was still 0-1 and we were playing like crap.

The no-standing rule is almost perfectly designed to allow stewards to kick-out anyone in the crowd they deem fit. If he'd have kicked me out I could've had no recourse to get my season ticket back. That could have been it for the season or even longer.

2 years ago I totally lost it at a bunch of people, all wearing QPR scarves and shirts, leaving 10 mins before the end of the game. We were losing and I told them they shouldn't be wearing the colors if they didn't support the team. One of them told me to 'f*ck off', which was fair enough. Again we were losing and again it had put me in a bad mood.

I sit over the only exit in X block; when 50+ people decide to leave it's right in front of the visiting supporters and they always take the piss. Some people wearing QPR gear don't seem to care and just leave as if they are somehow entitled to see QPR win in an entertaining way.


I'm surrounded by season ticket holders. Behind me is a young couple; they are really nice people, but arrive 10 mins late for every game, go downstairs 5 mins before halftime, arrive 5 mins late back and leave 5 mins early - unless they see me have a go at some supporters for doing the same.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Actually, by questioning their freedom of movement, that's exactly what you're doing.

They have freedom of movement to move to the UK because **we** say they do. Not the EU. The UK is the sovereign state here, not the EU. So by extension we have every right as a nation to question peoples freedom of movement into the UK (although to question our own peoples freedom to move out of the UK would be a massive human rights infringement - assuming it doesn't break the laws of their intended destination). In effect its a case of the playground *""our ball, our rules""*.

&gt; Aha. Of the British. So your concern about the well-being of those incomers was fake indeed. Doesn't that make you a big, fat hypocrite?

No. I don't owe anything to the EU. They aren't sovereign. Favoring the British doesn't make me a hypocrite - if you re-read my original post I am arguing that I would not like to see future **British** youths treated the way Spanish and Portuguese youths are in their own countries and the EU. My concern isn't about them, they joined the EU for their own reasons and that is something they have to balance up alone, as do we. My concern is about us and our future. 

&gt; Which ones? Can you care to give some names?

My point here is that if you look back at the creation of the EU, you'll see that after initially being floated by the UK, it actually became a primarily Franco-german union aimed at combating a perceived anglo-saxon dominance in economic and political affairs. i.e. Americanization (which at the time was seen to be an extension of the British style of economy and government). It was for that reason Charles de Gaulle in particular prevented UK entry to the union for many years. Times may have changed but certain aspects of the EU are still constructed around that idea that is should act as a counterweight to the English speaking world - and elements such as a financial transactions tax that would benefit the EU as an organization, at the expense of the UK are examples of that... rather than pump development cash into building up the city of London as Europe's financial cent re, they would sooner see it chipped away to make other European markets stronger. I.e. they aren't capitalizing on what we do best, because of a deep seated ideological drive away from the UK towards Europe.

true,crucible,null,null,"&gt; The major problems with the UK rail network at the moment seem to stem from it's age and inherited neglect from the 70's/80's. 

Network Rail seem to be doing their best to put this right now, but like I say the current electrification schemes should really have been done years ago. The problem is that in the 80s BR were making a tidy profit through the InterCity sector alone, but they had to practically fight with the Government of the day just to electrify the East Coast main line, for example. It wasn't all bad though: IIRC the budget allocated to InterCity for the Advanced Passenger Train was reallocated when that project was scrapped. It went to the regional sectors and funded a lot of the 1980s era Class 31x EMUs.

&gt; As you would use pretty much uniform rolling stock, you can use metro-style platform edge doors to prevent costly platform suicides.

The trouble then is you have to build all your future rolling stock to fit the edge doors otherwise you will be replacing the doors too in 35 years when you buy new trains. That said they seem to have fencing and gates on the platform edges of Japanese Shinkansen stations so it can be done.

&gt; New stations would be better designed, more capacious, more comfortable, and would integrate with local transport services in a better way.

Older stations are being massively rebuilt though; look at Birmingham New Street and Reading. Mancester Piccadilly is very good now too. Better integration with other transport serices is needed though. If you go to European cities like Geneva they have done this, there is a bus station by the main railway station and the tram line stops there too.

&gt; However, I find it difficult to digest the cost. I have little faith in the UK to undertake any major construction project at under triple the original budget. Budget management in general seems to be pretty poor in this country - I wouldn't disagree with a 1p per litre tag on fuel duty to pay for rail infrastructure projects, but this would spiral higher and higher and would end up paying for London Underground running costs. 

I agree with all of this. Yeah we brought the Olympics in on time - just. However it was massively overbudget. We can't even build a football stadium without it running late and overbudget - look at Wembley for example. Better still look at the fiasco with turning the Olympic Park into another football stadium...

&gt; I have no real gripe with spending on a London-Birmingham corridor as this is clearly one of the busiest rail corridors, but it does feel like other parts of the country are forgotten about. We're still running around in urine-soaked, condom-peppered 30-40 year old railbuses.

My personal hope is that electrification will cascade newer class 166 or 170 DMUs to replace older Class 150s and Pacers. If HS2 gets built, you don't want people getting off a gleaming new high speed train and transferring to a clapped-out 40 year old DMU to finish their journey on.

&gt; When will electrification reach Wales, the Westcountry and the North?

North is being done now, Phase 1 of North West electrifcation should be running now with new Class 350/4 units for TransPennine Express. Of course the big stuff like Liverpool - Manchester and Manchester - Leeds has yet to be done but should be done by the end of this decade.

South Wales will get electrification with London - Swansea. It was originally planned to only electrify the route between London and Cardiff, but when the commuter lines in the South Wales Valleys were added, that took the main line electrification as far as Bridgend. Swansea was an easy extension after that. Again this should all be done by 2020 with the possible exception of South Wales valleys.

North Wales is not getting any electrification. There are lots of 'what-ifs' being talked about for future schemes but no concrete plans yet. The obvious initial plans would be to electrify Crewe to Chester then you can do Chester - Holyhead and cover the North Wales Coast main line. My local line, Wrexham to Bidston, joins up with Merseyrail at the Bidston end. It could easily be electrified but Network Rail are against any more 3rd rail electrification now.

Bristol is as far as the westcountry will get in terms of electrification, personally I think it should be to Exeter really.

It's offensive to me that cannabis is illegal. It's offensive to me that people believe and repeat blatantly false things about cannabis.

It should it be fully decriminalised, and only regulated as loosely as the far more harmful substance *alcohol* - i.e. sold only to the over 18s, in pretty much any corner shop, cafe, restaurant or place of entertainment.

However I don't think it should be taxed as highly as alcohol - because it has no public order effect that leads to an increased cost to the community - and because it has negligible public health costs (despite the rare cherry-picked studies to the contrary).

Medical purposes are another issue, and let's not confuse the two. However I have worked as a PA for someone with severe multiple sclerosis.

Adebayor is very much playing as a second striker at the moment, so he's almost like an another attacking midfielder.  And our best one at that.  Plus, we are already playing three of our centre mids if Eriksen starts on the left.

I think we will run aground at some point if we rely on Adebayor and Soldado starting every match, but I think that's more a problem with our acquisitions in the summer than the formation.  I always thought we needed to buy two strikers, not just Bobby.

If Defoe leaves, then we'll need to buy two players to replace him I feel.  Ideally a pacy, direct forward with a bit of experience, and a younger lad with potential.  I imagine Sherwood might be planning of using some of our young players, but nothing I've ever seen from Kane has impressed me that much.

true,h33i0,null,null,"The bad writing is an issue with Christie not the whole style. Ronald Knox for instance is a good writer with good prose but is also a staple of the Golden age. 

You cannot conflate her faults with the whole style. The point of the golden age style is to focus on the mystery. The reader is not giving the facts bit by bit to goes through a journey analysing the details alongside the detective (a la Sherlock Holmes). That is a different style. They are given everything to solve the mystery themselves because the onus is on the reader to find out. It is a whodunnit. 

And believe me it is not as hacked as the butler did it. Christie as well as other authors loathed a obvious ending. They went out of their way to make it as unexpected as before. Really go check out the plots to a couple of christie stories, and see if the killer is the expected person. You'll find more often than not, it is the most unexpected person (to the point that this in itself because a cliche) who is the killer. I think you may have conflated a couple of episodes of the show and have this image of her work that may not be necessarily true. I would urge you to read a bit more of her books, as its hard to discuss her work without specific examples. 

In fact her last Poirot book is one of my favourite novels. Having read all of the poirot books, once you get to it, its really as unexpected as ever. There is a killer, poirot is old and ill, identifies the killer. She lulls you into a sense of comfort, that its going to be a traditional end to the series. Instead poirot himself kills the killer and dies soon after. The moral detective becomes a murderer himself. There are even more crazy twists, like murder on the orient express when there is a death in a overnight train carriage. Poirot reveals to the carriage of people, after his investigation, that every passenger in that carriage participated in the murder and stabbed the man to death. Or the story, ""and then there were none"", after reading that plot you can't surely argue about a lack of creativity. 

Most of this stuff was not popular immediately. Christie was really out of the norm, a lot of her contemporaries wrote in the style a lot but did not find popular success. I wouldn't say it was a callous as ""write whatever sells"". There were whole groups and organisations (e.g. Detection Club) devoted to this style of fiction. To quote the Detection Club (Christie was a main member) oath:

&gt; Do you promise that your detectives shall well and truly detect the crimes presented to them using those wits which it may please you to bestow upon them and not placing reliance on nor making use of Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God?

That as well as giving the reader a chance to solve the mystery before the conclusion you begin to understand what they stood for. They had an idea of what a good murder mystery was, and they wrote about in a wholly unique way. As a whole that generation of writers were not just writing for the sake of money or popularity, they worked hard on their craft and took it extremely seriously (the creation of murder mysteries).

If this was ever, *EVER* a safe mantra to use, we wouldn't have half the restrictions on over-the-counter drugs and medications that we do, or child-proof pill bottles, or any other safety mechanisms against stupid people. It's incredibly difficult to overdose on painkillers such as paracetamol, but that doesn't mean that people don't try, nor does it mean that we should entirely disregulate paracetamol as a drug.

If you look back you'll see I've revised my numbers, the fact that one bottle of e-liquid contains more than 4x the mean lethal dose of nicotine doesn't bother you, at all? Bioavailability taken into account, that's still a dangerous amount of _any_ substance.

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt;Wait you think the UK is just going to let Scotland walk away? Debt free? I can't see that happening. At all.

Nobody thinks that.

&gt; The most likely outcome I've seen is that Scotland could give up rights to any remaining North Sea oil in exchange for a reduction in their share of national debt. 

I really don't think so. I don't know where you saw that, but I've never seen it proposed as a serious option. For starters, there's estimated to be ~40 years worth of oil left in the North Sea, not to mention new fields being found off the northwest coast. Scotland's share of the UK's debt (8-9%, assuming it's being calculated per capita) would be something like £100bn. 

It's fair to assume that the estimates of the remaining oil's worth has been respectively over- and under-estimated by the Scottish government (£1.5tn) and the UK government (£120bn), but either way it's more than the debt figure. 

&gt;You've also got to bare in mind that whatever way you look at it, at the moment Scotland gets a pretty sweet deal from Westminster

You think so? 8.3% of the population raise 9.9% of the UK's tax revenues and receive 9.3% of public spending.

&gt;there are a lot of things England/Wales could press Scotland on, which they don't (charging EU students less in tuition fees than students from England is a prime example).

Short of drastically reducing Scotland's funding (or voting to leave the EU), there isn't actually anything they could do about that. It's in accordance with EU law. Also worth noting that Scottish students are charged to attend university in England/Wales/NI.

&gt;and as most analysis says that Scotland would find it hard to operate with its share of the national debt

I too am from Poland and have been in UK for 7 years now.
Just to add couple of things people I met found interesting/strange about Poland:

FOOD

* we have cake called 'tits of a black woman' ('cycki murzynki') which looks like, well, black woman's tits [recipe with picture](http://www.winiary.pl/przepis.aspx/65288/cycki-murzynki) (and tastes great, get if from polish shop near you)
* we also have a cocoa cake called 'black child' ('murzynek', diminutive of 'murzyn' - a black person) [recipe with picture](http://www.winiary.pl/przepis.aspx/4043/murzynek-przekladany)
* if I'm drinking something that smells like breast milk, it's most likely [kefir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir)
* when I say that I like 'white cheese' I really mean [Quark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(cheese\)) - it's somewhere in between of curd and cottage cheese and polish name ""biały ser"" translates literally to ""white cheese""
* we eat raw beef/horse meat with raw eggs and raw onions ['tatar' - 'steak tartare'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare)

HISTORY

* [Poland lost its sovereignty and was gone from maps for 123 years from 1795](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Partition_of_Poland) and only regained independence after WWI. During Third Partition period we were split between Russia, Prussia and Austria. There is a place near town Myslowice (where I was born) called [Three Emperors' Corner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Emperors%27_Corner) where the borders of Russian, German and Austrian empires met - this is a place where people from neighbouring cities speak bit different dialects (different pronunciation of common words and also many polish words replaced with russian/german equivalents) - they also regularly fight each other to the point that you can get punched on the street for speaking in a wrong way. I'd say most 'big' poles here in UK come from this area. 

PLACES

&gt;Scotland accounts for 8.4% of the UK population, 8.3% of the UK's total output and 8.3% of the UK's non-oil tax revenues - but 9.2% of total UK public spending.

&gt;Scottish Executive figures for 2009-10 show that spending per capita in Scotland was £11,370, versus £10,320 for the UK. In other words, spending in Scotland was £1,030 - or 10% higher - per head of population than the UK average.

&gt;What about revenues? The same source shows Scottish total non-oil tax revenues coming in at £42.7bn in 2009-10, or £8,221 per head, which compares with total public expenditure attributable to Scotland of £59.2bn, or £11,370 per head.

&gt;On this basis, Scotland 'got' £16.5bn more in UK public spending in 2009-10 than it contributed to total UK revenues - or a 'subsidy' of around £3,150 per head.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;Wait you think the UK is just going to let Scotland walk away? Debt free? I can't see that happening.

No, I'm saying Scotland would be free of the *interest* on the UK's national debt. 

Scotland's share of the UK's debt is smaller, both proportionally and by amount then most other places in the UK. However, there is interest on the UK's national debt, and particularly debt-ridden areas of the UK cause this interest to rise. Scotland (and other parts of the UK) end up paying more than their own debts warrant because this.

If Scotland goes independent it loses these debt-ridden areas, meaning the rate at which the interest on it's nation debt increase is far slower. 

At least, I *think* that's how it works, it's a bit confusing.

&gt; Current estimations put Scotlands share of the debt at £81bn with £100bn extra in bank bailouts that would be owed to the UK.

[It is very difficult to say what Scotland's debt would be. However, GERS has estimated, with a population share, Scotland's share of debt would be £92 billion which is 62% of estimated GDP, but using an estimated fiscal balance, the debt would be £56 billion, which is 38% of Scotland's GDP. Many different totals can be calculated using different assumptions.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24866266) I think it is difficult to say for sure how much debt Scotland would take, it could be that Scotland would take a higher amount in exchange for other settlements. That being said, I feel that the £181 billion is so high (and the source so dubious) that it could be disregarded as erroneous. 

Your point about bank bailouts is interesting, I haven't come across it before. The thing that immediately comes to my mind is that it might be unfair to burden Scotland with this cost given that, to my knowledge, the Scottish Government had no say in whether the banks should have been bailed out, but then no one outside of Westminster did, really. Again, some form of remuneration could be agreed as a bargaining chip.

&gt;You've also got to bare in mind that whatever way you look at it, at the moment Scotland gets a pretty sweet deal from Westminster.

Not *really*, most serious people even in the London establishment acknowledge that the subsidies and profits break even, and many claim that there are various ""hidden costs"" such as the distribution of MoD spending, BBC and various other things.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I honestly think part of the reason for people's distaste in 4-4-2 is that it harks back to the bad old days of British football, where it was very much kick and run, with little tactical innovation or sophistication.  Times have changed hugely though.  Look how many British managers are in charge of the top six teams, and how many British players are in their starting elevens!  Very few.  The EPL has massively swung away from ""British"" football to a more continental European style of play.

The modern trend away from 4-4-2 began when continental managers wanted an extra body in midfield. You had an extra guy to protect your back four, and could keep possession better, enabling you to launch a precise attack towards your one striker.  Mourinho's Chelsea and Inter sides did this very well, often creating relatively few attacking chances, but the ones they did were quality and were taken very well.

The thing is, formations are just the starting point for a team's tactics, not the whole deal.  It doesn't completely determine the players in the team, nor their roles and movement.  What I love about Sherwood's 4-4-2 is that he's granted a level of freedom to the players that at times has made us seem like we've got an extra man both in midfield AND upfront.  Adebayor and Soldado both regularly drop into midfield to provide an extra man and linkage play, Eriksen drifts in from the left to create overloads in the centre of the pitch, and Lennon and Walker stretch play out on the right to dominate the opponent's left wing.

In yesteryear, strike duos often were pretty one-dimensional.  Either big man and small man, or a creator and a finisher.  Nowadays we've seen a huge shift from specialist players to more generalists, who can perform a number of roles on the pitch at once (look for example at how Mourinho prefers Oscar - a CAM with a high defensive workrate - over Mata - an arguably more talented CAM with a low defensive workrate).  Players like Suarez and Aguero are able to play as both creators AND finishers, and even wingers is you ask them to.  Adebayor has already shown that he can do both, and so utilising him in a front two is far more effective than playing him alone upfront, where he is stuck between two CBs with little ability to roam and play to the strengths and variety in his game.  Soldado's more of a pure finisher, but is showing tremendous capacity to roam the pitch and create things in recent games.

With fired up, fit players who can run all day and know how to find space, Sherwood's 4-4-2 can be devastating.  The real test will be against a team with a strong, midfield-heavy style of play, like Arsenal or Chelsea.

true,devineman,logo,,"&gt;Right now all I've got on Soriano and Bergiristain is the signings they were involved in and Negredo, Navas and Demichelis have all proved to be good buys imo.

Yeah but look at the ages.  Negredo is 28, Navas is 28, Demichelis is 33.   My point was that Txiki isn't going to buy us a bunch of young players that we have to develop, he buys ready made players.

Marwood, for all of his faults, was the guy who setup a massive amount of our connections for youth products and brought them into the Club.  He was also the lead guy on the Academy project.  I'm obviously no major fan of his but structurally and scouting wise, Marwood managed to outshine what Txiki has done so far.  We just haven't brought in any talented young players for the under 18s under Begiristain and haven't brought in any to the first team.

Let's face it, if this guy was called Terry Burgerstain and used to play for Barnet nobody would care about him.  The fact that he was DoF right at the time that Iniesta, Valdes, Biscuits and Messi came through (for which he can take absolutely no credit) artifically inflates his record.

Let's actually look at the people he signed at Barca:

---

*First Season*

Larsson

Albertini

Guily

Edmilson

Belletti

Sylvinho

van Bronckhorst

Deco

Eto'o

All over the age of 28 outside of Deco and Eto'o.  Deco cost 21m and Eto'o 24m.  Eto'o was a smash hit, Deco not so much.

---

*Second Season*

van Bommel

Ezquerro

Again, both over 28

---

*Third Season*

Zambrotta

Thuram

Gudjohnsson

All over 28

---

*Fourth Season*

Henry

Yaya

Abidal

Milito

Pinto

Yaya was 24ish, Milito was 26 but turned into a Santa Cruz for them.  Rest 28 or over.

---

*Fifth Season*

Keita

Pique

Alves

Hleb

Henrique

Caracas

Arguably the youngest transfer haul that he's ever done.  Alves was about 25 and Pique/the last 2 were teenage/early 20s.  Pique was homegrown at the Club and initially snatched by United, the other two flopped harder than a beer belly in a swimming pool.

---

*Sixth Season*

Ibrahimovic

Kerrison

Maxwell

Chygrynskiy

2 old, 2 young.  Both youngsters flopped.

---

I suppose my problem with him is that he is a man who is in charge at the Club that I support and in his life he has only ever bought a handful of players under the age of 28 and in particularly every player he has ever bought under the age of 24 has completely flopped outside of Pique.

This is a man with the best job in football.  He controls a transfer budget into the hundreds of millions, he has a youth Academy underneath him with unlimited spending power and resources, he has an already existing worldwide scouting network setup by his predecessor at a desirable Club to play for.  He has the keys to our castle.

He had exactly the same thing at Barca and threw it all away on a bunch of older men with good agents and the odd youngster who is a punchline in football.  

So ask yourself this question.  **Why does a man with his record get a job specifically to buy and bring through youth footballers?**  The answer is because he is mates with the CEO.  I hated that bullshit with Marwood and Cooke and I doubly hate it with Soriano and Txiki.

I want us to employ the guys employed before these two at Barcelona.  Or image what the guys from Ajax could do with our budget and Academy?

I want us to buy the best players in the world, have the best manager in the world, the best coach in the world, the best groundsman in the world, the best social media department in the world, the best tea lady in the world and the best Directors in the world.  Now ask yourself this question; given his record of achievements is Txiki Bergiristan the best possible candidate for the job that he has to do at Manchester City?

My answer is no.

&gt;I remember last summer you said our best signings were Txiki and Ferran, what changed your mind?

He's a liar.  He lied to the fans, he lied to Mancini, he lied about his credentials, he lied to Barca fans, he lied to the Barca staff and the Police and he lied to the press.  We've had CEOs before who are out and out liars and they've always wrecked every promising thing that has happened to us, Mackintosh nearly ended us not too long ago.  I'm not exactly some wet behind the ears kid who wants some beacon of morality to be in charge but Soriano is way off the deep end.",0,1388706562,null,0,false,0,cefv5p8,t3_1u83if,t1_cefv5p8,t1_cefmyay,null,1431773423,4,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,4

The current regulation (or lack of it) is fine, there's a bit of a cottage industry developing all over the world in mixing interestingly flavoured juice as long as people understand how to safely handle and store nicotine containing juice (i.e. don't spill too much of it on your skin, don't drink it, keep the fuck out of the reach of children).

Personally my biggest problem with the whole thing is deciding who is and isn't Scottish. I know people who are deliberately living just across the border for an extra few years than they planned to so that they will be eligible for Scottish citizenship if the Yes vote wins.

I'm sorry. I'm not trying to offend you or your friend. As an artist myself, I understand that everyone is a critic and not all criticism is friendly. But I do mean this in a friendly way: the pose is bland, boring, cliche and flat. It isn't dynamic and it doesn't show the motion your friend intended. Amy doesn't look like she's running towards anything. She merely looks like a Barbie whose waist has been swiveled around.

A few minor tweaks could show more motion: have her torso angled slightly towards the ground, shift her shoulders to show the weight leaning on her straight leg, and lift her ""up"" leg away from the other so that she doesn't look like she's trying to pin an aspirin between her knees. 

Have you ever heard of the ""line of action""? The line of action shows, in a dynamic pose, the movement of the character. Amy's ""line of action"" is basically a straight line from the top of her head to her weight-bearing foot, which is why is doesn't look like she's running. It's also why the pose is not dynamic.

Whether your friend takes our critiques to heart or not is up to him, but I sincerely hope he does. Judging by this piece and the artwork on his blog you linked, he's got a lot of talent and a very fun style. But he does need to break out of the ""box of female poses"" and just do *poses*. Think about the action and intent he wants to convey, and then do it. This pose does not do that in the least. Action first, pose second; this seems to have been done vice-versa. And it's such a shame, because the rest of the picture is so interesting! I love what he did with the Doctor and van Gogh. I wish he had followed through with Amy.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;Good points, but I think the bank bailout is very significant, particularly given that HBOS and RBS are both fundamentally Scottish banks. Unfortunately you can't argue 'we didn't ask for this', because in this particular version of democracy you did, when you voted in the national election for your MP to represent you in parliament. Sucks doesn't it.

True, but then a fundamental point of the independence movement is that Scotland receives very little say in how the country is run due to the Westminster system, and because all representation is proportional. 

Furthermore, wasn't the point of the bailout that the *banks* themselves would eventually pay it back? This would make sense as both banks where private companies.

Furthermore, the extent to which these banks are ""Scottish"" is debatable. HBOS is *headquartered* in Scotland, but owned by Lloyds, an English bank. By your same logic Scotland should get all of it's money that was used to bail out banks not headquartered in Scotland, such as Lloyds, Northern Rock, Bradford and Bingley and various insolvent firms.

&gt;Personally my biggest problem with the whole thing is deciding who is and isn't Scottish.

Yeah, it's certainly a can of worms, but you have to draw the line *somewhere* I suppose. And, I'm sure most problems would be sorted within the 2 years between the vote and going independent.

Our food is very fat, we eat a lot of pork, we eat a lot of smoked meat. We have a lot of different types of sausages, [Slănina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sl%C4%83nin%C4%83), smoked or not. 

I personally like sheep cheese more than cow, and I think it's pretty common among romanians. 


We have some good foods with minced meat like ""[mici](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mici)"", soup with meat-balls and bors, [sarmale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmale#Preparation)(the first three pictures are romanian), varza a la Cluj(minced meat, rice, bacon, and a lot of cabbage), ardei umpluti (zucchinis, tomatoes and more commonly bell peppers stuffed with a minced meat, rice and onions among the main ingredients), we make meatballs but in a different way(in some places they're flat not round, made from a mix of potatoes, garlic, onions, carrots and minced pork and cow meat).    

And a lot of different regional recipes with a lot of things, from delicious and unhealthy baked beans with smoked bacon(best served with pickles), the cheap ""mancare de cartofi"" made with potatoes and smoked bacon as the main ingredients, to the very healthy chicken soup with semolina dumplings. 

Also, because of a lot of religious fasting rituals, we have a lot of vegetarian food and vegetarian versions of popular romanian dishes. 



So, as a sort of a tl;dr, the things you should be looking forward to are the smoked meat products that you can use to make a lot of interesting dishes using common british food like cabbage, beans and potatoes. And although some would argue that the bulgarians do them better, the pickles are incredibly delicious (and unhealthy).

Say you're a politician and you're in a party that wants to legalise. Great stuff. Well first of all you've got to get the electorate onboard - that's going to be hard, because the electorate rightly or wrongly may(!) mostly want it to remain illegal. So you are faced with either going with the electorates wishes or leading on principle - something we crucify politicians for every day on here.

But anyway say we pass the law and everyone goes crazy for the first few months. Things will settle down, sure - but how does the 'group' handle it? I know what I'm like when I've had a lot of weed - I get lazy, I get irritable. I just want to sit inside and stone. Fine for an individual - but imagine a nation starting to turn into that. Imagine if a sizeable proportion of adults were becoming lazy, starting to develop mental health problems - people wouldn't care about the evidence, they'd crucify you for it at election time if they wanted to. And the ""we'll make it illegal"" party would win.

There are a lot of people (including me) who would like to see a lot of drugs legal in our lifetimes (I think why stop at weed, but for the reasons above I can understand why). But no one, especially people whose jobs it is, wants to fuck this up and their careers with it. A LOT currently hinges on the US's and Uruguay's experience over the next few years.

true,Rc72,null,null,"&gt; The UK is the sovereign state here, not the EU.

And, as a sovereign state, it signed and ratified something called the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU which, in its Art. 45, paragraph 1, clearly states:

*Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Union.*

As a sovereign state, it may of course withdraw from the treaty, or try to renegotiate it with the 27 other member states, which are just as sovereign. What it can't do is to apply it selectively, just as you can't selectively apply some clauses in a contract while ignoring others. Because that's exactly what a treaty is: a contract between sovereign states.

&gt; My point here is that if you look back at the creation of the EU, you'll see that after initially being floated by the UK, it actually became a primarily Franco-german union aimed at combating a perceived anglo-saxon dominance in economic and political affairs

Care to cite your sources? The UK was actually invited to the [Spaak Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaak_Committee), which negotiated the Treaty of Rome, but it withdrew its representative before the conclusion of the talks. De Gaulle distrusted ""les Anglo-Saxons"" (when it suited him), but he also distrusted European integration (when it suited him as well), and most of all he distrusted [Jean Monnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet), chief architect of what would become the EU, unabashed Anglophile and close advisor to Roosevelt during WWII. If de Gaulle had been in power in 1957, the EEC would have never been. The other founders of the EEC, such as Spaak or de Gasperi, were so Americanophile that they've often been accused of having acted on behalf of the CIA.

&gt;  elements such as a financial transactions tax that would benefit the EU as an organization, at the expense of the UK

In fact, the UK already has a financial transaction tax, namely the [Stamp Duty Reserve Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_duty_in_the_United_Kingdom#Stamp_Duty_Reserve_Tax). The European Commission (not ""the EU"") has proposed a wider EU FTT, structured to prevent circumvention through tax havens, but as all fiscal matters in the EU, it requires unanimity
among the member states in the European Council. So far, the British government opposes it, [even though British public opinion apparently wouldn't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax#Europe).

As for the City, it owes a great deal to another freedom of movement enshrined in the Treaty on Functioning of the EU, namely the [freedom of movement of capital under Art. 63 TFEU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E063:EN:NOT).

If you wanted to go digital, you had to use mini-DV which was expensive for anything more than a basic camcorder that looked like crap, editing software was expensive and slow, and you still had to physically send your film to people if you wanted them to see it.

Where as today you can buy a camera, lights, an OK lens and a storage card for less than £1000 new, and shoot an unlimited amount of full HD video. Which can be edited using free software, and distributed for free online. No idea what you are doing? There are millions of tutorials, guides etc, and entire communities dedicated helping you get better. And you can actually make money from this, even if you are just talking into a webcam.

true,creamyjoshy,eng-Surrey,Straight Outta Surrey,"Yeah, your job has gotten much, much more efficient. The quality of the product is magnitudes better, it can be done for cheaper, quicker, and easier.

But what you aren't taking into account is the redundancies it's caused. Pay attention to ""quicker"" and ""easier"". With these in mind, it takes fewer humans to achieve the overall outsome. 

When you sent the film off to people, you presumably used royal mail. Nowadays, with less post and more digital distribution, and with advances in robotic sorting systems, many many jobs have been made redundant. 

A film company doesn't need to spend workers' time to cut the film with razor. It also doesn't need to train workers as much, as the tutorials are available online for free. 

This is reflected in these documents. [This](http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/uk-film-council-film-in-the-uk-2002-statistical-yearbook.pdf) document shows data from 2002. Page 32 shows that the total film industry in the UK for 2002 was about 566 million pounds. Fast forward to [a decade later](http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-2012.pdf), and page 199 show this has more than doubled to 1377 million pounds!

Crazy huh. Unfortunately, the number of employees does not scale in the same way. There were about 50,000 employees in the film industry in 2002, and about 60,000 employees in 2012. Thoise figures can be found if you scroll down a little. 

That means that while profits increased by ~2.5 times, the number of employees increased by only 1.2 times. 

Now this is very industry-specific. But we can open up the entire economy to see this effect. On the macro scale, [this](http://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/fig2_prodhhincome.jpg) is the effect of job automation. Wages stagnate but productivity increases. 

Now I consider myself a centrist, so I don't mean to sound so left here, but this has the effect of making those who own the means of production far far richer than the average worker. It increases inequality, and will continue to do so over time. 

This is only going to get worse as technology becomes more sophisticated. Now I don't see technology as a bad thing. We can't stay at this level until the heat death of the universe, we gotta keep advancing. But the point of technology is that it makes life easier, but it isn't easy to live a life with stagnant wages. 

By the end of the cold war, East Germany boasted a 0% unemployment record, which sounds fairly impressive, until you consider that the state employed people solely to walk around factories and bang the dust off of pipes with a wrench. This clearly isn't the solution.

What we need is a system which keeps increasing production efficiency, but still scales the amount of money given to average joe with the productivity. An unconditional basic income could be an answer. It would also streamline the benefits system and reduce bureaucracy overall.

As a society we can't yet afford to provide anything more than a very basic unconditional income, literally just enough to stave off death, and it would be unwise to ignore more targeted approaches given the limited resources we have.

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"Wonder if anyone thinks this isn't connected to the massive levels of propaganda over the past few years, demonising anyone unemployed or long term sick/disabled as lazy, feckless benefit scroungers too idle to go and get a job.

Apart from that, the changes in the benefit system, if you have mental health problems, essentially designed to deny that depression even exists and that you're just saying that so you don't have to get a job.

There's also a serious problem with the gap between ESA (sickness benefit, or 'employment support allowance' - note there's zero mention of sickness or disability, it's all about 'you will work, whatever's wrong, we will find ways to make you work'), and JSA, jobseeker's allowance.

At present, ATOS generally denies people unless they absoluately are incapable of any kind of work.  Yet there's two levels of ESA, one for those incapable, and one for those who need support, the 'work related activity' group.  This group would be ideal for those who need help but want to work, but instead they're just thrown onto JSA, where they're put under extreme pressure to 'get a job, take anything, just do anything, get a job now, now you lazy scum', ignoring any problems the person may have.

The system could work, but we need more people sensibly placed in the Work related group of ESA, instead of just denying that people need help, and dumping them on JSA, where, another thing that needs accepting, there's just not the jobs, and forcing the long term sick into the weekly grind of job hunting and continual rejection and failure, just isn't going to help those with mental health problems, or indeed anyone.

On top of that, it's been shown that the vast majority of employers will dismiss applicants at a glance if they have any long term sickness or mental problems.

TL;DR version, how about we help those who've recently lost their jobs and are clearly employable, instead of harassing the sick and disabled to fight the able bodied for work?

The defeat at Culloden also did a lot to damage Scotland in particular, with different privileges taken away from Scottish nobles loyal and disloyal, and other laws like the banning of tartan also passed.  

As such, I think there's a decent case for (in a jokey sort of way) saying it was the end of a ""Yes Scotland"" campaign, in that it put a dramatic end to much of the current Scottish identity and permanently brought Scotland into enforced closer union.  It wasn't about independence, but the '45 was certainly about certain values more typically held in Scotland and about the way that should translate to the rest of Britain.

I'm about one month without cigarettes thanks to my e-cig (I got one of those 'expensive' jobs that look like a Sonic Screwdriver) and I would go so far as to say that it has saved my life.

I'm only 25 but had been smoking since I was ~17 and had failed to give them up many times in the past. The last time I fell off the wagon was during my visit to your awesome country about two years ago after discovering that you sold them by the 10 pack; sneaky buggers how could you say no to a simple 10 pack!

Anyway, there's been considerable talk about more stringent regulations here in the states as well, with NYC outright banning them in public areas. However in my opinion, as you might have gleaned, they are a godsend. These days I work out around 5 times a week, and *much* harder than I ever could whist smoking. I don't reek of smoke anymore and I can actually walk up a flight of stairs with out coughing up a lung!

Now, I could totally see downsides to these things, one that you mentioned is that some might start ""vaping"" who never smoked in the first place because it looks cool; although personally I think I look like a goof with mine. Another being that there is no hard research as to the possible long term effects associated with the devices. 

For now I fully admit that I am somewhat blinded to the possible downsides by how much my quality of life has increased by my use of e-cigs. I am curious about how history will look back on this ""fad"", after all asbestos was the ""cat's pajamas"" at one point. While I'm not a trained chemist, I can't see propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin as being all that dangerous...but again I point to my lack of education on the subject.

I think further independent studies are required and until that happens, we should not be too hasty with regulations which could derail further use of what might end up being, literally, a life saver.

Poorer students, or unemployed people with no family support, would be on a plan whereby they pay back much less but at higher interest rate so end up paying more over time.

The formation is ridiculous for the most part. We need to be going for wins and not trying to scrape a draw. You would also think that with 5 in midfield, we should completely rule the middle of the park...in the last game vs Fulham there were so many gaps it was unreal even before Nolan's sending off.

Maiga is really bad...shouldn't even be in the first team. He lacks ability and presence...topped off with a lazy attitude. Even in pre season vs Colchester he couldn't keep up. For me, Carlton Cole has proved that he is a better option...he has the hold up play required for this style of play...allowing others like Morrison to join the attack. Either that or give someone like Elliot Lee/Seb Lletget a chance...they looked fantastic in preseason!

I can't see Nolan getting dropped completely though I think it would be the right thing to do. I'd give the captaincy to Noble and play J. Cole as an AM through the centre.

- 1st: grumpy old man who softens up. Regenerates of old age.

- 2nd: a playful space-hobo who thirst for adventure. Forced to regenerate by the Time Lords for meddling in affairs on Earth.

- 3rd: a gruff patriarch who tolerated little nonsense. Regenerated from radiation poisoning.

- 4th: a man perpetually a student, balancing his age with a slightly devil-may-care attitude. Regenerated after a huge fall when his body was too frail to handle it.

- 5th: the youthful hero who would prefer not to resort to violence. Regenerated after being poisoned, sacrificing all of the cure to his companion, Peri.

- 6th: egotistical but caring, a man who loved his companions only a tiny bit more than himself. Regenerated after his TARDIS was attacked by the Rani.

- 7th: initially very jokey, but later very cold and calculating (to the point that some of his other regenerations don't like him). Regenerated when undergoing surgery not designed for Time Lords after being shot by San Francisco gangsters.

- 8th: initially extremely youthful and the first romantic Doctor. In the books and audio stories, he becomes much more of a hero. Regenerated when given a potion to do so by the Sisterhood of Kahn after a fatal spaceship crash.

- War Doctor (9th): a warrior who fought in the Last Great Time War. Regenerated of old age.

- 9th (10th): a cheeky character concealing his psychological wounds caused by the events of the Last Great Time War. Regenerated after absorbing the Time Vortex energy which transformed Rose Tyler into the Bad Wolf, saving her life.

- 10th (11th): fast-speaking man who manipulates events much more than he cares to let on, still scarred by the loss of his people. Regenerated after exposure to radiation, saving the life of Wilf.

- Metacrisis (12th regenerated body): when the 10th (11th) Doctor starts regenerating, he decides not to change and diverts the energy into a spare receptacle. This will inadvertently create another Doctor who looks exactly like the 10th (11th). Though he isn't in the Doctor's lineage, he is still the Doctor and still used sufficient regeneration energy to push the Doctor's regeneration count up by one.

- 11th (12th main body, 13th regenerated body): the first mad man in a box to realise that he is a mad man in a box, and plays on it to hide a darker side. Regenerates of old age.

4th- Similar to two, but also had a big long scarf and a bag full of jelly babies.

5th- Very human, cared for his companions quite a bit.

6th- I cannot stress enough how much you need to ignore what everyone on the internet says about him. Go into his era looking for similarities with Tennant, and you'll see a lot of them.

7th- Starts out silly, but grows a dark and manipulative personality.

8th- Romantic, human, finds great joy in making people happy.

9th- You've seen him.

10th- Also human but does incredibly dark and almost evil things in his first and last episodes.

Think up more ways to punish the unfortunate unemployed, while spreading the word that they need to attend 'centres' in a full time context because they're all scamming the state by working on the side.  I don't see how these people can be lazy feckless wasters, and working full time while claiming benefits at the same time.

I just also don't believe that people wouldn't work, sure we'd see many people go 'wahey - fuck my boss and fuck my job', then a couple of months later, they'd become really fucking sick of sitting on the couch, watching daytime TV, and crave structure again, and a feeling of being useful.

On top of that, the basic income is exactly that, basic.  If you want lots of things to do and enjoy, you'll need additional income, and that means working.

As I say, I think the simple answer will be splitting the less enjoyable jobs that are still necessary into two part time jobs, so people can earn while not losing all their free time.

I also think we'll see some jobs just cease to exist, as they won't be financially viable in a world where people aren't forced to work or starve, and that's not really a bad thing.

For instance, I think they'd have to pay people a lot more under BI to work in call centre, annoying people at random with cold calls to sell pointless shit to them, and yet the 'value' of these calls to a company, I'd suggest wouldn't be enough to allow them to pay a far higher wage to encourage people to do it, so we'd just lose that sector of employment, and I don't feel anyone would miss it, especially as people are quite capable of purchasing things without being dragged out of a bath to answer the phone.

I'm however sure there's many jobs that don't generate enough value to survive a BI, but then is that a bad thing?  Just means we're forcing people to do essentially pointless work just to get by.  As was brought up in another thread, back in the 90s and 00s, many people were on unemployment benefits but 'working' in the sense that they were writing or creating music or such things when, strictly speaking, they should have been spending that time looking for work.  However, many bands, singers and authors were born from that, and I'm sure the successful ones have paid enough tax by now to repay their weekly pittance to the state. (See JK Rowling for starters)

Two: Cosmic hobo which he uses to make his opponents view him as a bmbling idiot he then takes over the situation, pretty much the archetype of all subsequent doctors eccentric, kind from the off etc.

Three: James bond of the Doctors, action, gadgets and UNIT, kind ,fatherly and frustrated due to being stuck on earth forced to help UNIT and sent on tasks by the Time Lords

Four: possibly the most eccentric Doctor entering as many situations as possible with out a jot of seriousness. Jolly, funny, friendly is how i would describe him.

Five: most human doctor of the original run, effete, kind,more serious but still lighthearted

Six: Brash, arrogant but he started to mellow towards the end

Seven: Manipulative yet good eccentric when he wanted to be but incredibly dark when he wanted.

Eight: romantic and kind unfortunately short lived bar audios and books

Ten: Most human of all the doctors arrogant whiny emotionaletc.

Eleven: Eccenric an old man in a young mans body

I think you're missing my point - because even in Singapore and Indonesia, dealers and traffickers will get much harsher sentences than simple consumers. You might see it as impractical (I imagine you're thinking of prison space) but if we're not willing to do what's needed then we might as well not bother. In the meantime, dealers will get rich, customers will face minimal repercussions if caught, and the police will spend a lot of time and money arresting a handful of the competition - keeping the market healthy. 

Remember that in the UK your convictions become 'spent' if you're given any sentence less than 2 and half years prison time. Can you even imagine going down for over 2 years for possession of cannabis? I can get stopped by the police up to 3 times before they even have to arrest me. Its not nearly enough of a deterrent to effectively dissuade users - and that's why dealers can make loads of money.

Having worked in youth justice, criminalising the kids who were in for possession would help absolutely no one. And, more importantly would not serve as a deterrent.

yes he makes good saves, however his inability to distribute the ball and his lack of awareness of danger is concerning.

He doesn't punch the ball when he's meant to and he makes FAR too many spills (which i noticed at sunderland). I honestly don't think he's up to our quality.          

      

Cast your mind back to Pepe. He always was jumping all over the place and screaming at our defence and made himself big when he needed to and by god could pepe punch a ball!

First of all, thank you all very much for the comments, critiques...and accusations XD

Second of all, Amy's pose coming off as sexualized wasn't intentional; cartoon exaggeration, attempt at capturing motion and dynamism was all I intended. I can see why her pose would upset many. Yes, it is, in fact, a stock ""girl pose""...added with the exaggeration doesn't really help in making her look like what others have unanimously perceived. =/

Some have gone as far as to feel she is being underpowered and undermined in her role while Vincent and The Doctor take action (trust me, she totally isn't). If you haven't watched the actual episode (Vincent and The Doctor) from which I adapted the scene the drawing is based off of, then I suggest you give it a peek. ;-)

As for the anatomical snafu on Amy, I will be the first to admit...I didn't exactly know how I wanted to portray her in motion dynamically, as in the original scene, she never turns around, creative liberty was taken so I can show her face while expressing surprise and urgency while her coat and scarf fly everywhere as she runs. I also wanted to show Amy running in a way that looks like she's coming from the foreground (watch the episode, you'll see what I mean). Bear in mind that I was attempting to recreate the scene from memory, The Doctor and Vincent were easy (and exaggerated), while I wanted to portray Amy's action differently from the actual scene (cartoon exaggeration and the like), I didn't pull it off quite as well as I could have and ultimately ""girl posed"" her. =/


My friend quoted me in an earlier post and got battered for it. Please don't send a Dalek invasion on the messenger, for my comment at the time came before I further observed the drawing with the criticisms it received in mind. =D

I wholeheartedly appreciate the critiques, and all suggestions are welcomed. 

Oh, the Pokemon reference...well, some users actually got the point. Pokeballs and the T.A.R.D.I.S are bigger on the inside. =D

I took a [Snapshot](http://imgur.com/9214VzO) of the scene, if anyone's curious. But do watch the episode if you haven't. =)

Depending on when you move may dictate how quick you need to be with making a decision. When I first moved to Bristol I moved in July with no issues. The closer you get towards September the quicker places will go (students and students finishing study who want to stay). I moved at the end of last August and had to go through 2-3 2 bed apartments before I secured one. 
Different places will have different letting terms, but generally it's 12 months and then either rolling or a renegotiation. Most rental agreements I've had there has been a 6 month get out clause.
If you can bunk down at a friends, or a hostel or something before you move, it may pay you to do so. The problem with pictures on rightmove and zoopla are that they aren't always representative of the area.

2. Totterdown, Knowle (not Knowle West), Sandy Park and Saint Anne's are all in &lt; 20 minutes walk of the main train station. They're not in the centre, but are cheaper from my experience (I've lived in Totterdown, Knowle and Sandy Park areas).

3. Can't really comment on that one. Others are better suited probably.

4. If you're moving to the South West of England, you probably want to move to Bristol. It's cheaper than other cities (such as Bath), bigger, has a good nightlife and culture, and is reasonably well connected in terms of trains to other parts of the country.
You probably don't want to move to Bristol if you don't want to move to a city founded on slavery, hate the rain (that's true of most of the UK tbh) or want to cycle - the Bristol roads aren't really designed for both motor vehicles and bicycles and there are only a limited amount of dedicated cycle lanes.
