false,Auckland345,null,null,"There are other countries in Europe that use to have vast global Empires such as Spain,Portugal and France who are committed to being in the EU and do not act like a spoilt toddler when something does not go their own way. Portugal kept many of its colonies up until 1975 but that didn't stop them eventually joining the Euro and being fully committed to membership. The Empire is dead, it is no longer economically viable to have such a close trade arrangement as in the past. By attempting to do so it partly lead to the collapse of British industry that happened in the late 20th century. While by working together France and Germany could keep a huge chunk of their industry. Other Commonwealth countries realise that that is why Australia is trying to get more diplomatic relations with East Asia over Europe and Canada entered NFTA. Winston Churchill was of his time so it is pointless to think that quote is really relevant now at the time huge chunks of the world still belonged to Britain and most of Europe had just been fighting each other so it is hard to have the same trust as now.  

As an anti-EU think tank the Bruges group has a vested interest so their results  are naturally going to be biased anyway. Even if it is a majority the loudest voice in the Conservative party is a strongly anti-EU voice of throwing a fit if you do not get 100% what you want.UKIP are a complete joke and are a very scary party who  even make the Conservative party look attractive. They create mass hysteria and a unhealthy landscape of obsessing about immigration when there are more important things to worry about. The reason why they are popular with normal people is because the main parties are irreverent to many people and by chasing UKIP in such a way makes them more so. The Maastrict treaty had little to do with UKIP's success as they had 18 years of being on the fringes of politics only recently becoming a big thing.

Did a quick google and nowt came up, feel free to correct me if I wrong.

They are interesting, but they are merely opinions. So on that basis I'll engage your point of view merely to discuss not debate.

Let's look at Spain and Portugal. They joined the EURO and it stimuled a massive credit bubble (particularly in Spain's real estate and construction industry). It used to be considered a country of poor people then people believed suddenly after many years for example Franco's rule that they were all aspiring to becoming middle-class.

What we're now seeing in Spain the ""Balkanization"" of the Regions and the high unemployment rate from the fall-out of the EURO Crisis.

If you look at France they are considering themselves atm to be in a ""Winter Of Discontent"" with a major short-fall in their welfare life-style system of social contract. France originally wanted to join the EU as part of preventing War with Germany again: They had to accept the loss of the Deutchemark for reunification between East and West. It was political plan. The Germans believed they could sell their export goods at a higher rate due to single currency but now are owed 25% of Greece's debts.

Coming back to the UK and our historic reasons, as said these are not complete reasons, they're merely contributory inputs. It's similar in some ways to Japan being an Asian country off the coast that identifies itself very differently to the rest of Asia. I think the British are similar with respect to Europe. Again we had x2 WW's in Europe that we were dragged into and did the honorable thing: We never did want political unoin, we only wanted trade as per Churchill.

As for his quote you may decide for yourself it's relevance but his vision of Europe is far more applicable today for the UK's future role in Europe than you fully realize, hence you wish to fully understand the rest of what he had to say about Europe and the UK.

The results from MP Watch are not fully representative, but they are indicative of the way the Government ie Tory coalition voted on EU related motions of parliament. That is fact and hence of interest though not conclusive. It actually reflects recent reports by Pro-EU Tories in the news:-

&gt;*Mr Green admitted that many Conservatives still did not want to be named as members of the pro-European group but said a fifth of the 303-strong parliamentary party shared his views.*

The rest of are likely opportunists!

You can blame UKIP all you like and there's plenty to accuse them of yes, but then you have to be even handed and accuse the perpetrators of this in the first place back in the early 2000's: ""Labour: We Got It Wrong"". To dismiss UKIP entirely and the public support for control over immigraiton and reduction (&gt;70%) for example.

But if someone says that some types of rape aren't as bad as others, then its very easy for people to say things like rape is rape, or confuse the severity of violent rape with other crimes which may have less impact on the victim.

The trouble is that rape has had its definition expanded over time. So the same word ""rape"" is applied to several things which in the past weren't considered rape (but rightfully now are considered a crime).

I think we could have a better discussion about sex and consent if rape was defined as violently non-consensual sex, while we used another word for coercive sex without violence (such as people too drunk to consent), another word was used for sex with minors presumed unable to consent (rather than statutory rape) .

The Green Party does well with young people and the youth wing of the party the young greens is a big part of that so you can also contact them for support if you need it. 

Find your local party and go to a meeting. Or ask questions on the Green Party or young green or your local Green Party Facebook page.

Welcome to the real world, cunt. You think going to an office and going home to a pair of kids and a housewife is going to solve that problem? Most people feel this way- because that's sort of how it works. A mortgage, kids, and all the other little check boxes that our parents slaved away at don't mean shit, because the idea of 'adulthood' that they were sold is bollocks. You can't judge a person's maturity by the amount of arbitrary boxes they've ticked off on some facile social checklist. So most of the people go through life with the expectation that they should feel like an 'adult' as if this feeling was ever any different to the feeling of being in your mid-twenties. Also, what the fuck do jeans have to do with maturity? Is wearing one type of trousers over another still considered a sign of their 'mental age'? 

You can go dress in a suit, get a job as an accountant, and spent 40 hours a week trying to pay off your student loans, mortgage, and feed a family that you've arbitrarily decided will bring you to some kind of transcendent state of mind where you've got your life in control and you know what you're doing.

For me Kane and Soldado getting minutes on the pitch together was always going to benefit Bobby, and there's no one I enjoy seeing score more than him.  Really hope they get a lot more game time together and this the start of a beautiful partnership between the two.

Hoping we keep Fazio and Jan at the back together, and I'm more comfortable with Davies at LB than Rose - as is Eriksen.  Whatever happened after the Stoke game with that 'fallout' rumour, it can't be coincidence that we have won our last two league games without Kaboul or Ade in the team.

Does this poster mean that gay guys can't rape, or that women can't rape. Its a tad small minded. (and its really reflecting the way the laws are written in all honesty). I'd word it in a non-gendered way.

Though i think the poster is getting at a point in a bad way. I think there is a difference between drunk/tipsy and drunk to point of not being able to consent. I also think the vast majority of people know that its wrong to have sex with a alcohol induced corpse, so i don't think this poster is exactly going to stop those people (not men or women, **PEOPLE**) that would take advantage of a person (not a man or woman, a **PERSON**) that is that under the influence.

Its akin to putting up a poster asking people not to murder... People don't exactly think about obeying the law when they're thinking of murdering someone. I think its a similar situation for rape (though its obviously not the same and the analogy doesn't quite fit, There's a lot more ambiguity with rape)

All in all, this is a nasty subject, and I'm sure they'll be someone that'll read this comment and think I'm the scum of the earth. To those people I say ""life is short"".

An instant return to the premier league is a target for the next 1-2 years whilst parachute payments are at their maximum. Developing an academy capable of regularly contributing players to our first team may take another 10 years. We've only had the disposable income to start investing in our academy again for a couple of seasons, it'll be a while before we start to see dividends. Also, a quick return to the Premier League helps immensely with the longer term goal.

The middle ground is to bring a manager in who plays football that complements what we're trying to do with the academy, which I think is half why Adams got the job to begin with. His U18's played counter-attacking football, characterised by quick movement of the ball back-to-front and strong wing play. Whilst that may have suited us in the Premier League, it's utterly hopeless in the championship when we've got the squad to dominate teams. I think that's why he's getting found out now, and why Phelan has been brought in. Phelan's era at United also had some of the features of Adams U18's, but they could also win comfortably against weaker sides, and rarely struggled to break them down.

But Adams doesn't have the nous to get the most out of this squad, and the appointment of Phelan only complicates things and makes it more likely that we have to give them more time. I'd much rather we cut Adams loose, and tried our best to bring in Tony Pulis. His direct style fits a lot of our players very well (Jerome played for him at 3 clubs, he wanted Redmond at Stoke, etc) and he can certainly organise a defence - Adams couldn't organise his way out of a paper bag.

I honestly think appointing Pulis would be the closest thing to buying promotion, and given 3-4 years could have us in a similar position to Hughton did a mere 14 months ago. If the likes of the Murphy's, McFadden, Morris, McGeehan develop into quality players, I think they'd fit in under Pulis, and meanwhile the board can look to develop the academy further. If they were happy with the job Adams did with the U18's, it's not like we're suddenly going to be producing a crop of Hoolahan's who may not fit in under the likes of Pulis.",0,1417377166,null,0,false,0,cmh6lrn,t3_2nu53n,t1_cmh6lrn,t1_cmh458r,null,1425752492,2,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,2

I would much rather have Adams and get rid of the 'Norwich Way' the board keep talking about.  Keep football exciting, yes, but don't subscribe to one way e.g. tika-taka.  By this I mean don't make the team play in a way that promotes possession which the manager doesn't feel suits them.  Look at Dortmund and how exciting their style is which evolved from the counter-attack (ie look at how we can develop a style in team and keep it).",0,1417378324,null,0,false,0,cmh78jf,t3_2nu53n,t1_cmh78jf,t1_cmh6lrn,null,1425752198,2,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,2

There's drunk and there's ***drunk***. 

A lot of people (men and women can both be victims) will have a drink, and still remain quite capable of making decisions, even though they wouldn't legally be allowed to drive. In fact, we *expect* decisions like ""I should get a cab home"" to be made. 

If you're really drunk though, you lose the ability to realise what's going on. A drunken mind may come up with reasonable answers other than sex for sharing a cab (she probably already knows the guy. Most victims do), kipping at someone else's house, letting him help you out of your clothes. Meanwhile the guy is interpreting all this as her wanting to have sex, because he's drunk *and* horny.

It is only in the men's loo. That's gender profiling for you but men are more likely to commit rape. There probably should be a ""stay safe"" poster in the women's loo, but then that's apparently ""victim blaming"" so it's easier not to provide basic safety reminders.

Several polls and a lot of discontent on Twitter shows otherwise.

&gt;The vote fails EVERY TIME, even with all the 'paint your face blue' shit that they tried this time.

Every time? This was the first time Scotland held a referendum on independence. The Last referendums even closely similar were one referendum for a Scottish Parliament and another for a Scottish assembly.

Also paint your face blue and...what? Did you actually see what was happening in Scotland. The focus the Yes campaign had was not blind nationalism ala Quebec, if anything the argument was that Scotland could have full control over what it does and take a direction other than where England (and it is chiefly England) takes us. The Yes campaign was running on the idea that Scotland's tax money could be better spent in Scotland rather than having it doled out to us by Westminster and that it would allow Scotland to re-industrialise through manufacturing. You know, the industries we lost in the 80s after being told that not voting for an assembly would protect them. You want kneejerk nationalism? Look to the Yes Campaign. When the result was announced unionist thugs descended on mass onto Glasgow's george square to beat up Yes supporters, burn Saltires, and sing Unionist songs whilst doing Hitler Salutes. The most Yes campaigners is thrown an egg at something and if you can't take an egg to the face you shouldn't go into politics. I don't remember Yes Campaigners forming mobs to beat up No campaigners. The most that happened when Yes Campaigners got together was a singsong of Freedom come all ye.

&gt;The majority of people in Scotland didn't want it, and will not have changed their minds in such a short time....but those crybabies who voted 'yes' and lost just can't fucking let go.

You act as if it was a 90-10% split. It wasn't. It was a 55-45% split. 10% isn't a large margin. There's been bigger swings over two weeks let alone a couple of years and bigger elections past. Calling 55% an outright majority that will never change throughout time and space is fucking retarded.

And what? Since the Yes vote lost, everyone who voted yes should give up. They should abandon what they feel is right and run over to the unionist side to wave flags, sing rule Britannia and circlejerk about how British they are? Fuck off, that's not how democracy works, if your side lose you don't then have to support the side that beat you. Why should we let it go? I'm not going to become an arbitrary unionist. Views change, they can change quickly, they can change slowly. Scottish Independence included. Also, we have a load of people who are newly active in politics, not merely voting but being a member of and campaigning for a party in a way that you don't see in England or anywhere in the UK. We have Politicians selling out public talks at major events. If you think those people are suddenly going to give up and shut up, you've got another thing coming.

I didn't say that and you know it. The fact that you're being sarcastic about giving equivalency to different verses *in the source you cite* illustrates how dangerous and silly it is to use any religious text as the basis to an argument. If you and OP are so sure about the validity of the verses in the bible then why don't you give validity to the verse I quoted ? Why do you think the verses about handling pork should be followed but not the one about stoning children to death ? 

&gt;But taking easy jabs at a religion for free karma is a little low.

Who's taking easy jabs ? If you look through my comment history you'll see I'm not bothered about karma. Why is it ""brave"" to criticise religion ? You agree that we live in a more enlightened time. Why should we give a free pass to ridiculous rules about touching a packet of sausages. Think about it seriously - it's stupid. Just because OP has a deeply held belief that he shouldn't touch pork doesn't make his belief any less stupid. I don't have a problem with him following his made up rules but he shouldn't expect to be above criticism and ridicule.

1. Link goes to a live thread on [reddit live](http://www.reddit.com/r/Live) that has regularly (every 2-3 min at most) updated commentary, and a little bit of colour if you consider yourself capable
2. First comment on the post should contain match basics, mostly from the pre-match thread (a text post with all this info in the description):

* Match Information (date, kickoff, location, referee, weather, press conference links, other links), 
* Team News
* Expected Lineups (update to actual lineups once announced), 
* Team Scorers/Assist Leaders
* Head to Head (Last 5)
* Recent Matches / Form
* Stats and Trivia (i.e. Gerrard's 16th anniversary, Stoke haven't won at Anfield since Sky invented football, etc.), 
* Current Table

As a comment, it's subject to sorting (best, top, new, etc.) on the match thread so it's out of the way when refreshing the page. Alternatively, it can just be a link to the pre-match thread, stating that match info is there. 

I'm hoping commentary can be taken a bit more seriously as it's a great service to those not watching the game but who want to get descriptive updates. 

**TL;DR use link posts + reddit live for commentary; include match info (or link to pre match thread) as a comment**  
  
Again, thanks to those who put in a great deal of effort to get these going and making them high quality.

There are, however, a number of things complicating that:

 - A lot of constituencies are ""safe"" seats - they've voted the same way for many years, the party could field a Golden Retriever as the local MP and the dog would get elected.
 - We don't vote directly for our Prime Minister. We vote for the person who will represent us locally - our MP.  Obviously the party they represent and the party leader will impact how people vote, but so does the personality of the local candidate.
 - It is quite possible for a party to change leader half-way through a parliament, resulting in a new prime minister who was not originally elected. (This is exactly what happened with Gordon Brown).
 - If no party has an overall majority (ie. &gt;50% of the seats) in the House of Commons - which happens occasionally - then the party that came out best is in a pretty tough position. If they form a minority government, they're going to have trouble getting anything through Parliament. The other parties can simply vote against the government on everything, meaning you wind up with a government that can't do anything. Usually they'll form an agreement - a coalition - with another political party whereby both compromise on some of their policies, both parties give good jobs to senior members within the parties and both parties agree to vote the same way in important matters.
    - This is what happened at the last election. It's turned out to be a poison pill for the Lib Dems because they lost the election, agreed to be the minority part of a coalition and in so doing had to compromise a lot of their key election promises.

false,ianjm,english,England,"It's the end of a Parliament. By convention, 5 years, although historically, often 4 years. The current Prime Minister goes to the Queen, and asks her to use her power to dissolve Parliament. 


Each party will choose a representative to stand for it in each seat by whatever method they have chosen. This is generally done some years ahead of an election. Some parties don't stand in all seats, and some smaller parties have arrangements to not compete with each other, and of course independents can stand too.  Each party has a leader, but elections are purely local. You vote for a person, not a party, although there may be a strong association between a person and the party of which he/she is a member.


The UK uses a first-past-the-post constituency-based system. MPs are elected from local voters, by achieving a plurality, for example, 3 candidates might stand in a seat, and one might achieve 40% to the others 30% and 20% (and 10% other). He will 'win' the right to represent this 


On election night, the votes are counted in each constituency and a picture emerges of who will have the most seats in Parliament. By morning, it is generally clear who the majority party will be. Since our system usually produces a majority of seats for the party achieving the most votes (even if they did not achieve 50% of the vote), it is normally clear which party will be able to command the support of the Parliament. 


The Queen will ask the leader of the largest party to try and form a government, in general he will become Prime Minister. The Government operates by having the support of a simple majority of MPs in the House of Commons (lower house of Parliament) and can therefore pass legislation.


If no clear majority is achieved (like last time), coalition negotiations will generally commence with the leader of the largest party approaching other parties for support. If he fails to form a majority, the Queen may ask someone else, or dissolve the Parliament triggering fresh elections.


The Government comes in to session at the official opening of Parliament and begins its legislative programme. As long as they continue to maintain support they can pass almost any bill they want. Since the UK has no written constitution, the theory of Parliamentary Sovereignty means the ruling party can do nearly whatever it wants.


The House of Lords can in theory block and amend legislation, but they do generally allow the Government to do its business. As an appointed house, rather than elected, they are acutely aware they do not have the mandate that the Commons does and therefore are seen as being quite ineffectual. There is a large consensus this needs to be fixed, but so far, no consensus on how to do so has been reached.


Now ***in practice*** many people vote for a Party based on its National legislative programme and who is likely to become Prime Minister if it wins, almost like a Presidential contest. This doesn't happen all the time though. There are plenty of people who vote for their MP on the basis of them being well liked locally or on specific local issues. It varies.

Not that I'm a big fan of Beautypedia, it can be a pretty good resource. Their [review](http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/estee-lauder/Idealist/_/Idealist-Pore-Minimizing-Skin-Refinisher) talks about the ingredient list, and it's okay, but not almost £60 worth.

They are both old and play midfield?  Sure.  Also they have completely different shots.  Gerrard really doesn't have one anymore, while Lampard can still find room and put it away easily.

Honestly Lampard is better than Gerrard  by a quite a bit ( imo ); just because Lampards style has translated into the newer possession football (short passing in the midfield with 1/2's and movement), while Gerrard's long ball style really doesn't translate into the new modern game.  Even Stoke play less like Stoke nowadays, and without Suarez up front, i'm afraid the long direct ball isn't viable.  

Gerrard used to make long winded runs, and played powerful football, and now that he's older he really can't do that.  Lampard has always played skill football, and with him slowing down he doesn't really lose much.

If you want to get drunk, that's great, there's plenty of ways to do that (pub quiz, boat race etc).

If you don't want to get drunk, that's also great, there's no pressure to drink, the pub quiz is definitely just as enjoyable sober (source: me this summer) and overall you sort of make iseries whatever you want it to be. If you want it to be a social event, you can accommodate that by sitting with friends or getting to know the people around you, but if you don't have anyone to go with, you're bound to make friends really easily if you just introduce yourself to the people around you.

I played in the dota tournament this summer and although we didn't get far, it was great fun and a nice group of people playing, however if you don't want to play in a tournament then you can easily pick up people around you to play with (You pick which section you want to sit in, and the dota section is usually pretty well populated).

Food is a pretty easy problem to solve. On site food can be quite expensive, but the UK's biggest Tesco is also a short walk across the car park, and there are microwaves and hot water available on-site for free use whenever you want.

The only issue I've found so far is that the Ricoh arena accommodation is pretty poor. There's a *very* limited number of on-site rooms available, and usually these are just raffled off to 2 or 3 lucky ticket holders. However, if you have a car that makes it much easier because you have access to the hotels around you (not on-site, a short drive away), you can take camping equipment with you easily, or you can in fact just sleep in your car.

Naughton - Fazio - Jan - Davies

Bentaleb - Eriksen

Lennon - Kane - Chadli

Soldado

I dropped Eriksen to a CM role to play more of that box-to-box role he can play, and if Chadli is available it would be stupid not to play him. Kane and Bobby suit each other so either one could take the CF role. Or we could lineup with 2 strikers.

Lloris 

Naughton - Fazio - Jan - Davies

Stambouli

Lennon - Eriksen - Chadli

Kane - Soldado

Either way will work. Regardless, we should have Bobby and Kane playing for sure, keep our defensive line from today except put Naughton back in, Bentaleb should start *unless* Capoue is back. I believe Stambouli in my second lineup can be that midfield workhorse that plays alone with help from Eriksen. Capoue slots into his role if available.

Numerous topical actives are useful in anti ageing - check our ingredients Wiki for a few of them. However some actives are also potential irritants, can easily cause over exfoliation (thin the protective upper layer of 'dead' cells), can increase photosensitivity so the risks outweigh the benefits in very sensitive or thin skin such as around the eye. Also the eye itself is slightly alkaline so using acids close to it is risky.

Aside from a broad spectrum sunscreen, the 'holy trinity' of anti ageing actives is arguably vitamin C, a retinoid (vitamin A) and niacinamide (vitamin B3). There are acid and non acid forms of vitamins A and C, niacinamide is super gentle anyway so all three can be used around the eye. Vitamin C is photoprotective, it increases the effectiveness of your sunscreen and reduces sun damage (a major cause of ageing).

Other actives useful in anti ageing include the polyphenol antioxidants and the carotenoid antioxidants - mostly from plant extracts. Many of these are gentle enough for around the eye too.

Lastly consider your diet and lifestyle choices: ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. These are minimums/ maximums they do not confer optimal health or optimal anti ageing, if you want that you would need to eat way more nutrient dense wholefoods and even less processed stuff (as a rule of thumb anything with more than one ingredient is processed).

No - so any attempt to encourage more personal safety for women, in the short term, can only be a good thing.

I get that it doesn't necessarily help the long-term goal of re-educating people about rape. But the more rapes we can prevent or discourage in the short term, the more women become safer.

false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"* The major parties pick a Prime Ministerial candidates who heard their respective parties. 

* They have a big battle of ideas. 

* The major parties place candidates in every constituency. There's about 600 constituencies.

* When you vote, you technically vote for the MP and not the party. This means that MPs can change parties have way through Parliament even if you they stood for election as the member of the other one. It's called crossing the isle. However it seldom happens because everybody knows that what people actually care about is the party and not the candidate. 

* In each constituency votes are cast and then counted. Which ever candidate gets the most votes in a given constituency wins the whole constituency. This means that if every other candidate got 5% of the vote but you got 6%, you're elected as the candidate for that seat. This leads to large distortions nationally, because a win of 1% in one constituency is equal to a win of 100% in another. 

* After the election the Queen then ""consults"" Parliament and appoints which ever party leader has the most MPs behind it. 

* However, during the course of a Parliament a ""vote of no confidence"" can be issued, where by a when a certain number of MPs (IIRC it's about 30) of the governing party call for a ""vote of no confidence"" then the entire Parliament has to go and say whether they have faith or not. This usually leads to the entire opposition (at this point Labour) voting for abolishment, whilst the government (the Libs and Conservatives) votes almost exclusively for the status quo. However this won't always be the case, which is why you get those radicals in the first place who voted for the vote. Interesting, if enough MPs of the government vote for a vote of no confidence and the vote of no confidence is successful, then it goes to a vote of the whole country. So the vote leads to a vote which leads to a vote. 

* If there no party has a clear majority, then the leaders of a larger party and usually a smaller party get together and work out some sort of agreement whereby the MPs of the smaller party support the larger one. Although you can occasionally get what are called ""grand coalitions"" where by the two largest parties govern together. This is what happened in WWII.  But that was less to do with not having enough MPs and more to do with not getting destroyed by the Nazis. 

* in the past the prime minister used to be able to decide when elections were held. Margaret Thatcher used this to great effect, consistently calling elections when her approval ratings were high. However, since 2010 this is no longer the case because the Lib Dems introduced the Fix Terms Parliaments act which sets out the life of a Parliament as being every ~5 years.

It also explains the chemistry that shows that deoxygenation of re-boiled water is not significantly any different than for once-boiled water.

Those of you who claim that your tea tastes different if the water's been boiled twice are fooling yourself. Those of you who go further, using pseudoscience to back it up, are in a similar camp to those who believe in, say, homeopathy: you're claiming that your water somehow has a ""memory"" of having being boiled earlier today, despite all of the scientific evidence to the contrary.

To call Lennon at all 'clinical' is just nonsense as he's always lacked the final ball. He'll pop up with a few assists and MAYBE a few goals a season but he squanders so much. He'll get the beating of a few players but can only ever go outside with a usually awful cross while Lamela can come inside and create a lot more.

However, if you let it cool then the water will also begin to reoxygenate (otherwise, all water would already be deoxygenated on account of the fact that it's pretty much all been evaporated at least once, by now!), offsetting this effect. Furthermore, as deoxygenation happens on a curve, it's mostly complete anyway by the time you reach 95°C.

false,agentdcf,flair8,,"xG is ""expected goals."" The maps are a way of mapping the various shots on target and (I believe) even missed attempts, with the different sizes of the squares indicating the statistical likelihood of a goal for a particular shot. It's not as simple as distance from goal, because Michael Caley (the creator of this system) has found over the past few years that there are important differences in shots. The biggest difference is that through-balls are MUCH more likely to lead to goals than shots from crosses. Crosses are, in fact, quite low-probability attempts at goal. Obviously, the benefit of crosses is that it's generally easier to get them in than it is to generate nice through-balls, but their effectiveness is nowhere near what a lot of commentators assume. 

So, these maps basically show the statistical probability of goals over a match. It's a good way of seeing the processes at work, and not just the outcome: if you're generating more expected goals, you'll win the game most of the time, something that can be obscured by a few lucky or unlucky bounces. 

What this map demonstrates, pretty clearly, is that we deserved to win today.

Edit: I'm not positive if the maps track shots on target or not. Overall, Caley's formula for predicting matches last year was based on ""SoTiB,"" or ""Shots on Target inside the Box.""

I agree that's what we had to do, and I'd never, ever want us to just sit back at 1 - 0, man up or not. Not ever. But we could have gone about it while keeping our organisation. While just keeping and moving the ball well (which we didn't do all day but have been doing all season) until we found a decent opening, which with a man advantage would have happened reasonably quickly if you don't just panic and do what we did, which is commit far too much and leave ourselves too exposed.

The crime is *watching* TV without a license, not being in possession of equipment capable of receiving a broadcast. 

You could have a YouView box and only watch catch-up, for which you wouldn't need a license, but it would need to be connected to an aerial. 

You could only watch on-demand content from Sky, for which you wouldn't need a license, but have your box connected to a dish. 

You could watch live TV on your computer for which you would need a license, and that doesn't connect to anything other than the internet.

Here's a quote from the TVL website:

&gt;**It’s against the law to watch or record TV programmes as they're being shown on TV without a valid licence.** This includes the use of devices such as a TV, computer, mobile phone, games console, digital box or DVD/VHS recorder. 

&gt;**Watching TV without a valid licence is a criminal offence.** This can lead to prosecution, a court appearance and a fine of up to £1,000 (not including legal costs). The exceptions are in Guernsey where the maximum fine is £2,000 and Jersey it is £500.

Note the use of 'watch' both times. 

Regarding your second point on detection... that is also bollocks. 

They cannot detect you. The abilities of the TV detector van were hyped up in the sixties, and vastly exaggerated. Whilst there technically *is* a way to detect if a TV is turned on (not if the aerial is being used) it would have to be an old CRT unit, not the digital TVs we have today. Even then it was massively unreliable and the couldn't even pinpoint where a TV was. 

The main way people are caught is by them turning up at your doorstep and them listening at door. People think they've been caught red-handed and confess. 

The vans, threats, enforcement officers, are all to *scare* people into paying. If they could catch people easily they wouldn't need to be so heavy handed. ",0,1417391832,null,0,false,0,cmhejo2,t3_2ns6v0,t1_cmhejo2,t1_cmhc1fy,null,1425748715,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[EDIT] After a bit of thought I have retaught that last bit, it is if anything culture shock, having a role of majority that many take for granted suddenly reversed into being a minority, there is little actual animosity but the mix of the unknown with a feeling of intrusion (again probably fear from the switched perspective) that keeps people apart, this is in relation to businesses mostly that cater to a specific community. 

I still think that multiculturalism is a good thing and that on the whole people get along well, but it isn't going as swimmingly as people may think.
