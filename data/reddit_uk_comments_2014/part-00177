Simply put this is not a race issue, the photograph on the front cover is from a completely unrelated incident over a year ago. It's a different issue that has been protested in an inconsiderate way, and then picked up by the national media. The community is already mixed race, and white, black, muslim people all get on in peace there. 

There's a big problem with housing in NI. Since the country is split 50/50 between two factions who *wont* live by eachother, you get a housing defect on one side of Belfast. People who aren't part of one of either of the factions can live anywhere in the city. The family in question would be fine living anywhere in Belfast, the council have moved them into a house that was built specifically for easy access (disabled, or elderly). The phrase ""Local"" in this context is ""hyper local"" and not anti-black, they mean prot-unionists.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"Some of these things would have happened under Labour - they can pretend it would be milk and honey but they had no serious prospect of retaining power so could promise the earth.

Labour actually did try to privatise Royal Mail, they introduced tuition fees, increased them (despite promising not to) and commissioned the report that the coalition acted on (after Mandelson said ""something has to change""), so they would probably have increased them again this time. 

If you honestly think that they would have handled the Snowden leaks and the guardian differently, you must be deluded (Labour set the standard for surveillance and authoritarianism - some of the things that got leaked are stuff they would have signed off on!). 

It was the Labour government who voluntarily strongarmed the mobile networks into installing filters that you can opt-out of, in a way this is worse than Cameron - who has only managed to get the big ISPs to do it so you can easily move to another provider if you really don't like it.

&gt; blame the young and unemployed for... anything and everything wrong

Maybe Labour shouldn't have embarked on the ridiculous policy of forcing everyone through university? That's why we have a lot of graduates who are complaining because they're in debt (thanks to Labour's tuition fees) and can't get a job - when they were originally sold on the idea that a degree (doesn't matter what subject) was the path to instant riches, when it is not.

&gt; lower taxes for the rich are among the things he has done.

If one course of action causes the appropriated reaction, then by having a stronger action well create a subsequently stronger reaction, so in this course of action, they are chipping away piece by piece at all the rampant speaders. Also by getting progressively more shocking it probably cuts down on complaints.

On the other side of the coin, when government sees that one course of action is not working, their next immediate step is to follow the same course of action only stronger.

Both these lines of thought operate as if there is some form of Hooke's Law of public conformity, and that the public are all one big spring.

Of course treating the public like one spring is very easy where policy is concerned and at the very least allows people to be seen to be doing something, even if all they are doing is pissing of a small potion of the law abiding electorate, until the next problem comes along and then they've had five years of dealing with problems and a good shot at the next general election.",0,1403426232,null,0,false,0,cidxdtz,t3_28o2w6,t1_cidxdtz,t1_cid6vpp,null,1434349171,0,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,0

**Best**

1. Emineke - Very good play last night, especially compared to the previous game, his pace alone was trouble enough for the defenders. Constantly kept Bosnia thinking, which may have helped the Nigerian defence a lot more than immediately obvious. 

2. Pjanic - Superb play, and as said at half time, it is a shame we wont be seeing him in this world cup anymore. A lot of his strengths for me are his intellegence in the game, able to move the ball to places other's would not anticipate, and able to beat a man, very good play.

3. Musa - Liked the look of him, looked very handy in the first half and managed to get in some really good positions, if he could work on his final ball he could really be a danger. 

**Worst**

1. Dzeko - Dont particularly like him anyway, so a fair amount of bias here, but truth be told he was simply not good enough last night. He was ruled offside for one goal, and then found himself unable to put the ball in the back of the net again, positioning was OK, although you might argue he rarely came to find the ball, but then that's not really his play, but what really let him down was his time on the ball, looked a very tired player. 

2. Misimovic - Just felt his was another poor Bosnia'n performance. Ended up frustrated and lethargic. And I believe he wasted some set pieces late in the game too, also came in alot, forcing Lulic out wide to fill the missing width.

The bailout was the option that preserved profit for the banks themselves. A buyout would allow the government to profit. A break up would have allowed more competition so smaller firms (and start ups) could profit.

6 years later and there are banks moving toward insolvency again. They are working to increase share price with tactics that are going to crash the company while the Directors farm personal profits. It's not directly their fault - legislation means it's the optimal situation for them. We don't have a choice but to look at the other two options now - either a buyout or a crash with a breakup. Legislation to guide us into one or the other is inevitable.

true,limitz,null,null,"EPL has more teams challenging for the title, the top 7 as you say, but La Liga's quality at the top is higher. 

&gt;Not even close to the same quality. 

Let's look at this year's CL:

The Quarterfinals featured 3 Spanish clubs among the 8 teams (only 2 from the PL). And of those 3, both finalists were Spanish. Did you already forget Chelsea lost 3-1 on aggregate to Atletico? Or that City lost to a languid Barcelona?

The 2012/13 CL is even worse. No English team made it into the round of 16, and the semi's featured 2 German, and 2  Spanish teams.

For a a supposed huge gap in quality, Spanish teams seem to be doing pretty well. 

&gt;Besides, EPL is a lot faster and physical league than La Liga.

I keep hearing this, and yet almost all of the Spanish imports in the past few years besides Soldado have been lighting it up. David Silva, Mata, Cazorla, Michu, Aguero, Negredo, Navas, Aspas, and probably even more I'm forgetting. 

Besides Negredo and Michu, none of these players are even that physical.",0,1403432093,null,0,false,0,cidybxe,t3_28q4sa,t1_cidybxe,t1_cidtzir,null,1434349617,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Anotherfuckwit,lfc55,,"I go to every home England game and have said for a long time that we would be lucky to win *any* of our group games. my biggest fear, to be fair was not Uruguay or even Italy, it was the Costa Rica game because our defence does not suit their attacking style. (they get out wide and put it in)

The tactics were more at fault than the players. the team and the tactics were picked by the media. it's almost as though the manager's World Cup strategy was formed by reading the Sunday papers:

""we need to play like Liverpool"" = 'stick as many Liverpool players on the pitch as we can; that ought to do it.' (forgetting the fact that liverpool's system requires *everyone* to work in synchrony and took six months to *begin* to get it right)
""We need to stop Pirlo."" = 'let's have someone close him down.' (forgetting that to close down a player on the ball you must simultaneously close down his *options*)
""we were too gung-ho against Italy"" = 'stop making runs, keep the ball in your own half until the opposition is set and one of our strikers will wander back to collect it.'
etc.

tactics were incredibly naiive.

I'd prefer Gerrard to be able to continue as captain but I believe Rogers has put pressure on him telling him 'you can't do both'. I understand that, Gerrard does too it seems.

Next captain should be Joe Hart. or (this is not an field bias) Jordan Henderson who captained younger England teams successfully. Hart would get the nod from me though.

Since Gary Neville bowed out we've had one liability after another at right back the only really promising player out there was Micah Richards before he got injured a few years ago. never been the same since.

regardless of whether or not centre backs are good enough, that's what we've got. they do not get enough protection from Gerrard in the middle (nor do Liverpool) and wide players, especially Johnson leave them isolated (just like Liverpool)

whoever manages them, get your squad, create a system that everyone knows what they are doing, practice it without sticking random people in, especially the defence  (what the fuck was he doing 'experimenting' with new players in defence in the World Cup warm up games!!!?!!!) and we *could* get lucky.

To be honest, our offer of 25 million was the closest bid to acceptable, if not perfect. 

He's done well this season, yes, granted, but I simply don't think he's worth the 30 million Southampton keep pushing for, especially considering the fact he wants to move to a Champions League side. 

We've already nabbed Lambert and Emre Can is on the way, and as much as I want Lallana to move to Anfield, I honestly believe that should Southampton postpone this transfer any longer, we should start looking at alternatives, Xherdan Shaqiri believed to be one of the more popular ones. 

Shaqiri is showing so much potential and would definitely be under 30 million. Both players, Lallana and Shaqiri, are young and have age on their side, but I reckon should Southampton believe that Lallana is the player that ""makes their team"" and choose to keep him in exchange for a 25-30 million sale, they've missed a great opportunity, and we should grab Shaqiri without a sweat. 

Looking at our performance last season, we've proved that we have the power to push our way to the top of the table. Young players would kill to have an opportunity at Liverpool to either start or continue their career, and challenge for silverware, something Southampton failed to prove last season.

When Charles becomes king I suspect there will be both a royal and media putsch to create a clearer image for him. Also, there will probably be a period of around 12-18 months between his mothers death and his coronation (if indeed that's what happens). You'll probably find there is around a month of mourning for the Queen with the state funeral and all that stuff, followed by a bit of media/political/cultural soul searching. As soon as she dies there will be a *""Proclamation of Accession""* after which Charles will effectively be king, but it won't be for a further 6-18 months that there will be a full coronation, and the latter will probably be all about him. As, much as I like our Queen, I suspect we'll be sick to death of hearing about her if the media do their usual royal death routine.

At 65 it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that Charles could get struck down by an unfortunate cancer or a stroke and she could live on to 100 like her mother. I'd say the odds are on more than ever that Charles may never be King especially as his mother remains in very good health outwardly at least. 

Interestingly, he has previously said he didn't intend to be ""King Charles"", and was going to be styled ""King George"", because historically King Charles [hasn't been](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles_I_of_England#Execution) a very [successful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England) name. How the birth of [Prince George of Cambridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Cambridge) changes that remains to be seen.

Passionate attachments for particular nations produces a variety of evils and should be avoided, rather we should treat all nations amicably. Sympathy for our favorite nations produces a mirage of a common interest where none exists. It means we treat other nations unfairly next to our allies, which produces jealousy and resentment. Finally, it means our allies are tempted to interfere with our internal politics, and that our own people might be tempted to betray our best national interests, sometimes even claiming to be patriotic in doing so.

By being part of these entangling alliances, you could say we've become slaves to other nations. We commit ourselves to being enemies of their enemies, and friends of their friends. Nothing could be better calculated to get us into stupid quarrels and wars, against a dispassionate calculation of doing what's in our own best interests. 

I simply can't see how permanent alliances are compatible with enlightened and independent patriotism, especially between small nations like Britain and much more powerful nations like America, it just means we become their satellites.

I remember moving to Notts and people telling me it was called Shottingham and all that but I never had any problems with crime in the three years I lived there. I lived in the Clifton area (about 10/15 minute drive from city centre and meant to be quite rough), West Bridgford right next to the football grounds (about 5 mins drive from the city centre) and finally in the city centre. Not once did we have any issues. I know some student houses were targeted by burglars but it was usually because the guys in the house went out and left windows wide open. I really think it's association with crime is a thing of the past and I found it much safer than living in Birmingham.  

From your description I would suggest looking at the West Bridgford area. It's next to the river Trent and has loads of parks and long paths to walk down along side the river. Loads of really nice pubs that do decent food and drink along the river side as well. And then if you want to get into the city centre it's about 5 minutes on the bus or about a 20 minute walk.

This may be to do with the employees but I think it needs sorting out. Every time I went to visit her she was in pain and the nurses on the ward really didn't seem to care. She was on the waiting list for an op to have them removed but she kept having postponed due to more urgent operations taking place.   

In the end her gall bladder was hours away from burst and this can be fatal. I'm not sure how this went unseen as she was lying in the bed all day but I was pretty shocked when I found out, she could have died.

But for me i think Tony Barret nailed it on twitter. 

Henderson and Gerrard played well in the season as part of a midfield 3, and Sterling as Roy used him in the #10 does not count as a midfielder. Making it inevitable that they would get outnumbered in midfield, especially against a team like Italy. 

Rooney is a great player, only the English could get on one of their best players back about how he is shit days before a world cup. But he is wasted out wide in that formation. 
Even playing wide men in a front 3 completely defeats the advantage of having 3 of the better attacking fullbacks in the world in Baines, Johnson and Shaw. 

I guess that makes me question why he didnt play Wilshire as the 'Coutinho/Allen' player in a 4-4-2 diamond instead of Welbeck in a 4-2-4  as it looked at times.

There isn't a striker we could get that offers what he does since he's on the same stage as Messi/Ronaldo in being arguably the best player in his position.

We could maybe bring in someone like Mandžukić (if the rumours about him wanting to leave are true), or Hulk or Higuain. But I don't think they'd be any better than Sturridge, and we have a shortage of quality strikers as it is. If the deal to Barca did go through I'd expect £75 million and Sanchez at the very least.

Edit: People in the sub have been saying they'd expect Bale money for Suarez (quite rightly in my opinion).

What always happens is the person gets really good advice from a lot of people......and then they post exactly the same thing a week later ""Yeah but my hard situation in life"". Professional attention seeking whereby the person has subconsciously defined themselves by factors outside of their control and then constantly searching for validation of that definition or world view, hoping to keep proving that they have no agency in their life situation. (A good example is ""I'm Asian, it's impossible for me to bang hot chicks, everyone is racist."" )

I may be really wrong and I hope so but it's worth me saying this just to give you a kick up the arse. Yes you have had some real hard shit happen to you. But you have the world at your feet still, you just have to recognise that it and everyone else does not owe you shit. It's up to you to create your own success and happiness.

The very first thing if you need to learn about if you want to develop yourself (and which no one ever talks about) is ego. Ekhart Tolle's the Power of Now is a good book for that. It's written in a new-agey annoying hippy style but in that book is GOLD. You just have to read between the lines. Read that first and then work on dissolving your ego. This won't change your life in the short term but in the long term nothing will have a more positive effect on your life than learning this.

Next start reading business, psychology, fitness. Ditch Netflix or anything like that and focus on information than can improve your life. The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco is an awesome book on business, it will really help find away to create a business from your skills. You'll read that book, come back and look at your post and totally facepalm. That book will completely shift your perception.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"You cant buy what Suarez has. You can only hope to buy certain parts of the now missing attributes by buying several different players, but it will never be him, He has the trickery of a winger, a pass of a CAM and a shot of a out and out striker, and the intelligence of a true worldie if he left, no money would replace him, because no one player could replace him. 

But in turn lets not forget though, the basics of winning any league and any game is to score goals. And you *can* buy players to do that, and if you can buy players who will get your team scoring the same amount of goals that Suarez scored and beyond , it starts to soften the blow, sure its not him, its not his heart and his trickery, but its getting the club back and keeping to winning football. And in my opinion that is where Spurs had the misfortune of the Bale deal being so cataclysmic, they brought in Soldado, and he failed to score the necessary goals. Do not get me wrong their buys were not great...

But when you have just sold your best player, for 100M, fans expect to see an instant response from the players you bring in. Soldado goes on to score 30+ goals in the premier league season of 13/14 and suddenly it soften the blow a bit more. Lamela goes on to turn defences inside out, and fans start taking notice, the daily rags cant slander you and cause a big issue, and you can start to get winning football. 

The club is always bigger than any player for me, that includes Gerrard.  Even Gerrard will be gone in a few years, but this club will stand years from now, and many legends will come and go through Andfield, the important thing for me, is that you buy players who will ensure you can defend well, and score goals, all the other stuff is necessary, but those are the two areas are two of the most crucial to winning games, And when you sell your best players, you try to look at and replenish the areas they have left, you cant allow one player to be your only shining light, because when he goes, what are you left with?

Frankly I couldn't have given a flying monkey shit about these people. I didn't notice them walking across Waterloo Bridge and I barely noticed they existed when walking across Westminster Bridge.

true,algerining,lfc93,,"Excellently put. I agree completely. Suarez is, and barring a deadline day transfer request, always will be one of my favorite players ever. But, clubs like Chelsea and Arsenal have proven you can qualify for the Champion's League without a world class striker (which we would still have in Studge.) Like you said, the key is replacing that production with something else.

A lot (well, pretty much all) of Chelsea's goals come from their stacked midfield. Their strikers weren't exactly lighting it up the season, but their midfield was dazzling. Our midfield doesn't really give us that right now. Coutinho has come up big in big moments when we really needed a goal, but he isn't the reliable 10+ goal per season attacking midfielder yet. Henderson hasn't really added goals to his game yet (but I can see them coming with time,) and Allen just scored his first club goal off of a set piece, so we're can't rely on either of them to replace Suarez's production. Stevie is playing deeper, and, as you said, will not be at the club as a player in 5 years time.

I think our main priority would be to bulk up on the wings (where we just have Sterling) and in the attacking midfielder department. That's why I like Lallana as an addition for us. He's proven he can provide an excellent goal threat from midfield or the wing. I would like the see another great winger added in, and I'm not really familiar with the market here, so I'll leave that for someone else.

Basically, I completely agree that Suarez's contributions are replaceable, even if he isn't. I don't want to see him leave, but we could move on from it and qualify for the CL again next year.

The differences, AND THERE ARE MANY. Throughout. Is that the BoE article, is talking about how money effectively reaches the public through QE.

'Postive Money' is heavily, heavily spinning this to suggest that private banks are autonomously controling the money supply. Hell its constructing a misquote from a reputable body, in order to use that bodies reputation to justify its position.

That is incorrect, and frankly given the tone of the whole site a lie.

The difference is staggering, either the BoE controls monetary policy and the supply of money, or banks do. In reality it is the former, your site is effectively lying that it is the latter to push an agenda (banks are undemocratic and bad-hiss boo).

Very key word, postive money requires it to be a universal statement of 'ALL' not most. Because we are talking about a methodology used by the BoE, not a foundation truth of economics in practice today.

&gt;by setting monetary policy — through the interest rate that it pays on reserves held by commercial banks with the Bank of England.

Again, to actually understand what the BoE is saying, is that (and its oversimplifying).

Money enters common use, by the banks borrowing money off the BoE, which is created by the BoE issuing bonds. This is then injected into the economy by way of deposit accounts.

None of this takes bonds out of the equation. and if you look through the whole thing not to quote mine, but to understand its point you'll see that.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;I don't know what you are talking about actually. There are so many quotes to prove that most money is created by private banks when they make loans. QE is just talked about because of the recession but in normal times private banks create 97% of new money as loans.

Again your missing a key bit, where does the currency come from?

And again. I think your need to resolve your understanding with these quotes.

p1

&gt;Although commercial banks create money through lending, they cannot do so freely without limit. Banks are limited in how much they can lend if they are to remain profitable in a competitive banking system. Prudential regulation also acts as a constraint on banks’ activities in order to maintain the resilience of the financial system. And the households and companies who receive the money created by new lending may take actions that affect the stock of money — they could quickly ‘destroy’ money by using it to repay their existing debt, for instance. Monetary policy acts as the ultimate limit on money creation. The Bank of England aims to make sure the amount of money creation in the economy is consistent with low and stable inflation.

p8

&gt;Unlike currency, which is created by the Bank of England, bank deposits are mostly created by commercial banks themselves

i.e - look at this

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statutory_minimum_employment_leave_by_country

USA: 0 days - the lowest - Less than China...

'There is no statutory minimum. It is left to the employers to offer paid vacation days as part of the compensation and benefits package. Larger companies will typically offer between 10 and 20 working days, depending on the company and years of service, plus a number of paid public holidays, typically 6-8  needed] Smaller employers may offer no vacations at all.'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_leave

-&gt;  US law does not require employers to grant any vacation or holidays, and about 25% of all employees receive no paid vacation time or paid holidays

i.e 25% of workers get 0 days paid holiday - makes our shitty 28 days look not too bad (including bank holidays).

And look at paternity leave in the USA...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave

- You guessed it --&gt; 0 days !!!

Hence, the only unions who are actually able to be 'strong' are public sector ones. Their demands can only be met through public spending which has a high opportunity cost and reduces spending on other areas, which is problematic to the public good.

 [**Boston Port Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston%20Port%20Act): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Boston Port Act__ (the __Trade Act 1774__) is an [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament) of the [Parliament of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain)  which became law on March 31, 1774, and is one of the measures (variously called the *[Intolerable Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts)*, the *Punitive Acts* or the *Coercive Acts*) that were designed to secure [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain)'s jurisdictions over her [American dominions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States).

&gt;The Act was a response to the [Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party). King [George III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_England)'s speech of 7 March 1774 charged the colonists with attempting to injure British commerce and subvert the Constitution, and on the 18th [Lord North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_North) brought in the Port Bill. It outlawed the use of the [Port of Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Boston) (by setting up a barricade/blockade) for ""landing and discharging, loading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandise"" until such time as restitution was made to the King's treasury (for [customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs) [duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff) lost) and to the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company) for damages suffered. In other words, it closed Boston Port to all ships, no matter what business the ship had. It also provided that [Massachusetts Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Colony)'s seat of government should be moved to [Salem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts) and [Marblehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marblehead,_Massachusetts) made a port of entry. The Act was to take effect on June 1. 

&gt;Even some of the best friends of America in Parliament at first approved the Act as moderate and reasonable, as the town could end the punishment at any moment by paying for legitimate merchandise destroyed by riot and allowing law and order to have their course. But the [Whig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party\)) opposition soon collected itself, and the bill was fought in its various stages by [Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke), [Isaac Barré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barr%C3%A9), [Thomas Pownall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pownall) and others. In spite of them, the Act became a law 31 March, without a division in the [Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom) and by unanimous vote in the [Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords_of_the_United_Kingdom).

I disagree. That makes no sense. Things like transport are key to the flow of business and commuting, leisure and tourism. Police manage disruption as best they can to minimise the impact on that and by extension the economy. Theres also health and safety considerations in some cases too im sure.

A planned route that organisers and police follow which gives an agreed compromise on message and exposure matched against the control of disruption, would be in the polices interests to follow and kettling would only disrupt their own plan. So it makes no sense unless the organisers plan to deviate from arrangements that kettling would happen, that would be the police causing disruption by lengthening the protest.

However due to a lack of team identity and cohesiveness the team played pretty rubbish all year, and more importantly got stomped by pretty much all of the top 4 teams (and fucking West Ham). We also got done by injuries all year and were up there in the injury charts for basically the whole season. That being said, we have a very young squad and there were flashes of potential throughout the season, we were just never able to string anything together basically. We've just signed a new manager (Pochettino) who managed to get Southampton (a club with far fewer resources than us) to 8th spot playing attractive, attacking football and developed a number of their youth players into English internationals (Shaw, Lallana, Lambert to an extent). So basically this off-season is basically the same asmost off-seasons for a Spurs fan - excited about our potential to succeed but secretly prepared for another season of heartbreak",0,1403450993,null,0,false,0,cie2o71,t3_28sp1g,t1_cie2o71,t1_cie2gka,null,1434351729,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Inevitably some services are going to be better delivered by private suppliers. It would be ludicrous for the NHS to develop all its own pharmaceuticals or build its own MRI scanners. And all GP surgeries have always been private businesses. 

The previous government introduced Independent Sector Treatment Centres to handle simple surgical procedures and reduce backlogs. This proved to be a disaster. £500m was wasted, and NHS trusts are bringing this work back in house. 

The latest private sector involvement has come about largely due to lobbying by healthcare suppliers and management consultants. They consulted and helped draft the legislation. This is the wrong way to involve the private sector, and it isn't going to work.

You can choose whether to use a BUPA or Nuffield hospital, and the competition between them keeps them both efficient.  You can't choose the supplier your NHS trust has selected via bidding process which is only open to a select list of well connected suppliers who will try to make a profit by cutting the service to the bone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"First of all my sincerest apologies for the late reply.  I was in the air all day yesterday and suffered an asthma attack to boot! Anyway, I find your first point quite interesting.   To describe wars as a capitalist thing seems strange- not only were they common features of pre-capitalist societies, and even (in a sense) were existent before civilization itself formed in the case of tribal conflicts and so on.  Socialist countries, especially China and Russia themselves came very very close to war, arguably only avoided because that would make them weak to Western attack.    In addition, the argument that WW1 started because capitalism influenced its immediate factors is absolutely untrue.   The Serbian question, and indeed the heart of the Austro-Hungarian situation which triggered the war, was the fault of the various ethnic and religious faultlines of the Empire.  In Germany, too, conflicts with France were part of a long series of wars that had begun centuries earlier.   Certain Capitalist interests had profited off of some of this myriad patchwork of alliances and conflicts (though that's a stupid point because in a capitalist society people can make money off of everything, not just 'bad' things), but in general, tariffs and border controls hindered business more than anything.    Far more than any other factor, WW1 was a nationalist conflict, and as we know, Nationalism can existed in societies of all types.   Indeed Nationalism is an impediment to capitalism and globalisation, which is why most capitalist interests are not happy about the prospect of leaving Europe.  Contrary to some of the information you may have seen, Germany was not close to Marxist revolution in 1932.  Socialism was a powerful force in politics at the time, certainly, but the risk of Marxists coming into power across Europe and indeed the world is MASSIVELY overstated (I literally did a Semester on this at University).  Leftist groups and trade unionists, who did gain power in many countries, were only very rarely for the full Marxist program, and often just wanted better labour laws, nationalisation of key industries, and government job creation programs.   In the First World War, the Kaiser was not, actually, especially scared of Communists (though he did dislike the social democrats), but rather was unwilling to give way to a full constitutional democracy and thought a quick war would cement his power.  Your second point is based on an even more interesting pont in my opinion.  You suggest corruption is inherent in purely hierarchical societies, and that the state inherently furthers its own interests, both suggestions with which I would agree wholeheartedly.   I, and most other Conservatives, see the state as an unfortunate necessity, to be watched, doubted and restricted and every turn.   Someone must find rapists, murderers and criminals, as well as those who invade others' property and administer our justice to hold them to account, and something must defend us against less free societies and leaders who wish to attack us from abroad.  With very few exceptions, that is all a capitalist want the government to do.  Even a central bank or federal reserve is unnecessary if money is backed by gold, and everything else may be handled, non-hierarchically, by individuals and private interests. An 'anarchist' society, by contrast, cannot function without an extremely powerful state.   As there is not an unlimited supply of goods, energy, land and resources, their distribution must be regulated.  In a capitalist society, financial instruments (ie money) and a very basic set of property rights that can be enforced by a small group of people, allow for efficient distribution of said resources.  In an anarchist society,  either these goods are given to everyone in equal measure (I don't want a trampoline, you don't want an xbox), they are given freely (I take more food than I need, more land than I need, and more power than I need just because I can) or they are allocated based on various factors by a central authority which sits hierarchically atop the distribution chain- i.e. a state. The second problem in an anarchist society is that banning capitalist trade and employment is a task that would require a Stasi-like volume of secret police, infiltration and state control/surveillance.  If I give Bob 10% of my chickens this year in return for 25% of his tomato crop next year, that's me 'investing' in his business, and thus 'profiting' off his labour.   If Sam gives Jerry 20 bushels of wheat for helping him catch 50lb of tuna this year, and then trades that tuna for 100 bushels of wheat on the black market, Sam is, in Marx's eyes, a capitalist. In order to stop capitalism cropping up, to prevent private trade, to prevent employment of labour for profit, and to prevent the development of private currency (which in the age of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is almost impossible anyway), a colossal surveillance effort would be needed, with neighbours informing on neighbours, and a huge central control operation, probably with hierarchical structure to boot.  If I set up a little capitalist state within your anarchist one, whose going to come in with guns and pitchforks and shut me down?  An army? Whose?  And under centralised, hierarchical control?    ",0,1403454383,null,0,false,0,cie3w60,t3_28mnpw,t1_cie3w60,t1_cid8c2b,null,1434352304,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

How on Earth they think the MBT makes them experts is laughable. It's like doing a CBT and thinking that you're now a n expert on all things two wheels. Shit. I wouldn't even think that the DAS makes you an expert. 

Ninja 300 is a great bike - doesn't mean it's the only bike in the world in its class. The SV650, again is good, but it just lacks any soul. 

I wish I could afford to have a scooter as well. It would make my quick urban errands so much easier and more enjoyable. But, they have a different type of road network over there.

They're certainly relevant and there is certainly a defence aspect to the EU, but that is a tiny part of the whole thing. NATO and the UN's primary function is the application of military force or granting consent to the application of that military force (respectively). SEATO, CENTO are also primarily not focused in Europe and are, again, *primarily* military organisations. 

Now let's contrast these with the EU. It's main functions are trade, governmental co-operation and peace. Significant amounts of EU money heads towards things like the European Space Agency and to environmental concerns. The EU is so much more than a military organisation. It is one of the only organisations that exists today which is almost exclusively focused on building a peace *peacefully* rather than by amassing more sticks and intimidating everybody else into being peaceful, which is exactly why we ended up with World War One, the very event which we're commemorating the centenary of.

I just think it is extremely disingenuous to claim that because the EU has these EU battle groups (which always remain soldiers of their respective countries) that is effectively the same thing as NATO.

I am not like you. I know very little about this subject. I'm reluctant to find out more because this would require research which costs time and effort. I also don't approve of demonstrations much - I simply don't see how they make a difference, but I do like to criticise them and their participants based on trivial observations. But maybe I will go and watch one or watch/read a news report about one by chance or ""for a laugh"". By some tremendously unlikely coincidence I could, in principle, change my world view by some amount, and maybe I would pay more attention to similar events in the future.

But perhaps you're right - the story doesn't bring anything new to the table. So why don't I just relax and forget about it in the comfort of your expertise. I should also mention that I intend to vote in the next general elections (or maybe I don't need to, because I'm sure you'll do the right thing).

On a serious note: How many reports about one person on a street corner have you seen? Probably a few, right? The people were probably a bit crazy - maybe they super glued their genitals to the floor of a supermarket or something like that. The BBC or whatever news outlet you might prefer WILL report on a single person at a street corner if there is enough meat in the story for the public to read/watch it.

true,evilcleverdog,wales-pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,"&gt; Protests are routinely ignored by the media unless people smash some windows or the police start a fight. This is one of the reasons some protesters use tactics such as property damage : it means it gets into the media instead of being ignored. It's a shame that violent protest is the only way to be heard, but that's the way it is so someone hand me a half-brick please.

This is by far the stupidest, most upvoted comment here. People who get violent do so because they're arseholes, and they are using an opportunity to profit, and avoid punishment by blending into a crowd. Never have I seen a vandalizer or thief, who smashed a window with the intent to get more media attention.

Also, if you must know, violence actually diminishes the effectiveness of protests. The whole idea of a protest is to get attention, and sympathizers, and convince otherwise apathetic politicians to help. If you start acting like a mass of dickheads no one is going to help you out. A protest is a cry for help. 

Thirdly, Reddit is a form of media. The poster is complaining that this protest isn't making the news, but the internet is a part of it. This website counts.

It has a rather unjustified reputation for being a rough place but it's a lovely *small* city, I've lived here all my life and I'm yet to get any serious hassle, I can't imagine it being any worse than bigger cities, just like any other city it has good parts and bad parts. If you have half a brain you should be able to spot the types of people to avoid a mile off.

With regards to parks, arts, jobs etc, there are a lot of open places: Baxter Park, Lochee Park, Caird Park, Camperdown Park, Magdalen Green etc etc. There's a lot of parks! Baxter and Lochee parks host the bonfire night firework shows but if you want to be greedy you can go up Dundee Law and see both at the same time :P, I'd also recommend going up the Law in general if you do decide to investigate Dundee further for a brilliant view of the city and surrounding area.

Countryside access: you are no more than a two hour drive from the highlands, Aberdeen or Edinburgh. Perth and St Andrews are right next door, easy rail links and I believe there are regular flights direct to London. As its right on the edge of a river it has a good beach at broughty ferry, plus Broughty ferry is a great place for days and nights out, plenty of shops and pubs, although it is a bit expensive to live there. Dundee is also statistically Scotlands sunniest city, so you get a whole extra day of sun! Theres also a good city centre - compact yet a great selection of shops, pubs and usual city centre stuff

You have heard correct about the arts scene there is a lot to do and its only going to get better with the waterfront redevelopment and the V&amp;A museum opening in a few years. The Caird Hall has always got something going on ranging from Standup to Ballet to live music to video game festivals. Dundee rep &amp; contemporary arts theatres are right next door and there are always shows going on (I think the rep has Scotlands only full time set of actors), The McManus art galleries I've been told are lovely, I've never been inside but if the outside of the building is anything to go by the inside should be great. You also have three education institutes (Abertay Uni, Dundee Uni, and Duncan &amp; Jordanstone College of art &amp; design) that all have some art related courses and usually show student art and regular art exhibitions through the year.

As there are two uni's in close proximity with respected courses in arts and digital courses (&amp; video games) you can kind of guess there are a lot of digital media companies here or nearby (there are a lot of game development studios) who I'm certain will be in need of a graphic designer / illustrator and theres bound to be work for a web dev too.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I think we'll have to wait and see, Charles has picked up some negative press but I think you'll see institutions and the government back him immediately, plus news outlets like the BBC will be very unlikely to rock the boat. 

The guardian are a strange old bunch when it comes to monarchs. They might have the odd ""Republicanism slant for balance"" article down the scrollbar on their website but I don't think it's like them to push for what would effectively be a non-constitutional outcome to the line of succession. 

Then there's the Sun, Mirror etc. Working class support for the monarchy is high and printing controversial stories about monarchs in working class papers can go to one of two extremes, where it either sells a lot of papers - or it kills your readership overnight out of protest. I don't see why they would push for someone other than Charles or take the risk like that.

Above all, as you point out, anybody expecting Charles to bow down to any sort of popularity campaign is missing the core point of our constitutional monarchy. We have a very long established legal mechanism that selects the next monarch and that's the point... No amount of friends, soldiers or money can change who the rightful ruler of the country is - and we've had the benefit of grooming someone for the job for probably something like 70-75 years by the time he actually gets there. It would also be tremendously unfair to do that to a man who has spent his entire life dedicated to taking on a job like that. He might not be amazingly popular and his views sometimes stray into the fantastical, but that's tough luck. The only way I can see it being any different is if Charles himself decides for whatever reason... for example if he has a terminal diagnosis himself at the time of her death. But even then I personally doubt he would step aside in all honesty. 

There is also no historical basis for how this would work. In reality Charles would probably **have** to be crowned King and then abdicate, and his families views on abdication are very well known following the abdication of Edward VIII that thrust his grandmother and grandfather into the strange position of suddenly being relatively unknown to becoming King and Queen Consort.

Which I am not doing. I've completely acknowledged their existence and pointed out that they have only limited relevance within the EU. It is a tiny amount of troops used to patrol borders which remain under the direct command of a national army at all times. The resources diverted to them are absolutely tiny in comparison to other areas of the EU and their function is almost irrelevant compared to the functions of other areas of the EU, such as the common currency and market. 

I've not gotten away from the main point, I've pointed out why I disagree with it. I think that the centenary is about commemorating the tragedies of the past and finding or continuing solutions to those problems. The EU is the solution, a along with international co-operation and integration in general. I think that having the flag of the institution which is directing the process which has created peace in Europe for 60 years and broken the cycle of continuous warfare between European states justified its flag being flown at the commemoration.

true,aeisenst,num5,,"/u/fuug gives a pretty good appraisal, but as far as our players go, we're mostly excited about Christian Eriksen, who we picked up last summer from Ajax. He's slotted in well as our playmaker, and of all seven of the signings, he's far and away the most successful. A lot of people will also talk about Lamela, who is probably the most obvious replacement for Bale. He's our record signing, but he got very few starts last year (though he was hampered by injury). Most fans, though, still have a lot of faith in him, and he's very young, so he could be the big breakout star of next year. Finally, our other huge signing was Roberto Soldado (sometimes Bob the Soldier). He was a great goal scoring threat in Spain, but he severely underperformed in the premier league. There's a lot of debate about whether this was because of a lack of service from the midfielders, or whether he's lost the goal scoring touch. Next year is really a make-or-break for him. Other popular players are Vertonghen, our star CB, though he had a pretty rough year last year, both performance-wise as well as personally, Sandro, who is great but is still coping with some injury issues, and Lloris, the best goalkeeper in the world.

As far as transfers go this summer, we desperately need a leftback, could use a good, pacy cb, and as always, we're short a striker. Danny Rose, our lb last year, was a huge problem, so hopefully Pochettino will replace him soon. Dawson, a long time Spurs player and team captain, doesn't seem to really fit into Poch's system, so hopefully he'll be replaced with a faster, more athletic centerback. Adebayor, who was our best striker last year, is super mercurial, sometimes looking top tier, other times completely disinterested. On top of that, his salary sky-rockets this year, due to some shenanigans with his transfer from Man City. Levy is probably going to dump him, so we'll need a replacement.

Hopefully that gets you up to speed with the team.",0,1403458442,null,0,false,0,cie5hql,t3_28sp1g,t1_cie5hql,t3_28sp1g,null,1434353057,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

This isn't Game of Thrones. Monarchy isn't a popularity contest in the slightest and certainly not in the sense a democracy is. We don't get to choose who our next King or Queen is, it doesn't work like that. That is why other countries fought wars over their political governance. It's also why ours has been very stable **thanks** to monarchy.

The line of succession **is** the line of succession, like it or not. But one of the reasons monarchy survived here and not elsewhere is because our royal family have regularly modernized themselves and their role over the last 300 years - now we're in a position where they are effectively a hereditary corporation that acts as a figurehead for institutions. Any power they have is relatively limited and while they're material assets are impressive, they're at the mercy of a lot of different parties - including a government they once fought a civil war with and increasingly a populist public and press.

Monarchy is also a part of who we are. If the UK goes against monarchy its a bit like the USA turning its back on the right to bear arms... it's part of what makes them different from other nations and shapes their cultural image. I think people might be prepared to look past someone a bit irritating because they value the thing, though perhaps not the individual.

I dont have much evidence of actual UK protests to base this on, and you have provided none to back up the claims you've made, but given the stated goals of kettling tactics, as i linked to, all that claim you've made serves to prove is its as likely violent elements were prevented from erupting into uncontained violence.

Kettling being a preventative reaction, kettling is not a tactic deployed to contain significant violence that has already erupted, it is a tactic to contain elements that might erupt into violence.

&gt; kettling has preceded rather than followed significant violence.

Therefore kettling has been a great success in UK protests at containing significant violence from erupting.

&gt;

&gt;The __Roanoke Colony__ on [Roanoke Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_Island) in [Dare County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dare_County,_North_Carolina), present-day [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), was a late 16th-century attempt by [Queen Elizabeth I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England) to establish a permanent [English settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_overseas_possessions). The enterprise was financed and organized originally by [Sir Humphrey Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Gilbert), who drowned in 1583 during an aborted attempt to colonize [St. John's, Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador). Sir Humphrey Gilbert's half brother [Sir Walter Raleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Raleigh) later gained his brother's charter from Queen Elizabeth I and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates [Ralph Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lane) and [Richard Grenville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Grenville), Raleigh's distant cousin. 

&gt;The final group of colonists disappeared during the [Anglo-Spanish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Spanish_War_(1585%E2%80%931604\)), three years after the last shipment of supplies from [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England). Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname ""The Lost Colony"". To this day there has been no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists.

3. Eden Hazard (LW) - Quiet in the first half but grew into the game second half. Kept the ball well and was tightly marked, sometimes doubled up on. Played a big part in the lead up to the goal and set  it up. Also set up a glorious chance for Mertens who should have scored at the end.

**Worst**

2. Kokorin (ST) - Missed a free header just outside the 6 yard box in the first half which was a great chance. Should have put Russia ahead.

De Bruyne was almost ignored in the build-up play, and they reverted to a much more direct style of attacking, much like the style Atletico or Everton have been playing this season.

In Segunda Division, the top two teams in the table get promoted automatically to La Liga while places 3 - 6 go through the promotion play-offs. For all matches, it is home and away, including the final, with away goals counting for more like in Europe.  

Las Palmas had eliminated Sporting de Gijon while Cordoba had eliminated Real Murcia. Cordoba had an average home record but a superb away record this season. So in the home Final match, it remained a scoreless draw between Cordoba - Las Palmas. In today's match, Las Palmas had scored at the 48' minute and for the rest of the match, Cordoba tried to equalize for the promotion spot.  

As the 90' minute approached, Cordoba looked unable to score and it seemed like Las Palmas was going to get promoted. The fans knew it as well and after the ref added 3' minutes after 90' minutes, after the 2' minutes, some of the fans began invading the pitch, disrupting the unfinished game, soon becoming chaos. The ref stopped the game while the Las Palmas fans where asked to go back to the stands. By the time the crowd was under control, it was the 98' minute and the ref had to give back the time wasted. Well Cordoba resumed their attack and in one attempt at goal, the keeper parried the ball back to the feet of the Cordoba players and Ulises Davila was the one to push it into the back of the net at the 100' minute, giving Cordoba the last promotion spot and their return to the top after 42 years.

We're at a phase of technological development where we're getting vastly diminishing returns since all the low hanging fruit has been taken.

&gt;

&gt;__Godwin's law__ (or __Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies__)   is an [Internet adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_humor) asserting that ""As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1""  ​ that is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler) or [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism).

&gt;Promulgated by American attorney and author [Mike Godwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Godwin) in 1990,  Godwin's Law originally referred, specifically, to [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsgroup) discussions.  It is now applied to any [threaded online discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading), such as [Internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum), [chat rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room) and [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) comment threads, as well as to speeches, articles and other rhetoric.  

&gt;In 2012, ""Godwin's Law"" became an entry in the third edition of the *[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary)*.

As ""the issue"" is whether the BBC should cover the protest in the news then there is room for opinion.

&gt;political message we're talking about is a fact

You're confusing two different things.

Austerity has affected people: FACT.

There should be less opinion (what the protesters argue for): OPINION.

&gt;at a disadvantage: in an unfavourable position **relative** to someone or something else.

So the phrase is meaningless unless you say what they're disadvantaged relative to.

&gt;lots of recent statistics and articles illustrating the negative effects of austerity measures on societies

I just tried Googling. Nothing I found blamed the way austerity has been implemented for damaging millions. Sorry if I'm being thick here.

&gt;You're assuming that the ""best"" way is for news reports to be prioritised according to some ""measure"" on the subject.

Correct. I think a (reasonably) objective measure is the best way for the BBC to decide what to broadcast. What would you suggest instead?

&gt;There is no ""best"" measure

I never said there is. However, there are measures which can be considered. I accept that you should also take into account the context.

&gt;an arbitrary measure, which, in this case, isn't even related to the subject

How is popularity of a political viewpoint not related to politics/policy (within a democracy)?

&gt;with all these measures

Only one measure, popularity, has been mentioned.

&gt;how can we be sure that ""dissenting"" viewpoints are indeed presented adequately

I don't exactly have a source for the false rape claims. I just finished my Criminology degree and we studied rape/sexual assaults in detail (There's various things to support it if you Google it but you'll probably find articles that disagree too). The point is that people who make false rape claims are emotional unstable and probably have mental health problems. Police question people who report rapes for hours, grabbing every piece of info they can. They probe them to the point where many sexual assault victims have complained to the police Ombudsman/ media for being treated like a criminal. If their story does not match up perfectly, it's thrown out and won't even be brought to court. The victim is literally treated like a criminal throughout the process. Of course it's possible that the 'victim' is lying, but the process easily weeds out liars, *most* of the time.

Sorry for you're experience. I will make my own mind up about whether a person is guilty or not, but only if I know them well enough to do so. I cannot judge them if I don't. The courts cannot deal with rape/ sexual assault; Most of the time it's just hearsay evidence and that is not enough to convict anyone.

You're right, these are incredibly complex matters with more nuances than I am able to comprehend at a glance, same with local and foreign policy, elections, unified theory etc. Being bombarded with the opinions of other lay people is probably not going to help. 

With regards to the elections, would you like to see every independent candidate, every farcical group and every person on the street willing to vomit an opinion be given airtime with the BBC as well as the traditional parties? A line has to be drawn somewhere. 

As for someone supergluing their genitals to the floor; I am hoping that this is an unusual event and would therefore be considered an interesting anomaly, even then I am not sure it would be national news unless it was an otherwise dull day. People protesting austerity measures is not an anomaly, but then again, neither are protests against government spending. I'm not denying that the budget is an important (and contentious) issue, but this protest has been small fry in the grand scheme of things, especially as this was a conglomerate of a number of different causes, not a coherent protest. It might be a turning point in the history of human-kind but presently it appears to be a minor footnote in London life; our recent defeat in football is more interesting to the average Brit and our national state of mind.

The Guardian is the only mainstream Internet outlet on the first page of a Google search for 'London 2014 anti cut protest' and their reporting is coming under scrutiny here, as you've seen (on a side note, The Guardian doesn't state what the protesters are offering as an alternative to austerity measures, just that they don't like them. And that Russell bloody Brand wants to lead a joyous revolution).

Overall, I think the lack of reporting may have actually drummed up more awareness online, particularly where Reddit is concerned.

On a personal note, I don't think protests are an effective way of changing policy and public opinion; a careful campaign of information dissemination, particularly in the age of the internet, will reach more people and is less likely to turn away fence sitters. I will automatically discount any protest where violence or destruction is initiated by protesters.

No, I'm saying that *if* GCHQ wanted to do bad things to me, I think they'd be far more capable of it than those other entities.

This refers to your original comment that GCHQ doesn't have a monopoly on 'this stuff' - the point is, just because other people might be active in the same general sphere doesn't mean it wouldn't be big news it GCHQ put its mind to it. This is true regardless of whether they actually do or not, my comment was about the principle of the comparison.

&gt; I know people who work in this field. GCHQ are not beyond the law nor do they believe that they are.

This really seems like a massive...so what? It's a total non-argument to say you know some good people, or to simply claim that GCHQ operate within the law. I mean, maybe they do and maybe they don't, but your statement demonstrates nothing, we all already know they *claim* to, and if that settled the matter we'd never have to question anyone about anything.

You're also attacking arguments I didn't make in not very good ways - I didn't even claim that GCHQ is breaking the law, my entire comment is about the principle that (as above) it's still noteworthy were they to do so because their resources are so much greater than most others of 'ill intent'.",0,1403467800,null,0,false,0,cie9hc7,t3_28ral6,t1_cie9hc7,t1_cie91wh,null,1434355064,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

---

&gt;On 3 December 2012, [Belfast City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Council) voted to limit the days that the [Union Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag) (the flag of the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)) flies from [Belfast City Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Hall).  Since 1906, the flag had been flown every day of the year.  The vote means that it will now be flown no more than 18 days a year, in line with British government guidelines regarding government buildings.  The move to limit the number of days was backed by the council's [Irish nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism) and the [Alliance Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland); it was opposed by the [unionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland) councillors.

The three examples in the wiki are of the US civil rights movement too. Im not aware of any in the UK, which is kind of a shame, probably something in the 60's i guess... bit before my time.

If you pressed me for lots more examples of the most effective forms of protest being non-violent i'd probably reach next for Ghandi in India or something... but im not going to because, despite your eagerness to attack sit down protests being effective, im only making the case here, that they are a **lot** more positive and effective, than throwing bricks through shop windows.

Yes.

I'd rather people did the sit-in thing. In the US. In the UK. Anywhere.

If you like lakes/mountains then the Lake District is the place to be. In my opinion it is the most beautiful place in the UK. I recommend driving up towards the Penrith/Keswick area.
North Wales has some amazing mountains though too and brilliant castles. The drive along the North Coast would bring you across some really cool places.
If you like seaside countryside then the North Yorkshire Coast is a must. It also has the country's best fish n chips.

The UK is fairly expensive unless you're clever with where you buy your food. Find a local grocery and you'll be quids in.

District, no idea. Just moved here and living in suburban Downend which is very nice and quiet, but 4 miles out of town.

Flat rental - if you go through an Estate Agency (which is usually normal and safer in some respects, but often trickier), you'll have to pay between one and two months rent in advance, the estate agent or Landlord MUST legally show it's placed in a deposit protection scheme, it's illegal for them to keep your deposit for themselves, generally you should get all of it back when you leave.

Contracts are usually 12 months min. If you go through an agency you'll have to prove you have an income and can legally work in the UK. If you have a private agreement (i.e. finding a house on Gumtree) then you'll not have to deal with so many hoops to jump through, but be very very careful that you trust any person you enter a private deal with.

IT jobs, no idea. Google IT Recruitment Agencies Bristol and see what comes up. Agencies can be good to help place you in work, but will take some of the money you'd otherwise get.

Serbia, Croatia et al are about as 'our neck of the woods' as it gets. And the EU didn't do a thing about it. So you can hardly say in good conscience that they have kept the peace locally. Yes, yes, I know you said afterwards that it is only amongst the member states that this tenuous peace has been kept (everyone is just rearing to go kill themselves some neighbours, but are simply unable due to this membership thingy), but peace *in Europe* was not upheld by those pulling the strings in Brussels. That is a failure of genocidal proportions.

&gt;

&gt;__West Germany versus Austria__ was a [1982 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_FIFA_World_Cup) game played at the [El Molinón stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Molin%C3%B3n), [Gijón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), on 25 June 1982.

&gt;The match was the last game of the first-round [Group 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_FIFA_World_Cup#Group_2), with [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria_national_football_team) and [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_national_football_team) having played the day before. With the outcome of that match already decided, a win by one or two goals for West Germany would result in both them and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria_national_football_team) qualifying at the expense of Algeria, which had beaten West Germany in the first game. After 10 minutes, West Germany took the lead. Thereafter, neither team scored, and few scoring chances were created.

&gt;In the second group stage of the previous [World Cup in 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup), the Austrians, despite having already been eliminated, had made great efforts to beat West Germany 3–2 in a match known as the [Miracle of Cordoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Cordoba), which deprived the Germans of a berth in the Third Place match.

And ""smearing"" the black bloc? Are you having a laugh? How do you smear an aggressive faceless blob? If protestors dont police the black bloc they give it their tacit support, and the cops have exploited that to insert agitators in black bloc costume creating justification to move in and disperse using heavier handed tactics than is justified.

&gt; Non violent movements rarely if ever succeed without a militant wing alongside them.

Total bollocks mate. A non violent movement succeeds because it succeeds in maintaining nonviolence.

You're confusing how the presence of a complimentary radical movement effects an overton window on the publics perception of the more mainstream movements message.

4. Try and find a more casual contract through gumtree or something. My friends pay £600 a month without bills for a one bedroom flat on Zetland Road (central area) and so you could go further out for something cheaper or go for a houseshare and pay about £350 a month.

* The choice is between two campaigns - ""Better Together"" and ""Yes Scotland"". Although Cameron has made his opinion clear, he isn't involved in the better together campaign at an official level, so he is no more entitled to represent the UK than any other significant figure in UK politics. Salmond often tries to elevate himself like this... Holyrood is only a regional government, and Salmond is only a regional leader. Cameron on the other hand is PM for the whole country and as such occupies a higher political office. If Cameron debates with Salmond on national TV then he'll be giving Salmond a boost by elevating him to such a status where people percieve Salmond as being able to *""parley""* on equal terms, and that's not right... Salmond isn't an international politician and he doesn't have any right to engage Cameron in a 1 on 1. In a sense, Salmond works **for** Cameron.

* Cameron's image is not good in Scotland, very few people there voted for him. He's a smart guy who went to Oxford, he understands harsh truths like this. He also knows that north of the border Salmond enjoys a curious sort of popularity... people don't necessarily agree with him but they do have a quirky respect for his pro-Scottish message. Challenging that will only play to Salmond's strengths, who can just laugh off anything Cameron says or does as *""A posh English Westminster politician telling us what tae do""*. Taking part in this would be a huge own goal for the UK government. Cameron also knows that the Scots are proud to a fault, and being in any way seen to *""talk Scotland down""* will cause the currently anaemic Yes Scotland campaign to gather speed.

* Last and perhaps most significantly... Better Together are on course to win. They have always been on course to win statistically. **However**, the polling difference is not huge and there remain a very large amount of undecided voters that could theoretically swing it one way or the other. By doing nothing and not rocking the boat too much, Cameron is on target to achieve the outcome he wants. Debating with Salmond is just incredibly high risk... yes, he might be able to put forward his vision for a ""Better Together Scotland"" and win by a bigger margin, but in reality it's more likely (per the above paragraph) that he'll provide Salmond with exactly what he needs - a last minute swing.

If you think I'm joking, the govt itself quoted 20k women trafficked for sex in the UK. The original study estimated (IIRC) 2k max. The rest was just exaggeration by various interested parties. It led to police resources being directed away from women who had been trafficked, as they sought huge international slavers rather than small gangs and pimps.

Paulinho came on very strong at the beginning of last season, and looked like a great signing, but kinda faded about halfway through. Now, part of that might be that both AVB and Sherwood were using him in kinda weird ways, but in the WC he has still been lousy. He's one of those weird in-betweener types. He's not really an attacking midfielder, but he doesn't really defend either. He's at his best dribbling the ball, but his passes have been very suspect. He doesn't press well, either. Most importantly (in my eyes, at least), all of those things that I said could equally be said for Dembele. They are very, very similar players, yet they kept being played together as a central pairing. What ended up happening was when they tried to pivot, neither could really handle their defensive duties, but similarly, neither could make the killer pass into the attack.

I never corrected them, I internalised everything and refused to admit, even to myself, that it really wasn't my fault. 

It took many years before I was able to admit what had happened and openly talk about it. Even now, over 13 years later, it's still traumatic for me to talk about the details of it all.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Cameron is often under-rated as an orator after his performances in the last General Election debates. In reality I think Cameron was actually fairly effective, but he struggled in the debates because peoples perceptions of his party were still incredibly poor after their stint in power in the 80s/early 90s... and because the message he was putting across was fairly trite = more tax, less gov spending... hmm, easy to sell. 

But actually, in the Commons he can be pretty cutting. People forget that these Eton educated Oxford politician types have spent the first 21 years of their life in school and university debating clubs learning how to do it professionally.

Now, this next point I sat as someone who doesn't personally like Cameron... but he is a smart man. He often gets a hard time for his privileged background and the fact that virtually as soon as he left university he got sucked into politics so has never worked in real industry. But where Cameron can be accused of being privileged, Salmond can be accused of being mediocre. He also went pretty much straight from university into career politics, and having only a 2:2 degree to his name.  

Anyway, back on point - my guess is the outcome would depend on which side of the border you're sitting on. In Scotland a posh Tory is almost always going to have a rough ride especially against a man like Salmond who while people don't necessarily agree with him, they do respect his genuine pro-Scottishness. In the wider UK Cameron will probably be applauded for point out some of the gaping flaws (of which we all know there are many) in Salmonds logic. But ultimately, what people south of the border think isn't going to win the referendum for Cameron.",1,1403473166,null,0,false,0,ciebr94,t3_28sjfi,t1_ciebr94,t1_cie4ftp,null,1434356137,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;I'm not outspoken on LGBT issues and rights, therefore I'm not confident with my sexuality.

So it's okay for you to say I'm not confident or secure when I *do* speak out and paint me out as some kind of self loather, but I can't do the same to you?

Got it.

Can dish it out but can't take it ey? Why can you do that to me but then freak out when I return the favor?

&gt;You're a very outspoken person on LGBT issues and rights, whereas I am not. It's not because I don't care, it's just not really in the fore-front of my mind and I don't care about it as much as you do. 

It's not at the forefront of my mind either, but there's a big difference between ""not caring"" and being a Know Your Place boot licking, ass licking queer like I said. It's okay to not care, but when you try and drag people who DO care down into your pit of silence or paint them out to be self loathing because they're outspoken then we're going to have a problem.

&gt;Fuck it: I'm actually sorry for being a dickhead. I saw your post on /r/offmychest and I do feel bad for affecting you that much. So, sorry. 

Thanks, I appreciate that. Don't think you're the only one though, the reason I made that post is because I've encountered a lot of people like you in my own friends and family and online who has done the exact same thing and it really pisses me off because I didn't spent 20 years getting over my insecurities and growing the balls to finally be able to say what I truly think to just have everyone turn around and accuse me of having the self loathing, insecure mindset I spent 20 years getting over only a year after I got over it. I'm not having it. 

Gays like you make me angry, and I don't get angry much. You make me angry because you try so blatantly hard to impress the straight people you copy them to the T including their anti-gay opinions and it makes me feel sick, you kiss ass and it makes me cringe, and it's so obvious Like when you parroted straight people by saying ""stop shoving your agenda down people's throats"" (what self respecting gay man says that? seriously) it basically translates to me as ""Please like me straight people! I'm not like this guy! I'm just like you! I share your oppressive opinions too! I want gays to be silent and invisible too! Like me! Like me!""

If straight people didn't constantly go on about gay people shoving their sexuality down their throat or contantly go on about how they're fine with gay people as long as they never talk about gayness and act/look as straight as possible then you would never have parroted them. 

Can't you see what you're doing? Can't you see how oppressive what you did was? Trying to gag me and propagate the idea that the only confident gay is a silent gay, the only happy gay is an invisible gay. Do you have any idea how bad that is?

&gt;How do you smear an aggressive faceless blob?

Easily.  Just as you're attempting to do now.

Actually, let's take a look at their site.

Have to admit it's hard to work out fro their [policies page](http://www.classwarparty.org.uk/policies/) where they plan on getting the money from, as it's a short:

* Double dole
* Double pension
* Double all other benefits
* 50% Mansion tax
* Abolish the monarchy
* Abolish all public schools

Not sure there's THAT much to be raised from a mansion tax (not to mention that if you had to pay half the value of a property, every year, values would collapse so you'd be getting fuck all from that pretty fast!).

Looks like they plan on generously donating at least £14,000 to the state at the General Election mind you - at least, I'd lay fucking good odds on them not holding a single deposit, and they're apparently putting up at least 28 candidates:  http://www.classwarparty.org.uk/class-war-2015-5th-place-nominated-candidates/",0,1403473956,null,0,false,0,ciec3ck,t3_28sbun,t1_ciec3ck,t1_cie6te3,null,1434356294,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

to my:

&gt; Besides, you are judging the merit of a protest purely by its turnout. In this case, I believe the message carries much greater weight.

which is in the context where I am assuming the message of the protest is that austerity measures are being implemented and this affects people negatively:

&gt; However, this doesn't change the fact that the organisation is trying to put across an important message about a very real issue concerning millions of people.

Maybe I should have been clear about what I meant by the ""message"" from the start.



I've typed ""define: disadvantage"" into google, here's the noun usage of the word:

&gt; Disadvantage - an unfavourable circumstance or condition that reduces the chances of success or effectiveness.

Maybe I have misused the phrase, sorry, English isn't my first language.  By ""at a disadvantage"" I mean ""into an unfavourable circumstance"". I think this formulation is not meaningless.


Googling “negative effects of austerity” gave:

http://www.womenlobby.org/publications/reports/article/the-price-of-austerity-the-impact?lang=en

http://epthinktank.eu/2013/12/13/social-dimension-of-austerity-measures-cases-of-four-eu-countries-in-receipt-of-financial-assistance/

There's also a lot of stuff on “distributional effects of austerity measures”, where people argue that risks of poverty, growth of inequality and unemployment increase.


The fact that a measure is related to politics/policy within a democracy, doesn't make it objective. You seem to think there can be an objective way to prioritise news. This is not the case when serious world issues are at play. How do you choose whether to report on an deadly disease outbreak or a military conflict? Based on the number of casualties? Based on the risk to the population? Regardless of how you make your selection process, you will miss important events and opinions. But you're using this idea of the “objective measure” to rationalize media bias.

&gt;

&gt;__Petrichor__ (/ˈpɛtrɨkɔər/) is the [scent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction) of [rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain) on dry [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil), or the scent of dust after rain. The word is constructed from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language), *petros*, meaning ‘stone’ + *[ichor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichor)*, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology. It is defined as ""the distinctive scent which accompanies the first rain after a long warm dry spell"". 

&gt;The term was coined in 1964 by two [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) researchers, Bear and Thomas, for an article in the journal *[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal\))*.   In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants) during dry periods, whereupon it is [absorbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(chemistry\)) by [clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay)-based [soils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) and [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology\)). During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, [geosmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosmin), a metabolic by-product of certain [Actinobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria), which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone) may also be present if there is lightning.  In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil retards seed germination and early plant growth.  This would indicate that the plants exude the oil in order to safeguard the seeds from germination under duress.

Trusting morality and people to mindful of the lessons of history is incredibly naive given the proximity of the two world wars so we'll have to leverage it through increased cooperations and binding treaties that intertwine our nations in a way that war becomes even less advantageous than it already was, oh wait this is what the EU was set up to do and don't you know it's been pretty successful. 

Lets put it this way can you imagine another war between the UK and Germany? Given that hundreds of thousands of citizens of Germany live here and vice versa that makes war a bad idea. Given that german companies own and operate some of our energy infrastructure, war not a good idea with that in mind. We trade with 26 other countries freely in our association that includes Germany they won't be happy about this war and much of our trade will stop. Add to this we would breaking many of our own laws to have a war with the germans and this is on top all the other usual terrible consequences of war which may well be terrible but in the past have not proved to be enough.

Maybe they should take the mask off and defend themself instead of smashing shit up. Oh no, they cant, because they're a protest tactic not an entity you can actually smear.

Not at all, Malcolm X and MLK are the perfect example of why revolutionaries and radicals have their place on the left, where **you** need to pull your head out your ass is you are conflating radical ideologies and their **eloquent and legal promotion** with **actual violence** and the advocacy of **strike first violence** which is what the black bloc are on the lookout for.

Malcolm X advocated violence as a form of self defence, not strike first. He advocated for separatism and a black nation, and never *actually* as far as i know tried to incite direct violence in protests. He just called MLK a buffoon for advocating nonviolence.

I think he may have been aware of the fact he'd probably be jailed, but he didnt call for violence at protests, unless it was in self defence, as opposed to MLK who said even when they billy club you, passively defend do not fight back.

And that mate, is how the civil rights movement eventually won. Nonviolence. Dont you fucking dare try to prise that one from the history books in my hands.

true,everyotherday,null,null,"Good choice on Bristol - its a great city!  I've lived in Bristol for a few years now so I think I could help with a couple of these questions.

1) Bristol feels very white to me having lived in Nottingham.  I am originally from the South West though and I would say that in comparison to my experience elsewhere in the South West, Bristol is tolerant and welcoming.  You could definitely do worse in the UK, although as other people have pointed out, its not as much of an issue to some people as the media like to make it out to be.

2) Bristol can be quite expensive, but as much as anywhere in the UK.  Go to a supermarket in Clifton vs one in St Werburgh's / Easton and you will notice a difference in price.  Its just about being smart with what you're eating and where you're buying from.

3)  I would highly recommend Redland / Cotham as somewhere to live - its where I live!!  5 minutes from Gloucester Road / Stokes Croft, less than 10 minutes to the City Centre and nice local shops for supplies in the evenings.  There are a couple of hidden parks in and around and its generally very chill, but not all out bohemian and feels safe to walk around.  I love it.

4) As above - the rent is reasonable here.  Bristol is one of the most expensive places to rent in the UK though.  Expect to pay at least £85-90 a week for somewhere half decent.  Rent for me is £350 a month including bills, but I think my landlord is charging well below the average for the area.

5)  Can't really comment on this, but I do know a couple of programmers   and it certainly seems like quite a few people work in IT in Bristol.  

6)  Tips and tricks - Bristol is a small City, with a big City feel if you want it.  It has lots of cool events and there are always things like small festivals or parties happening in the city confines (particular highlights are Love Saves the Day and St Pauls Carnival).  Its surrounded by countryside and there are tons of festivals around it, including of course Glastonbury.  It has very distinct districts, all of which have their merits; St Pauls / Stokes Croft area is quite bohemian and has a big Caribbean population - Clifton is very white and middle class, but is full of beautiful old houses and buildings. It has a strong [""Freecycle""](https://groups.freecycle.org/group/FreecycleBristol/description) scene; so for you, if you need furniture or whatever when you move over here, Freecycle is a good shout. So many good things about Bristol!

Outside of all this, Bristol is just a great place to live.  Final tip - go for breakfast at The Bristolian cafe.

You're alleging that US airbases in the UK allowed them to leverage us into invading Iraq with them? No. That happened because Blair wanted it to. The blame is Blair's and his personal relationship with Bush.

To counter: Syria. Obama had made clear his intentions with the red line speech. Cameron went and held a vote, lost it and duly refused all military involvement. People then questioned our relationship with the USA. The same bases you allege helped them get us into Iraq were still present in the UK for Syria.

&gt; I disagree that getting nuked to fuck would have been a good idea for Britain

If the Soviets were going to nuke us, its because we were in the Cold War on the same side as the USA, which again, was our own decision. We were practically against the Soviets before WWII (see the origins of Molotov-Ribbentrop or Operation Unthinkable - although a post-war plan - as two examples).

The invasion involved the US, UK, Australia, Poland and the Kurds. The US has plenty of allies in Europe alone that chose not to be a part of this.

Wow. I've seen some apologists but this... wow...

[Read some history yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants'_Revolt) - the peasants were forced into unpaid labour, and when the Black Death finally gave them power to demand reasonable conditions they were prevented from doing so by Royal Statute.

So they rose in arms but settled to negotiate and swear fealty to the King if it avoided bloodshed - when they met to negotiate (having already sworn their loyalty) the Aristocracy butchered the leaders and then rounded up the rest for summary trials in which they were not permitted to speak and subsequent hanging. Many ended up decorating London on spikes.

But sure that's not so bad - we should celebrate such a system and allow it's beneficiaries to continue to benefit.

It'd be like keeping the slavers of the great plantations in great comfort and full ownership of their plantations in the USA - to preserve the history of the nation of course - I mean the slaves weren't treated _that_ badly, we just hadn't progressed! Perhaps when you realise how absurd that is you will see how absurd our monarchy is.

true,shudders,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; the inconsistency of UKIP not caring about a foreign power having military bases on British soil, an entirely one-sided relationship, yet wanting to can the EU.

I'm all for criticising UKIP, but this isn't the inconsistency you make it to be. They aren't *that* isolationist (evidenced in their support of international trade). They don't want legislation being made for Britain in Brussels (or anywhere else). There is a clear and marked difference between that and US bases on British soil. Note also they don't oppose British bases in, for example, Germany.

&gt; They're now entirely operated by Raytheon. Britain has no independent nuclear arsenal.

Explain this, because the complexity of Trident means it makes no sense to me. Having no independent arsenal would mean a foreign power having complete control over our weapons, i.e. the ability to fire them. The British nuclear arsenal is launched from Astute. These are BAE made (obviously with components coming from a multitude of companies).

&gt; So no protests = evidence for support?

Indifference is often seen as passive complicity. This indifference is a lot easier to argue as support for the US alliance than it is to argue as opposition to the US alliance.

You are correct that no protests is not blanket evidence of support, but it is much closer to support than it is opposition.",0,1403478389,null,0,false,0,ciedwvc,t3_28s5n8,t1_ciedwvc,t1_ciedcql,null,1434357217,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anonymous is a good example of how becoming too aggressive will destroy a movement.

Im neither for or against it, its an institution that although lacking much purpose today, is a net profit to the country, theres absolutely no reason to remove it.

Its why we are a sophisticated species, communes would **suck** at that, and i consider anarchism a backup plan for if our society collapses, but not how countries are run.

Read the news and you'll find your answer.

I'm 23 as well, I'm atheist but I come from a catholic background, 90% of my friends are protestant and I'd say 99% are unionists.

Personally, I support reunification. It's nothing personal or to get at 'themmuns', because narrow-minded sectarianism is insanely stupid. I mainly support it due to Britains militaristic outlook on world issues and I don't want a single penny of my taxpayer money going toward bullets that will inevitably kill some innocent civilians in a country I'll probably not visit (every war has its collateral).

Furthermore, I'm quite left-wing, I class myself as a socialist - I am incompatible with Westminster, whom are constantly railing on the poor. I want to distance myself from such a government as much as I can.

Personally, I don't feel divided from anyone in Northern Ireland, besides the uber loyal loyalists that will dismiss me (due to my Irish name). My reasons for being political are beyond 'themmuns/ussuns'. I want a fairer society - in our current hate-crime-ridden country, theres more than enough reason to be political, and although most of them here may be down to our history, mine are due to ethics, morality, and pushing for a leftist way forward.",0,1403480204,null,0,false,0,cieen9m,t3_28t3y4,t1_cieen9m,t1_ciec8h4,null,1434357564,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

I would call some liberal democrats centre right (classical liberals) and some are around the centre or at most marginally to the left of it (social democrats).  But none are left wing.

&gt;i believe capitalism should be restrained by some socialism inspired policies that put all individuals social security above all individuals rights to accrue unchecked amounts of wealth, companies too. 

For me, anyone who believes in capitalism is right wing, albeit social democrats who believe in a strongly mixed capitalist economy are probably more centrist than right.

&gt;You call communism/socialism the left, the left wing is whats not right wing, stop trying to own the left like property if you dont believe in it ;)

Heh, fair enough.  But historically, the left has always been about ending _all_ hierarchies.  Right back to the French revolution where the terms were coined.  Being a bit progressive on identity politics but getting skittish on economic democracy, and supporting a mixed Keynesian or social democratic form of capitalism, doesn't make you left, it makes you liberal.

&gt;I also believe in hierarchical organisation in society and a monarchy acts as a totem for society to reinforce that idea which civilisation is built on. Its why we are a sophisticated species, communes would suck at that, and i consider anarchism a backup plan for if our society collapses, but not how countries are run.

The extremely central bits of town (B1 &amp; 2) are both super convenient and really fucking noisy, so make soundproofing a criteria when you're viewing flats.

The Jewelry Quarter (North City Centre) is nice, somewhat pricey and tends to be quieter, particularly on weekends. Digbeth (South City Centre) has some nice bits, but the gentrification process is incomplete so rent tends to be cheaper here. If you want a collective makerspace in an old factory, you're laughing. If you want prosaic things like cashpoints and supermarkets, they're a bit thinner on the ground. Digbeth edges into Highgate which isn't worth looking at.

You can rule out pretty much everything immediately outside the ringroad, with the exception of a small corridor to the south running along the Bristol and Pershore Roads. All the other almost-city-centre areas like Aston, Nechells, Winson Green, Bordesley, Balsall Heath, etc are economically depressed and visually depressing. The aforementioned corridor runs through Edgbaston (posh) and Selly Park (studenty).

Okay, moving further out to places that are livable and have a bit more character. To the south we have Moseley (baby yoga classes and a private park to keep out the riff-raff), Kings Heath (over-stuffed bookshelves and wooden ornaments from Shared Earth), Stirchley (""happenings"" and community protests against building a Tesco), Bourneville (old people,  Cadbury's employees and people who like to be near the Moseley scene but aren't prepared to commit to it full-time). Any further south along that axis and you get to the white working class areas with multi-generational unemployment after the closure of the Longbridge plant. Even further south and you're in the Lickey Hills which are nice to visit, but not to live in unless you've retired.

To the south west there's Selly Oak (students, dear god so many students), Harborne (Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer) and Quinton (the Milton Keynes of Birmingham).

To the west there's Bearwood (poor man's Kings Heath), Smethwick (the shit end of Bearwood) and further west some extremely strong Black Country accents in areas that are mostly white working class until you get to Stourbridge where you're far enough out that it starts getting posh again. 

The north west isn't even Birmingham, really. The Black Country starts almost as soon as you leave the city in this direction.

To the north, once you get out of Aston and Lozells, you hit Handsworth and Handsworth Wood which have a large black population and therefore a lot of great takeaways if you like Carribbean food. There's some really nice and some really rough areas here cheek by jowl. If you're renting in Handsworth don't just visit the property. Take a good old stroll around all the neighbouring streets and make sure you're happy with the vibe. Further north there's Perry Barr (students and greyhound racing) and then Great Barr &amp; Kingstanding (BNP voters, avoid!)

To the north east, you've got Erdington (students, lecturers and people who couldn't afford Moseley) and then further north you start getting into Sutton Coldfield and Four Oaks (giant park, posh people).

To the east you've got some rough Asian areas (Small Heath, Bordesley Green, Alum Rock) which give way to some rough White areas (Stetchford, Kitts Green, Chelmsley Wood). Then the M42 which acts as a physical boundary between Chelmsley Wood and the countryside.

To the south east you've got some affordable, but nicer Asian areas (Sparkhill, Sparkbrook) and some affordable but nicer White areas (Hall Green, Olton) until you get to Solihull (which is posh and likes to pretend that Chelmsley Wood doesn't actually fall within its borders, although it technically does.)

I dont get it, are you saying they are centre? Because theyre not right wing...

I looked it up, you're right, but i see systems too big to change rapidly and fusion and evolution is the way to the left-wings ""revolution"". I want social equality, but i believe revolution is the quickest way to ruin what equality we have, to the bad anarchy, not your good anarchy, i.e. revolution creates the vacuum of security (look at how the arab spring turned out), the security upon which all civilisation is built. Its why a strong military is the basis of that security, followed by the police, without them we dont have the security to *sophisticate* as a society. 

&gt; If you believe hierarchy is superior you are most definitely right wing. Embrace it.

Nope - and I wasn't thinking of social democrats, but classical (free market) liberals.

&gt;I dont get it, are you saying they are centre? Because theyre not right wing...

Pretty much.  Left wing refers to opposition to hierarchy.  Today, most are socialists, some are anarchists.

&gt;I want social equality, but i believe revolution is the quickest way to ruin what equality we have, to the bad anarchy, not your good anarchy, i.e. revolution creates the vacuum of security (look at how the arab spring turned out), the security upon which all civilisation is built.

I hear you, and I'm not entirely unsympathetic.  Revolution is incredibly dangerous, and reform is an obvious alternative.  But, also, reform has been tried before - indeed, tried endlessly, and it has always been undone by the vested interests in society.  Revolution is about making real change and putting it beyond reaction.  Then there's the 'choice' between violent and non-violent revolution (would that it were a choice).  I'm certainly much more oriented towards creative direct actions, and creative destruction, rather than pure nihilistic destruction; and I certainly subscribe to building a new society within the shell of the old - if we could develop a new technology which would end exploitation by simply releasing it to the masses for free, I'd say go for it.  But I suspect, like many of my ilk, that, in the final analysis, the privileged will not give up their privilege without violence.

As for the police, like most of the left, I view them in large part as the footsoldiers of reaction.  Working class as individuals, but working for the privileged as a group.",0,1403482760,null,0,false,0,ciefs4w,t3_28sbun,t1_ciefs4w,t1_ciefdz1,null,1434358102,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also the Crypt under St Pauls is very cool. Admiral Nelson is buried there with a massive marble sarcophagus and so is Duke Wellington who won the Battle of Waterloo.

Temple Church as well is well hidden. Turn right off Fleet Street through big black doors. The Da Vinci code was filmed there if you've seen that and William the Marshal is buried there. There was a brilliant documentary by Thomas Asbridge that was recently on the BBC about him. 

I personally loved walking down a road called [Shad Thames](http://www.thedateguy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/shad_thames_buildings_nw010909_1.jpg) on the south side of Tower Bridge. It's one of the only remaining examples of Victorian dockyard and warehouses. The buildings on either side are 4/5 story warehouses converted into flats and there are still rickety iron walkways between the upper levels of the warehouses that the workers used to transfer goods from the ships to the warehouses further inland. There's a Pizza Express there too so you can have lunch. 

Other than that I could suggest more specific things depending on what your interested in. There are more galleries and museums than you can possibly visit so if you like that sort of stuff then it will pay to be specific. Also, presumably it will be sunny this next week so make sure to visit the parks while you can. St James' and Hyde Park will be really nice.

All the sites given are commercial and profit earning sites however, they are using the sub to attract customers and forcing their readers to only read what they want them to read.

As of abuses.. q_pop is probably hiding the fact that on his sub where he is paid to work as a troll, the user who first started to abuse me when I countered his arguments himself accepted it that he started it. However, great q_pop is so honest individual that he almost forgot to mention who was abused and changed the whole thing so that i stop exposing their commercial activities.

They are situated at the end of the main street, closest to the housing estates, and at the entrance to a shopping centre. You can't miss then. Then you have a cash for gold, a gold exhange, and two short term high interest loan companies, and most of the shops are discount shops. Its like they are saying to people: take a loan out or sell your possessions, have a gamble, and use the winnings in the shops and on a pint. For people with very little money, its a huge temptation when betting shops within so close proximity are competitively advertising ""attractive odds"" and the chance to double or triple what little money you have.

Look at how its presented on the adverts. Its either a group of mates enjoying a day out, or a bunch of professionals in business suits. It completely mistepresents the reality of gambling, and competely neglects the risks involved. The adverts are are selling a lifestyle that people often lack access to, and presenting gambling as a means to achieve that lifestyle.

Second, this video is a bit dated and some significant events have occurred since Thatcher was Prime Minister. As a person who makes their home outside of my birthplace, I completely understand the concept of identity and holding onto traditions or familiar cultural aspect. I live in a non-English speaking country. I have met a handful of ""Northern Irish"" out here, who have identified themselves as such. Some have initially said Irish, but thats just because it is a more familiar country (eg: from travelers/tourists) and having to explain Northern Ireland in a different language multiple times can be exhausting. Obviously, with the distinct accent, anyone that is familiar will know they are from the north and when asked, the person will say Northern Irish -there is never a denial- or never a correction of either British or Irish.

In my experience, it is unfortunate that some of them will try to distance themselves (Km) from Northern Ireland because of the negative publicity and bad reputation, especially of late, originating from the news. Of course, it is a static picture of a dynamic atmosphere, but (un)fortunately, it is publicized worldwide via BBC (and or course, Reddit).

true,Kyoraki,null,null,"Come to Brighton. Why you don't already live here, I don't know.

Pros:
It's still a small city, surrounded by the countryside of the South downs with Ashdown Forest not too far away. Oh, and there's also that beachfront that goes on for miles and miles, though that needs no introduction. Culture and art? I'd argue that we're the best in the country. It's Brighton, ffs. More than enough events and festivals of every shape and size to keep you busy on every day of the week, and because of our rather unique laines, we're very high on small and genuinely interesting independent shops in the city centre. It's worth it for 'Snoopers Paradise' alone, the king of junk shops. We're also home to both world class music venues and clubs, so you won't be short changed on music whatever your taste is.

It's also (getting back to the 'why don't you live here already' thing) a massive hub for web designers and graphics artists like yourselves. Check out Wired Sussex, or pop down to one of the many different weekly networking meetups that happen all over the city.

Cons:
Now this is the big catch. Brighton is lovely, but Sussex is an expensive county to live in. 2k a month should be enough to live on, but you wouldn't be living in luxury. But, finding creative work down here is like shooting fish in a barrel, and soon you'll find yourself drowning in clients. If you can handle the workload, you'll thrive down here.

And though public transport in the city is good, once you're out of the greenzone you're pretty much doomed without a car. It's a green city stuck in the tory heartland, and the city will become your prison if you don't drive. Buses outside the city are non-existent, and train fares around here will make you faint.

I should also mention that yes, we seem to be home to the majority of Britain's homeless population, especially youngsters. And yes, it does make walking through the city centre both uncomfortable and depressing. Hopefully all these new shelters will help fix the problem, though I fear it'll probably attract more.

&gt;___Birthright___ is a novel by [Nigel Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Robinson) from the [Virgin New Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures). The New Adventures were a spin-off from the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. Although part of the main run of New Adventures featuring the [Seventh Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor), the Doctor only appears in the beginning and end of the novel; most of the story involves his companions [Bernice Summerfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Summerfield) and [Ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(Doctor_Who\)). The events in this book occur simultaneously (from the point of view of the characters) to those in the New Adventure *[Iceberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_(Doctor_Who\))*, which was written by former *Doctor Who* actor [David Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Banks_(actor\)). A prelude to this novel was published in *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)* #203, penned by the author.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; a lack of public awareness of the benefits they are entitled to because of the complexity, no way to know before processing what you are entitled to

I agree with your other points, but I have to mention something here. The system is unavoidably complex because it's trying to cater for everybodies circumstances, and some people have complex circumstances. This is where some people effectively get short changed because their circumstances aren't considered in calcuating the amount they are entitled to receive.

It sometimes goes the other way too. When I claimed last year, they wouldn't let me make a single JSA claim because I lived with my girlfriend, and thus they had to look at our combined income (This is to prevent a couple having one person working full time whilst the other is claiming for JSA, which is perfectly reasonable). Our combined income was 0, because my girlfriend was studying for a masters degree, not receiving loans/bursaries and not eligible for JSA due to being unavailable for work. 

Yet because of the aforementioned rule which was designed to close a loophole, we could not claim for anything less than a couples claim, which is double the amount of a single. I asked them to 'downgrade' it but they couldn't, so I had this clarified in writing and it went through 3 separate decision makers to confirm it. Our circumstances were just not anticipated within the system and it was a choice between this or not claiming at all.

Simplifying the system in the way they want to will create more problems than it solves. You will have lots of people overclaiming and lots of people underclaiming because it will effectively be one size fits all. It might save the government a little money but it's going to hit some people hard if they have unusual circumstances.",0,1403491722,null,0,false,0,ciejdbp,t3_28tp1y,t1_ciejdbp,t1_cieho9g,null,1434359790,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; This article has discussed how money is created in the modern economy. Most of the money in circulation is created, not by the printing presses of the Bank of England, but by the commercial banks themselves: banks create money whenever they lend to someone in the economy or buy an asset from consumers. And in contrast to descriptions found in some textbooks, the Bank of England does not directly control the quantity of either base or broad money. The Bank of England is nevertheless still able to influence the amount of money in the economy. It does so in normal times by setting monetary policy — through the interest rate that it pays on reserves held by commercial banks with the Bank of England. More recently, though, with Bank Rate constrained by the effective lower bound, the Bank of England’s asset purchase programme has sought to raise the quantity of broad money in circulation. This in turn affects the prices and quantities of a range of assets in the economy, including money.

This proves most money is created by private banks and other quotes I have shown you shows it to be 97%, QE was just because interest rates were at 0.5%, unprecedented.

Reading about the issue of private banks creating the 97% of new money in the [New Economics Foundation] (http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/sovereign-money-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters) .

supply is created by banks, through debt, rather than being created debt-free by the government.

Is it that Courtois' agent has said that he isn't interested in sitting on the bench?

It's not like Mourinho pulled Cech's shoulder out of its socket, and told him that the club was going to offload him to Graffin Vlašim in the Czech Second Division.

Cech is a professional athlete and a goalkeeper. I think he has pretty thick skin to deal with rumours and idle speculation about his role at the club. Stop treating athletes like delicate sensitive little flowers.

you are lucky to be brought up in a society where women have the vote and can divorce a husband if he beats her and doesnt get blamed for rape.
The trojan horse scare in Birmingham schools is showing what a threat islam is it hasnt evolved at all like the other religions. 
no doubt I will get slated for an anti trendy view but I personally dont want to live in a society where men are the leaders and women and lgbt are treated like second class citizens.

I live in tower hamlets and I see how a certain culture refuses to integrate with muslim only swimming sessions here and vote rigging and corruption in the council by the muslim community 
its disgusting that this should be happening in a western society
this is what happens when you get muslims en masse 
there is no moderate islam even though the good law abiding muslims dont do any harm deep down they have no desire to integrate and agree with the korans views on women and gays 
until they evolve and accept other religions and sexual equality they will always be incompatible with western culture

**Best**

1. Fabian Johnson - I thought he was extremely good coming forward and he did a good job in defense as well. Caused Portugal a lot of problems on the right hand side. Man of the match for me.
2. US defense played pretty well I thought. Johnson was solid on the right, Beasley had a much better game this time on the left and thought the two center-halves played well despite Cameron's error for the first goal and the second goal which probably should have been cleared away.
3. Klinsmann was fantastic. Got his tactics right and made some brilliant substitutions, particularly putting a young fullback, Yedlin, in and using him as an attacking player. Caused Portugal problems as soon as he was in.
4. Adding one more as I forgot about him until I posted. William Carvalho was very good when he came in as a substitute. He was the only Portuguese player who I thought could hurt the US other than Ronaldo.

**Worst**

1. Portugal - Honestly I thought Portugal were very poor in general. They were gifted a goal in the first half and had a moment where they came close to scoring again but that was it until Ronaldo put it on a plate for Varela right at the end.
2. USA's inability to close the game off. Bradley lost the ball in a terrible position and they got the ball to the only Portugal player who could hurt them.
3. Have to mention Nani just because I can't stand him. He scored a goal that was gifted to him but other than that he was anonymous all game, besides the complete dive he took looking for a penalty. Didn't surprise me but it would have been nice to see him get booked for it.

I think for that reason he gives Poch a different option in the middle of the park, and is worth keeping around.  Plus, loan spells may give a guy playing time, but not in his own team, learning the manager's tactics, formations and working with the chemistry of fellow clubmates.

I abhor the term Native American. It is a generic government term used to describe all the indigenous prisoners of the United States. These are the American Samoans, the Micronesians, the Aleuts, the original Hawaiians, and the erroneously termed Eskimos, who are actually Upiks and Inupiats. And, of course, the American Indian.

I prefer the term American Indian because I know its origins . . . As an added distinction the American Indian is the only ethnic group in the United States with the American before our ethnicity . . . We were enslaved as American Indians, we were colonized as American Indians, and we will gain our freedom as American Indians, and then we will call ourselves any damn thing we choose.""

true,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"When Microsoft brought out Windows 8 last year, the tech world leapt on one feature above all others - the fact that, after 20 years, Microsoft had done away with the Start Button.

Much concern was shown over how long it would take for users to get used to the new interface, which amounted to not much more than a pretty-looking unnecessary extra barrier between you and what you wanted to do, while plugging all the stuff Microsoft particularly wanted you to look at.

This is pretty much what Universal Credit is. They're not amalgamating the dozens of agencies which currently calculate all the currently individually administered benefits one could claim dependent on circumstances, they're just trying to work an IT solution so that it all *looks like* it's all coming from one place and administered centrally, in some kind of coherent, integrated way.

There won't be one monolithic Universal Credit agency, there will still be an ESA department, and a JSA department and HMRC and Council Tax office and Housing Benefit office, etc, etc, but they willall have to use the same UC paperwork and the same UC IT system...and it's the attempt to integrate all these agencies which must, by nature retain their own application and administration procedures, which is proving the nightmare and which they really should have known was an impossible task.

Holtby's the only other CM who can do fine as a good passer. Dembele tends to slow down the pace of the game, and Paulinho is someone I haven't been impressed by at all. His WC form is giving me a massive headache. 

Keeping him here would benefit us, IMO. If Poch is given a few years like I hope he is, Bentaleb has to learn his system rather than 'Arry's or maybe McClaren's. (I don't keep up with the Championship too much, this is the only good name I know). Even if it means game time, having that training environment of double and sometimes triple training sessions might instill a great work ethic down the road, important given that he's 19. 

I think a better question is whether or not we should keep Carroll. I can't see him overtaking Paulinho, Bentaleb and Dembele for the moment, and it doesn't look like it's going to change. Even in QPR, Tommy didn't see too many regular minutes.

Weoley Castle is an interesting one. It's white working class with loads of council houses, bordered by areas entirely unlike it, which - combined with the lack of a train station and some overlong, needlessly circuitous bus routes - gives it a bit of an insular, Royston Vasey feel.

The other areas are all transitional ones. Places that get overlooked because they lie between other districts with more character. So Kings Norton and Northfield is the transition between affluent Bourneville and the council housing in The Three Estates/the areas fucked up by the Longbridge closure, Maypole is the transition between The Three Estates and the affluent countryside, while Cotteridge is the transition between Bourneville and Stirchley. Case in point, Cotteridge has a nice park (like Bourneville) which is only nice due to the cussedness of people who will unironically refer to themselves as ""community organisers"" (like Stirchley.)

Some other transitional places I missed off are Sheldon, Yardley and Acocks Green which transition the shit white areas in the east to the okay white areas in the south east, Yardley Wood which transitions nice Hall Green (south east) into The Three Estates (south) and then in the east there's Hay Mills and Tyseley which transitions the shit Asian areas into the shit white areas.

Even less would fess up to it, a tiny minority of those may withdraw from the scheme, and then an even tinier minority would ever choose to pay back the tax they avoided like he did.

What he did wasn't a mistake legally. IMO, we shouldn't be pissed at him, we should be pissed at the people who allow the laws and loopholes to remain which keep such schemes within the bounds of the law.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Yes this is definitely a big part of the problem.  Take my home county of norfolk for example.

In the early 90's there was one large PCT (primary care trust) that administered the whole of norfolk.  Then in the mid-late 90's they broke that up into 5 PCTS, to administer different parts of the county.  This entailed hiring lots more senior managers etc.  Then, again, in about 2006 they decided that they were going to merge all the PCTs back into one big centralised one again.  Then Landlsey rammed his reforms through a few years ago and frankly I don't know what the fuck is going on any more, and neither I think do any of the ministers in charge do either.  Other examples are the closing of local hospitals and move towards more centralised healthcare, and apparently the fact that they now might want to move back towards decetralised healthcare again.

And the whole thing is absolute madness!  Large scale organisational change of bodies like PCTS takes quite a few years to sort out, and for various changes and stuff required to percolate through the system.  I would be willing to be that in terms of health outcomes these organisational changes would probably take at least 5-10 years to be properly measurable.

This is a dialetical logger heads. Exactly the kind of thing common in philosophy (one reason I got out of it to move to computing) but should not be occurring in a proper science, which economics aspires to be. 

I'd only suggest you have just as much if not more skepticism towards fridge theories as mainstream ones. Again, I come back to the misquoting, as a student of economics, I presume at a reputable university, you have to realise how much of an academic sin that is. 

And important, there is never too small an academic sin that can be discounted in so noble a goal. I think that's a primary problem here. What does it matter if things are being 'slightly' misrepresented, they want to 'fix' the system right. A mistake plenty of intelligent well meaning people have made for thousands of years.

Economics is full of fringe theories that are badly in err of the scientific method and have a lot of axes to grind at the moment. 

Sorry, but the British pound does come into existence by the issuing of bonds. Monetary policy is dictated by the bank of England. To suggest otherwise based on the quirks of QE or based on a highly politicized fringe theory and a group that uses 'democracy' is a cure-all and nebulous fashion. Is something that arises a huge deal of skepticism in myself, and should be in you also.

It does worry me somewhat that pretty much every other ad on sports channels in particular is for some betting/gambling establishment. Should gambling be somehow illegal? no. Perhaps, however, there is scope to regulate it further, and prevent it being advertised on certain channels or at certain times, in a similar vein to tobacco restrictions.

The secret with gambling is *only ever bet money you can afford to lose*. If you get to a point where you are gambling your food money for the week to see if you can get more, then you have a problem, and the first thing I would do is urge you to seek help.

I don't think it's fair to describe people as stupid for trying to gives a simplified version of a message that has many complex nuances to it. Governments do the same when campaigning - you can't fit a full explanation of a socially responsible and fair economic model on a placard. 

Fact is, the people in charge are ideologically in favour of a model that has proven time and time again to leave people behind. Working across local authorities and the public/voluntary sectors, I see plenty of things that could be cut but also plenty of things that should have increased funding, to the benefit of all. It's cheaper to have someone in a hostel with a support worker than a prison with a guard, for example - but numbers are up in the latter and down in the former because of cuts to local authority budgets which they pass on to the homeless because the homeless don't vote. It took two decades of building up the homelessness infrastructure in the UK and it got rid of the cardboard box cities we had in the eighties under the last Tory government. That's fast being eroded and the people it will cost most is the people keenest on the cuts. Watching 20 years hard work pissed away into nothing with no rational economic reason for it is hardly the sort of thing I want to be told to 'learn to compromise' over. 

There's a (functional) deficit and an economic crisis aftermath, sure, and both need to be managed, but it's been the excuse a significant number of unpleasant rich people have used to enact their ideologies, which are not those of the electorate. That's why people protest. Too much, too far. 

What teaches people compromise is strong leadership and a good example. The rich people who run the country do not show the masses any of this at all. ",0,1403516617,null,0,false,0,cieq2zt,t3_28sbun,t1_cieq2zt,t1_ciep3kv,null,1434363018,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In my opinion, payday loans need to be made illegal, not just to advertise, but entirely. Or interest needs to be capped much, much lower. The repayment period needs to be significantly longer and early repayment not penalised.

Or as an alternative, banks could start actually fucking lending money to their customers again. Then payday loans would have no reason to exist. They exist solely because the needs of the public are not being met by the 'good guys', so in swoop the 'bad guys' with their easy loans that can lead a desperate person into a whole lot of bother. The irony of the situation is the people that need payday loans are exactly the people that should not have payday loans. I'm not looking down on anyone when I say that; I was one of those people too at one time.

I think heroin should be made freely available to those already addicted, via a pharmacist filling a doctor's prescription. It would improve the safety and quality of life for addicts and reduce crime. They would only be allowed to use in shooting galleries and all gear would be stored there. 

Tobacco is a tricky one. While extremely addictive and harmful, it has no beneficial effects for the user, other than a headrush, if that counts. People smoke because they are addicted, not because it's an enjoyable drug. Also, e-cigs offer a healthier alternative.

On balance, tobacco should be only available to current smokers, and they should have to agree to reduce their intake or join quitting programmes. Ban smoking outside of designated areas and homes.

&gt;

&gt;The __European Revolutions of 1848__, known in some countries as the __Spring of Nations__, __Springtime of the Peoples__  or the __Year of Revolution__, were a series of [political upheavals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_upheaval) throughout [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) in 1848. It remains the most widespread [revolutionary wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_wave) in [European history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_history), but within a year, [reactionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary) forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed.

&gt;The revolutionary wave began in [France in February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution_of_1848), and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries. Five factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants. 

&gt;The uprisings were led by shaky *ad hoc* coalitions of reformers, the middle classes and workers, which did not hold together for long. Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of [serfdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom) in Austria and Hungary, the end of [absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy) in Denmark, and the definitive end of the [Capetian monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capetian_dynasty) in France. The revolutions were most important in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, and the Austrian Empire, but did not reach Russia, Sweden, Great Britain, and most of southern Europe (Spain, Serbia,  Greece, Montenegro, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire).

You inevitably get new novel negative externalities (surroudning crime or quality of supply) emerge from the prohibition itself.

Criminalising use is a fucking stupid idea, that has never worked to solve any problems in a meaningful way. It simply changes them, over on a netsum for the worse.

So imagine a world in which heroin is freely avalible (i.e before, 1910 in most places - or morphine for an even more expansive sample). Where there negative externalities from relatively widespread use.

But to tell me with a straight face, well less people using it regularly is a netsum gain, ignoring that criminalising use and pushing it into the black market creates a huge range of significant new problems.

true,Lauranis,null,null,"That's fair, It did not address the comment directly, only to indicate that cigarettes are already have a heavy direct tax placed upon their sales.

To look at your comment more directly, the problem with such a policy is that it could all to easily be expanded to other areas of life or risky activities with the same logic:

""I want an additional tax to cover the drinking related costs to the NHS. Also adding more tax will make it less attractive to minors""

""I want an additional tax to cover the fat related costs to the NHS. Also adding more tax will make it less attractive to minors""

""I want an additional tax to cover the driving related costs to the NHS. Also adding more tax will make it less attractive to minors""

""I want an additional tax to cover pregnancy related costs to the NHS. Also adding more tax will make it less attractive to minors""

Naturally some of those comments above are absurd, particularly the pregnancy line, but no less justified by the same reasoning.

The NHS is defined by the idea of being flat rate, and being free at the point of consumption. As it is smokers pay by far more in direct tax than they cost the NHS, as well as their standard income taxation and national insurance:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8086142.stm

Indicates that in 2009 smokers costs the NHS  approximately £5 billion.

And here:

http://www.the-tma.org.uk/tma-publications-research/facts-figures/tax-revenue-from-tobacco/

We can see the tobacco industry paid about £10 billion for the same period.

So as you can see smokers put in by far more into the economy through tax than they cost it. If the tax they are already paying is not being spent on covering the costs of their habit (and then some, perhaps the other £5 billion could be spent on smoking cessation courses and lowering the costs of viable alternative products like vaporisers), then there is no reason to believe that a direct ""NHS tax"" would be spent wisely. Perhaps if the cost to the NHS is such a problem we should be lobbying the government to ensure that an appropriate portion of the tax revenue already applied is in fact being sent to the NHS to cover those costs, with appropriate checks and balances to ensure the funds are not siphoned off to pay for other risky and costly activities.

As far as taxation and minors are concerned in theory it should work, however it seems that some recent studies have identified a problem on that regard as well, tobacco companies are increasing the prices of premium brands to offset and absorb the costs of keeping budget brands cheap:
