What about Torres' winner against City? He was still running at defenders and pressing well in the 90th minute allowing us to capitalise on a mistake and snatch a winner, against arguably our main rivals for the title no less. If that's not hard working I don't know what is. I'm not saying he's good enough, none of our current strikers are, but at least he's putting in the effort which is all you can really ask for given the situation.

The important thing about Hive is that it has a tried and tested formula. Sunday through Thursday, its free entry. The drinks are ridiculously cheap, the music on the main dance floor tends to be chart music (with the exception of Tuesday, which is the ""Antics"" rock night) whilst the music on the smaller dance floor tends to be music that is a bit older or less mainstream.

Hive is a good night as in you don't expect too much so you can't possibly be too disappointed. Cheap and cheery, a right of passage for anybody who visits or lives in Edinburgh.

However, if you have the chance, I'll happily give Temple at Silk on a Thursday a good shout. Just off of Lothian Road, it has quite a rather good atmosphere, good EDM tunes on the second floor and a couple of drinks promotions that will get you wasted (the tequila was dangerously cheap last time I was there).

Whatever you choose to do, Edinburgh has plenty of options. By no means is it the cheapest city in the country to go out clubbing, but it has a lot to offer. A good pub crawl can't really go wrong, and if you turn up to a club that has a nice amount of people in it, you're bound to have a good time.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Amazon have recently started doing something similar.

They do something they call Collect+ in some small stores and have lockers in others.  The lockers are particularly neat, since they give you a code which opens the locker with your parcels.  However, there are limits on how large an item you can have delivered this way.

* Peace Process politics has expired – McCallister

* After the UUP’s rejection of the Haass proposals and the failure of the negotiating process, John McCallister MLA, deputy leader of NI21 has outlined his belief that the peace process style politics of protracted negotiation is finished and the time for reforming our political institutions is now.

* In a statement Mr McCallister said:

* “The fact that the UUP has gone from being 80-90% over the line to a complete rejection of the Haass proposals in a matter of days is staggering. It mocks both the public and Dr Haass. 

* “However, this is not just a failure of leadership by the UUP, it is a failure of all parties of the Executive and our political institutions. Peace process politics – the self-important politics of protracted negotiation over issues which affect a proportion of the population - has run out of steam and must end.

* “How much good will and political capital has been expended in this debacle. Friends of Northern Ireland in Washington and Brussels will find it increasingly difficult to garner support for economic conferences and peace initiatives. It is not just Northern Ireland’s public who are running out of patience with this Executive and the peace process.

* “1998 brought us peace, devolution and a significant increase in stability. However, it is startingly clear that our institutions of Government need to change significantly in order to allow politics and Northern Ireland to move forward.

* “On the back of the Haass failure, NI21 has a number of proposals which we believe would radically change politics in Northern Ireland for the better:

* Introducing an official Opposition at Stormont, while retaining a firm commitment to power sharing, would increase accountability and drive better Government.
Ensuring political parties agree a Programme for Government prior to entering into the Executive, would develop collective responsibility and Government by single mandate.
Renaming OFMDFM the Office of Joint First Ministers would remove one of the most divisive tenants of our elections; forcing the DUP and Sinn Fein to seek votes based on policies and not a sectarian headcount.
Electing the Speaker by a secret ballot, and elevating him or her to be the MLA for Stormont, would ensure that the Northern Ireland Assembly is empowered to stand up to the Executive.
Devolving more fiscal powers into a reforming Assembly would increase political accountability and allow Northern Ireland to better meet our particular economic and social needs in the future.

* “The issues of the Haass talks are important but they are now in a mess and many will be quite rightly wondering where we go from here. However, we cannot allow failure to reach agreement in these areas to completely stagnate politics. If this happens the ramifications could be profound for our society and economy.

* “The public must demand change and other political parties must recognise the current brand of politics is self-defeating.
It is now a case of reform or fester.""",0,1389416132,null,0,false,0,cemqeh3,t3_1uxdro,t1_cemqeh3,t1_cempghr,null,1431892908,9,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9

Amazon's customer service are infuriating too.  When your order is updated as, 'Delivery Attempted' they will absolutely insist a delivery was attempted.  Even though you're in and they apparently managed to not only knock near silently and forgot to put a card through the letterbox!

**However** if you paid for a delivery with a set date and it doesn't arrive on time, Amazon will refund you the postage or credit you a month of Amazon Prime if you're subscribed to it.  *(On a loosely related note, my experience is that it is so unreliable that Prime isn't good value for money.)*  You should claim this **every** time they screw up.  Not so much for the refund, because the only thing that will force their hand will be when it starts to hurt their bottom line.

As a final point, Yodel advertise for self-employed delivery drivers.  The ads state that you may not earn the equivalent of minimum wage.  I'm not an expert, but I doubt classifying them as self-employed is legally correct.

In much the same way that the Conservatives didn't really care about the right wing until UKIP started looking problematic.

You can see this in the way they've behaved over public sector pay and pensions.  They want to claim that the Conservative cuts are wrong and threaten the recovery, but as soon as the Conservatives announce a cut they scramble over themselves to confirm they wouldn't reverse it.  

This is one of the reasons they're all so keen to point out that UKIP are evil racists and at a push to claim they're a one policy party.  I'm not a fan of the UKIP position personally, but just writing them off as racists is lazy and frankly inadequate.

true,tealeg,newcr-5,,"Here's a good one, from way back when.. bear with me, there's a tale here.   In the 1890/91 season, Everton won the league for the first time.  At that point in time we played at Anfield (now home to the red shite).  The owner of the land saw our success as a cue to cash-in, and promptly upped the rent on us.  The board of Everton reacted by moving the club to Goodison Park, and building the first purpose built football stadium in England (The grand old lady..).   So how did the owner of Anfield react to this?  Like a twat.  He decided he'd start his own football team - what we now know as Liverpool FC (the red shite) - but here's where it get's interesting.  He didn't set out to create a rival team, oh no.. he tried to register his team as *EVERTON* and take our place in the league.  Only when the FA rejected the scheming fraudster's request did he eventually accept that'd he'd have to use the more boring, generic name of Liverpool, and start in a lower division. Unlike Everton, which grew naturally from the community of Everton, like a beautiful flower, Liverpool was constructed by buying in players from Scotland.  Everton's a club born of the passion of it's community - Liverpool's a club built on fraud and buying your way through life, you might think that's ancient history, but you can see it reflected in the ownership of the two clubs today (and in the attitude of the fans too).  Given the existence of such a juxtaposition - how can you choose to stand anywhere but on the bluest side of the banks of the royal blue Mersey?

So there you go.. Everton, a team so good that even our greatest rivals want to be us.  No matter how many trophies our pink-tinged neighbours buy themselves they'll never be Everton, or even be in our class, because whatever else remains, form is temporary, but class is permanent.

It still seems crazy to me, but omitting that from the BBC story is basically just encouraging idiots to start dribbling spite and stupidity.  *""Community raises cash for local project that you might think is a bit weird!""* is fundamentally different to the way that story reads, which to me at least suggested that the money probably came from the public purse.

They just don't tell you this because the gravy train is sooo lucrative if you simply acquiesce and accept their notices.

Furthermore, within those ""guidelines"" are the procedural steps they must take when trying to tow your vehicle away.  They must attach a notice to the car, give you half an hour to spot it and accept the notice by doing nothing, then attach their towing apparatus to it, ready to tow.

Should you then come out of your house and sit in the car, they are **not** allowed to tow and should then remove the towing vehicle apparatus and leave completely.  Whether they threaten to call the police is immaterial, as a constable should only attend so as to prevent a breach of the peace, not to interfere with a civil matter.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"No, it was very chaotic and disorganized imo.

The Time of the Doctor treats the answer to the Question as the key to letting the Time Lords through the crack. Besides the fact that Moffat probably never intended to bring them back when he was doing series 6, he already used the answer to the Question as the key to the Doctor's tomb in The Name of the Doctor. Sure the Question's answer could be the key to both things, but it shows he didn't plan it out.

Also, with the quick line in The Time of the Doctor about Kovarian's chapter of the Silence being a rogue branch, it's clear he did not know what the Silence really was up until The Time of the Doctor. He says Kovarian's branch is rogue in TTotD but in A Good Man Goes to War there's a line where a soldier says that, given permission by the papal mainframe herself, they (the soldiers) are allowed to lift the hood of a Headless Monk just that one time. This implies that the Kovarian chapter of the Silence was working with the papal mainframe (Tasha Lem, as we now know her).

Steven Moffat, like all showrunners, just makes stuff up as he goes along. Unfortunately, it's easy to tell when he's not planned something because he backs himself up into a corner with many scenarios or introduces a necessary element to a story very soon before it's needed (i.e. Amy's childhood friend Mels never existed until the episode she actually became relevant: Let's Kill Hitler).",0,1389427476,null,0,false,0,cemtjqz,t3_1uuxvr,t1_cemtjqz,t3_1uuxvr,null,1431894677,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If you're going to get a bike and want one on a budget, gumtree is a good place (gumtree is our craigslist) and there is also the edinburgh bike cooperative. If you're going for a new one, halfords at straiton is probably the easiest place to go, but i'm not a bike expert.

Talks in a snarky, cat-like accent, that's actually more of an American accent than an English one. But it does have slight British undertones.
Personality: Kinda snarky, geeky, can act like an action hero sometimes, but prefers act from her computer. Kinda friendly, childlike, and hyperactive. Likes to fangirl over anime characters and stuff. At times, she acts like a cat. 
Companions: Initially, i just have Clara left over from 12's, plus Handles the Cyberman Head and Tom the Coal Hill teacher. After we lose Handles in one of our adventures and they get picked-up by a few reformed Cybermen, we get a feline version of K-9, named F-L1N. i then welcome Paternostrus' Jenny, Vastra, and Strax for a bit in the TARDIS. Then, i get a few visits from River Song, Daughter!Jenny, TenToo &amp; family (Rose and two kids named Gallifrey and Debenhams. They took up organic cattle farming.) and Susan Foreman. After a trip to Gallifrey, i get matched-up with a Time Lord named Chorolandrewir, or ""Choro"" for short- he regenerated to look like a 12-year-old. Both Choro and Clara leave together, because Choro wants to study at Coal Hill, just like Susan did. He will go by Chorley Oswald, and act as Clara s' nephew ""from... uh Los Angeles. Yeah, this is why you never heard of him before. He decided to move in with me after his parent died. Eaten by... a rabid zoo lion. Yeah."" Then, Clara returns again, stoweaways Ianbrel Chesterton-Wright (Ian and Barbara s' son) and his cousin Boleyn Jackson-Wright (Ben and Polly s' daughter) join the TARDIS team. Then, both Clara and Tom move out together, and my final TARDIS team is: Ianbrel, Boleyn, F-L1N, and a mysterious pseudo-ghost named Leibrette, who joined in my last episode. I also sometimes go visit Sarah Jane, who was visited in death bed by the Trickster, and now she can pseudo-regenerate too.",0,1389434446,null,0,false,0,cemurf9,t3_1uud6e,t1_cemurf9,t3_1uud6e,null,1431895345,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Can't say I was sad to see Wells go to Town, it would have been nice to grab him, but he's stepping up to the Championship and another young player. We really have to balance experience in the squad and we'd have way too many young uns with him in our side. Barnes I completely agree with. We can do better.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;The same applies to the coalition. The Lib Dems are a very, very small minority here. They don't actually hold much influence on the Tories simply because they're only required to keep a stable government.

&gt;When you get in to areas such as Tuition fee's, the lib dems hold that little voting power on the matter that the Tories would never let them control it. It's not like if the Lib Dems said no it wouldn't have gone through.

I don't think you understand the situation, the Tories don't have a majority in the house of commons so they need the Lib Dems to support them on anything they want to do to get enough votes to have it pass. Saying they are a small party so how they vote wouldn't have made a difference is utterly wrong. They have the power to block anything the Tories want to do, including raising tuition fees (unless Labour teams up with the Tories, which is very unlikely and didn't happen for Tuition Fees)

&gt;Further to that, had they said no, what do you think the political scene would look like now? Do you honestly think the good Lib Dems have done, and the concessions the Tories made to them, would have happened had they refused to go ahead with the rise in tuition fees?

Again, your misunderstand. The Tories would have had to make concessions either way, if they didn't have a coalition agreement with the Lib Dems they would have had to agree each issue individually or they wouldn't have got anything passed. The only difference would have been that anything positive the Lib Dems have done wouldn't have been passed, but there's only a few minor positive things they've done and it doesn't balance out all the harm they've done by supporting the Tories.",0,1389436781,null,0,1389438206,0,cemv3dm,t3_1uvv8w,t1_cemv3dm,t1_cemd7a7,null,1435533154,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The bedroom tax really is a silly idea, it's probably saved peanuts financially and it's caused a lot of issues for the poorest in society.

[Freeview](http://www.freeview.co.uk/whats-on/channels), which is a digital TV service available almost nationwide. All new televisions sold in the UK include a tuner capable of receiving these channels. All you need is an aerial on the roof of your house.

[Sky](http://www.sky.com/products/tv-packs/), which is the largest satellite television provider. Also available nationwide. As in the USA, you can subscribe to different 'bundles' of TV channels, eg sports, documentaries, music etc. They have rights for a lot of popular sports in the UK such as most Premier League football and Formula 1 motor racing.

[Freesat](http://www.freesat.co.uk/channels), an alternative satellite tv provider to Sky, but only carries television channels which do not require a subscription. It's similar to Freeview in that respect.

[Virgin Media](http://store.virginmedia.com/digital-tv/compare-tv/index.html), which is the only Cable television and internet provider in the UK. They only offer [coverage](http://www.samknows.com/maps/llu/25) in the larger towns, cities and metropolitan areas of the UK, and have no plans to expand their cable network. Again, like Sky you can choose to subscribe to different channels and they also carry some of Sky's sports channels.

As a nation we have a finite amount of jobs. If immigrants are filling these jobs non immigrants (logically) are not. If immigrants are needed to fill jobs/fill skilled jobs the bigger more important question is why non immigrants cannot do the work?

Presumably if they where doing the work, the tax point would be moot.

true,IndividualNo6,null,null,"What city?

Apart from a few East Coast cities Edinburgh is FAR more walk-able than anywhere in the US, I mean I'd consider Philly a fairly walk-able city by US standards and Edinburgh absolutely trounces it. You can walk from one side to the other in a under an hour (I'm talking the city here not the burbs before people start calling bullshit). 

It's hard to say without knowing your city but my experience is most american towns and cities were built with the car in mind, most British ones were not. LA might be the best example, they built the city assuming everyone would have a car, so everything is spaced out for parking space so by default it's really difficult to walk anywhere cause everything os so god damn far apart. Houston is even worse!

Edinburgh on the other hand LOOOONG predates the car and reflects that. As I say, I don't drive but my friends from outside Edinburgh always complain how hard/expensive it is to find parking in edinburgh and how much of a nightmare it is to drive in (lots of weird one way streets and perpetual road works).  

YMMV but I think I know 2 people who live in Edinburgh and have a car, one of whom needs it for work.

My experience is public transport is more accessible and you're less likely to encounter human fecal mater in on the floor up the back or just general crazy people making you feel unsafe. It's also a fairly comprehensive system and when coupled with the aforementioned walk-ability it makes the whole city accessible without a car.

With regards to groceries, most places you'd end up living would probably have a Tesco/Sainsburys/Scotmid local within an easy walk. Whilst they might not have the range you'd like, they'll have a everything you need including FRESH fruit, veg and meat, they're small supermarkets not 7-11s or gehto liquor stores. 

The great outdoors? Well, I hate to say it, but there's not all that much of that here. Not if your coming from Vermont or Colorado. But what there is, again, is mostly accessible with public transport. You can take a train from Edinburgh and be in Dunkeld or Pitlochrie in ~1hour or you can bus to the slightly less majestic Pentlands in 20 minutes. I'm not sure exactly the nature of you're job at the Roslin institute but if it means you can join Uni Societies then there's even a hill walking club which puts on regular excursions. 

In short, having a car would defiantly be nice and if you can afford it go for it. But if money is an issue I honestly think you're quality of life would be higher if you spent the money you would spend on a car on living in a better location that means you don't need one.

Take my company for instance, when interviewing for a un-skilled post last time (cleaner!) I found I had someone in their 30s asking for £11 an hour, they had a very poor CV.  I had a Lithuanian with a good CV asking for £9.50.  Now I believe that if we had different working practices, we would have a bunch of sole traders working for less than minimum wage.  Someone once had the audacity to tell me I'd fucked up by not doing that.

Now of course cheaper labour means cheaper products, cost of consuming products drops, but the transition isn't kind for those effected by it.  Even less pleasant for those effected when you consider that a lot of essential products and services these labour costs don't really effect.

As a result I get kind of pissed off, when the degree holding / non-minimum living wage earning types tell others they are being racist by complaining about the competition and squeeze they will face.

true,pharao007,null,null,"First of all, there is a problem with interpretation of the word ""immigrant"", where plenty of politicians and media either pick up certain immigrants to fit their current agenda or mix them later on just to ""prove"" what they argue about.

* Outside EU immigration from poor countries - people most desperate to move into UK, whatever the cost. Illegal immigrants will even work for nearly nothing (forget about NMW). Even legal ones can (for example student visa allows part time work, where students actually work F/T, so illegally, thus possibly under NMW). That group normally doesn't even think of going back to their countries as most of them don't have there any prospects of normal living (no point in writing those here as probably all of you have an idea), especially after looking at normal life in UK.
* Outside EU immigration from first world countries - obviously less desperate than above and they very often have somewhere to go back (meaning they aren't forced to live here). Probably more than a half of them comes here with a decent skill, required for UK. Some may still be working under NMW, at least for some time or work illegally (student visa restrictions, visiting visa etc). That group surely has an impact on NMW but much lower than previous group.
* Inner EU from ""western and central"" (richer) countries - probably the lowest risk group. They have mostly where to go back and can do it easily (plane ticket or couple of hours driving and you're home). They have full working rights, so they certainly tend not to work below NMW as they can legally sue an employer and have nothing to lose (nobody will send them back to their countries, they will just find a new job here). On plenty of occasions their countries pay nearly the same wages for the same done jobs and offer very similar level of social help, medical and education. I would even say the risk of lowering wages from their part is nearly at the same level as any British person who lost a job and will work for less just to have one.
* Inner EU from ""eastern Europe"" - higher risk from the group above as wages in most of those countries are lower than in western. However, in most of them very similar general level exists, meaning they have decent schooling and health system and if they earn good they can make even nicer living than in UK (as costs there are lower). That group tends to have some influence on wages but not really that much as they also know they have full working rights. As probably all of them moved overseas to make a better living and most of them try to work hard, meaning they have good ambitions, they try to go up the ladder and earn the same as British people do in certain sectors or change jobs for better ones. It does take time though.

Also, important perspective with numbers. Let's say 1mln immigrants from Eastern Europe now living in UK. That is 1/62 so about 1.5% of total UK population. Now, I'm not an economist nor good mathematician but can anybody tell me how 1.5% of total UK population can have a SERIOUS impact on wages? Even if you take into account children and pensioners, how much in percentage the total number would be? 3%? 4%? I really don't see how they could lower wages so much as to have a national discussion about it.

Western Europe numbers are probably even lower than from Eastern Europe. Outside EU is definitely higher (together with already living people and arriving) but I will not be looking into it as I made my main points.",0,1389439966,null,0,false,0,cemvidc,t3_1uy93o,t1_cemvidc,t3_1uy93o,null,1431895606,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Anyone in the know has already said top talent available at reasonable prices in January are needles in the haystack but sometimes needs must. Champion's league is a platform we must reach. I feel Tottenham will only get better and Man U will invest, we *must* beat them to European football if we want to see realistic and sustained title challenges without relying on punching above our weight. 

I want to stress that I do not want us to compromise our summer budget with overspending now but a lengthy period without Suarez or Lucas could only result in points dropped. I'm not knocking Sturridge, he is a brilliant forward, but if Suarez scored a goal or two against a World 11 back line would you be surprised? We obviously can't buy another player of his quality but another up and coming attacker is a must unless Aspas and Moses kick on massively. I love Lucas but he has no back-up, none what so ever, and Allen, Gerrard, Henderson and anyone else we could field as a destroyer cannot accomplish what he does game in game out, not out of a lack or ability but out of a difference in playing style.

For instance Canada has 30 million people and the USA has closer to 300 million people, where as Canada has unemployment of 7.2% and the USA 6.7%.

Maybe one more person in a country who goes to the local ASDA won't provide that ASDA with enough business to hire a new employee. However, that additional member of the population wont just shop at ASDA. They'll pay for gas, TV, internet, getting a car, getting their car cleaned, going out to nice dinners, buying furniture and so on. Non of those actions are enough by themselves for each company to hire a new person. But imagine that 100 new people come who all shop at these new places. The ASDA, the gas company, the TV company, the furniture company, the car washing company now all have enough new person to hire one new person each, which averages out to one person per immigrant.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, this is based on my own experiences so I'm really sorry if it's anecdotal but in my experience is most people who identify as feminist have a very skewed idea of equality. They ARE differences in how men and women are treated. Legally, culturally, and economically but currently it's pretty mixed with each Gender having some good and some bad bits. Every ""feminist"" i've talked to wants women to have what men get without giving up the perks they have. This, to me, is really why the ""men's rights"" movement has started. I don't really like the ""men's rights"" movement but I can see why such a thing would arise in the current climate

I had a discussion the other month with a ""feminist"" who wanted something done about pay inequality (now I have some reservations over how dramatic this pay inequality is  but I bit my tongue). I told her I could sympathise if she agreed that maternity leave could be split between husband and wife, and the retirement age set the same for both sexes. She said this wasn't fair and the only justification she could give was ""Women have it tougher"". She also didn't believe that a military draft should include women either.

So I kinda agree to the article in a way though I think she's being hugely disingenuous in saying her idea of what feminism is what feminism actual is in practice.

&gt;The **Russell Group** is an association of 24 British public research universities. It is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members' interests, principally to government and parliament; 19 smaller British research universities formed the 1994 Group in response. In 2010, Russell Group members received approximately two-thirds of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom.

They approached them in the way they approach more militant animal rights and environmental groups, or indeed organised crime syndicates. This evidentially had some success, as only in the last few years were the fans, families and the city nationally vindicated in their long campaign. 

Even now rival fans (United's ""Always The Victims"" chant) and journalists and politicians speak about ""victim mentality"" ([this provides a good example](http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/rod-liddle/7792578/since-when-has-grief-meant-threats-and-vituperation/)). These police tactics certainly delayed the exposure of the truth, and this refusal upon ""national security"" grounds furthers the portrayal of the HJC as a ""fringe group"". Whilst the complaints themselves highlight the level of the government campaign against the families, what we in the FOI denial here is a refusal to accept accountability and the continued police practice of looking after their own.

It's not widely reported, but the societal group most worried about Romanian and Bulgarian immigration are the Polish. They are most at risk from a new wave of immigrants who are willing to work harder and cheaper than they are.

So you're right, there are only a finite amount of jobs, but the ones that typically get churned by immigration are already taken by immigrants - casual, menial and hard labour, like cleaners, fruit pickers etc. 

But even within that work sector, if you turn up for fruit-picking duty and there's only one job left - and you're a native English speaker who's articulate, well dressed and familiar with the national lores of this country, while the other guy is fresh-off-the-ferry from Romania and dresses odd and doesn't speak a lick of English - then I can safely bet my mother's hat that you'd nab that valuable last position... And I'd bet my mum's other hat that because of you're relatively privileged position, you'll turn up to work late several times, or not at all and eventually you'll be sacked and the Romanian will happily jump into your shoes, work twice as hard and send half his wage packet back home to his family, while sharing a room in a flat above a fast food shop with 12 other recent immigrants.

**TL;DR:** even when new immigrants ""take jobs away"" from existing workers, it's usually from other immigrants. Also, your lazy ass couldn't hack what immigrants do to earn money. Also, immigrants never have it easy; try being one.

&gt;The ""Plebgate"" scandal in the United Kingdom concerns an altercation between Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, the former Government Chief Whip, and the police, which took place on **19 September 2012**

--------------------

&gt;**On 20 September, before the incident was publicly reported**, an email[8] was also received by John Randall, MP, the Government's Deputy Chief Whip. It appeared to offer independent corroboration of the version of events in the police log. The author stated he was a member of the public who had been present outside the gates of Downing Street at the time, with his nephew from Hong Kong

----------------------------------


The logs were not leaked until the **24th of September**. And I believe Mitchell has hinted that he believes those specific reports were leaked just because they contained the word 'pleb', as it counted as evidence against him at the time, and made it look like he was lying.


So, how did Keith Wallis know what to write? You can't corroborate on a story you don't know.

true,fidelcabro,,Yard of overproof rum.,"Jamaican Beef Patties.

You could buy pastry roll it out and then fill with the filling but you wont have the right colour pastry. So you make a basic shortcrust pastry I used 250g of plain flour and 250g of butter. You can mix lard in here but the fat should be 250g. 1 1/2 tsp of turmeric and a pinch of salt and some cold water.

In a bowl mix the flour turmeric and salt then add cold butter either grated or in small pieces and rub the flour mix and butter through your fingers until it looks like breadcrumbs, when it does add a little cold water at a time until it comes together in a dough, wrap in cling film and place in fridge.

For the filling you will need 200g of any minced meat, onion, garlic, ginger, scotch bonnet chilli, tomato purée, salt and pepper to taste, stock. You can add peas or small diced sweet potato.

Chop the onion and the scotch bonnet, garlic and ginger. One clove and about the same size for the ginger. 

Heat a pan up with a little oil and add the onion, garlic and ginger. Once the onion is soft add the minced beef (lamb is great for this) when browned add the scotch bonnet and about a tablespoon of tomato purée cook this for a couple of minutes then add around 150ml of beef stock and the peas or sweat potato if using and cook until the stock is almost gone. Place this mixture in a bowl and leave to cool.

Take the pastry from the fridge and on a floured surface roll until about the thickness of a £2 coin and cut circles out about the size of a saucer. Place a good tablespoon of  the mixture in each circle and then take a beaten egg and brush around the outside of the circle, pull over into a half circle and seal with a fork.

Turn your oven on to about 190 and place the patties on a baking sheet, give them a brush with the egg and put in the oven for 20 mins.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"This is shocking from Leeds. Absolutely shocking. The worst I've seen us play since Warnock was in charge. Twice we've conceded due to absolutely **basic** defensive problems. Mark the people on the right side of our half, for fuck's sake, and it would still be 0-0!

This line-up and formation was a bad idea from its very conception. I'm sorry, but it's hard to respect McDermott as a manager when he does this. Thing is, we're not playing 5-3-2 - we're playing 3-4-3. So Pugh and Peltier don't have the same defensive responsibility, which leaves the back three exposed. You could see that Sheffield Wednesday's game plan literally is to let us pass it about between the defense and midfield, knowing that as soon as they intercept the ball they can break in numbers against three vulnerable players.

Moreover, we can't pass the ball. We don't look capable of controlling the ball, let alone passing it between our players, and this isn't helped by the pitch being an absolute Christmas pudding. This team is screaming out for a player like Smith and McDermott had the brilliant idea of leaving him **on the bench**. Wednesday must have been laughing when they saw our line-up!

Also, Zaliukas has completely lost his form since signing his contract. It's Andy O'Brien all over again! At fault for both goals, he's looked completely incapable of defending. Mowatt has also been very disappointing, as he's uncharacteristically let the ball slip away from him so many times. The only players who look at all decent are Pearce and McCormack, who unfortunately can't carry nine other players by themselves.

This team needs massive changes. Get Zaliukas off and put Smith on, changing the team to a 4-4-2. I'd also take Pugh off and put Warnock on, personally. If we do that, we might get something out of this game because Wednesday are no great shakes, but I fear that the damage done in the first half cannot be repaired.",0,1389446313,null,0,false,0,cemwd1t,t3_1uyeep,t1_cemwd1t,t3_1uyeep,null,1431896024,6,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,6

I think I speak for most in saying I had never heard of the vast majority of our signings under Lambert. Our lack of interest in premier league and other obvious players makes it very difficult to predict who we will get. I would make a competent left back our number 1 priority, followed by an attacking midfielder. If possible I would also look to bring in an experienced player that can play in defensive midfield and across the back 4.


We should look to sell the bomb squad. Ireland is all but gone. Given Hutton Stevens N'Zogbia Delfouneso and Bent remain. Getting rid of those 4 high earners in particular is a very important step for moving the club forward. I would also like to see more of our U21s get loan moves - particularly Janoi Donacien, Daniel Johnson, Callum Robinson, Graham Burke. There is little value in the Under 21 league any more and they need to be playing first team football to progress. 


Is Lambert the man for the job? Still too early to tell in my opinion. He has said from day 1 this is a long term project. He has had to shop in bargain basement and it is very difficult to find quality players for the amount of money we are paying in wages and transfer fees. The football is horrible at the moment but we saw these players play some good stuff last season when they were confident.

I don't think we deserve to be in the Prem - the fans do though. Even though we're 4-0 down to one of the worst teams in the league, away, they're still there singing and supporting their team.

But the league standing doesn't reflect current form - if we carry on playing like this, we won't be there come the end of the season.

&gt;You pulled examples from canonical material

Which you ignore in favor of a JOKE made on a spinoff show.

true,Cheimon,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"I'm not saying it is flawed, though.  Just because something's biased doesn't mean it's bad or whatever, it just means it's worth taking into account.  Bias isn't some dirty word that automatically poisons the well of whatever your argument is drawing from: I'd assume a lot of studies have some sort of bias because people with an interest in certain subjects are more likely to commission certain studies.

As for why I don't look at the study: it's faster to just make vague points on the internet, especially if I'm not actually saying it's flawed.  On your suggestion I have looked for details on how the poll was done, and found the following.

This is how it's been presented:

&gt; “Four out of five British people believe that the media’s portrayal of ethnic minorities promotes racism. This is true whether you’re Black, Asian or White. The vast majority of the British public questions the ability of the media to portray ethnic minorities in a fair and reasonable light,” he said.

Okay, so what were those respondents?

&gt; Total sample size was 750 adults. All respondents provided details of their ethnicity and religion. The demographic of the group are as follows: Indian 200, Pakistani 150, Black Caribbean 75, Black African 75, Eastern European 100, White British 150. The demographic by religion is as follows: Christian 217, Hindu 138, Sikh 54, Muslim 188, Other 18, None 135. The survey was carried out in person. Fieldwork was undertaken between July-August 2013.

http://www.end-racism.org/if-the-media-promotes-racism-what-can-we-do-to-fix-it/

Immediately, there are some questions.  I don't know exactly how the survey was done because that's all I could find, but the obvious ones are (1) where are Asians (including Bangladeshi and Chinese people, who [make up a significant proportion of Asian ethnicity groups on the UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-Ethnicity-in-England-and-Wales)) who are not of Indian or Pakistani ethnicity, but who still live and work in the UK and would qualify as minorities, and (2) have the poll results been weighted in proportion to the demographic makeup of the UK to support the claim of 'four out of five British people believing X', and (3) if religion is being taken into account, has the poll been weighted in accordance with that related to the UK generally?

These are some key details that might be helpful in determining if the study has any flaws.  There's also the sentence:

&gt; Quite unsurprisingly the groups who most strongly agreed with the statement were from Pakistani and Eastern European backgrounds, both of whom have been targeted by the media in Islamophobic and anti-migration narratives. 

That potentially suggests they commissioned the poll with the specific expectation of certain results (suggesting a bias, though *as I've said before* not one that necessarily causes flaws) and also reveals that they are certain the media has been Islamophobic, but doesn't source that.  Has it?  I don't know.  Quite possibly.  But that they're certain enough about it gives further impression of a potential bias, and the need to bear it in mind when viewing the results of the study.

While I mostly support fracking for the reasons you stated, I can't help but be nervous about whether or not it's implemented well. Anything that's offering a short term gain of huge amounts of money is just asking for corners cut in corruption cases for a quick £. I think the reason the food industry is much better regulated is because more people know about whether food is fucked or not (within reason) and because it's less of a short term cash boost.

Frankly we'll have much more energy security if we invested in something that wasn't going to run out soon, like most energy sources we've had recently that deplete. Something like Nuclear really needs investment imo more so. 

Yeah I agree, the whole 'NO FRACKING' isn't entirely fair - while I  know it can be done securely I'm just dubious about whether it will or not :/ And for that reason I think we're better off investing in renewables.

true,LostThineGame,null,null,"&gt;the only independent witness said Mark Duggan 'did not need to die'. The taxi driver said Duggan never touched a box the gun was supposed to be in. The gun had none of Duggan's fingerprints or DNA on it. No one ever saw him with a gun, and apparently the police didn’t see him throw a gun over a fence after they stopped him. The only independent witness said Duggan had his hand above his head when shot.

For me, the most likely scenario is that the Police planted the gun after the shooting so I don't think they acted well in this case. Despite that however, it would have *no* bearing on the conclusion of the killing being lawful. 

&gt;The only way you can see the shooting a legal is if you only take the words of the police, police which in this case have systematically lied.

If the jury couldn't trust any of the police information the conclusion would be an open verdict (i.e. unknown). It still wouldn't be an unlawful killing. To reach an unlawful killing conclusion you have to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the police officer didn't have a reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger. I think anyone in this scenario where you're following someone with a gun, that exits their vehicle rapidly making various hand movements, where decisions are made in a split second with adrenaline pumping, would have a reasonable belief that they were in imminent danger. Please note the word 'belief'; it doesn't have to be objectively true, it just has to be a belief that they were in imminent danger. 

So by the rules of Law this is **clearly** a lawful killing. You're evidence doesn't even suggest any unlawful killing because it says **nothing** about the frame of mind the police officer was in. I think you're thinking of this as more of a civil case; in which the officer would be liable for some blame.

OP then states no one Chelsea could buy would replace him. This is a sub full of fellow club supporters so obviously appealing to our sense of pride in players is likely to garner better reception than stating the simple reality that Hazard is not the be all of players.

true,J_Cubz,,Wei   mann?,"As people keep saying, we need a link up between midfield and attack whether in the form of an attacking midfielder to drive at defences or a creative player to feed the attackers through on goal. The later would be my preference, as our ability to keep the ball in the opponents' half is woeful. I don't think Hoolahan is a very ambitious target, but for his dirt cheap price it's better than nothing, assuming he doesn't just become another poorly performing wage drain.

I don't think we can really afford to sell anyone in this window with our current bad luck injury wise. Also, most players i think we don't need are currently on loan and won't be sold until summer. Benteke may be suffering but he really came to life in the new year last season and his current goal drought is not entirely his fault, so why sell him? I can't see many teams wanting to buy such a poorly performing striker in Jan anyway.

Discontent is to be expected with our current play style and some results, but i think Lambert should be given longer. A manager change would be a massive gamble at this point. However, if we don't make a sensible signing in this window i will be completely baffled and rather angry with him, even if transfers aren't entirely in his hands.

So in summary, we need a creative mid and maybe some cover at CB, we should keep Benteke and Lambert is the man for the job currently.",0,1389453168,null,0,false,0,cemxqfk,t3_1uyh35,t1_cemxqfk,t3_1uyh35,null,1431896623,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

There a a few people on twitter that help in a situation like this. it's a place for fans to sell tickets to fans for face value. There twitter handles are @chelseaticket and @cfctickets. 

if you follow them closely, tickets will come up but you have to be incredibly fast. 

I tried to scalp tickets but they wanted 250 for Upper Shed End. I was relentless with them but there were not budging on price. While I was dealing with them, A crowd of four guys walked up to me and asked if I wanted to see the match. They had a friend who was a season ticket holder that could not make it to that match. I paid them face value and saw Mikel score.

Are you equating the Picts (native Celts) with Vikings? The Vikings did not come to the British Isles solely to plunder, they colonised much of the East of England, and set up a variety of polities in what is now Scotland. That is an extremely facile view of Norse history in the British Isles.

&gt;  The only times we were completely invaded, was when Julius Ceaser sent 100 000 men.

What about Guillaume le Conquérant, i.e. William the Conqueror? He invaded, subjugated the Anglo-Saxon nobility, and then replaced them with Anglo-Normans. He was the King of England, but his liege lord was the King of France, who he was bound to acknowledge as his superior. Norman French was the language of the courts and literate classes for centuries, and it also had a massive impact on the vocabulary and grammar of English, which was hitherto a fairly typical Germanic language. The notion that the British Isles stand apart and have been free from invasions or major outside influences is an old misconception resulting from Anglocentric historiography.",0,1389454954,null,0,false,0,cemy8dz,t3_1up75q,t1_cemy8dz,t1_cem4c4u,null,1431896859,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

It's hard to directly respond to your question as I can't imagine Brits migrating to Poland to do low paid jobs and thus can't answer you what possible views of native people there would be, based on those facts.

I doubt it's filtering in this case. The IWF checker shows reddit as currently not in the filter, and my ISP, not being one of those volunteered, isn't operating any other kind of filter.

[ Side note: Filtering CAN cause a site to go slow. The way Cleanfeed works is that a coarse filter redirects requests to listed sites or servers to a proxy, the proxy then performs a more finely-grained filter. If a popular file or image host gets listed over a handful of files, this can overload the proxy system, making all requests to those sites slow. Also, one site might be listed on a shared hosting server containing hundreds of sites. All of those sites will go through the proxy, and be slowed down. Since reddit has its own dedicated servers, we can be sure this is not the case here; it would need to be listed individually.]",0,1389459324,null,0,false,0,cemzo6d,t3_1uysht,t1_cemzo6d,t3_1uysht,null,1431897543,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,petethepool,null,null,"the problem to me is always the same - I remember last season at some point listening to the phone-ins on the Liverpool channel after a loss, and a guy phoned up ranting about the need to spend £50 mil on a player to show L'pool's intent etc.  The question was then asked: 'well, who do Liverpool buy then - who can they realistically attract to the club that would cost that much?' - the guy couldn't think of a single player, and quite right too.  There are so few 'big' players out there who are available, and even less that would move from a club in a league that they a guaranteed CL football every year (for example, in Dortmund, they may not win the league but they'll almost always at least qualify for the Champs League due to a relative lack of strong competition in their league for 2nd - 4th.  I say relative because when you consider how many teams in the BPL are strong enough to fight for the Champs League places, you see how much more of a gamble it is for a player to move to a club outside of Chelsea and/or Man City, if they are hoping for consistent Champs League.  Similarly in Italy or Spain - if a quality player is in a team that is consistently qualifying for the Champs League, it will be very hard to convince him - this winter in particular - to take a gamble on the club.  Also, the majority of the teams in the CL will not need/want to sell if they can afford not to (which CL qualification assists them with).  

So, the only options realistically are either players who are out of favour with their clubs or are playing at clubs with bad finances / poor league position - or, as it is a WC year, a player who has a chance of getting into their national side if they can get a run of games at a high level (See Jelavic to Hull).  And, again, the question remains: who, out of that group, do we sign? I am not implying that there are not players out there, but, rather, that most people on this sub seem to throw out the same names every year (as in, each year a new set of names are thrown about, and everyone simply assumes that they are who we need, irregardless of availability), and then get pissed off when they aren't 'snapped up', when the reality is that Liverpool must know more or less who is available and who isn't -- and if they felt the deal good for the club, they would do it.  So, to me, the implication is that there are very few players available.   

My point, I suppose, is that it is very very hard to find players of a suitable quality that would be willing to move at a realistic cost to a club that is not guaranteed CL football.  That is why this season is so important to Liverpool.  If they qualify, then they can compete for signings in the summer.

I would love, personally, for two or three signings that fill the weak-spot in our squad, and I think you're right after last January - although I had heard of both Coutinho and Sturridge - I would be happy enough if L'pool signed two players I'd never heard of.  Because L'pool have proven they can play the market in the past year, if the quality is there.  And if anyone knows who is available and who isn't - it's the club.

Two that spring immediately to mind in Wolverhampton, near the train station, are The Royal, the old hospital and the J N Miller flour mill right next the the station.

The Royal is where my Dad did his training and was a beautiful victorian looking hospital, with some dubious ""modern"" addons. It is now a demolition site as only parts are protected. The Mill is mostly old, ugly and very unsafe (some Urbex guys went up to the roof a few years back, but I don't think anyone has risked it recently). But beyond the metal construction is some beautiful Victorian brickwork, not to mention that it is historically important as it apparently is one of the first buildings in the UK to have been built to some sort of fire safety code.",0,1389459883,null,0,false,0,cemzvl3,t3_1uvrn8,t1_cemzvl3,t1_cemzojt,null,1431897647,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That said, I'm glad to see that we stuck with it; Eriksen has demonstrated again that he is our single best offensive weapon, and Bentaleb continues to make a case for himself as part of our starting XI even when the squad is healthy.

It assumes that the natural state of being for any right thinking person is to have no political aspirations outside of the union. Even to question the makeup of the UK is somehow sectarian, backward, unthinkable.
Essentially it asks everyone to be a unionist, but not too much of a unionist. 
The supposed progressive elements in NI are NI21, Alliance and the PUP. There is but one problem; all of these parties are on the Unionist end of the scale.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"Yes, and it's fueled not only by incessant anti-unemployed propaganda but by the dissatisfaction of the employed.

The story of someone having Mon-Fri to do whatever they please, without alarm clocks, commuting, rushed meals, or constant low-level stress is that much more enraging when your pittance wages are garnished for that tuition you didn't need, that miserable pension you might never see, the trains which are always crowded and late, etc.

&gt; If you look at the government's Labour Force Surveys over the last couple of decades you'll see a clear rising trend in the number of people being treated for stress related illness by their GP whilst still able to work, from the late eighties onwards. From the mid nineties this is accompanied by a rising trend in the number of people unable to work because of stress related illness. A few years in to the new century that particular part of the LFS was accompanied by a note to the effect that ""we consider it unlikely that this is due to any actual increase in stress related illness as their is no rise in metal health morbidity over the same period"".

&gt; What has clearly happened if you look at the data is that increasing use of short term contracts and casual employment, coupled with a housing shortage, have led to many more people suffering levels of stress sufficient to make them ill and eventually chronically ill.

&gt; Unfortunately the current political orthodoxy is that you can have a free lunch. You can constantly put people under ever more stress and all that happens is they are more productive/profitable. The evidence shows that isn't the case. The price of unrealistic employment and housing policies is one heck of a lot of very sick people.

I'm sure most (including BR) would love to have a giant stack of money to spend, but where does that money come from if the club doesn't have it?  Frankly what we need to do is a better job of actually making money on player sales.  As I recall I think we've actually made money on like 3 players in the last 5 years or so- Ngog, Torres, and Shelvey.  Everyone else has been sold at lesser amounts that what we paid for them.  

I do think BR and the committee have done a good job lately there- at this point it's hard to see Mignolet, Alberto, Coutinho, Sturridge, Sakho, and probably Ilori going anywhere for less than we paid for them.  Aspas is perhaps one that would on current form, but he didn't cost a bucket load either so that's okay.  Appreciation in player value I think simply has to improve significantly as that's one of the biggest methods to quickly generate cash for the club in order to further invest.  CL is obviously another massive way to do this as it provides somewhere between 25M-50M to the participants.

Lucky to get in at half-time 0-0. Second half a marked improvement, but Palace still threatened through out. Also, throughout the whole game right up until injury time we were terrible at defending set pieces and this is something that surely needs to be addressed.

As for the Miami speech? I don't know, he's hyping the crowd, might come off as being arrogant but what was he supposed to say? The reason he went to Miami was for titles, the big question was always going to be how many

As for last night, Lebron vs Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, probably two of his most consistent rivals during his whole career, it's always going to make for a tense match.

Bentaleb looked sharp comparatively, but it's hard to rate long term considering there was such a lack of effort in the first half from our forwards.

Dembele and Eriksen were solid.   Eriksen didn't have much to work with up front and I think will be more dangerous as the season moves forward.

Lennon had his moments, but with no movement from the strikers and Eriksen playing a more floating role, Palace routed the play away from him and they knew he was the only threat from the wing.

The bad:

Unless we have no alternatives due to injury or player fatigue, I'm losing confidence in our 4-4-2 with Soldado/Adebayor up front.   Adebayor has bouts of work rate, but both of them played listlessly waiting to poach for opportunities.   I'll remain hopeful, but I don't see this changing too much as the rest of the season moves forward.  I think in the following summer window, we should try to get a young developing striker who makes more runs and can develop themselves into the first team over the next season or two.

Once we have Townsend, Sandro, Paulinho, and Lamela back from injury, I can't really see playing the 2 strikers up-front as the go-to strategy considering the positional quality of our midfield players.",0,1389460630,null,0,false,0,cen05ij,t3_1uyu3p,t1_cen05ij,t3_1uyu3p,null,1431897795,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Few points:

Tom Lees, he's average at defending, but his problem is that when he has the ball, he's useless. He doesn't know what to do with the ball, and he loses it.

Peltier. He was taking the lead on the right far too much. His job should have been to feed Kebe down the line, but he wouldn't. He made runs himself, which forced Kebe to run into the middle. We got Kebe for a reason Peltier, now fuck off back to defence.

Zaliukas. He had one bad game, he was the fault of a few goals, but you can't just blame him.

Mowatt. He seemed tired today. He lost the ball a lot and seemed sloppy. This is not like his normal performances.

At half time, I was saying we need to bring on Matt Smith, because we had two quality wingers, and nobody to supply in the box. The sending off, I'm not sure, I haven't seen a replay. But McDermott said it wasn't a sending off, and that he would appeal it.

Other than that, I don't know where all of this is going to go. For no reason, the entire team has just flopped into awful awful performances.
There's nothing we can do, except freshen up the team with new players (preferably a striker), and hope they get their heads get banged together.

I worked in a factory that makes cardboard boxes (think ""the boxes your KFC chicken nuggets come in"") and it was one of the most exhausting weeks of my life. I was working flat out and cleaning 1 pallet of boxes in the time it took any of the Eastern European workers (who had been doing it for months at the very least so they did have practise) to do 2 pallets and start on the 3rd. They'd go at this breakneck pace from 6 to 6 with about 30 minutes of breaks total in the day.

I washed out. My hands were a mess of papercuts and bruises and I was only doing 8 hour days. I was prepared to go on longer but fortunately my permanent job search had turned up an interview the next week, and my agency replaced me so they wouldn't have to find someone just 1 day of work that next week.

Look at Moses and Cissokho, both were brought as squad options, granted both are on loan but are you telling me that they are any better than Flanagan or Assaidi?

We need to get the right players at the right price. I'm happy to see no one come in during this window rather than some average player for a lot of money. I agree with paying over the odds for players with huge pedigree that almost guarantee success but just remember the last time we went on a big spending splurge Carroll -£35mil, Downing -£20mil, Henderson -£18mil.

GAMBLERS: For a new gambling opportunity, try sending £50 to yourself by Royal Mail.

EMPLOYERS: Avoid hiring unlucky people by immediately tossing half the CVs into the bin.

MEN: When listening to your favourite CD, simply turn up the sound to the volume you desire - then turn it down three notches. This saves your wife having to do it.

DRIVERS: Avoid getting prosecuted for using your phone while driving. Simply pop your mobile inside a large shell and the police will think you are listening to the sea.

BANGING two pistachio nut shells together gives the' impression a very small horse' is approaching.

DON'T waste money on expensive iPods. Simply think of your favourite tune and I hum it. If you want to ""switch tracks"", simply think of another song you like and hum that instead.

CINEMAGOERS: Have consideration for pirate DVD viewers by using the toilet before the film starts.

DRIVERS: If a car breaks down or stalls in front of you, beep your horn and wave your arms frantically. This should help the car start and send them on their way.

PREVENT burglars stealing everything in the house by moving everything into your bedroom when you go to bed. In the morning, move it all back again.

CAR THIEVES: Don't be discouraged if nothing is on view. The valuables may be hidden in the glove box or under a seat.

RAPPERS: Avoid having to say: ""Know what I'm sayin'"" all the time by actually speaking clearly in the first place.

SHOES last twice as long if only worn every other day.

SINGLE MEN: Convince people you have a girlfriend by standing outside Topshop with bags of shopping, looking at your watch and occasionally glancing inside.

EMPLOYEES: Only use the loo at work. Not only will you save money on toilet paper, but you'll also be getting paid.

SCROOGES: Save money at Christmas by returning last year's cards to the sender with the simple inscription ""Same to you"".

MICRA DRIVERS: Attach a lighted sparkler to the roof of your car before starting a long journey. You drive the thing like a sodding dodgem car anyway.

ANGLERS: Attach a helium balloon to your line and bait the hook with an acorn. Then sit under a tree and ""fish"" for squirrels. An upturned laundry basket would make an ideal keep-net, but don't forget to throw the squirrels back into the tree at the end of the day.

SINGLE MEN: Get a glimpse of married life by taping Woman's Hour on Radio 4, then playing it back at a higher volume than the TV while trying to watch something on Discovery Wings.

TIGHT-ARSED blokes: Only date girls called Natalie, Carol, Holly or Eve. Chances are their birthday is around Christmas and you won't have to shell out for a present until then, by which time they will have chucked you.

BOIL an egg to perfection without costly egg timers by popping it into boiling water and driving away from your home at exactly 60mph. After three miles, phone your wife to take the egg out the pan.

SHOPPERS: Take one grape to the till. It won't register on the low-tech, insensitive scales so you will get it for free. Repeat this procedure 100 times or so and you have yourself a free bunch of grapes.

McDONALD'S: Make your brown carrier bags green so they blend in with the countryside after they've been thrown out of car windows.

A POST-IT Note stuck beneath the nose is an ideal way to foil lip-readers.

AMERICANS: Save valuable time by not pending ""God bless America"" to your every sentence.

TOWN COUNCILS: Reduce litter problems by issuing blind folk with pointy sticks.

WHEN visiting a motorway service station for a cup of tea and a slice of cake, make sure you arrange your bank loan or second mortgage before you get to the tills, saving time and embarrassment.

CYCLISTS: Avoid getting a sore behind by simply placing a naan bread over your saddle. This will comfort your ride and when you return home, hey presto! A warm snack.

HOUSEWIVES: Before attempting to remove stubborn stains from a garment, circle the soiled area with a permanent pen so that when you remove it from the washing machine you can check the stain has gone.

SKY TV viewers: Avoid repetitive strain injury by holding down the ""prog+"" button on your remote control and taping your finger in place.

YOUNG mothers: Calm hysterically crying children in the supermarket by firmly slapping their legs and then tugging them along by the wrist.

PHILANDERERS: Avoid the embarrassment of shouting out the wrong name in bed by having flings only with girls who have the same name as your wife.

FOOTBALLERS: Remember there is plenty of time to get drunk after your playing career has ended.

HORSE whisperers: Speak louder. The animals will hear you more clearly, thus speeding up training times.

FEMALE shop assistants: When a garage mechanic comes to your till, add on a selection of random items they didn't know they needed and charge them s50 labour costs for the transaction.

It wasn't spread out thinly, but concentrated more in certain areas. I don't think it ever pushed any services to breaking point, but it certainly would have been noticeable to anyone in those areas and added extra strain. Not to mention, that was in relatively good times for the economy, before austerity. I'm not sure public services would cope so well if it were to happen today, so it's natural for people to be concerned about the possibility of it happening again.

However, I'm not convinced it will happen like that again, especially since the economies of the countries neighbouring Romania and Bulgaria are doing better today than they were when they joined. It's likely they'll end up just stopping there as they're closer, more similar, etc, and will do the same for their economies as they Poles did for ours.

Most of it has been acquired over a few years; partly because of cost, and partly because I've always had a car and did only very basic servicing. But to do almost any task on your bike without fear of getting stuck halfway through for lack of tools, you'll need:

* Torque wrench 
* Breaker bar
* Socket extention bar
* Socket size adapters
* Sockets -  lots (32mm for rear axle on most?)
* Paddock stand (unless you have centre stand already) 
* Spanners (and some duplicate sizes) 
* Spark plug socket (check handbook for specific size) 
* Allen keys
* Screwdriver set
* Oil filter cup wrench (check handbook for size) 
* Drain oil can/tub
* Chain cleaner
* Toothbrushes (preferably not being used by someone, unless you really don't like them) 
* A decent light/torch
* Anti-freeze tester
* Lubricants: (Anti-corrosion spray/WD40/GT85/chain wax) 
* HAYNES MANUAL (I know everything is online these days but there is no substitute for accurate information, all in one place) 

Good torque wrench and sockets (particularly the larger ones) are expensive. Not worth buying cheap crap though. Halfords professional sets are good quality, and have a lifetime guarantee. Highly recommend.

Most of my sockets are 1/2"" but I have some 3/8"", too. Don't forget adapters if you have varying sized sockets. 


Advanced includes:

*  Brake bleed kit
* Chain linking tool (if new chain for your bike takes an 'endless' chain). Avoid cheap crap. My housemate bought one under £30 and it was destroyed within one use. Read extensive reviews for whatever you consider buying. 

Find out the size of the wheel alignment nuts on the rear swingarm(s) and have a couple of spanners the same size handy. My bike, in particular, has 2 nuts either side for adjusting and locking. Some bikes only have 1. Need to do each side of the wheel, bit at a time. Easier to have a spanner on each to get it as accurate as possible. 

**Remember to check the condition of your chain and sprockets regularly.**

This is also on the menu tonight and it is simple, use any meat you want or again veg. Goat is better but you use what you have.

Aim for 2 chicken thighs per person as the dark meat is better and well the bone adds to flavour, plus cheapness. About a pint of chicken stock (oxo in water is fine), a pepper colour of your choice, an onion (my gran would say use scallions (spring onion) but I went for red), 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, a thumb sized piece of ginger, tin of tomatoes, tablespoon of tomato purée, scotch bonnet chillies (I used two without seeds, if you like it hotter use more or keep the seeds in), sweet paprika, and a spice mix called garam masala. It is a combination of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg.

Chop your onions and grate your garlic and ginger and fry gently in oil, you want them to go soft and not get colour on them. Once this has happened put into a big saucepan.

Fry the chicken in batches until it is browned and place with the onions. Into the pan now add the tomato purée and a little water and fry with the pepper you have chopped up (do all the chopping at the beginning it is easier) now add the scotch bonnets, a tsp of paprika and a tsp of garam masala and fry for a minute or so. Add the tin of tomatoes and the stock and let it come to a boil for a couple of minutes.

Pour over the chicken and onions and give a good stir, if the chicken is not covered add a little more water. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover with a lid or another pan and simmer on the lowest heat you can get until the chicken is cooked. (It will pretty much fall off the bone) Serve with rice and rum.

This shale gas is an immense store which can be accessed right here and used quickly by the infrastructure we already have. I'd love to see more nuclear, but we can't just spring those up overnight. I'd also love for us to have made better decisions in the past and be in a better position with ""green"" technology and infrastructure. But we didn't, and the last government failed to build any nuclear stations at all. So right now, in 2014 we need more energy and sitting on an enormous potential stock of usable fuel and doing nothing seems bonkers. That's why I'm glad that we will be digging out this shale gas.

Bear in mind you'll also need a minimum (sometimes more) of 1 months rental as a deposit, returnable when you leave, as well as your first months rent up front. You'll then need to pay Council tax, which is probably between £600 - £1000 a year with your 25% single persons discount, depending on your property. Your electricity and gas is maybe another £800 to £1000 a year. Your broadband will be £25 - £35 a month for something decent. You need a license to watch TV here, yes, i know we all think its disgusting too, £145.50 a year. If you want any kind of ""extra"" TV, cable, satellite etc, thats maybe £20 to £70 a month depending on your package. Food can vary a lot depending on what you eat, maybe £50 - £70 a week? Buses cost £3.50 a day for unlimited travel that day, if you get a monthly card thing you'll save a little.

I've not counted any leisure activities, or running a car, these you'll have to figure out yourself when you get here. If you can budget around £1200 a month, you'll get by, but for a comfortable living, £2k a month is what i'd aim for. This is just my opinion and other people's figures might be wildly different, so just ask as many people as possible.

Weather wise, the last week or so has probably been around 1 - 7 degrees Celsius which is about 34 - 45 degrees Fahrenheit, its been pretty easy this winter, but its not snowed yet, i expect some soon though, it'll get colder. When its windy (it often is), its even worse.

As for amenities, if you are in any of these towns, you'll have access to everything you need. Penicuik, Loanhead, etc has everything for day to day living, if you need something specific, you can bus it into Edinburgh easily.

As for safety, thats a matter of opinion, there are rough areas everywhere in the world, but in my opinion you're always safe. One thing i would watch however is weekend pub closing times, especially in Penicuik. Our culture in the UK tends to be irresponsible drinking on the weekends, and when pubs close for the night, all the drunks are all tossed outside all at once, which means that fights happen pretty much every weekend at around 2am.

The harm arrises when an increasing number of people are looking for (especially low-skilled labour) jobs.  This brings the wages down (basic supply and demand stuff) across that area of the market, but can't push down the NMW, only the state can do that.  Were the state to declare the NMW had to be higher it would be so, we would still face the same problem of too many people for too few jobs.        
         
A few caveats:    
1. The effect this has on wages overall and employment competition is difficult to study, and is likely negligible (the immigrant population of the UK is tiny).        
2. the NMW is law, but not always obeyed.  There is evidence from the USA indicating immigrant workers are more likely to accept below-legal wages.  Whilst not lowering the NMW it aggravates unemployment and makes the law toothless.  I am yet to see evidence of this being a significant factor in the UK economy.      
3.  More insidiously, the way most of our political discourse is arranged in the UK means issues like immigration can focus attention on areas like benefits etc, where there can be a phantom-harm.  This takes airtime and attention away form issues like NMW which is (imho) a far more useful solution to far more problems than changing Welfare policy.  This prevents good reasons for upping the NMW not getting aired because (fictitious) Bulgarian benefits scroungers are coming over here, stealing jobs, cheating the system, flicking Vs at the Queen, etc etc and we need to hear about that :/",0,1389470134,null,0,false,0,cen3vpd,t3_1uy93o,t1_cen3vpd,t3_1uy93o,null,1431899553,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I think he was the emporor or some kind of leader. He said something about annihilating all of humanity or some other Dalek stuff and when he was done, giant fireballs started raining down on earth. I knew I couldn't do anything about it so I just hoped none of them would hit me (spoiler: they didn't). When it seemed to have stopped I immediately started looking for the Doctor (11) to see if he was alright, as if I already met him earlier, but I didn't in the dream.

I thought he would be angry or scared, helping people somewhere but I found him inside a van, just tinkering with a small device with his screwdriver.

In any case, what I said seems to stand, broadly speaking. The US has a higher growth rate, yet a lower rate of unemployment than the UK. The opposite is true of Poland, Hungary and Belgium-their population growth is lower but their unemployment rate is higher than the UK.

France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Ireland all match the prediction that a higher population growth rate correlates with higher rates of unemployment.

In any case, it seems to me that the number of exceptions is too great for one to be causatively linked to the other in any meaningful way. The two figures are both symptomatic of other issues in any given country.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"Nearly all roles in the military have at least some possibility that you may need to kill people (even if a good deal of roles are non-combat), it's one of the main reasons the military exists. Volunteering for the army while having a problem with the possibility you may have to go and kill people is rather shortsighted, joining up as a cook or technician may well drastically lower the chances of combat, but it doesn't rule it out.

As for your fathers generation, I'm not sure how old you are, but up until the mid-80's there was (at the time) a perception that war with the USSR was a genuine threat along with the Northern Ireland Troubles and a myriad of other post colonial engagements. The only time where there was a perception of the world being genuinely peaceful was the decade between the cold war ending and 9/11, and during that time there was the Gulf war, Bosnia and Kosovo (more if you don't include our forces being involved).

In regard to the CoD generation, I don't think the desire to join up and fight is something new and fucked up. Kids have played army games for time immemorial, and the idea that this is wrong is a relatively new thing.

As for PTSD after the army, it's something that impacts a lot of people, but I also know people who were in combat roles who were fine after they left the military. They joined up, they went to war and killed people, they left the army and had no problems.

Canadians, Australians, Kiwi's and Americans can't live here. Romainians, Polsih, Germans, French, Swedish, all these nations can live here. They don't speak our native tongue as a first language, aren't a prior colony, and have LESS culturally in common with us. So why are we favouring these people over English speaking places that we colonised? 

EU trade protectionism against foreign states is also a bit mad in my opinion. Why should we have free trade with countries that spend the euro (which isn't our currency) and not have it with Canada, USA, or any of the previous countries I just mentioned? 

Why don't we accept peoples from these countries if we're accepting people from the EU? 

Also, people say 'immigrates are a net benefit to the economy'. I fully agree with this. More people means more consumerism, more money spent, more taxes taken, more productive people in our country. If I was from Eastern Europe, I'd come here within a heart beat. I'm driven, motivated and want to better myself financially. I have nothing against people who want to this, it's makes sense for them to do it, on a personal level. 

The problem is we don't have enough housing for these people, don't have enough oil for these people to consume goods that are transported via oil (petrol prices are fucking horrendous as are rent/house prices), and these factors are not focused on an intellectual level because it's 'racist' or 'xenophobic' to do so.

Your first misconception is that the BBC is a telecoms company. I think you might be confusing them with BT. The BBC is the British Broadcasting Company, who are the state-funded TV and media producers. BT is British Telecom, who were the state-owned telecommunications provider until privatised. 

Essentially, the BBC license fee entitles a person to posses equipment capable of showing or recording live TV and radio broadcasts. This includes radios in houses, TVs, DVD recorders for TV, etc etc. It also entitles people to use battery-powered or portable radios and TV sets outside of the covered home as long as they are not plugged into the mains. This therefore covers car radios and portable TVs.

As far as the internet is concerned, you are allowed to use any ""catch-up"" style services without a license, however watching live broadcasts mush have a license.

As far as telecommunications are concerned, since the dawn of the telegraph era in the UK, the Post Office (our equivalent of the USPS) handled the government network of ""sending a communication from one person to another"" and thus acts were passed at various times to grant the Post Office monopolies on telegraphs and telephones. 

Incidentally, this is how the Post Office was involved in computing during WWII and played such a critical role in developing code-breaking computers.

In 1969 the Post Office transitioned from being a government department to a Nationalised Industry, but it maintained it's monpoly over the telephone system. 

In 1980 British Telecom was created as a department of the Post Office and took over the telephone network. BT was privatised in 1982. They have since been split up into private companies under one parent company, so that their services can be resold to other BT groups and other telcos and ISPs.

BT group via a company called OpenReach retains ownership of the entire telephone network, and thus the ADSL broadband infrastructure of the UK, but new laws passed mean BT has to lease the network at a government set price to other telcos and ISPs.

As far as TV is concerned, the standard delivery network is the freeview service, which is operated in a joint venture between our major tv channels (the BBC, ITV, Channel 4) and BSkyB, a satellite TV company, and the transmission tower operator, which is a private company.

Besides the freeview (terrestrial) channels, there is the BSkyB service, which is satellite delivered, and the new format of getting TV through internet service providers.

Internet Service Providers range from ADSL providers like BT and BSkyB, to Virgin Media, who own and operate the cable network in the UK. They are a private company, who also operate ADSL services for those outside cable areas, and they can also provide telephone services like telecoms-based ISPs.

TL;DR: BT has nothing to do with the BBC, and BT own the whole telephone network but have to lease it. Virgin Media owns the cable network but they are private. All ISPs in the UK are privately owned.",0,1389472341,null,0,false,0,cen4qga,t3_1uwh51,t1_cen4qga,t3_1uwh51,null,1431899975,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

&gt;

&gt;""**Rose**"" is the opening episode of the first series of the revived British science fiction television programme Doctor Who. The episode was directed by Keith Boak and written by Russell T Davies who was also one of the three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC One on 26 March 2005. ""Rose"" was the first Doctor Who episode to air since the Doctor Who television film in 1996.

&gt;The plot involves Rose Tyler meeting series protagonist the Doctor, a time-travelling alien Time Lord. She first encounters him in the department store where she works, while being attacked by Autons  – living plastic in the guise of shop window mannequins. Rose and the Doctor uncover and defeat a plot by the alien Nestene Consciousness, which aimed to take over the Earth using the living plastic, after which she accepts the Doctor's offer to travel through time and space with him in his time machine, the TARDIS.

&gt;The episode marked the debut of Christopher Eccleston, the ninth actor to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963, and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, the Doctor's companion. Being the first episode of the revived series, several lead characters were introduced; Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith. Viewers did not see the Doctor Who character regenerate from a previous incarnation; regeneration being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating. ""Rose"" began filming in Cardiff, the headquarters of BBC Wales, in July 2004, with some location scenes shot in London. ""Rose"" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed Doctor Who episode since The Creature from the Pit in 1979 (making it the first episode in over 25 years); and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.

It's because nobody knows what the fuck is going on in the world. Even our political elite leaders haven't got a fucking clue. We didn't even arm while nazi Germany armed for five years AT CAPACITY WITH EVERY RESOURCE BEING POURED INTO THE WAR EFFORT (before they even invaded anybody). Our PM came back waving a piece of paper hitler signed saying 'HE WONT INVADE POLAND', that right there shows you how much you can trust politicians. 

And this subreddit is left wing, so they can't see anything wrong at all with immigration. The facts on the ground here in the UK for a working class man is that houses are too expensive to own, petrol prices are ridiculous, cigarettes are ridiculous, they even want to tax our alcohol more. Our cost of living is rising rapidly, which can only be explained by more people being here. More people = more oil needed, more housing needed, and they can reap some costs by raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol as these are 'consumed by scum bags', who are the working class. Posh people don't sit there smoking rocky joints and drinking cider. I don't either any more, but I used to do it all the time lol and I went to a top 5 worst school for GCSE's in the whole of the country for my year group. 

It's actually quite mad if you think about it though, sheep follow the EDL and BNP, if this forum was EDL and BNP I'd question it. Saying nothing bad about immigration and being left wing is what we should question. Take the downvotes mate and leave your comment up, it's worth it.

Half the time a gun is used (not necessarily statistically accurate), it is used as a threat. It doesn't need to be fired to be used. The Doctor did use a gun as an instrument of fear, a heavy handed threat, an exercise of an imbalance of power.

That said, it can be somewhat forgiven, given that the man had just murdered his ""daughter"". That warrants an unprecedented emotional reaction. 

Still, I don't think he should have immediately afterward exalted himself as a man of peace to be aspired to because he pointed a loaded gun at the head of an unarmed, restrained man without firing. Feels like an odd juxtaposition. All the ugly behaviors the Doctor was preaching against were there in the undertones of his actions. A model of restraint, sure, but a model for peace?

Police reported a 96% reduction in acquisitive crime among a group of addict patients. Deaths from locally acquired HIV infection and drug-related overdoses fell to zero. But, under intense pressure from the government, the project was closed down. In its 10 years' work, not one of its patients had died. In the first two years after it was closed, 41 died.""

Benefits claimants cost society far less than leeches like him. If you ever wonder why house prices rise so quickly and why interest rates have been stuck at record low levels for so long, look at scum like him. There are so many like him who took out obscene numbers of mortgages on the basis that house prices would just rise endlessly, these people would have caused complete economic collapse if they had all defaulted after the 2008 crisis, which is the main thing that necessitated such low interest rates. And of course through their huge frenzy purchases people like him fuel housing bubbles in the pursuit of profit, because their greed is more important than peoples lives. 

People are only too happy to blame bankers for causing the collapse but men like this are just ignored because ""it's a business, what do you expect?"" And then he even kicks out hundreds of people, some of which paid their rent on time always and caused no trouble, but that's still not enough to be considered a cunt.

I think the best argument is simply that isn't any of their business. What people choose to put in the own bodies is nobody's business but their own. 

It's kind of like vegetarians demanding the meat products be banned. Yes, there are good arguments in favour of abstaining from meat. However, all but the most hardline accept that forcing people to give up meat is simple wrong-headed. The vast majority would accept that a ban would represent an unacceptable restraint on individual freedom.
 
I argue precisely the same position with drugs. At the end of the day, you personally may not like drugs but nobody is putting a gun to your head and force feeding you drugs. If you don't like them, don't do them!  

If you allow the government to regulate what people can and can not legally consume, you're going to end up on the slippery slope with the bottom being a police state. The evidence that this is happening should be obvious enough to anyone.  

The correct way to do deal with drugs is to treat it as a health issue, as we do with nicotine and alcohol addiction. This is precisely what is done in Portugal, where sure enough drug use rates are lower. 

We desperately need reform in this area of our criminal justice system. Not on the basis of a few weed smokers wanting to get high, but on the basis that it is an unacceptable restraint on individual freedom.

In a nation where you can go from primary school to university without paying a penny until you're earning over £15k, you have to ask what stone has been left unturned for them. I disagree because I think there's a level of personal responsibility. If it's the state's fault they ended up like that, there's no limit to what you can blame on the state.

He does provide this quality as an imact sub - But other players do/would aswell IMO.. Dembele in the Man City match for example. Sandro in the Newcastle match, Lamela in the west Brom match even. Bentaleb has shown an ability to show composure coming off the bench when we have needed it (Vs United for example) and Im sure if a quickening of the tempo was required he could provide that aswell. Im not saying that Holtby doesnt provide this quality, Im saying that he doesnt provide it exclusively.

A) This quality isnt enough to justify his conclusion and

Disclaimer: I am from Furness and would love it to happen.

It is not going to.

Firstly, Windermere is actually closer to the M6 than Barrow is to Coniston (the closest body of water to Barrow) so it would make no economical sense to build a bridge from Barrow to Morecambe for tourists.

Toll everyone? well then they would just take the quicker and cheaper option via the M6. Ok if they wanted to go to the west coast of Cumbria the bridge *might* be quicker. By 5 minutes. So not worth it for the price.

If they want renewables in Morecambe Bay they can test via the existing Viaduct. a new bridge will meet with an unholy amount of resistance for ecological reasons.

so the entire Northwest would not benefit. Barrow would benefit. But that would not justify the cost of a £600m + (cost completely pulled from my head. This is the cost of a 260km electricity cable from UK to NL) bridge. unlike the Denmark-Sweden bridge, it would connect an irrelevant town, with a forgotten town and would be of no great net benefit to the country of England.

I want it to happen. It would be great for Barrow.

Just something a bit different. Rose and Walker act as highly advanced wing backs, with a 3 man defence covered by Sandro. Dawson acts as a destroyer/physical defender right in the centre, almost a sweeper like role who plays SHORT simple passes to Verts/Chiriches who are better with the ball at their feet. Verts is comfortable covering the left side of defence, Vlad on the right. Sandro playing deeper can protect the defence if Chiriches brings the ball out of defence or if Walker/Rose advance higher up the pitch. Capoue would also be good at this as he's decent as a CB. Dembele acts as the ''water carrier'' box to box type, and Eriksen fills the playmaking role. Lamela plays as a support striker/treq type, he's pretty creative. Soldado up top.

He seems to be someone who has taken the time to understand the values, significance and history of the club to the fans. It doesn't seem like a project he's aiming to make a big fast win from - their whole investment strategy seems to be about long term growth and sustainable success. And at the same time it doesn't strike me that owning a football club is just some kind of vanity project for him like it seems to be for the likes of Abramovic or Vincent Tan.

I feel like actually, unlike a lot of clubs in the Premiership right now, we have an owner who not only has good financial backing, but also crucially an understanding of sport, and how to be successful in sport. It's not just about blindly spending ridiculous amounts and hoping things gel. It's about building a youth system, creating an intelligent system for finding and signing upcoming great players at sensible transfer fees, and recognising that spending 4-5 years to patiently build a club that can be right at the top and be successful and grow a fanbase for 10-15 years if not longer is actually the way to do it. 

I don't know how Chelsea and City will cope when their big-bucks owners get bored and decide they don't want to fund the huge wage bills any more, or support the transfer strategy of ""Sure lets spend £50m on a massively out of form striker, it's only money..."", whilst I feel if FSG backed out tomorrow for whatever reason they'd have still left the club in a substantially stronger long-term position than they found it, and operating in a sustainable manner as well. 

He's the owner and the manager of an investments group, so ultimately the motivations for success are always going to be different (if we're successful I don't care if we're making money, so long as we're not horribly losing it), but I feel like the end goals are exactly the same as what the fans want to see long-term, which isn't the case for a lot of Premier League clubs right now.

&gt;

&gt;**Hiraeth** /hɪəraɪ̯θ/ is a Welsh word that has no direct English translation. The University of Wales, Lampeter attempts to define it as homesickness tinged with grief or sadness over the lost or departed. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire for the Wales of the past.

&gt;Hiraeth bears considerable similarities with the Portuguese concept of saudade (a key theme in Fado music), Galician morriña and Romanian dor.

The simple fact that nigh on 50% of the welfare bill is spent on state pensions alone is barely ever mentioned in these bi-monthly 2 minute hate sessions reddit throws.

1) There are somewhere in the region of 6 job-seekers per job vacancy available in the UK

2) That means that it is a **physical impossibility** for every (or even the majority) of job-seekers to land an employment position

3) a large portion of the jobs posted are rubbish, 0 hour contracts/self employed bollocks

4) If we stop the money, these people, who are claiming, *will* find some way to survive.  That means they will *take* what they need from society in the form of crime against, you guessed it, everybody else who is lucky enough to have an income.

er-fucking-go if we stop their money (which is peanuts on the grand scale of things) we will *all suffer* as a society. At the same time it is common knowledge that politicians, bankers, energy suppliers and large corporations will game the system at any given opportunity. Why do we still keep banging on about the unemployed when there is MASSIVE corruption under our very noses?

Friend absolutely loves Swansea, he plays for the american football team and its great for partying and is a well ranked uni. He studies politics. Travel to major UK cities isn't toooo bad but you're in Wales, its a fair way away from London etc. His halls is by the sea so its really nice on good weather days.

Friend at Leeds loves it, studies something to do with Film. Great city, good nightlife and culture. Big big uni.  Good transport links on the whole.

Friend at Essex uni also likes her uni, studies accounting. Transport links are decent, if you go from Colchester to somewhere in essex you're on the end of the tube lines so its easy to get into London :)

UEA is not such a good uni for partying and when I visited, the halls options were awful! New ones have been built since. Its a proper campus uni. Transport links are pants. Its a good uni however. 

As far as what ones are most respected - Exeter first, then (imo) Aberdeen, Leeds and Sheffield about the same, then Swansea and Hull, then UEA, then Essex. No idea about Trinity St. David. 


The further north usually you go with unis, the cheaper the accommodation and suchlike is. Most places in the UK have decent rail links, so travelling isn't too bad. Get a railcard and save a 1/3 off rail fares and book advance fares to save cash. 

Biased opinion as I study there - check out Nottingham Trent Uni! Awesome uni, loads of great facilities, good sports clubs and societies. Big city, plenty of nightlife, lots of culture-y things to do. Travel to London is about 1hr and a half by train. My flatmate studies English and loves it.

true,fieldsofanfieldroad,null,null,"No-one has tried to answer this question thoroughly, so here is my attempt. I however am an idiot and I've had a few drinks, so corrections welcome.

Most people here are correct when they say ""their arse"", but it's a bit more refined than that. No paper is going to print ""Ronaldo to Liverpool"" just because it will sell papers. Therefore anything they print will have a basis in reality (scouts having been seen at a match, previous interest in a player, club's obvious weak areas) even if they are basically just made up. However, a lot of rumours, especially since the birth of twitter, are just rumours. However, there are cases when someone will have an inside line.

Most parties involved (the two clubs, the player and his agent) don't normally want to leak details before a deal is done. *Normally*, the selling club and the player don't want to make the player seem like he's leaving in case he doesn't actually leave (if he stays his relationship with the fans and/or other players could take a hit). *Normally*, the buying club don't want to be seen to be failing to get their targets (see, for example, how it led to negative news for Moyes and Woodward last summer).

What are the circumstances when the someone will leak this information to the media? The agent/player may leak in a couple of scenarios. If they are in negotiations for a better contract with their current club, they may make it known that the player is wanted elsewhere to force the current club's hand. Or, if they want to move, but haven't got a good enough offer or an offer from the club they are targeting, they may leak to force a buying club's hand. A selling club may also do this for the second reason mentioned. They may also do it if they want rid, but the player doesn't want to go as it can make a player unpopular. A buying club may leak information to unsettle a player (especially if they are a much bigger club - e.g. Zidane and co talking about Bale all summer before Madrid eventually signed him). They may also do so to prove to their fans or other players that they are in the market (this happens a lot when clubs bid for big name players, e.g. us for Costa (possibly to as a sign to Suarez) or United for Alcantara (as a sign to their fans)).

The final issue is who first printed the rumour. Obviously this takes more detailed knowledge than I have, but, famously,  Marca is a Madrid mouthpiece, James Pearce has contacts at LFC and EFC and Indiykaila is full of shit.

Given all this you can read some rumours without just taking them at face value. 

**Example 1:**, when rumours leaked of Agger going to Barca you can guess that it was unlikely to come from Liverpool (they had little reason to unsettle him and given they didn't seem to even consider Barcelona's offer, we can't imagine they were trying to force other clubs to bid). It could have been Agger or his agent, but this is unlikely, because if there was a genuine Barcelona offer, then who they trying to target? It is unlikely that they did it to get a better offer from Barcelona, because Barcelona players are reasonably well paid and it is unlikely they did it as part of contract negotiations with Liverpool because [he signed a new contract a year before](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/05/daniel-agger-new-contract-liverpool) and hasn't signed a new one since. Therefore it was likely either bullshit (always a strong possibility) or a leak from Barcelona (as a way to unsettle Agger; see their treatment of Fabregas). My Google skills aren't good enough to find the original source, but that could definitely tell us a bit more.

**Example 2:** Salah. This could be any of the four. You can never discount bullshit. It could be Liverpool - we're a much bigger club than Basel so it could help unsettle Salah. Or it could easily be the agent or Basel (apparently the sticking point is we won't pay more than 8m so either one could be letting other clubs know that a big club is interested. Again, if anyone can find the original source, maybe that could give us a clue.

Anyway, I realise this is a big ramble, but this is my thought process when I see a rumour. I'm sure there are lots of other motives. I hope I've covered some main ones.

You Humans and your linear perspective of time,

Time isn't some linear...line,

it's a big wibbly wobbly ball that is constantly changing but that isn't the end of it.

What year is this? {sticks out tongue} Ah yes the beginning of the year 2014 A.D., great year, the air has just a hint Chamomile,

you're gonna love this year,

the human race finally does away with that silly idea that Moore's law has an endpoint.

According to some physicists at this time and ""string theory"" (an idea that, in my personal opinion is a vast oversimplification of the entirety of creation, you know I really should pay good old Wereny another visit to correct what he misunderstood from my explanation, though I guess I should cut him some slack given we were running in a forest from angry Nazi officials who had just caught on to his ingenious method of sharing his findings on nuclear power with Einstein, too bad they walked straight into a swarm of Vashta Narada )

where was I? Oh yes ""string theory"" says at every singly decision,

(or any and every possibility of every energy arrangement if you like),

creates its own universe in which that decision was made,

for example, if someone were to say come up to a street and turn left, it might create a completely different set of causal events then if they'd turned right.
Except both options, along with innumerable others were selected,

that is both happened because at that instant, a universe was created in which that person turned left
and, one was created in which that same person turned right.

So, Clara calling Gallifrey, and Gallifrey responding by giving me enough energy for me to regenerate again created a new universe,completely distinct from the one we resided in earlier in our time streams,

while this again, is an oversimplification it should give an idea as to how the universe can deal with all those ""paradoxes"" I go about making,

the enormous temporal energy is not in sustaining a logical impossibility so much as keeping us from slipping into the void while transferring to a different causal event matrix.

Boy, I do go on don't I, I usually shorten much of this to time and space being timey wimey.

It’s a much cooler catch phrase don't you think?

true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"No-one thinks the Daily Mail is a con. It's pretty simple: they print anything that they think will sell newspapers. Eye-catching headlines sell newspapers, and particularly sensationalised stories that are carefully tuned to cause outrage, no matter how accurate they are. This actually requires the writers to be quite clever (although possibly immoral).

At the moment, the topical things that can be used to get people riled up are ""im'grants"" and ""scroungers"". So that's what the Daily Mail prints.

Furthermore, the problem isn't that Daily Mail readers are ""right wing loon[s] who hate poor people and immigrants"". The problem is that the strong negative coverage of those classes of people shifts the Overton window in the direction that makes people begin to take ridiculous allegations being made about the impact of ""im'grants"" and ""scroungers"" seriously - usually because they come to think that something that wasn't basically truthful at the core couldn't possibly be getting this much coverage!

Characterising Daily Mail readers as ""right wing loons"" is neither fair nor accurate. Characterising the concerns about the impact of the Daily Mail and tabloid papers as ""disingenuous crap"" is neither fair nor accurate.",0,1389514352,null,0,false,0,cenkbu5,t3_1uytvq,t1_cenkbu5,t1_cendmo3,null,1431907445,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If anything, the dark age of Disney (regarding only its animation department at least) was 77 (Rescuers, which while a decent film wasn't a major success) up until 89 with the release of The Little Mermaid.

The 90s AND the 2000s are filled with several absolutely wonderful and classic Disney films that also made a bunch of money.

I love Disney and I don't understand anytime DIsney gets hated on, I think if I thought REALLY REALLY hard I can count the bad Disney films on both of my hands.
