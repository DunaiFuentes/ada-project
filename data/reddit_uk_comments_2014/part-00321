Its like you didn't even read what I said...

&gt; Not what i said at all. If these tiny mistakes are refined out ie Shurrle tracking his man and Phil Dowd making a correct decision, we walk away with 6points. Tiny errors cost us.

Don't blame the game on the referee, that is whiny and a sorry excuse. We conceded because we let United keep attacking us until we gave them the set piece they needed to score.

Have you ever thought of where these ""tiny errors"" come from? They come from tired players defending for their lives for 30min +. They **will** get tired, and eventually they **will** make a mistake. It is hard to stay 100% alert for 90 min let alone when you are letting an entire team attack you at will. Di Maria had like 20+ opportunities to whip in crosses, eventually one worked.

&gt; Not by drastically altering strategy and playing Guardiola-esque football like you seem to think

1) On a purely visceral level, appealing to the primeval fear of being lost in the forest, unable to find the path while eyes watch you from the darkness was far more effective at sending a shiver down my spine than a shambling mummy or a screeching cyborg. The episode was also visually beautiful.

2) I could watch Capaldi's Doctor interact with Maebh all day.

3) I am fascinated by the way Clara has been gradually going off the rails this series, and there was some great Twelve/Clara interaction in this one.

4) I love the fact that Frank Cottrell Boyce tackled a very difficult conversation about medicating children, despite the inevitable backlash. This is a conversation that western culture badly needs to have, in my opinion.

There's plenty more, but those are the biggies.

To address some of what you've said-- yes, the plot is scientifically ""stupid"". But that hasn't stopped a bunch of other literature and drama dealing with fairies and Earth Spirits from existing and being enjoyable over the centuries. Looking for scientific plausibility in a show where the main character can be aged into a tiny, wrinkled dwarf, only to be restored to youth and vitality when everyone on Earth chants his name at the same time is probably going to be an ultimately frustrating exercise.

Everyone seems to believe that a zoo tiger is some kind of vicious, human-devouring beast. It's not. Points to consider are that this tiger was not cornered, it did not have offspring to protect, and it had almost certainly been fed within the previous 24 hours. Here's a quote from a famous big game hunter named Kenneth Anderson relating specifically to *man-eating* tigers (which this one probably was not):
 
&gt;It is extraordinary how very cautious every man-eater becomes by practice, whether a tiger or panther, and cowardly too. Invariably, it will only attack a solitary person, and that too, after prolonged and painstaking stalking, having assured itself that no other human being is in the immediate vicinity... These animals seem also to possess an astute sixth sense and be able to differentiate between an unarmed human being and an armed man deliberately pursuing them, for in most cases, only when cornered will they venture to attack the latter, while they go out of their way to stalk and attack the unarmed man.

Maybe it's because I used to volunteer for a rescue organization that took in big cats (including tigers), but the only thing that struck me as stupid about that scene was that the Doctor seemed to think they were all in imminent danger of death.

Next: the selfies. I'm admittedly in a different country, but kids here take selfies. Like-- a lot. Who cares?

And finally, the fact that there was no monster to fight-- I like to have these stories interspersed occasionally, because it seems deeply improbable to me that every single situation has a villain that needs to be defeated. 

And it's not true that nothing would have changed if the characters had done nothing. If the Doctor had not facilitated Maebh sending a worldwide message, the authorities would have defoliated more of the trees, possibly dooming the planet. Also, Anabelle would not have heard her sister's plea to come home just at the time when frightening changes in the world were likely making her reassess her decision to be apart from her family. 

To me, this episode was very much about the importance of family and tribe, and the decision not to be alone. (""I don't want to be the last of my kind."")

&gt;

&gt;The third and final episode is set in Egypt and looks to gain insight into the teachings of [St Anthony of the Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great), the [Desert Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Fathers) and the [Hermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit) lifestyle. He visits Coma, the birthplace of Anthony, and the church where he spent 20 years in relative solitude. From there he travels into the desert with a group of [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin) [camel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel) [herders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herder) to trace Anthony's steps to the site where he established the [Monastery of Saint Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_Anthony).

&gt;After a stay with the [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copt) monks at the monastery Peter goes into one of the hermit caves where St Anthony spent his final 43 years. Under the stewardship of an [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian) coptic hermit, Father Lazarus, he is introduced into one of the caves and goes on to spend 21 days there in solitude.

Proof that it's lies, please. In the meantime we should evaluate how much care we can give other people around the world. It's easy to get caught in the trap that we're the only in the country that *could* and therefore that we *must* - but we both know that this country doesn't help everyone who needs help equally around the world, so how do you pick who gets it and - realistically - how much can we afford? 

We should be able to ask that - and should be asking that - without people getting up in arms that we suddenly *want* others to suffer and die. 

&gt; Nobody is saying prioritise it. We're saying that we can find creative solutions or reassess some of our priorities. How much money do we spend on keeping the Saudi's sweet for example? Is that more worthwhile than this?

Good call - now we're getting somewhere - it's starting to feel like we (as a nation) need a thorough shift of how we spend our cash both internally and abroad. I fully agree we should be clamping down on tax avoidance by corporations, bringing errant bankers to justice and putting things right - but this cut back in aid is an extention of that. Untill we're sorted, it should be another option to be considered. 

&gt; I'm not even saying it is solely our responsibility, but we are a part of europe and it is a european problem. People seem very keen to give up on people who have been dealt a shitty card is all. 

Again good points - you've clearly given this some thought. I wouldn't say I'm *keen* to give up on anyone for the record, but to an extent - maybe in my old age - I'm getting rather pesemisstic and tired of people who seem fully intent on fucking up their nations / people / land / country / whatever *and expect others to pick up the pieces*.

Because whatever it is, it somehow always ends up being our problem to put right. We're not the mother or father of 'the world' and haven‚Äôt the resources to be it ‚Äì but we do seem to be expected to play the part. 

Now it could be argued that‚Äôs because the UK is a developed country ‚Äì but as far as our generations of people are concerned ‚Äì we‚Äôre lumped with that legacy as a blessing and a curse.

That could open the door for Andros Townsend, the England international, to leave White Hart Lane, with Southampton still interested in the winger and West Ham United watching his situation carefully.

Pochettino made Rodriguez one of his primary targets after being made head coach at Spurs and wanted to sign him in the summer, despite the 25-year-old‚Äôs cruciate ligament injury. Southampton refused to sell the ¬£15‚Äâ million-rated Rodriguez or Morgan Schneiderlin to Tottenham in the summer window, but that will not stop Pochettino having another go to link up again with Rodriguez.

Southampton have made an incredible start to the Premier League season without Rodriguez, who is aiming to return from injury in mid-November.

Tottenham were interested in signing Danny Welbeck on loan from Manchester United in August, but did not make a permanent bid because of Pochettino‚Äôs desire to try again for Rodriguez. In their opening nine Premier League games, Spurs have scored 11 goals ‚Äì fewer than Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion and Hull City. Rodriguez scored 17 goals for Southampton last season before his injury.

Signing Rodriguez would push Townsend further down the Spurs pecking order after the winger was left out of the match-day squad for the defeat against Newcastle United. Spurs refused to sell Townsend to Southampton once the St Mary‚Äôs club would not do business on Rodriguez or Schneiderlin, but the Saints have maintained their interest.

West Ham United, who will look to offload Matt Jarvis in January, are also admirers of Townsend, who is desperate to play regular first-team football. Despite playing in the Europa League, he has largely been rotated with Aaron Lennon on the substitutes bench for Premier League games.

Pochettino‚Äôs early policy has led to a feeling that there are certain ‚Äòuntouchables‚Äô among his squad who will be guaranteed a Premier League start, no matter how they are performing. Record signing √ârik Lamela scored an incredible goal in the Europa League last week, but his performances have still not been at the top level.

Christian Eriksen has also endured a dip in form, but has retained his place. Striker Harry Kane scored a hat-trick against Asteras Tripolis, but did not start against Newcastle ‚Äì a decision that confused a number of players in Pochettino‚Äôs squad.

Other than juggling between Premier League and Europa League campaigns, the Argentine Pochettino must also be careful of cliques developing in his squad ‚Äì particularly among the Spanish-speaking players. It is understood that Spurs‚Äô South Americans, together with Roberto Soldado, are still speaking Spanish to each other at the club‚Äôs Enfield training ground, despite the club‚Äôs best efforts to improve their English.

Youn√®s Kaboul, the Tottenham captain, repeated a familiar message for the squad to show more mental strength following the 2-1 defeat against Newcastle, in which Spurs threw away the lead by conceding just six seconds into the second half.

‚ÄúWe have to be braver and more focused,‚Äù Kaboul said. ‚ÄúAt this level there is no mercy. If you‚Äôre not focused, brave and ready, you pay the price. We should not concede goals like that. If the opponent scores an unbelievable goal, you can‚Äôt say anything, but from where it started [from the kick-off] and where it ended, it‚Äôs not acceptable. Do we need more character in the squad? Maybe, yes. When you concede a goal straight away coming back on the pitch, you need to reply immediately. You need to send a big sign that we‚Äôre here, and say: ‚ÄòOK, you scored early and we‚Äôre going to reply to you straight away.‚Äô
‚ÄúHave I spoken to the players? It‚Äôs hard in the heat of the moment. Sometimes you can say some wrong stuff. It‚Äôs better that you analyse it first on the video clips and then talk.

‚ÄúWe need to be more consistent and regular and more mature on the pitch. It‚Äôs about knowing how to control the game, kill the game, knowing how to defend all together in certain phases of the game, and for us to be more confident also.‚Äù

Over recent years Levy has demanded that the club challenge for Champions League qualification, but Kaboul hinted that the players had already given up on that goal.

‚ÄúOf course we want to, but the most important thing for us this season is to finish as high as we can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to improve and we work very hard, trust me, and we want to improve at any point.‚Äù",0,1414510660,null,0,false,0,clm77gd,t3_2kipyp,t1_clm77gd,t1_clm6qun,null,1426308654,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Thank you. Neither do I. 

&gt;That said I had another read through the Act myself and it's not quite as clear-cut on the issue as I remember. Setting up an all-white company definitely would be covered under the Act as below:

&gt;&gt; An employer (A) must not discriminate against a person (B)‚Äî
&gt; (a)in the arrangements A makes for deciding to whom to offer &gt; employment;
&gt; (b)as to the terms on which A offers B employment;
&gt; (c)by not offering B employment.

&gt;Having a policy of providing white drivers on demand (and thus denying work to non-white drivers would almost certainly be covered by the above; failing that see below:

&gt;&gt;A person (A) harasses another (B) if‚Äî
&gt;(a)A engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected &gt;characteristic, and
&gt;(b)the conduct has the purpose or effect of‚Äî
&gt;(i)violating B's dignity, or
&gt;(ii)creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive &gt;environment for B.

I'm not so sure about this. Harassment has to be repeated, and doesn't it have to be something like speech or other conduct, rather than discrimination. Anyway, I accept your white taxi company would be unlawful. 

&gt;As for your ""regular client"" example, I think that's a bit of a grey area. On the one hand the client would have engaged in ""unwanted conduct"" as per the above definition, and the employer has a duty to prevent this as below:

&gt;&gt;The circumstances in which A is to be treated as harassing B under &gt;subsection (1) include those where‚Äî
&gt;(a)a third party harasses B in the course of B's employment, and
&gt;(b)A failed to take such steps as would have been reasonably practicable to prevent the third party from doing so.

Oh. That's interesting. But now, the regular may not have said anything at all to the cabbie, just called the office. 

&gt;On the other hand it could be argued that, by complying with the client's wishes, the employer is actually taking ""steps as would have been reasonably practicable to prevent the third party from"" harassing the employee, as they would be avoiding a situation where the driver could be subjected to racist comments from the client. However if multiple regulars make the same request then complying with them all would clearly disadvantage non-white drivers.

Flimsy, but no matter. 

&gt;I would suggest that in order to avoid falling foul of equality law, taxi firms should adopt a policy of ""You get the driver you're given. If you want a white driver, tough, the law says we can't discriminate against our employees. If you have a concern about a specific driver's behaviour, please get in touch and we will investigate and take appropriate action."" I'm a layman though not a law-talking-guy so the above is merely my inexpert interpretation.

Good. I like it. 

I'm a layman too. What can we do but read the law?

&gt;There are a number of guides available that can help with interpreting the law:

Literally everyone was told different things regarding travel expenses, PPE costs, if/when you had to still sign on during the course, etc. Even people attending the same Job Centre were told conflicting information, and it lead to at least one person having to drop out because he couldn't afford to travel ~15 miles every day for 12 weeks.

Since that course, I've been told to sign on fortnightly, then weekly, then fortnightly again, had to change sign on books twice, inconsistently been refunded for certain travel expenses, and been told different information about the threat of Workfare. Even the *layout of the Job Centre itself* has changed since September, with jobseekers just left waiting without being able to inform anyone they're there, which I can only imagine has caused numerous potential sanctions.

Next up they're introducing some electronic touchpad thing to sign on, which I'll sure will work perfectly fine without no massive problems what so ever...

I'm seeing it this way, almost half of the voters saw fit to vote for reunification - less than 1% difference - extrapolate that figure a little - all those polls the BelTel published about only 20% of the population voting yes in a real referendum don't seem realistic all of a sudden - a difference of 30% in QUBs ref vs BelTel poll. I'm not saying there's a possible chance of reunification in any real referendum at the moment, there's not, but there is a much higher want for it in the population that the media lets on - definitely over 20%, which is about what Scotlands ref debate started off as.

In the centre of town, just behind the Mound is a place called the [Whiski Rooms](http://www.whiskirooms.co.uk/whiskytastings.html). They offer custom tastings and have a good restaurant beside them that do decent Scottish food at reasonable prices. 

Alternatively, if you wanted a tour of a distillery as well as tasting, then [Glenkinchie](http://www.discovering-distilleries.com/glenkinchie/) is within 30 mins of town. I see from their website that they offer a shuttle bus which seems a good idea. You can also get the local [113 service bus](http://lothianbuses.com/plan-a-journey/journey-planner) to Pencaitland then a local taxi there which would be much cheaper.  

As to where to drink after, if you stick with the masses (rather than get a tram), you will likely walk through Costorphine and back via Haymarket so you will pass loads of decent and likely very busy pubs. [The Bothy](http://www.thebothyedinburgh.co.uk/contact) is your closest bar on the walk home and usually has an outdoor BBQ on.

Major won the '92 election and Blair made this massive swing right, scrapping [clause 4 of the Labour party constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_IV), in order to capture the vote.

I suspect the peak electrical use times are driven by things like everyone using their ovens at the same time to cook dinner, and everyone watching the same TV shows, and all the offices using computers and lighting at the same time. You can't really tell people they can't use their ovens at dinner time or tell workplaces to use less electricity when their workforce needs computers to work.

I suppose there are some things that can be done - like incentivising turning off items left on standby when not in use, like microwaves and TVs and computer monitors. I don't need a clock shining the time into the kitchen all night when I'm asleep, certainly. Especially not when the oven does it too. And incentives to switch to low energy lighting in offices might be a good idea - perhaps with light level detectors so they turn off in the middle of the day when there's enough sunlight lighting the office. A lot of offices already use movement detectors. My office uses them in meeting rooms (meaning meetings that don't involve much movement end up in the dark every 10 minutes) and toilets (again, woe betide you if you need a longer loo trip than normal) as well as on sites we're building.

Really, the way to reduce demand at this stage is to invest in technology that has better energy efficiency. Low energy lightbulbs was a first step, but lightbulbs never were particularly energy intensive in the first place, not compared to things like TVs, ovens, computers, kettles, microwaves and so on.

You say it is unlikely, but I contend that if it is a criminal offense, it is likely that the prosecution feels that he did indeed hire an accountant to scam his taxes. Not saying he did, but public figures have done worse. We can't just say ""well he's a brilliant footballer and he seems to be a nice guy so it's likely that the accountant did it"". That's what the court process is there for.

If he is found guilty then where do we draw the line? Is it really a moral issue or is it morality in football court (FIFA sanctioned fines)? In which case it clearly isn't about morality but about authority instead.

This video is a classic example is why you're so wrong. Taking a random minute (say 1:00 to 2:00) he references himself DIRECTLY nearly 20 times (with the use of 'me', 'I'm', 'my'). Or we can take the whole thing:

Minute 1 - intro / How HE is not running for mayor.

Minute 2 - Starts good then 'ME' on LBC and how it's ""not about me""

Minute 3 - How I'm not a 9/11 truther, Boris Johnson

Minute 4 - This is actually the only thing of worth here but it's ABOUT Boris

Minute 5 - more on Boris

Minute 6 - Started off well - back to 'ME' again

Minute 7 - More about ME again and how 'silly' it all is

Minute 8 - more on Boris and MY book

Minute 2 - He says he 'spoke to experts' and has re-written them in a way ""in which you can understand without having to go to Eton first"". Either you've never read Noam Chomsky or you're blissfully unaware he's the most referenced human being on earth. The father of modern linguistics is awarded worldwide for his brilliantly simple eloquence. We don't need Brand to re-interpret Chomsky in 30 seconds.

Labour is now the party of immigrants and metropolitan trendies. Immigrants overwhelmingly vote for labour as in many cases, they are the ones that brought them here. If you read Andrew Neather's account of how new labour sent out search parties to trawl for immigrant families to bring here, you'll understand why they are so pro-immigration.

Labour is in a position now where it has to choose between its working class traditional voter base, or the immigrants and metropolitan types that it has relied on since new labour. It will choose the latter, because they are most like the MPs that make up the party. This choice is why labour are so silent on the issue of immigration, and constantly try to change the subject to the cost of living. They don't want to alienate their huge immigrant vote by taking a firm view like UKIP, but they don't want to further alienate their working class vote by openly calling for more immigration. So they stay silent.

The working class labour vote will go to UKIP, which is ironic because Farage's economics is much more Thatcherite than many realize. That being said, Labour are seen as too PC and too soft on immigration. UKIP appeal to the working class because they aren't scared to say enough is enough, and they aren't the types who would cover up the gang rape of white girls by Pakistani gangs in order to avoid being called racist.

&gt; But he's versatile BECAUSE he's played there that's the point

Again, using Azpi as an example. He had to play at left back for the first time at some point(I thought it was at Chelsea but it wasn't, that part was irrelevant) and he isn't versatile because he played at left back, he played at left back because he's versatile.

&gt; wingers and CAMs are often interchangeable, so it's not crazy that Januzaj plays there

In our set-up, yes. When United played with wingers on the other hand was the old fashioned type of wingers, which aren't similar to CAMs at all.

&gt; Ak√© plays more CM now than he does CB so saying he's out of position because he's not playing CB is misleading

Firstly, you obviously don't watch our u21's play if you think he plays more CM now than he does CB. Secondly, we're not talking about now, we're talking about 2 years ago when he made his debut, when nobody knew he could play CDM/CM/LB because he hadn't play there, yet he came on for his debut playing out of position. 

&gt; We've already discussed Solanke and Brown switching off

So let me get this straight, I say that Brown is a striker but is extremely versatile and can play many positions and you come down on me like a ton of bricks because you're only aware of one game at West Brom. Then it's completely acceptable for Solanke to be versatile and play out of position? 

&gt; I didn't say it was a bad idea, but if you're so sure he played so much striker whilst not playing CM at West Brom, why didn't Clarke put him up top? They were losing the game so wouldn't it make sense to add a striker in his natural striking position?

I've already explain but I'l try and make it even easier for you. WBA have one sub left, they chose to bring on an attacking player for a defensive midfielder, now do you put him in the striker position ahead of Shane Long? No, because if you had to put money on one of them scoring it would be Long and Long isn't very creative/doesn't offer much behind the striker. Brown on the hand has played in various positions, including behind the striker(which is where he actually spent most of his time that game, I think it just listed him as a CM because he replaced Mulumbu), he's creative, he can dribble, etc. So would you rather put Long behind Brown and have the worse striker playing striker and the less creative player playing behind the striker?",0,1414520303,null,0,false,0,clmcqa6,t3_2khnur,t1_clmcqa6,t1_clmagka,null,1426306007,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

4) The Silence didn't have anything to do with the Pandorica, and the Doctor *did* know about it, just thought it was a fairytale.

One would think that within a 4-3-3, the widest players would be the wingbacks  However, the way the team has been playing, it appears to look a lot more like a 4-5-1 with the widest players being Coutinho/Lallana and Sterling, all of these players play much better closer to the middle of the pitch. Additionally, there is no one in the squad positioned to connect the midfield to the lone striker, all they can really do is bring the ball very wide and its difficult to penetrate the 18.

At least, if Rodgers insists on playing a lone striker, put one of the central midfielders in more of an attacking role (a prime example of this was the Gerrard-Torres days, could just as easily work with Coutinho-Balotelli or Coutinho-Sturridge with Sterling and Lallana giving him support). On paper, this formation appears to be a 4-2-3-1.

Playing a 4-(1-2-1)-2, the way Rodgers has executed it over the years this formation plays a lot like a 5-3-2 or 4-3-1-2 where the widest players on the pitch are the fullbacks, Johnson/Manquillo and Enrique/Moreno. What this formation does as you go up the pitch is that it converges towards the middle of the pitch, not away from the pitch as the ball moves forward. Not only can you continue to play the ball wide as you see the RM/RWB and LM/LWB playing together, but you also have a good connection between the midfield and the strikers. This is because the midfielders are playing more central and also that you have a proper CAM behind the strikers.

Anyone with the right chemistry degree could. There are tens of thousands of chemists out there needing the work. The process could be then handed on to those without the knowledge.

Not being completely on top of the latest nuance in medical research is quite different from being anti-science as some seem to be claiming with her.

false,JackWilfred,null,null,"Hello. I just want to explain to you what the MHoC and the Model Liberal Democrats are.

The MHoC (Model House of Commons) are a collective of many politically aware people who want to project their views and ideas onto a hypothetical UK. It works almost the same as the real House of Commons, MPs are elected, Governments are formed, and debates are fought.

The Model Liberal Democrats were previously in the last Government coalition, with the Labour Party, and although being the minor party, were the strongest speakers for the people. By voting Liberal Democrat you will be pushing forward a fair and open society for all, with a strong economy and strong education and healthcare systems.

In the previous Government I was the Secretary of State for Innovation &amp; Skills, in which I made sure higher education was ensuring young people going into work achieved their potential, and helped small businesses attract vital foreign investment.

[**Read our Manifesto here.**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mVpgdhKbwMoI0uM6UjyF50ZBgJ3Gaz0oeJv4qmICwb8/present#slide=id.p)

Thank you for reading, and I'll hope you make the smart choice in voting Liberal Democrat. Feel free to ask me any questions on the policies we have suggested.

**JackWilfred MP**

**Secretary of State for Innovation &amp; Skills**

**Parliamentary Candidate for North West England**

The day is very light and pleasant to use from what I can remember and did make a difference to my skin. Enough for apres ski? Maybe not. The tub version is richer and almost greasy but in a silky way in the amounts I use (heavy handed), better for night than day.

CeraVe PM is also very light to the point I prefer it for day. Alternatives with ceramides and other skin friendly lipids include NSPA night repair cream (two for ¬£8 in Asda now) or Boots No.7 Beautiful Skin night cream for very dry skin (pricey unless you have a ¬£5 No.7 voucher). If your sister is 'girly' the NSPA is pale peach and smells lovely (neroli): a major benefit for travelling is that it does not move when you tip the jar (balm like texture but not greasy).

Another option that comes to mind is the Weleda Baby calendula face cream or possibly the calendula weather protection cream - both have lanolin which is awesome for slightly sun/ wind burned skin

I have used the calendula face cream and it is a little greasy so I have been know to mix it with aloe gel, but it works well and is gentle enough for use on irritated skin (after microneedling). The weather protection version is presumably more occlusive, but IIRC was recommended by crazy YouTuber Mattie Roberts for skiing.

New trains get bought by the government on behalf of the train company.

- Encouraging the public ownership and operation of public transport, preventing fares from rising above inflation, integrating fares for rail, bus and tram services, expanding north-south rail services, and limiting inter-city flights where travel by rail is a possibility.

- Committing to reducing military spending by ¬£5 billion year on year, withdrawing British forces in Germany, assisting charities set up to help return military personnel to civilian life, ensuring that personnel made redundant will be found alternative employment, and scrapping Trident.

- Utilising the National Drugs Board to aid in the decriminalisation and potential legalisation of currently prohibited substances.
Establishing a cross-party board to manage the devolution of powers to regional assemblies, devolved parliaments, and greater powers for councils.

- Ending the bedroom tax, introduce a living wage certificate, reverse NHS privatisation and prohibit PFIs whilst still reforming the system to adequately cope with the aging population, help people on benefits get back to work via a work program, and strengthen the cradle to grave ethos of the welfare state.

The MHoC (Model House of Commons) are a collective of many politically aware people who want to project their views and ideas onto a hypothetical UK. It works almost the same as the real House of Commons, MPs are elected, Governments are formed, and debates are fought.

The Model Liberal Democrats were previously in the last Government coalition, with the Labour Party, and although being the minor party, were the strongest speakers for the people. By voting Liberal Democrat you will be pushing forward a fair and open society for all, with a strong economy and strong education and healthcare systems.

In the previous Government I was the Secretary of State for Innovation &amp; Skills, in which I made sure higher education was ensuring young people going into work achieved their potential, and helped small businesses attract vital foreign investment.

[**Read our Manifesto here.**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mVpgdhKbwMoI0uM6UjyF50ZBgJ3Gaz0oeJv4qmICwb8/present#slide=id.p)

Your chemistry skills are likely better than your question reading skills - look again, you will doubtless know the answer if only you read the bladdy question first! Then give me a) the correct answer to the actual question; and b) identify which of your answers to the wrong question was wrong, and why.

So, I had a think about it, wrote a comment, deleted it, did a bit of digging and I'll put it like this... 

¬£10 billion as a proportion of UK GDP really isn't much. A deficit of ¬£25 billion still isn't much. 

If you look at either graphic, it's only really 2008 and beyond where the deficit becomes a concern. 

[This image shows the deficit as a proportion of GDP] (http://i.imgur.com/krhif4B.png) (it's from page 7 of the [December 2013 EFO](http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/Economic-and-fiscal-outlook-December-2013.pdf)). That shows the deficit in context of GDP and even at its highest (2009-10, the longest bar in the graphic in the OP), the deficit is around 11 per cent of GDP. 

In most years, the deficit is manageable, which is why up until around 2009, the UK's debt-to-GDP was at a manageable level.

Edit: I've done a bit more digging and I've found [the data for the period 2003-4 to 2009-10](http://i.imgur.com/selLq1G.png) (from [page 86 of the June 2010 Budget Forecast](http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/budget-2010/)) (which is as far back as the OBR covers from what I can tell).

false,drogbafan,null,null,"Schurrle, IMO, is an impact sub. He is great against tired legs, but starting a game requires one to be committed to linking up and creating attacking movements; something that Schurrle just isn't capable of doing. His playing style is too direct.

Salah looked good overall, but cutting in on his left foot is not a good idea. Great assist.

Mikel, ""the human full-time whistle"", has no business starting a game in which we are actually looking to score.

After having watched Mikel for years now, I don't believe anyone ruined his attacking ability or flair.

He just doesn't want to pass it forward. No matter how defensive a coach wants you to play, he will not forbid you to pass the ball forward. Mikel just doesn't like passing the ball forward. Not good enough for a side like ours.


All in all, tough game. Glad we're through.

- The bottom part is totally different, @ Bristol all the office buildings the casino, School and Collage all make it so different. Its amazing to think that was all rail way but you can still see some of the tracks around there today.

- The NCP is missing from Park Row along with Academy and that makes a big difference to that landscape.

- The Hatchet has building all around it. I all ways thought it stood on its own.

- Look at all the parking space on every road.

- The fountains in the water outside collage green buildings are missing.

- Bristol grammar school (behind the museum) should not have gotten rid of that big sports field.

false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Lamela could definitely play wider, but I don't know that it's his fault.  He's not a traditional winger... he's always been a more central player than that.  If the club wanted to buy an exciting young winger, they should've bought Griezmann or Draxler with the Lamela money.

I'd say there are more problems with playing Lamela/Eriksen/Chadli/Adebayor all together.  Those four do not link up that well.  Like the article says, we all saw how sharp Soldado looked last weekend against the champions, and then he gets inexplicably dropped when playing a much weaker side.  Adebayor is tactically hopeless, and Chadli offers nothing by way of creativity.

Lamela and Eriksen both need to play with players capable of stretching the play in order to give them space to create, and neither Ade nor Chadli do that.  Even when Lennon came on, it was at the expense of Lamela.  That was a mistake... Chadli should've come off so Lennon could create spaces for Lamela.

The sad thing at the moment is that there are some gallingly obvious flaws in our side that no one seemed to notice in the off-season.  Why did we not buy a decent winger?  Why did we let Siggy and Holtby go with no replacements brought in?  Why are Lennon and Townsend still in the squad if Poch never has any intention of using them?  But even beyond simple squad members, the way Poch is using our players is not working, and yet it seems everyone but him can see it.

A one two on the edge of the box with Ade would open up and get in behind a lot of defences with ease because of his pace and strength. Mason can do this as he has enough energy to do so too. Both can make untracked runs from deep. 

Also the Lamela point is so spot on. For now I think we should stick with an orthodox winger staying wide and hitting the byline. Particularly on the right whilst Walker is out. Even though Lennon's crossing isn't fantastic; if he hugs the touchline like he used to, knocking it past the full back on the half turn receiving the ball and darting to the byline whipping or drilling a cross after getting behind the opposition's defence, Ade and a drifting Chadli + Eriksen can have opportunities to score.

People blame Lamela for hogging central spaces, but he needs to play with someone who can truly stretch the play to open up room for him in the middle of the pitch... Lamela is not and will never be a proper winger.

Chadli doesn't do that.  He occupies the same central spaces, but doesn't have the pace, skill, speed of thought or creativity to make an impact there.  He can't beat players, is too slow to burst into spaces, and isn't a creative passer.  He's a terrific option to have in the squad and knows the way to goal, but he's not starting XI quality for me.

We run a shuttle bus 3 times a day (2 on Sunday) from the city centre to the distillery and back. The journey is about 30 minutes. For your return transport, 40ish minute tour and a taste of 2 whiskies is ¬£20. you can try 4 for ¬£24! Public transport plus taxis from pentcaitland are a bit of a joke, their charging about a tenner each way, but captive market, eh? Might be a little cheaper if you've got 4 or 5 in your group... Other option is a nice 45 minute walk after the public bus, but that's pretty weather dependent. Feeling brave for February?!

Good whisky pubs in Edinburgh? There's the Kilderkin down in cannongate, Bow bar on Victoria Street, the black cat on rose Street (expensive...) and tuectues in the West end that all spring to mind. Also someone mentioned jolly topper's tasting - well worth it if there's one on when your here. Normally every other Thursday.

No idea on cards.  I wouldn't expect the same degree of interest from Newcastle, so probably not too many.

I think Yaya might make an appearance off the bench.  As shit as he's been, this isn't really that unusual for him.  Sure he'd scored a few belters by this time last year, but even during good years he's actually quite shit *most* of the time.

Borini has had less minutes than Balotelli, so don't try and use twisted stats by saying he's had more games. Also, the games he has played I personally think he's been better than Balo.

The main reason he deserves a swap is because Balo has missed so many good chances that most other strikers would have tucked away. There was 3 clear ones against Hull that could have gave us the 3 points if he put one away.

If small things make your quality of life improve for a tiny extra cost then its' well worth it imo. Things like spending ¬£30 on a decent cooks knife, etc.  Bit of a rant, sorry. I think it's because I grew up in a house where 'being frugal' meant not really ever throwing things out, and never replacing anything. Parents are still using the same dishes and plates for 30 years and it looks awful. Sure, it still works, but the value you may have extracted over the past, say 10  years, out of having nice looking plates would exceed the ¬£20 to replace it. Spending money on yourself isn't always a bad thing or 'wasteful'!

I hate to sound like a hipster but I've always found that Doctor Who was better before it was ""cool"". The writers must know how big the show is now, and are trying to make it strike a chord with people all across the world, but the world is a big place. And to be honest a lot of the recent episodes seem to be pandering to the ""fan-girls"" who threatened to stop watching when old-timer Capaldi stepped into The TARDIS. ""Look, Doctor Who is still cutesy!"" The difference I've found is that I could understand a Doctor Who episode when I was 10 years, but now I'll watch a recent episode and be totally lost. It's like they're trying to be too ""Hollywood"" and it loses all of the reality and down-to-earthness that RTD was famous for. RTD seemed to have a better grasp on his audience - he certainly wasn't as divisive as Moffat - for example, Moffat has always said in interviews that he writes what HE would want to see in Who and hopes other people enjoy it, and that's fine to an extent. However in RTD's book he talks about having a whole storyline planned out that he scrapped because he thought little kids wouldn't get it. But it still worked for the whole family!

*It's PC gone mad!*

Just kidding. 

Anyway I think there's a few things going on. It depends on your intent. 

You have to think about why someone might want to ""black up."" Are they mocking black people (e.g. blackface)? Are they generalising about black people because of their skin colour (e.g. fancy dress as a ""gangster"" or something)? Or are they literally just trying to look like a black person for some benign reason (e.g. it's your black friend's birthday and everyone is dressing up as him for a party)?

In the latter case I don't really see the problem, but it's hard to understand someone's intentions from the outside. Easier to just ban ""blacking up"" and save everyone the embarrassment and hurt caused. No one's really missing out because there are very few legitimate reasons to black up. 

Something like wearing a kimono is a bit different. Are you wearing a kimono because you think they're fashionable and look nice? Or are you wearing it because you're having an East-Asian themed party and are stereotyping? In most cases it's the former, so there's no real need to ban them. 

That's what I think, anyway. It's the intent that's right or wrong, not the actual act of blacking up. ",0,1414536999,null,0,false,0,clmmiib,t3_2klhrv,t1_clmmiib,t1_clmlav9,null,1426301431,9,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,9

Lots of our players like to play aggressively, and in general our team doesn't have the kind of ball retention to play that possession game. With the energy of players like Hendo/Suarez, and the pace of Sterling/Sturridge it made sense to play a quicker game.

Balo is not as quick and is used to a different style, and remember is moments of brilliance come from the squad that surrounds him. When he was at City he had the likes of Tevez/Aguero/Yaya/Dzeko feeding him the ball. With us having Sturridge out we basically lack that extra bit of attacking quality (this is not an attack on Sterling/Coutinho, as they usually try and feed the ball to the strikers) with one up front it is so hard if you don't play that way or its hard to adapt. Reason I say this, I play striker for my uni and when I started I was positioned upfront alone, fuck it was so tricky to get a goal if any as I don't really like heading the ball from crosses and I'm not the fastest player, prefer it fed to my feet with a striker alongside next to me...I'm drifting off a bit but I feel so bad for Balo because the pressure builds up game after game of not getting a goal but playing upfront alone when you work so much better with a second striker is frustrating to say the least. LFC's style of attacking play will look normal again when sturridge is back, remember when Owen and Fowler got injured so many games were a struggle but usually the midfield would get a goal or we would finish 0-0.
 
TL;DR
2 up front makes a huge difference in the final third and results in more goals for balo/sturridge,1 up front just isn't enough. Even when sturridge isn't available 2 upfront will make the attacking play come back, such a small thing as positioning can change a game entirely.

On her return she walked straight past her desk without even acknowledging I was still there and went to speak to her manager.

How is that not at least a written warning?

&gt;

&gt;In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), firearms are tightly controlled by law, though shooting organisations provide opposition to this legislation.    These laws are much less restrictive in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. In 2012 the British Shooting Sports Council believed that the law needed to be consolidated, but did not call for a review. 

&gt;The United Kingdom has one of the lowest rates of [gun homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_crime#Homicide) in the world.  There were 0.04 recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. Gun homicides accounted for 2.4% of all homicides in the year 2009. 

&gt;With the exception of [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), it has been public policy that [police officers in the United Kingdom should not generally be armed with firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_use_of_firearms_in_the_United_Kingdom).    Shooting fatalities of members of the police are extremely rare; there were three in England and Wales in the eleven-year period from 2000/01 to 2010/11.  About 7,000 police officers have received firearms training.   Standard police firearms include [semi-automatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle) [carbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbine), and [pistols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol), such as the [Heckler &amp; Koch G36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G36), [Heckler &amp; Koch¬†MP5SF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MP5#Semi-auto_only_variants), and [Glock¬†17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock_17).

From this article, [""Finding the Flavor of Chocolate""](http://news.psu.edu/story/140591/2000/09/01/research/finding-flavor-chocolate),
&gt; Butyric acid comes from the milk fats in the chocolate. In a process called lipolysis, the fatty acids in the milk decompose, resulting in a rancid, or ""goaty"" taste. Hershey's purposefully puts their chocolate through controlled lipolysis, giving it that unique flavor. Because of this, most Europeans don't like Hershey's chocolate‚Äîbut Americans do.

And what can we [learn about butyric acid](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-butyric-acid.htm)?
&gt; It tends to have a somewhat rancid smell when isolated, and is the primary cause of the foul smell associated with human vomit and flatulence. It is a common addition to stink bombs for this reason.

Vastra is saying this because she feels that Clara is being irrational and acting like she doesn't really know the Doctor because she is acting like the man in front of her isn't the Doctor.  Vastra treats her like a stranger because she isn't acting like she is a true friend of the Doctor.  

&gt; This would also tie in to the Doctor wanting to find Gallifrey this season, as Gallifrey still is in the painting in UNITs storage (I think).

Gallifrey is not inside a painting.  It is sealed in a parallel pocket universe.  

&gt; Missy had a white iPad, well in the trailer for the finale Kate Stewart has a black iPad,

I think it's a bit of a stretch to assume a connection between them based on them both having iPads.  

&gt; Missy could've easily replaced the impossible-girl-Clara before they crashed in the dinosaur in London, because the Doctor was forgetting everything all the time then.

The simple reality is that the police did not care one iota about child abuse until it was forced upon them via public pressure over the past ten years.

Defoe is 40.8 times more cost efficient than Soldado, so far. Soldado is, so far, a bigger flop than Keane at Liverpool (¬£4m per goal) and Torres at Chelsea (¬£2,500,000 per goal so far).

However, our most cost effective player ever was Bale who made us a profit of ¬£1,864,000 per goal. It would take only 2.3 goals from Bale to compensate for Soldado's cost efficiency and bring it to ¬£0 per goal.

Other modern Spurs players' prices per goal include:

Pavlyuchenko: ¬£471,430

Aaron Lennon: ¬£38,460 so far
Robbie Keane: ¬£5,400

Interestingly, Darren Bent broke exactly even with ¬£0 per goal.

Listener figures are always pretty low - with the internet being a thing the 'Golden age', so to speak, of Student Radio is long past, but it's never really been the aim of student radio to actually be popular. Instead it's more about the experience, getting involved and giving people a chance to do something they'd never otherwise even think of. 

For comparison, about four years ago a poll was conducted by LUSU regarding listener figures, BFM was only beaten by Radio 1 amoung students living on campus based on absolute numbers, and even then only just. The problem was students just don't listen to the radio as much anymore, regardless of which station - about 70%, IIRC, of students surveyed didn't listen to the radio at all. 

Most shows just have the hosts friends listen in, which is a shame as a lot of the shows themselves are well done and put in a huge amount of effort, the problem is consistency - it's hard to keep listeners when one show is interesting and well planned but then the following show amounts to two people pissing about on air. 

All that being said, it's very popular at Roses, even for non-students, as BFM pumps the broadcast range up to cover the whole of the Bay area and loads of locals listen in. 

Ended up a bit of a ramble, but I'd advise listening and trying it out - it's great fun. ",0,1414547912,null,0,false,0,clmska9,t3_2km7uh,t1_clmska9,t3_2km7uh,null,1426298598,6,false,lancasteruni,t5_2swbr,6

I currently have a minimal-thrills routine that works wonders for me: 

1. Cleanse with honey

2. Oil cleanse with emu oil + microfiber cloth

3. Biologique Recherche's P50V 1970 toner

4. BHA/AHA exfoliation every few days

5. Spot-treat with Bentonite clay masks mixed with apple cider vinegar and water.

I have a sensitivity to Propylene Glycol - amongst other common additives - which makes product searches a challenge. Still, I manage!

And, Im a huge fan of holistic beauty and health. After getting my PCOS diagnosis at 18, I revamped my diet and lifestyle to manage/mitigate symptoms, including acne, hirsutism, and a propensity towards weight gain. In my mid-20s, I began to take it *super* seriously, and now, at 29 and a half (ish), I feel like I have the original issues under control. Finally!

I have a handful of interests/hobbies that don't really relate to my current profession as an artist/designer, but my most relevant is an interest in the link between skin, diet and nutrition.

Its great to meet you all!!!

Enough with the personal attacks. Keep /r/unitedkingdom civil please. Don't let it become a cesspit like /r/ukpolitics.

&gt;Why are you assisting in the cover up of state-sanctioned child abuse in our care system? Why are you not calling for justice there instead of focusing on one very specific and statistically small avenue of child abuse? 

He's commenting on this particular story, about the sexual abuse of young girls in Rotherham by mostly Pakistani men. He's commenting about this case in the comments section an article about this case. It's not rocket science.  What's wrong with focusing solely on the exploitation of 1400 young girls in Rotherham in the comments section of an article about Rotherham? You're not actually responding to the statistics posted by the original commentator and are instead (bizarrely) accusing him of not caring about child abuse because he posted about Rotherham.

&gt; Shouldn't MPs and high ranking civil servants also face your scrutiny following them treating children's homes like sweet shops? How about MI5 who operated child abuse rings to gain dirt to blackmail people?

How do these stories of yours make Rotherham any less important? How do you know the guy (or girl) you're responding *hasn't* commented on other child abusers and scandals elswhere?  How does the existence of these other stories make the statistics the original commenter posted (which are actually relevant to the article) invalid?

&gt;The simple reality is that the police did not care one iota about child abuse until it was forced upon them via public pressure over the past ten years. How else do you think paedophiles like Sir Jimmy Savile (OBE, KCSG) were able to personally claim over 1,000 victims in plain sight with no scrutiny? 

This still has nothing to do with the comment you're replying to. The police and local government didn't care about the Rotherham victims because of the race of the perpetrators.

&gt;Dozens of victims reported him for it. Was that ""multi culturalism""? Was that ""enrichment""?

Now you're putting words in his mouth. Do you deny that a disproportionate amount of asian men were involved in sexual abuse against almost entirely white girls?

I'm not sure what these issues are or how you'd address them.

Free movement? Founding principle of the EU, been that way for decades. There's no way we'll ever get rid of it. The influx of migrants will slow if the UK becomes less attractive, or as East develops more, though.

Unnecessary bureaucracy? What, Strasbourg? Somehow I doubt this is really what the British public are worried about. Sure, the EU is bureaucratic. But I can't see that changing much. It's actually a quite efficient bureaucracy for what it's worth.

Meddling with internal national politics... how?

It was basically ""might as well just sit back while you watch life go by in your already established bubble and try to find something vaguely interesting, because literally nothing short of epic space adventures will be exciting.""   That little speech made me hate Danny so much.

That's like...the antithesis of every single Doctor Who episode I've ever seen.   It's always been about never standing still, about actually exploring the world around you even if you can't go much farther than your planet and reveling in how cool it all is while figuring out how it works.

Because she was introduced in WAY the wrong way(""impossible girl"" thing, as you noted), and even as she's gained something resembling character and personality this season she's been continuing to act in the ""super-companion"" role:

She's expected to make the right decision in Kill The Moon and somehow does despite it making no sense; she gets to fuck with the Doctor's timeline again in Listen; she somehow magically knows how to fiddle with Dalek memory systems in Into the Dalek; she's shown to have an abnormally high capacity to use the Sonic; she gets to mentally interface and fly the TARDIS better than the Doctor usually does.

These are all fine things for a companion to do, but this is in the span of one season after she spent all of last season-proper being a living McGuffin that inserts herself into thousands of points in the Doctor's life to save him.   It's just too much, and it's annoying.  

I agree, the character flaws we've seen in some episodes lately are actually really interesting(love the idea that she addicted to being in the TARDIS), but it's all too little too late for me.

All this said, if the finale delivers what it's seeming to promise, then I'll be more than willing to reconsider these issues.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/22/ukcrime.race

&gt; The data, released under Freedom of Information legislation, shows that between 1995 and 2004 there have been 58 murders where the police consider a racial element played a key part. Out of these, 24 have been where the murder victim was white.

...

&gt; Fahy also warned of caution in over-interpreting the figures. He said that the 24 white victims also included those who were Jewish, 'dark-skinned' Europeans or gypsies. In addition, seven of those were killed by white attackers, four by black, six by Asian, with seven whose racial background was not identified.

&gt; Police have suggested that some white-on-white killings may be a result of attacks between Scots, English, Irish and Welsh people.

&gt; Overall, there have been 10 black victims and 16 Asian victims. Of the 58 race murders, 18 have been where a white attacker has killed a black or Asian individual and another 14 where one member of a minority group has murdered another for racial reasons.

So while crimes against white people comprised almost half of the attacks, white people were responsible for just as many (well, slightly more). Once distinguish between white domestic and white foreign, to say that white people are overwhelmingly the victims of interracial crime becomes a lot less meaningful, as ""white on white"" crime may still be contributing to that statistic.

At the end of the day though, the point is that racism sucks, regardless of who it's directed at.",0,1414562868,null,0,false,0,clmz2g2,t3_2klth3,t1_clmz2g2,t1_clmxfvv,null,1426295493,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
