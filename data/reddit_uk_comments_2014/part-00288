Getting a mobile phone plan is very straight forward. You can buy pay as you go sims at nearly any supermarket for about £1. As for monthly plans you'll have to have an address for 3 years but if you go to car phone warehouse they will usually make something up for you as they make their profits from selling you phones. Another solution might be you company willing to get you a line. Prices are pretty reasonable as well, especially compared to what I heard about the states!

I'd wager that (as one poster above already said), Migs crouches low to get additional spring for lateral movement.

Honestly, the same thing for Howard too. You need to bounce a little if you're preparing for an explosive leap. He just got his timing slightly wrong. And that could just be down to him not being sure who was going to take the kick - Gerrard or Mario.

At the highest level (in any sport), athletes don't come out of a cookie-cutter mould. They all have little idiosyncracies. No 2 goalies will do exactly the same thing. Overanalysis with fancy slow motion can tell you whatever you want to believe. It can make a slight touch look like a cast-iron pen.

I would be really worried only if Migs started taking this to heart and second-guessed himself in future.

I did some serious Googling and put all the percentages on the Wiki entry where I could find them.  Don't think I ended up listing Indeed Labs, I didn't feel the ingredients list represented good value for money. 

La Roche Posay is a tad misleading, the claimed 0.3% is only 0.1% pure retinol (true vitamin A), the other 0.2% is a much less potent retinyl ester.

Bear in mind if you diluted Peter Thomas Roth to **0.15%** you would get **300ml end product for £40** plus the cost of your base lotion or oil. That is a higher percentage of pure retinol than all Paula's Choice products except the 1% Clinical (£50 for 30ml), and likely more active than the La Roche Posay retinol/ retinyl combo product (£20 for 30ml). If you diluted PTR to **0.5%** you would get **90ml end product for £40** plus your base.

The only other option is Environ, they are consultation only and it's tough to get prices or percentages (I found IU but that mathematic conversion is beyond me). It is a line from a very well known cosmetic derm/ plastic surgeon tho: arguably the father of microneedling.

**ETA** Sorry if the text is too hardcore science-y, the mods are aware it needs to be more readable. Hopefully you can understand enough or at least find the selected products useful.

This not the answer you are looking for.

This isn't helped by the fact that questions have a limited lifespan before they pass into academic folklore (the airplane on a conveyer belt being one of those: http://blog.xkcd.com/2008/09/09/the-goddamn-airplane-on-the-goddamn-treadmill/). So interviewers jealously guard their questions, as otherwise they would quickly become obsolete. I'm sure there's plenty of resources with hard questions (Olympiad Physics / Chemistry papers?

If you are spending a lot of money on a nice dinner or cocktails, then having a friendly, attentive waitress or bartender literally changes your entire night from good to amazing, while having a shitty one will ruin it entirely.

&gt; (1) It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom and shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the purposes of this section in accordance with Schedule 1.

&gt; (2) But if the wish expressed by a majority in such a poll is that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament such proposals to give effect to that wish as may be agreed between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Ireland.

Some observations:

* There is no provision for Irish people to have a vote in the Northern Irish referendum held by the British govt, as that only requires a majority of the population of NI. 
* The agreement does *not* contain a matching provision for Irish law, and I'm not aware of one which commits them to a particular protocol in this event. This means they could hold their own referendum on accepting the North, or let it in with just a parliamentary vote, or simply outright refuse. The wording of the law suggests the UK govt has no obligations to honour a reunification vote if there is no agreement with the Irish govt to take on NI. 
* There is no provision for a referendum on any constitutional question other than reunification - so, for example, a vote for independence does not have the same backing in law.

I'm not suggesting *they* were driving recklessly at all. 

The BMW Z4 is a rear-wheel drive car. Without traction control a RWD car will be very capable of doughnuts or drifting round corners. However, your boyfriend may not be all that capable. 

I reckon he's tried to light up the rear wheels and driven into something and blamed it on the car-park. 

The car-park guys would not let the car go without a walk-round to protect themselves from fraudulent claims. They record the state of the vehicle on arrival and before departure, otherwise you could turn up with some damage already on the car and blame it on the service.

Also, as human beings, we are very protective of our stuff, especially stuff we've entrusted to others. 

If you lend someone a CD, when you get it back you check for scratches. When you lend someone a book, when you get it back you check for dog-ears. 

When you leave your car in the care of a company, you most definitely check it out for dings and scratches. You'd *certainly* notice the front-end caved in and smashed head-lights. 

Ask your boyfriend what really happened, imply that the car-park are sending you evidence of the actual state of the car. I should imagine he'd confess pretty quickly. ",0,1412028346,null,0,false,0,ckvyi6y,t3_2hsibj,t1_ckvyi6y,t1_ckvxrmw,null,1426763167,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

The reasonable way to go about things would have been to come clean to the Doctor about her suspicions of the identities of Rupert and Orson; to insist the the Doctor meet Danny and allow him to see the TARDIS as soon as she decided that they were going to have more than a casual date or two; and to cut one or the other of them loose if it became obvious that either of them were completely unwilling to accept the realities of her dual life.

See answer above.  Don't let that that stop you though.

&gt;Most of the really crap parents who didn't plan for it got into the mess by not practicing safe sex, thinking they can pull out in time instead of using a condom, or otherwise making poor decisions.

&gt;__Article 2 and Article 3 of the Constitution of Ireland__ (*[Bunreacht na hÉireann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland)*) were adopted with the constitution as a whole on 29 December 1937, but completely revised by means of the [Nineteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland) which took effect on 2 December 1999.  As amended they grant the right to be ""part of the Irish Nation"" to all of those born on the island of Ireland and express a desire for the peaceful political unification of the island subject to the consent of the people of [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). Before 1999, Articles 2 and 3 made the claim that the whole island formed one ""national territory"".

His problem is that he wants to build public image,  and the best way he can think to do that is by getting the Right and Left to compramise. Problem is that with the way the Congressional election system in the US works (look up the Primary System), it encourages each party to pick the most extreme candidates,  hence the recent crop of presidential candidates that are religious nuts on the right and damn commies on the left. The same thing happens in Congress,  less so for the 6 - year term Senate, but triply so for the 2-year term House. Those guys are always in campaign mode,  and often even a hint of compramise is panned as high treason and almost guarantees an incumbent will loose an election. So basically Obama is trying to move the Himilayas by poking then with a stick. Now he could poke it with the sharp end, which is the fact that if he wanted to Obama could basically stop the government from spending on *anything*; Congress only controls the budget,  but the Secretary of the Treasury is the one who actually pays the bills,  and the office shares a close relationship with the President. Doing so however takes balls of depleted  reinforced with ceramics, because you are going to piss off everyone. It's not as much that Obama won't table action,  but that he can't without being denounced by every side. I would say that anyone who runs for President in the US is not totally spineless. Making that decision exposes you and your family to obscene amounts of abuse. Your wife will get booed by her family. Your kids will be attacked at school. Every pay off your background will be dug up and used against you. Your family will even recieve death threats. Maybe for the rest of their lives. Even running takes a lot of balls, not to mention holding the position for four or even eight years. I may not always agree with the President. But simply because of how much shit you have to go through to get there,  I damn well have respect for the President. And most other world leaders too for that matter.

They don't, already. The council here has welcomed ""affordable housing"" with open arms, allowing developers to shit out their identikit shoeboxes all over the place.

They still aren't affordable, they aren't good houses, and since they are ""affordable housing"" they are automatically exempt from many levies and infrastructure improvements - one of them being an education levy aimed at improving schools. The school in my village is full, and can't expand (short of builidng on the playground) because the council let a developer build around it. We are taxing children around to other schools at great expense. They are now full too.

The sewers here are overwhelmed when it rains a bit, the roads are chock a block (a lorry every minute, apparently), it's a mess. The parish council have had enough and are exploring their options to block further building.

We absolutely need more houses, but they have to be built with the local area in mind. Building on edges of existing villages with minimal or no improvement to local infrastructure is not the way to go. And we certainly need to end the practice of making sure the poor, destitute property developers aren't given absolute priority over everyone else and their every whim catered for.

Rumours have it that Joe kicked up a stink back in Mancini's last season and demanded to be played in the FA Cup final against Wigan in 2013. This was after Pantilimon had played every single fixture in the FA Cup, and was expected to start in the final. Joe started the game.

I've always thought Joe had a particular arrogance, but it became particularly prominent after he became England's number 1, and it's made it more difficult for me to take to him than it has for other blues.

He needs to accept the competition. Caballero has just as much right to play as Joe does, he deserves his opportunity.

Joe's reluctance to accept this, or any challenge to his position as undoubted number 1, belies his arrogance. And it's precisely this attitude which has seen him regress as a player over the past 2 or 3 years.

I have ridden all of my biking life (the last 10 years) in London, filtering every day, for a couple of those years i was a courier, these factors I think have changed my risk perception compared to the dawdler we are talking about here. 

I am getting better at not putting pressure on the guy in-front by either hanging back a respectable distance (but then they never move over because they think you are happy to follow at their pace) or just straight over/undertaking them quickly to be done with it.

The ones with no awareness i understand, they don't check their mirrors or are not experienced enough to take in whats behind while concentrating on filtering. What always perplexes me is the ones that see you arrive behind them and then spend an inordinate amount of time checking you out in their mirrors (every few cars they pass, which i consider more dangerous than riding at whatever pace i was going at) It must be an ego thing to not move over, as a generalization these riders are on flashy bikes. As you say each rider has a different perception of safe progress, I don't understand the mentality that forces their slow speed on everyone else. I do see the hypocrisy in that my preferred speed is higher and at least for a brief moment their risk level is altered, I think in situations like this I as the impatient one behind and the slow one infront we are both assholes, but just let me past for a second and we can carry on being assholes away from each other.

There will always be someone faster and i would rather just let them be on their way, even if to observe/learn or merely make a snide comment in my helmet about what a nutter they are.

OP: I don't think there is any actual consensus it just depends on who you happen across on that day, their skill level and what mood they happen to be in, but yes generally I find i'm held up alot more by other riders than car drivers in heavy traffic. Most are good about it.

Farage is fortunate in that he'll never have to deliver on any of the things he talks about - the best he can hope to do is force an EU referendum. ",0,1412035469,null,0,false,0,ckw1wti,t3_2ht4rp,t1_ckw1wti,t3_2ht4rp,null,1426761545,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

While Countiho is obviously good, he hasn't shown it, while the others have, so I think he should be left as an impact sub. Other than that, I agree with everything else. That back four, though it sucks now, should gel with time and I'm hoping it'll come good. Our fullbacks are amazing, and Lovren and Sakho just need to understand each other better, and we should be fine. Sterling is great right where he is, but I also think he should have some freedom to roam and do what he does, cause he really is one of our, possibly main, star player. And the 2 strikers, I hope, will work, but we'll have to wait and see. What I'm hoping for is them to create a similar partnership with last years SAS, except Sturridge becomes our new ""Suarez"" (obviously he's irreplaceable in terms of talent) in the sense that he creates havoc for the defense by making lots of runs and pulling defenders out of position, while Balo takes advantage of said created space and does his thing (scores a bucket load of goals... hopefully).

It was explained during one of the classic serials that the last incarnation of the Doctor would be a villain.  During the serial in question he appeared as an antagonist opposing the then current Doctor.  

It was assumed at the time that this meant that the 13th Doctor would be the Valeyard, however this was proven incorrect in Time of the Doctor.  Since then, people have been trying to figure out how the Valeyard fits into the mythology.  Is he the 23rd Doctor?  Is he Matt Smith in an alternate timeline?  Is he Capaldi?  Is he whoever Capaldi regenerates into?

Personally, I think the most likely answer is that the Valeyard is an incarnation of the Doctor that occurs so far into the future that we have no reason to even think about it.

As a woman, it matters a LOT to me when the female protagonist is weak, whiny, or obedient.  Basically, the Wife of Bath's tale still holds true today: **Chaucer Spoilers** -- women really do want power, or rather, agency, to use a modern word for it.

Martha walking out on the Doctor was one of the most powerful character moments I've ever seen in fiction -- and it illustrates the difficulty of writing these companions to be strong protagonists. Of the three that scored well in this thought experiment, two achieved an equal status with the Doctor (Rose, Donna) and one could only stay if she accepted being dependent and unequal (Martha).  None of these relationships were stable, although you could argue Donna managed it, and her ending was just a one-off accident, rather than their relationship's logical conclusion.  We can't know for sure, but the series implies it.

Anyway, this is why Romana was an awesome companion, because she really was the Doctor's equal in a way a River Song could not be (she was never allowed to be her own person, but hey, at least she became a better person because of the Doctor).

Let's have more mixed-couple companions to take the gender equation out of the species/power difference.

27 million for Schneid? They can fuck off for that much. I know we have to play the market, prices are higher, etc., but there's quality out there that won't force us to be frugal for the next few seasons. With Stambouli and Fazio, I'm hoping that we won't regret not splashing 47 million for Mussachio and Schneid. But fuuuuck, he's going to be the best midfielder in the league in a few years. He's already up there now. 

The most interesting part is why the players switch off on matchday. I know that practice and application are two different things, but the players should understand that if they want to win stuff (and unfortunately in the case of some, seal a big money move away to Spain), they have to buy into what Poch is selling. 

Eriksen's loved around here, and rightfully so, but he's had such a dip in form for the first few games. I hope he comes back, or Poch even goes with the Modric Option and moves him next to Capoue (at that point, we'd probably have to sell off two center mids and completely lack depth in attacking mids, so maybe that's one for the future). The worry might be that him and Lamela are both ""freedom players"" who just might not work well together because they do a lot of the same things. That's the worst possible scenario though, so there's that. I'll reserve my judgement for four more matches, though, because ten games should be a good gauge of our progress. 

Overall, I'm happy with how things are going. This sub had a meltdown after the West Brom game, but most (if not all) of us agreed that Poch needs time to iron out flaws from last year, get to know the players' strengths and weaknesses, etc. I hope the speech after the match set things straight. Signs are looking positive for us and things can only go up. If the problems are only mental, winning a few in a row should boost spirits and convince players that Poch is doing it right.

Half of his players despised him and it wasn't before too long when he lost the whole locker room.  I don't want to comment too much on the Tevez situation because Tevez was a diva, but to be stripped of captaincy was a little ludicrous.  He always seemed to put players in the dog pound without reason.  I feel like he would put players in position to fail whereas Pellegrini puts them in position to succeed.  The whole Balotelli circus just got out of control, and as big as a fan I was of Balotelli, it just became too much.  Like mentioned in this thread Kolorov, Dzeko, and Nasri are performing much more consistently under Pellegrini.  The whole blaming of players has also stopped.  If you guys/girls remember correctly Mancini would point out specific performances of players and attribute it to the loss or draw.  Pellegrini takes the blame or would just label mistakes as unfortunate events.  This way he has the players backs and they don't feel like they are being sacrificed.  I never understood how we had 4 of the 10 or 15 best strikers in the world and we would only play one.  Mancini is a little old fashioned and rough on players but also deflected blame on players and rarely took responsibility for loses.  Good luck to him finding another job but I'm much more happy with low-key Pellegrini.

Poch has always coached small teams in big leagues - Espanyol and So'ton were teams which were happy to cede possession and play a counter-attacking style because other teams would come at them thinking they could overrun them.

Now, he has a team of stars and teams come to WHL hoping to frustrate us by sitting back and banking up (as we did to Arse). Poch has never faced this problem before. He is used to reacting to the impetus of other teams, not setting his team up to provide the impetus.

This is why I personally preferred FdB and would have appointed him if i were in charge. He is not only a proven winner as player and coach, but as coach of a really big fish in a very small pond, he is used to taking a team which should always dominate possession and chances, and using them appropriately to break down stubborn resistance. 

Also, with our squad lacking the pure pace Poch required to play proper counter-attacking footy, I wonder whether we will ever see the best of this team under Poch.

Ian Rush was the greatest striker produced by British Isles since the Romans introduced the concept of football to that past of the world circa 2000 years ago.

In an era where:

* he needed 2 defenders to play him onside, not just 1
* defenders just needed to toe poke the ball back to the keeper, who could then dive over it and use their hands

Rush was still unstoppable. He scored 49 goals in our treble season (yeah Manure fans - we did it FIRST).

He would single-handedly harry and press a back four into making mistakes, when they had the ball. Even when they had the easy out of passing it back to the keeper. His pressing was THAT good.

I remember reading a behind the scenes article on Rushie by Shoot magazine. Where it showed how many times he missed in training. Point being - his goal-scoring was mainly instinct.

Thats why it took Paisley a year to fully trust Rushie (he left him out for the 81 Euro final). You needed to discount what you saw in training, and trust the man. Put him in the team. Let him cross the white line. Then he transformed into a KILLER.

1 chance. 1 goal.

2 chances. 2 goals.

3 half chances? A hat trick.

Unstoppable.

Fowler was excellent. Owen was (in my opinion) just below Fowler. Torres was the most graceful (in his prime). Suarez was the better all-round player. Better even than Kenny, in my opinion. Keegan was before my time, so I'll pass on him.

But as a pure goal-scoring ruthless murdering assassin - Rush was the greatest there has ever been.

Migs was always a strange choice as our keeper and has pretty much worked out as some people, myself included, expected.

Sahko was around the 16 million mark and still hasn't really nailed on a starting spot which is beginning to become an issue.

Lovren cost 20 million and I actually think he could be one to settle but was hardly bought on the cheap.

Moreno looks a decent prospect and for 12  million worth a punt.

Can is potential and looks like he could be another worth a punt, especially at the 10 million mark.

Allen, though has something to add to the team, at 15 million it is questionable if that money was well spent.

Markovic at 20 million will need quite a bit of time to adjust to the league and, at the price, is a big gamble.

Couts is so inconsistent, has been last season and this, and will probably need a few more seasons before we ever see if he can live up to the hype of BR and many of the fans. Though at the money paid for him could be seen as good value.

Lallana, though many feel we overpaid, can at least be a player who has an immediate impact on our first eleven. Once he is up to fitness I believe he will be a good addition and will add to our midfield dynamic. We could have done with more at his level.

Sturridge has been the only complete success and was great value.

Lambert was bought to add something to the bench and at 4 million, fair enough.

Borini at 12 million, though many seem to like him, has hardly proved any value.

I can't believe with all the time we had to sort out a striker that we were forced into a last minute gamble on Ballotelli. We had so much time to get this right and somehow as time went on our options seemed to disappear.  Maybe he will work out but I doubt he was ever our first choice, or even second or third.
Then there is the 4-7 million list including the likes of Aspas, Alberto and llori.

What I would say is that BR improves the standard of most technical player's under him: Sturridge, Sterling, Suarez, Hendo etc.

To say we have been successful in the transfer market under BR is just not true. We have paid out so much money on players who may be good in a few seasons or others that just never looked like being good enough.",0,1412060668,null,0,1412060861,0,ckwcf7g,t3_2hutpk,t1_ckwcf7g,t1_ckw99ln,null,1426756550,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

It was a byname of Woden with the meaning ‘masked person’ or ‘shape-changer’, and may have been bestowed on male children in an attempt to secure the protection of the god. The Continental Germanic cognate grim was also used as a first element in compound names. Compare Grimaud and Gribble, with the original sense ‘mask’, ‘helmet’.

If you seriously believe austerity has done us well then its seriously about fucking time you did some research in to the matter rather than drawing false correlations.

false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Agree on all points.  I actually wrote a pretty similar thing about Poch vs. FdB after the West Brom game.

And I do think Poch's strategy against Arsenal is partly due to his traditional underdog status at his previous two clubs... from last season, we can see he knows how to take points from top teams.

However, I would quibble with saying Southampton ceded possession and just played counter-attacking under him... didn't they actually have the highest percentage of possession out of all teams in the EPL last year?  I might be wrong, but I thought that was the case.

He's interesting because I think he plays both a ball-retention game (like AVB), but a quick, incisive game, similar to someone like Mourinho.  It's very much the kind of philosophy Bielsa espouses, and Barcelona when at their peak between 2006-2010 really epitomised it.  They had absurd amounts of possession and could easily pass the ball for 20-25 passes uninterrupted, but when they saw their opening, they were lethal and swift.  'Tiki-taka' has caught a lot of shit in recent years for being slow football that bores the opposition to death, but when played properly, it's actually amazingly quick.  Looking at so many of Barca's goals from that era, they could hold the ball forever, but their goals were usually the result or 1-2 sudden, direct passes.

This is what we've lacked as a team lately.  Under AVB we could hold the ball well enough, but we never got around to playing those 1-2 vital passes that unlocked teams.

As OP says, attacking transition speed and intensity is our side's biggest flaw over the last 2-3 years.  It was bad when Bale was here, but he alone gave us that thrust to override the flaws in our overall game.  With him gone, we've had virtually no one to take up that mantle.  Bale could change the pace of an attack with a pass or a burst into space... we need to get our most talented players working on this.

The game plan against Arsenal may have been at attempt to teach us quicker transitions, but I actually think it's closer to how we should be playing the big teams.  We got murdered last year trying to play them at their game, as tactics like high and wide fullbacks only exposed us badly.  I'm quite happy for us to play a more conservative game against the top six until the side gels a bit more to Poch's plans... we won't score as many goals, but we won't give up easy ones either (hopefully).",0,1412062557,null,0,false,0,ckwct0n,t3_2hv2g3,t1_ckwct0n,t1_ckwbyyr,null,1426756371,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

I moved to uk years ago, and to MK almost a year ago, the advice you got here is very solid.

Rightmove.co.uk is very good to look around and figure out the prices. Recently my colleagues from work were looking for places to live in central MK, and renting market is very fast moving there. It means you will have a lot to choose from, but if you find something you need to decide fast.

MK is very car friendly compared to other english towns/cities. The infamous grid system is confusing at start, but the traffic is much better. So if you're planning on having a car, living a bit further away from the centre is a good option. Other thing worth noting - if you're working in the city centre you can get an employee parking permit that lets you park in special zones in city centre for 30 pounds a month.

Walking / biking is great in MK. Tons of paths and parks.

Banks are generally ok. I use Lloyds, but other high street places are much of the muchness. All I needed to open a bank account was my passport and had no hassle at all.

The level that someone is at after doing a good master's course is significantly higher academically, in terms of writing and research skills, than if they just come out of a three year bachelor, and these skills do help with a job - especially if you are careful to pick a master's that is directly related to what you do. 

I left the UK for my master, and in the rest of Europe it is considered basic level. The majority of UK students simply would not be able to compete for jobs in the rest of Europe because their education level is insufficient. 

The fundamental question we have to ask is whether we want British people to do PhDs. It's a fact that at least one master is required for practically all PhD studies, yet we have atrociously high tuition fees and no loan system! Most UK master courses are now aimed at international students who can get scholarships from their own countries. It's not good that we are being outstripped like this. 

All I'm suggesting as a starting step is halving the fees and permitting students to take out a student loan for a master as well. All we are saying otherwise is that only wealthy people are permitted to have access to postgraduate education. Or, we lose good graduates. I wouldn't describe myself as the best of the best but I have a good degree from a top university and I got the hell out as quickly as possible to do my LLM, and don't plan on returning so long as I can find work internationally. And I know I'm not alone - I know tons of good young scientists and lawyers who left because they simply wouldn't go into horrible debt to further their studies.

false,Ftumsh,cnty-expat,Expat,"Best advice I ever got about roundabouts (and I used to have to cycle from a minor road to another minor road through a three-lane wide roundabout intersecting a dual carriageway at least twice a day) is: ""**turn yourself into a car**"". 

Meaning by that, insist on a car-sized lane space. Position yourself right in the centre of the correct lane just before you get onto the roundabout. Don't give way, hold your ground, and don't be bullied by honking horns into letting a car come into your lane alongside you. It slows everyone else down but it is your right to be there. 

Your two danger points are 1. people not seeing you as they enter the roundabout (as a car driver I once hit a bike this way - she was riding in the dark in the rain with no lights but it was still very traumatic for both of us, although her more than me I'd imagine). So be visible. Don't be embarrassed to wear hi-viz, and also have bright lights on even in the daytime. Also try to make eye contact - I think someone else has said this too. Making even a minor human connection with other drivers really changes their behaviour and stops them from seeing you merely as an irritating obstacle. Not aggressively - lots of smiles and waves. Works if you're a pedestrian too.

The other major danger is 2. people not seeing you as they change lanes or exit the roundabout. Remember that the worst blind spot (both physically and for unobservant drivers) is behind-left, so on a multi-lane roundabout when you have a choice use the furthest-right correct lane. A lot of cyclists just stick in the inside lane no matter where they're exiting, but (IMO) this is more dangerous because you're in everyone's blind spot the whole time. But when moving from an outside lane into an inside lane, check *your* blind spot with a swift head-turn in case someone's overtaking you on the inside. 

Remember if all else fails, you can stop. Hopefully any traffic behind you will have their speed reduced enough that they'll have enough time to stop in time too. This course of action may cause a snarl-up but it could save your life. 

Riding your bike like this pisses the drivers off but it's completely within your rights, and in my experience the only way to do it with any semblance of safety. ",0,1412067382,null,0,false,0,ckwdn0t,t3_2hswuz,t1_ckwdn0t,t1_ckvq3gf,null,1426755982,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

No. Instead voters give a clear message that they don't really care about any of the things above and even support weakening the welfare state, and clawing back all the progress that previous generations of workers fought so hard for.

I don't see it that way, though I can understand why you would. 

More knives, more of a chance people will kill with a knife.
More cars, more of a chance people will die in car crashes.
More pet hamsters, more likely people will die in pet hamster cable chewing fire events.

Just because it's more likely to be used as a murder weapon, just because an increase in guns results in higher gun related crime, doesn't mean it should be banned. 

If the total amount of a specific crime, e.g. violent crime stays stable then does it matter if the suspects weapon of choice is a knife or a gun? I don't believe so.
If the total amount of that specific crime increased, then it would become an issue.

And I'm not trying to suggest there isn't evidence of exactly that. But there is also plenty of evidence to suggest it's not so. The issue for me is in the comparisons drawn by people on both sides of the gun debate, especially in the USA.

Anti-gun parties in the US often point to the UK and say 'look, less murders. Less guns. Guns must be bad!'. But I don't see it as simply as that, it's too difficult to compare nations in that way as I'm sure most people would agree.

The US for example has a far higher number of traffic related deaths per 100,000 people than the UK does (11.6 and 3.5 respectively.) but no one looks at that statistic and says 'Look, less car deaths in the UK. Less cars. Cars are bad!'.

Plenty of cities have a cultural scene on a par with London - unless you consider the West End to be culture, in which case you're probably better off staying here.

&gt;could you seriously live in the Midlands

Yes, there are plenty of lovely towns and cities there. Have you heard of Oxford? It's pretty nice. You have the classic outlook of someone who has never really lived anywhere else and I feel bad for you. London is a crowded, expensive, unfriendly nightmare. Londoners tend not to realise this until they try living somewhere else, and discover that their quality of living shoots up, and the cost of living shoots down.",0,1412068088,null,0,false,0,ckwdr26,t3_2hs07a,t1_ckwdr26,t1_ckwdl2v,null,1426755930,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It looks as though we're about to have a female Head of State, a female Presiding Officer and a female First Minister. That's great. If we're going down the route of quotas, surely they should work both ways, and some of those top three jobs should be going to a quota of men too? (I'm not saying we should do that, that's silly, I'm saying if you support quotas, that's the logical leap to ensure balance). 

I'm a member of a minority - with about 10% of the population ish, Scottish Labour don't have a single member from my community in my council, or in any of our three parliaments. Does that mean that they can't stand up for me because they're attracted to a different gender than I am? No. 

Should I take up seats on things within my party because I'm the token homosexual? No. 

I have a heterosexual female MSP in my constituency, she is fantastic. The other half of my city has a homosexual male MSP. He's also fantastic. The fact they do a great job is nothing to do with their gender or the gender to which they're attracted. In fact if I had to put money on who was Scotland's worst parliamentarian, it would probably be a gay MEP ;-) 50% of our MEPs are gay actually, thinking about it. Is that undemocratic? 

If women (or any minority group) don't get involved because there are barriers to their participation, we should tackle those barriers. Ensuring the few who aren't held back by such barriers are promoted before others doesn't change that. It doesn't help those who are disenfranchised. It's wallpapering over the cracks to give the illusion that the problem has been fixed when in reality it hasn't.

There are a few sections through the Sperrins, just south of Derry, which would be near enough to you, although the landscape there might generously be described as bleak. 

Certainly the most dramatic stretch is the Causeway Coast; you could start at Coleraine (or even Limavady), a little over half an hour from Derry, and get the whole way to Ballycastle on foot with little problem. You could then take the Moyle Way through the Glens of Antrim if you wanted to keep walking. There's a road that follows some of the best coastline from Ballycastle round to Larne, but this is best experienced on wheels - under no circumstances would I suggest walking it, but if you're a competent cyclist you may enjoy biking it.

The Mourne Way and Lecale Way would make an excellent hike as well. The Mournes rival the Causeway Coast for dramatic scenery, and there are plenty of routes that you could take a diversionary ramble down while you're there.

Taxation is a tricky issue for the Labour government in Cardiff. If a portion of the tax take in Wales goes directly to the Welsh Government, that will necessarily result in a reduction in the block grant coming from Westminster. Wales is considerably poorer than the rest of the UK, so you'd be swapping a portion of the block grant, which is a net transfer of funds from central government to Wales, for a much smaller figure coming from direct taxation. 

Carwyn Jones is looking for recognition in Westminster that Wales is underfunded in terms of relative need (which is true), and a move to end that underfunding, before he commits to tax raising powers. Oh, and he also wants to put income tax powers to a referendum, because he doesn't really want them in the first place.

It's all a bit ironic; Labour, who have painted themselves as the champions of devolution in Wales, are now the single biggest roadblock to more powers for the Assembly.

Your average ""rank and file"" hosptial nurse (staff nurse) starts on Band 5 of the Agenda for Change pay scale, which usually works out at around £21K. The ward sister/charge nurse is usually on band 6 or 7 of the pay scale which goes from £30-40k at the upper end. There is also room for further progression into more specialist areas where pay can go higher still.

Now, £21k might not seem like a lot, **but**, they can pick up agency (freelance/locum) shifts that can pay very well. A 12 hour bank holiday night shift could comfortably pay £25 an hour. So in reality many nurses supplement their 38.5hrs a week with the occasional extra shift so their take home pay tends to be closer to £25-30k. It's good money for a job with a broad and middle range entry criteria, and minimal debt incurred studying. 

They also have an interesting shift pattern, where many ""long day shifts"" in hospitals can be between 10 and 13 hours... now if you're working 38.5 hrs a week full time, that means you can actually work 3 long days one week and 4 days the next - so its a job that is very stressful but also comes with a lot of downtime.

I have my own products in the market under my own name, but I also design and build mainly niche products for various industries - these jobs come to me as consultation requests (I should probably go and approach other companies too...).

I used to do this in my bedroom when I graduated, in my parents house (built my double bed on stilts and spent 22 hours a day in there!!

I moved with my parents to a much larger place where I have a full workshop and living space. Without the support of my family this project would not have taken off.

Earning... heh... that's all over the place. Monthly I make enough to get by without having a crazy lifestyle. I can buy the 2nd hand watches I want and take my girlfriend out so my simple life is satisfied. I have a few long jobs on that are just starting to come to fruition now (who would have thought that a 2 month project can take over a year!? :) ) so just one or two of these will hugely swing my yearly earning. My sample size of 24 months in a growing business probably isn't worth basing any expectations of future earnings on.

My earning/turnover is very steady and growing as I release more products. I'm in this for the long haul and have a goal - working towards it!

Is it as I had wished it would be? Yes and no. 

Yes - I get to make products I like and conduct business in a way that I can always be proud of. I have huge flexibility with my time (it's 11:13 am and I'm on Reddit). I get to listen to all the music I want for 8+ hours a day, every day, with speakers.

No - I did think that progress with my business growth would be faster. The more I do this the less disappointed I am about this element and the more I realise that this job is a lifestyle/way of life that rewards patience, focus and self-discipline. My first year was financially very, very good (especially for a startup) but I had no discipline *at all*. Most of my profit went behind a bar. Lesson learned :)

The flexibility with time is a 2 way thing. I can do pretty much what I want, when I want. However I have to do 100% of my work or I don't get paid, people get upset and I undermine myself.

OP: if you are thinking about going self employed please do listen to all the advise you can get and pick the stuff that makes sense and fits with how you want to conduct yourself. Make as many contacts as possible - both in and out of your industry. This isn't for business this of for your sanity and focus.

Without going too far into detail, expecting success at the Browns after they came back as an expansion team (effectively they were formed in 1999) is sort of like expecting Celtic (and this is being generous) to drop into the Premier League and challenge for titles straight away. It's a near-impossible task. Doesn't help that by all accounts he had no interest in the team anyway.

As for Villa, he invested over 200m in the club ffs. Most of it lost on poor decisions from people he trusted to make the right ones. And even with the poor decision making, the teams finishing above us every year (other than Everton) had revenue streams that were literally double what we were getting. We couldn't compete financially without Lerner plunging the club into debt.

debateable, but could go half way and raise 2.5 billion/year from it.

Parliment would never get this measure passed. However replacing it for a cheaper alternative should be considered, and could save a decent chunk of the money it costs.

probably a bad idea - their needs to be better country-wide long distance transport options.

no - would never happen anyway , tory voters would hate this.

Who has put forward that argument? Imperial measurements provide significant advantages over metric in regard to imbuing the general population with more complex maths solving skills.

In addition they have access to a pretty decent pension and 38 days holiday per year! If they stay in the regular army after their initial 4 years then they also get a £7,500 bonus and by about 5 years can expect a promotion to corporal where pay is closer to about £27k.

Among.... 


Yes OT and NT literature should be studied and analysed and sifted and critiqued like any literature. The coming to dominance of a monotheistic cult is an important moment in human history (in the West) and needs to be put in some context.  A lot of the text in both of these books is pagan in origin but most people are never given the chance to look at the collection in this way, seeing instead a 'single book' with some seriously warped translations being the only form they will ever encounter them in.

I was lucky enough to study the Old Testament and the Q'uran in their original languages.  The OT is full of polytheism but all the various different gods have been airbrushed by translation principles that sought assert the monotheist view above all the other recorded practices that both sources contain.

Under no definition of the Midlands can Oxfordshire be found unless you include the area called South Midlands which is made up and doesn't actually exist. So yes call it Jaundiced but I think your kidding yourself if you think Oxford isn't a nice quaint post city in South East bloody England!!

I do not know anyone who hates their life in London. I only know people from other cities and places who would kill to come and live here. I suspect that's a difference of social groups/friendships and interests. No right or wrong on that one. I mainly questioned the age as at 24 I find it surprising that anyone around my age could say what you have said (assuming that is around the age then). Again subjective, just not a view I have heard before from anyone under 30 and not married. 

I have lived in the Midlands (the real midlands as I will call it after your Oxford point!) and its not something I will ever do again.  A bleak hole in the UK landscape sums it up well. Doesn't matter where you go in the Midlands its is dire. Birmingham, Stoke, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham. List goes on. So while you say i may be an ass you should realise that doesn't bother me a huge amount - I tried it, it sucked. 

Personally to me London is the be all and end all of the UK. We make the money, we have the important jobs etc etc. While I love going to visit other places I am always happy to be home. I grew up just outside of London (In South East England) so no I do not have attachments to somewhere 200 miles north creating what you may call a bias - This is my home and it also happens to be the center of the UK for everything.

I also don't want to compare it other international cities - I see you've lived in Shanghai yes - I don't care? I have zero interest in Shanghai, there are plenty of other cities that I would rather visit. Also if London is crowded Shanghai must suck for you...

For that reason, I would argue that any journalism he engages in is incidental to his main aim.

I think that's a shame, because he's actually very good at stringing together a good yarn on a subject and tying together different strands, as evinced by his chapters on crony capitalism and police corruption in this book. Where he falls down is his attempts to pin it on ideology, in this case neoliberalism, whereas the most obvious explanation is bald self-interest.

You might argue that neoliberalism incites such individualism, but it's obvious that the neoliberal lobbyists of the Adam Smith Institute did not want to create a system of corporate handouts. Perhaps that is naivety on their part, similar to the socialist naivety that enabled Soviet corruption in Russia, but Jones does not seem to see the obvious comparison.

He's doing well in that he's playing his usual game well enough. Problem is that his usual game is very ill-suited to our style of play, like Andy Carroll - there were lots of post-match threads in 2011-12 where people talked about how Andy looked good and was playing better, all of which ignored the fact that it didn't matter how well he was playing when he wasn't on the same wavelength as the rest of the team.

To get the most out of Balotelli's natural game, we'd need attacking midfielders and/or other strikers making runs ahead of him, pushing past the defence and scoring goals. Only Sterling and Borini offer that at the moment. We'd also need Balotelli to stop shooting from low-percentage areas, as he is very wont to do, and focus on creating.

Alternatively, Rodgers tries to get Balotelli to adjust his movement to better suit our style of play. It's pretty clear Rodgers would prefer to do this, and I can see why - if it comes off, we have two strikers who can drop deep and link up with the midfield, also know when and how to make runs in behind and get on the end of chances - plus one of them's a great physical presence.",0,1412075157,null,0,false,0,ckwextt,t3_2hv90t,t1_ckwextt,t1_ckwd26c,null,1426755375,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

**Total Welfare Claim for a person aged 25 - 35, living in the Black Country.**

Type of Benefit | Weekly Amount | Annual Total.
---------|----------|----------
JSA - ""Adult Rate"" | £72.40 | £3,764.80
Local Housing Allowance - Single Room Rate | ~£60.00 | ~£3,120.
Council Tax Benefit¹ |	~£11.29 | £587.29
Free Prescriptions² |	£2 | £104.00
Free Glasses³ |	~£0.37 | £19.15

**Total: £7,595.24 per annum / £146.06 per week.**

It may seen counter-intuit to include an approximation for prescription costs, but if you leave them out, there'll be a plethora of posters who scream bloody murder about how ""scroungers"" also get free prescriptions.

The only thing I couldn't approximate is dental costs, as there isn't a pre-payment option - like with the prescription pre-pay certificate, that I could use as a base.

**Notes:**

**¹:** Originally Council Tax benefit covered the full amount; following changes to funding for local councils this has been at their discretion - in Dudley, for example, the changes have required claimants to find £54.56 a year, to cover the deficit between the amount they're awarded, and the actual cost.

**²:** This is a difficult one to figure out; for convenience I've taken the cost of an NHS Pre-Payment certificate as the base model, as it's the avenue a working person would go down, if they had regular prescription needs.

**³:** I have taken the cost of an NHS optical voucher - currently £38.30, and divided it across two years, as currently people in receipt of working age benefits are entitled to eye tests - and if deemed necessary, free glasses, every two years.",0,1412075954,null,0,false,0,ckwf3it,t3_2hs6o8,t1_ckwf3it,t1_ckwcb5j,null,1426755301,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As usual I play with no 1st transfer window so all the teams are locked into their starting lineups.

Found we were a bit light in the midfield if you're competing in all cups and had to use the youth squad a few times.  Gallifuoco was great for me in the cups against lower league opposition.

You'll need a Right Back asap as Rangel is on the way out and Tiendalli/Jazz will do for occasional games but they aren't first team quality.  You're fine at CB  with 3 first team CBs and Bartley will do a shift, though I'd offload Tate asap as you're never going to play him and maybe bring in another young promising CB and loan him out to get experience and he may be decent cover in a few years.

Central midfield could do with another Defensive midfielder, I find Shelvey is a beast though he can't shoot for toffee while Ki grabs the occasional goal for me and runs his heart out every game.  They need another guy of similar quality to allow for rotation.  Britton is on his way out too sadly.

Siggy is amazing but you need to grab another CAM so you can rest him.  I use Emnes or Carroll in there when he is tired or to sub him off.

The wingers are great and adding another up and coming pacey winger to cover Dyer is recommended.  

Up front you've got Bony the beast and Gomis is decent but nothing special.  I find Emnes tends to do better in the way I play up front than Gomis and can really hurt a defence that has faced the Bony battering ram for 70minutes.

In goal Fabianski is solid, Tremmell is a decent back up and you've got some young goalies who are various shades of rubbish.  I tend to loan out all the goalies save the youngest one (as he came to ask me if he could play in preseason and I figured he can stay as he's got more balls than the rest so might get a game).

No they don't either in real terms or in your theoretical example. They also face the costs of disposing of the old carpet, delivery of the new one, the possibility of needing new underlay if that was also damaged (which can't be seen until after the carpet dispute is sorted), etc. But even all of these aside, there is still the issue that they do not get x/15ths of the value of the carpet where x is the number of years the carpet should have still been usable. Instead they get the value of the carpet as it was at the time it was damaged/ruined, which is always less than x/15ths, even on the year it was due to be replaced. 

&gt; If they got full replacement each time, they'd actually be profiting to the extent of 1 carpet. Why do they deserve that?

If the tenant could replace the carpet with a second hand carpet of the same size, colour and condition that it was before they damaged it *and* get this replacement carpet installed professionally then your argument would have some merit but this is not practical in most circumstances. I'd be happy for the tenant to be given this choice as an alternative to replacing the carpet at the cost of doing so however. 

&gt; It doesn't make sense with a single cost but these will be averaged over all the landlord's properties for all the time he's being a landlord.

Many landlords became so reluctantly or only have one property they let. These costs make letting unprofitable for them, so they sell up to bigger landlords or foreign investors (who are the only ones that can afford many properties these days) further entrenching the rich/poor divide and/or reducing the number of properties on the market.",0,1412077673,null,0,false,0,ckwfhgd,t3_2hvh2p,t1_ckwfhgd,t1_ckwf7ru,null,1426755121,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;

&gt;___The Edge of Destruction___ (also referred to as ___Inside the Spaceship___) is the third [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on 8 February and 15 February 1964. It was written by [David Whitaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitaker_(screenwriter\)) and directed by [Richard Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Martin_(television_director\)) for the first episode and [Frank Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Cox_(director\)) for the second.

&gt;In the story, [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Doctor) ([William Hartnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hartnell)), his granddaughter [Susan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Foreman) ([Carole Ann Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Ann_Ford)), and her teachers [Ian Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Chesterton) ([William Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Russell_(actor\))) and [Barbara Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(Doctor_Who\)) ([Jacqueline Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Hill)) are in the Doctor's time and space machine the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) when it appears to be taken over by an outside force. The travellers begin acting strangely and turn against each other.

&gt;The serial is distinguished as a rare ""[bottle episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_episode)"", in that the entire story is shot on a single set, with just the main cast. It also serves to resolve several character threads that had been presented over the previous eleven weeks.

About a month ago I harvested the damsons on New Road, near Histon. I got enough to make several pots of jam as well as several litres of damson gin, vodka, brandy and rum. Should be a good Christmas.

Thinking of only making a few litres of sloe gin this year.

I noticed that the sloes are everywhere this year, certainly not a problem obtaining them.

Plums in general were pretty bad this year due to a large infestation of ""Pocket Plum"". Most  likely because of the very wet Winter.

https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=199

I even saw sloes that were affected by Pocket Plum. That looked really weird. Imagine a thing that looks like a miniature banana growing on a Blackthorn bush.


BTW, Cobnuts (type of hazelnut) are in season at the moment. They're pretty tasty and easy to forage as they simply drop to the ground when they're ready.

Check out Cambridge Business Park. There are cobnut trees near the entrance, and right down the back in the far carpark.

There have been changes to the Income Tax (earnings and pensions) Act 2003 and the Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations which came into force on 6th April 2014. It is clear as day that the current Ltd/Umbrella system used by agencies is not legal. 

Most relevant. 

http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/esmmanual/ESM2033.htm

&gt; The legislation will apply when a worker personally provides their services (see ESM2035) to a client under, or in consequence of, a contract between the client (or a person connected with the client) and an agency and the relevant conditions are met (see ESM2034). In this context, an agency is any third party interposed between the worker and the client for whom they provide the services. An agency can include an unincorporated body of which the worker is a member. (That means umbrella company) The agency does not have to place the worker with the client for the legislation to apply.

&gt; When a worker enters into arrangements with an agency to personally provide their services to a client and the arrangements come within the agency legislation, then any remuneration received by the worker (from any person) under, or in consequence of the arrangements, is treated for income tax purposes as earnings from an employment with the agency that contracts with the client (or a person connected with the client). 

ALL the agencies using Ltd/Umbrella are falling foul of the agency legislation. There isn't a single instance anywhere in the UK where it meets the conditions for not being classed as an employee of the agency. At some point in the future I fully expect HMRC to come chasing after everyone using umbrella/ltd company. 

Full list of things that apply...

For the most part it was 2 banks of 4 with Chadli and Ade up top, a standard old school 4-4-2, we conceded possession (partially by design, partially because we continually were making very bad choices when we did have possession), absorbed the attacks and weathered the storm and tried to hit on the break. Very different than what we would expect and as you said, probably a very astute change from how we have played and gotten stung against some of the bigger teams over the past couple seasons.

What interested me most in this was that one of the biggest criticisms of Poch (and Bielsa, and AVB etc) is that they stick to what they are doing regardless of what is happening.  ""They have no 'Plan B'"" is generally how it is represented.....Poch and Bielsa (AVB as well) would probably say something along the lines of ""If you move to ""Plan B"" you have already failed"" as they believe the preparation of their approach means that ""Plan A"" should work and if it isn't then there was a flaw in the preparation.  

The game against Arse showed in a way that Poch is willing to use a ""Plan B"" by changing from the standard manner that the team has been coached to play since he arrived (pressing, possession etc) but at the same time showing that very strict, disciplined adherence to a version of ""Plan A"" for the match can be successful.

I can really get frustrated when I see him hanging around outside the penalty area passing around with Sterling or Lallana looking for a gap to shoot, when what he should be doing is taking a run deep. Either for a pass or to clear up space for someone else. Hopefully, as you say, this'll look much better with Sturridge back - I thought they looked really good together in the spurs game. Problem is, what happens when Sturridge gets injured again?

A part of this problem - the lack of deep runs- could be solved by Henderson playing a more active role in attack. But this would mean someone else would have to cover for him in central midfield/ defense. And I don't see Gerrard doing that atm. Hopefully Lallana/Sterling will get more comfortable taking runs, because a 4-2-3-1 is impossible if not even the striker is running deep.

&gt;I remember one day when I had taken my children to the seaside going to choose an ice-cream. I ordered theirs and asked for one for me too, I’ll have one scoop of vanilla I said. I watched as the man made me up a scoop of strawberry and I didn’t say anything, then he looked up at me. Oh sorry it was vanilla you wanted wasn’t it? Its ok it doesn’t matter I said, I” just eat it, but he fixed my gaze (he was incredibly attractive BTW). “You don’t have to, if you don’t want to”. Somehow this was a message the universe had failed to pass on to me before now, and as he scooped the unwanted strawberry back into the tub and got out the vanilla it was all I could do not throw myself into his arms and weep decades worth of relieved tears.

This is something that worries me with our housing problem (ie look how much it costs for a 1 bed in Zone 4 London), that people don't realise that a lot of BTL types are not making any money.  The average rental yield around me is about 2.5%.  Add in fees like ground rent, estate agents, insurance, damage replacement.  It's not worth it unless you expect the asset to appreciate in value.  Which in fairness it will if we have un-controlled population growth, whilst having tightly controlled house building.

Many people like to converge on a symptom as a cause.  It boggles my mind that we've a situation, we've allowed to create rather this situation, that people spend half a million quid, on an illiquid asset (you can't quickly sell if the price changes, ie down), that will have a yield in the first year that is lower than the stamp duty to buy the damned place.

&gt; Do you think people with no eduction qualifications should not earn money. 

Christ, what a loaded question. But basically yes, I think it's fair that people with **fewer or no qualifications** should - as a general rule in society, earn less. Ultimately salaries are determined by a free market combination of the jobs requirement, the number of people skilled to do it (and by extension the time/difficult involved in acquiring that skill) and a persons preparedness to do the job. I would argue £18k is not *""nothing""*... for a youngster that's a respectable starting salary, and considering it can be significantly higher with specialty/tour bonuses and regular incremental rises it seems fair.

I do appreciate that being in the army comes with some innately hazardous occupational risks... like death or serious disability, and that needs special consideration towards pay and perhaps more importantly benefits (like healthcare etc)... but overall I think the pay is fair. Like I said, there aren't many ways a 17 year old without GCSEs can walk into an £18k a year job after just 6 months of training, debt free and with pension prospects - as well as the capability to work himself all the way up to the very highest levels with the right attitude and ability... there's also a lot of hand-holding at that level which you simply don't get in other starter jobs.

I would actually find it really trying and pandering if there were these two female protagonists that never talk about relationships and are focused solely on their journey be it some adventure or what have you. Romance and love is part of living and needs to be in a story. The Bechdel test is too simplistic and narrow in focus so it's no wonder not many meet the criteria.

There is no breakdown by age on there, but it doesn't take a huge leap of reasoning to see how something that sounds so plausible is going to seriously hurt some people. 

It's more of the same workers and shirkers rhetoric which is both misleading and factually inaccurate. 

The spreadsheet on [tax credits](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/child-and-working-tax-credits-statistics-finalised-annual-awards-2012-to-2013) on this page (opens in excel) gives a little more nuance about amounts, and who is and isn't working. 

The working poor are hurt by these constant cuts to benefits and tax credits (a freeze is a cut at the rate of inflation) as much, if not more, than the unemployed.

Ouch, the FTSE all-share over that period would have a CAGR of 7.8% and the S&amp;P500 14.5% (over the last 4 years it's gone up by ~73%)

&gt; I think inflation has been circa 10% since then.

Inflation is most definitely *not* 10%.

&gt; Hypothetical : I earn 44k. I pay all the 40% rate in pension (let's call it £4k for simplicity). I've saved 20% in tax. Yet, if I withdraw more than personal allowance in pension, I pay 20% on it? Where is the tax saving? I'm genuinely curious.

If you pay all the 40% rate in you'll save the 40%, not 20. £1k in your pension should cost £600, so that £4k in your pension would have cost you £2400 in your takehome.

&gt; Yet, if I withdraw more than personal allowance in pension, I pay 20% on it?

You'll only pay 20% on the amount over your personal allowance, not on the entire sum. 

There's also a 25% lump sum you can take out tax free.

It is people our parents' age who can't move away from us/them, and don't give a shit about social issues who unfortunately make up the majority of voters, but that's the case right across the UK.

We have a strange culture in our country in that I really don't see people hardening with age, not in our generation anyway.  I can't speak with certainty about the nationalist side, but I'm sure it's the same in that - as long as people have options as time goes on - anyone who would vote DUP is already doing so.  A breakdown on voting habits according to age would be interesting.

So it's that issue of options again.  To me it's essential to avoid the more apathetic in our generation from falling into their parents' ways, as they become only too happy to decay into middle age.  At the recent European elections I found only a couple of parties who didn't mention their ""designation"" in the first paragraph (losing my attention instantly), and NI21 were promising to push for a proper system of opposition at Stormont too, which would kick the now career politicians into gear a little more.

Anyway, if we could get some real political parties who have no interest in even discussing the complete irrelevance of the border that could fix the issue, but they only ever seem to stand in random constituencies for one election at a time.  But either way, you could call me an optimist (I'm really not) but to me a move inward from the extremes is inevitable.

When your second tax rate of 40% kicks in at £39-40k and only catches the top 15-20% of earners^[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#Percentile_points_for_income_of_individuals_before_tax) you've got a bit of a problem.)

I'm unsure if it's difficult to explain over text.

How does national insurance factor in? I.e. 20% rate is actually 32% and 40% rate is actually 42%. 

Inflation over the past 4 years has averaged 10% over the period, not yearly. In 2010 the annual RPI was 4.6,% - 2011 it was over 5%.

It's not an exact metric, but the comparison is 10% inflation over the 4 year period.

It should be easy for Doctor Who to pass almost every time because while the Doctor is the main character, there's usually at least two female characters in every episode and heaps of really exciting other stuff going on for them to talk about.

It's not perfect, but if a show is consistently failing it then there is probably something wrong.  Yeah it doesn't capture how well female characters are fleshed out but there isn't really a way to quantitatively assess that and compare across shows.

The author of the post accepts the limitations of the Bechdel Test, and does discuss the female characters in more depth.  I particularly liked the comparison of Rose and River Song.  Rose loved the Doctor but wasn't afraid to disagree with him and helped him grow into a better person.  River Song actually said - “We’re going to as The Doctor’s friends always do.

I don't want to be a Morris dancer, no do I want to ballroom dance or play rugby. However I would think it a shame if harmless traditions die out.

&gt; I think that's a really smug, pompous and arrogant attitude, it's fun.

You think getting educated is smug pompous and arrogant? On the drinking side - I'm not a teetotaller, I enjoy pubs clubs and festivals and drink through them all. However I don't like seeing drunk 18 year olds having their stomachs pumps, or the London Ambulance service taking 45+ mintutes to respond to calls on a Friday night.

&lt; The money and concern spent on anti-radicalising Muslim teenagers would be better spend on the ambulance service on the weekends.

The 'Prevent' strategy for examples costs [£3 million a year](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/26/hundreds-people-anti-radicalisation-support), and that is one of several programs run by the UK government, let alone what the Met and local councils spend from their own budgets. Sure £3 million isn't much, but its more than 100 nurses for example.

&gt; I think that's arrogant and cunty. You get fines for actual damage etc already.

Well first off why is it arrogant? I want to know why its cunty as well but I think that may be because you've taken a dislike to me.

Secondly you get fines but only up to £80 which isn't much at all. In addition its a lot of paperwork, plus drunks require a constant watch when in cells - which means every 30 minutes.

I'm afraid I don't have a citation as evidence, but this is first hand what I see year in year out:

A minor point once you understand the rest of the work I see is that this '12 weeks off' is enforced and the only time a teacher can go on holiday (making it twice as expensive should they choose to, not like the parents who have started taking kids out of lessons to get a cheaper deal)... anyway, on with the show...

A lot of half term weeks is spent marking and lesson planning, the first two weeks of Summer holidays are spent ill from the bug they've been holding off for the last push through to the end of term and recovering from the huge workload and pressure they've been under for the entirety of the school year, especially with recent all too regular changes in curriculum. 

The last two weeks of Summer at least are then spent preparing for the next terms lessons, collating results data and planning not to mention the days and evenings they put in during term time and holidays (unpaid I should add) with parents evenings, extra tuition during lunch or after school for kids just because they care and want them to do well, running other activities after school and weekends, organising and running trips important to their subject and general education (including evenings when it's a few days away - that's 24 hour care of someone else's kids for a few days), going in to support kids on exam results days. Then we'll factor in behaviour management and receiving abuse from parents and children alike (a minority of course), and throw in a smidgeon of being vilified and demoralised regularly by the government for doing a job the vast majority of them are passionate about.

I think him dropping is useless without a second striker on the pitch to keep the CenterBacks on their toes. He can certainly hit them from far but when he drops out the whole defensive line can follow as he's the only threat down the middle without a tiki-taka chance.

Him holding centrally is very traditional but keeps their entire backline so compact that he really doesn't have any chances. It can open up space for others but really the backline is forced from his threat into a good position to break down most attacks. There were so many times during the everton match where we had the ball down the wings and mario was just holding static in the middle and the cross came in. A drop of the shoulder and run to the near post or far post or anywhere is absolutely needed and he will drag defenders with him. 

Other than that I thought Mario played very well against Everton. He put in work and that's what Liverpool wants. Players that work for each other. ",0,1412085468,null,0,false,0,ckwhzqp,t3_2hv90t,t1_ckwhzqp,t3_2hv90t,null,1426753881,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

No, it really doesn't.  It does not require more complex arithmetic to add up imperial units, arithmetic isn't about remembering how specific numbers can have operators applied to them, it is about remembering what the operators do and applying general methods of using them.  No more skill is needed to add up imperial units than is needed by metric units, since it is the same bloody rules...

The only difference between metric and imperial units is that in one you are operating under the formally defined base-10, whilst in the other you are operating under a base that was pulled out of some English bureaucrat's arse...

Infact I don't think any of our under 21's team are good enough to be in the first team right now, so I guess I think they're all talentless, right?

When did I imply we need a 3rd world class full-back? Does saying I don't want a 19 year old who lacks experience and quality(atm) imply that to you? City have Zabaleta, Kolorov, Sagna and Clichy. Arsenal have Gibbs, Monreal, Debuchy and Chambers. Liverpool have Moreno, Manquillo, Johnson and Enrique. Yet you some how believe Luis, Azpi and Ake is adeqaute?

By my logic Mikel shouldn't be in the team? How is that my logic? That's you putting words into my mouth again... Mikel is good at what he does, is experienced and has the trophies to prove it. If Mikel wasn't playing for us he'd be playing for another Premier League team or a team in one of the top leagues. If Ake wasn't playing for us he'd be snatched up by someone and loaned out to a Championship side, the only reason we haven't loaned him out to a Championship side is because we lack homegrown players.

Do you have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or post inflammatory erythema (PIE) or both? The drug you mention is an antibiotic so for active acne, it is not for hyperpigmentation or erythema.

Please list the medical treatments that have tried and failed, also your full skincare routine including brands and ideally a link to full ingredients lists. Moisturiser and sunscreen are important. Aloe is soothing and a humectant but not a balanced moisturiser, and some components may increase UV sensitivity. PIH is worsened by UV exposure.

It rarely does any harm to overhaul your diet and lifestyle, ensuring you **consistently meet or exceed ALL** our government's recommendations for healthy eating and living. I work in the field and very rarely see a new client who does. Remember they are merely minimums/ maximums, far from being ideals or optimal. If you are 'hardly going out' I wonder if you are meeting the physical activity requirements or regularly getting vitamin D from midday sunlight,for example (broad spectrum physical sunscreen on your acne/ exposure on arms etc).

**Clinical depression must be discussed with your family doctor, and should be cause for a swifter referral to a dermatologist, ditto scarring.** Research suggests mild to moderate responds well to diet and lifestyle modification. Severe deperession is an indication for prescription medication.

Also check out our Wiki entries on niacinamide and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (derivative of vitamin C). These are particularly useful in both acne and hyperpigmentation.

Obviously not the worst damage in the world, but I do like my car and I have been taking good care of it since buying it just few months ago.

Pretty clear (at least to me) that whoever parked this had no idea how long the nose of the car was, underestimated and hit something straight on. Damage is to the paint, bumper clips and headlight lugs.

From the website: ""On arrival, pull up in the dedicated arrival bays, go straight to reception and hand in your keys in exchange for a receipt. Your car will be parked for you by one of our professional and fully insured drivers.""

To anyone thinking of using this car park, I would STRONGLY advise against it. You aren't given anything to sign, nor do they check the car on arrival. Since they don't check the car and you don't sign anything I doubt you have a leg to stand on legally. I would have used the other car park where you park the car yourself, but it was full. I did take note of the mileage, just did this in &lt; 1 mile, but at 7am after a 10 hour flight, needing to get to work I was in enough of a hurry not to notice approaching it from the rear before leaving.

My car was photographed on the way in, since it's how the barrier is raised. I would really like the photo since it was likely of the number plate and the damage is right above. 

To those blaming the car and my driving. If you know anything about TCS, you'll know they are intended to stop over and under-steering, i.e. problems around corners especially like where the back end slips out from too much power. The damage is literally slap bang on the nose, it's obviously from parking, I can assure you I know how to park it daily without bouncing off objects :)

- He moved from the Mexican league to Portugal relatively late (24/25 years old)

- He plays for Porto, who on their very, very best day are a colossal pain in the ass to deal with when it comes to negotiations.

- He has a monster release clause (~£31m) for a player with so little time in Europe.

If you a club it is hard to justify dropping £31m on a player who has a small track record in Europe and who is owned by one of the most miserable clubs in all of Europe to negotiate with. So you have teams that may take a quick look at him and then decide to look in a different direction because of all the other shit they would have to deal with to get him.

Given that it looks like 3rd party ownership is going to be a thing of the past in Europe moving forward and given that Porto has taken advantage of the 3rd party system to get in high end talent for years i would presume that they will be even more difficult to deal with in the near future as they attempt to drag out every possible bit of money for all of their players while they adjust to having to purchase replacement talent at full price.",0,1412086518,null,0,false,0,ckwifhc,t3_2hvpc9,t1_ckwifhc,t1_ckwg70s,null,1426753677,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Those things are about the most capital-intensive product available, and what's more, the end product of nuclear weapons deployment - as well as being a genocidal obscenity - is pure waste material. You can hire those same people to do pretty much *any other form of human endeavour, no matter what it is* and it will turn out to be a lot cheaper per person employed.

Haha. Real answer. I am highly allergic to the sun (in the UK anyway) so I don't sunbathe or sit out in it much. Also, if I don't take care of my skin in the winter months, it cracks and bleeds and I get lizard skin, so I have to moisturise from head to toe fully every day. My sister who is four years older than me has perma lines around her eyes and her skin's ageing prematurely; she's only happy when her skin is virtually frying and will spend all day every day sunbathing when on holiday. I've never done that. Luckily it bores the shit out of me and I'm used to being bluey-white anyway, so it doesn't matter to me. I do look nice with a bit of a tan (and you can do some spectacular makeup when tanned), but I really don't care much about it.

 In all honesty, though, so much of our defensive problems involve Mingolet. His positioning is poor, as is his decision making regarding when he chooses to come out to meet a ball. On top of that, he doesn't seem to communicate with the defenders very well. The 'keeper often has the best view of potential danger, and it's part of his job to organise the defence.

Can you do better than this on another network? Your position will be much stronger if you have an alternative to threaten (although O2 basically said ""bye"" when I told them I was leaving)

&gt; They called me up today regarding my upgrade and despite insisting I want to pay the same or around the same as I currently am for the same plan, he told me that the best deal I can get is 300 mins, Unlimited texts + Data with an Acer Liquid E3 for £20 a month. I'd probably just sell the phone, **because I already own a better one**, 

Have you considered SIM only deals to try and haggle on one of those if you want to keep your phone


&gt; my question is really just if there's any action I can take to force them to lower their price. 

No. You won't be able to force them to do anything. I'd ask to speak to a manager of a supervisor - someone who has authorisation to change your bill in your favour.

&gt; The deal they're offering me is the exact same as the one they offer to any customer, new or existing, so it's rather disappointing they don't recognise the fact I've been a customer with them for almost 7 years but they don't seem to be that fussed at retaining me.

Remember, the IRA needed to gather intelligence about it's enemies and look after it's own members, and it's not going to be able to do that without some sort of paperwork system. If you want to spot informers in your own ranks or keep tabs on the bad guys, you need a central point to correlate information. As an added bonus, we might even end up with an official history of the Provisional IRA at some point.

The real reason is likely a matter partly of perception - for the most part, HET inquiries into the security services are likely to hit the headlines whereas the others don't - and partly that the vast bulk of IRA killings are noncontroversial anyways - someone was murdered, the IRA admitted it, the only real issue is nailing the actual individuals who carried out the attack. The IRA wouldn't have much need to lie about the bulk of their killings (other than the likes of the 'disappeared' or a few of their worst crimes, like Kingsmills or Birmingham, about which they kept shtum).

With the security services, they were held to a higher standard - law and order and rules of engagement, and all that stuff, so there was more room for controversy.  The RUC or the British Army couldn't just gun someone down and simply claim responsibility, the way that the paramilitaries would - in the cases where someone was killed outwith the rules, there would inevitably be lying and coverups and attempts to justify the attack and all that stuff, which would make them more investigation-worthy. And of course, even in cases where that wasn't the case, any ambiguity would still be seized upon by propagandists opposed to the security services, and that, too, would likely warrant some sort of investigation.

GiffGaff offer a sim only deal with 200 minutes, unlimited texts + data for £12 a month, and it's a rolling contract. However, their coverage checker for my area is spotty at best.

&gt; Have you considered SIM only deals to try and haggle on one of those if you want to keep your phone

Yes, their cheapest SIM only deal with unlimited data (which is the only big deal for me, really) is £15 a month. It's a 12 month contract rather than a 24, but I'd probably end up sticking around after the 12 month period anyway, they give me good service.

&gt; Have you considered telling them this? How much you want to stay with Three but this deal is not good enough.

I did mention this initially, and he said my current deal is very lucrative and I'm lucky to have it in the first place.

&gt;Kalas and Zouma are far to young to rely on them as starters. Varane is the only one in that age bracket you could see starting week in week out. Cahill has to step up in his leadership on the pitch.  I guess it is partly not his fault as Terry basically solely commands what to do. I think is Terry does leave, Cahill will step up as he knows the responsibility (and possibly captaincy) is with him.

England is doing us a massive favor by giving vice captaincy to Cahill. I think it would be a good transition. When Terry is not there, Cahill is the one organizing the defence as of late. I think Branislove could be used as a stopgap, with Kalas moving in later on. If we do sign a defender, I think a player like Otamendi could work wonders. He has really been impressive with Valencia so far, and Valencia are in a very shake-y financial position. Other players that come up are Papado-whatever from schalke.

false,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Pretty clear that London being the new tax haven for oligarchs says to me we have to do something about the lack of tax payed by multi-national corporations more than individual rich people.

There looks to be a couple of ideas there, so let's try looking at some of them.  Are these oligarchs actually domiciled here?  Nope.  As such they pay their income tax elsewhere.  We get say council tax, VAT on anything they spend (and are unable to claim back when exiting).  We could improve this, have Land Value Tax, one that penalises lack of utilisation, this might improve housing capacity too.

So we now have the idea of taxing multi-national corporations, but how do you realistically do that without major international support?  It becomes rather reminiscent of the prisoners dilemma.  Only the option for betray is openly shouted by many in the democratic process, this I think would be a really fun exercise in game theory to look at.  By that I mean, it's not going to happen, it's infeasible.  We also don't really want to close our borders to countries, that doesn't really bode well for long term global integration.

If you are running an organisation, you have to be focused on controlling money going out, you can not get tempted to start spending potential money you could maybe raise.  Given that a Land Value Tax in one form cost a previous Tory party leader their job, I doubt we will see another.

As a general rule of thumb, in most ambulance services, at least one person on an ambulance will be a technician or a Paramedic. If you're a caller with a legitimately life threatening call then you're almost definitely going to get a Paramedic unless there's significant service pressure at the time. If you get an ambulance with three people on it, one of them is probably a university student studying the registration degree to be a Paramedic. 

Doctors relatively rarely respond to 999 calls, and if they do it'll normally be in one of two ways: 
HEMS, the air ambulance, is staffed by trauma specialist Paramedics with or without a specialist HEMS doctor (typically a registrar or consultant with additional prehospital training.)

BASICS (The British Association for Immediate Care) doctors are volunteer doctors with additional prehospital training who respond typically at the request of a crew or if a crew is a long way away to provide support with medication regimes that Paramedics are not permitted to give of their own accord (sedatives etc.)

There are also  some nurses with additional training who can respond by car as part of ambulance services, depending on the trust.

A 17 year old Royal Navy Able Seaman fresh out of sub training could literally be the guy who presses the button to launch a nuclear weapon that kills millions... but it isn't something he does alone, and clearly there are processes in place to make sure that at the end of the day, all he has to do is press a button when someone more experienced and senior tells him, which shouldn't be taxing even for a very junior sailor.

Nursing is similar in this respect, hospitals are set up with processes in place to minimize errors, maximize patient safety and delegate responsibility in a way that is safe. So the nurse who administers a dangerous drug isn't doing it in isolation - the drug was prescribed by a doctor, checked by a pharmacist, double checked to ensure its in date etc. by the pharmacy technician that delivered it to the ward... then the drug itself is checked by a suitably competent nurse and double checked by another nurse prior to being administered, and some nurses won't even be allowed to deal with the drug until they have the appropriate training in-job. (i.e. although all nurses should have at some point been trained to administer IV medicines, not all will be competent to do this within their specific job until they've been trained up to their specific employers standard).

So yes, there is responsibility. But I'm not really sure to what extent that influences, or rather should influence, the pay aspect of the job... since nurses should be competent to handle the responsibility required (hence the 3 years training prior, and in-job training) and are shielded in that responsibility by other people as well, so they aren't really carrying the full weight of the world alone (despite what I'm sure it must feel like).

I think in this thread some people are conflating jobs that are socially worthy with jobs that ought to be paid more. The two arguments don't necessarily logically follow each other though. Being a nurse requires responsibility yes. So do lots of jobs. That also is one of the reasons being a nurse commands some respect from society... but it doesn't necessarily command higher pay simply because its morally worthy and involves responsibility.",0,1412090577,null,0,false,0,ckwkbqu,t3_2hvfps,t1_ckwkbqu,t1_ckwjvsw,null,1426752792,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I agree with you care work should be paid higher - and I would argue the level ought to be closer to £8-10 an hour for an NVQ qualified carer, and perhaps about £7.50 for a starter, depending on regional variations and all that. 

Nursing, as I mentioned elsewhere, I think is actually fairly paid. £21k starting salary with minimal or no debt, access to the NHS pension scheme, shift variety and the ability to pick up highly lucrative extra/agency shifts - as well as the ability to move jobs to anywhere in the UK even at short notice, key worker status etc. As much as its a morally worthy and respectable job, I'm not sure the pay is really as bad as some make out.

The Able Seaman may be pressing the button, but he's not doing what a nurse does (to stick strictly with your analogy.)

He is compelled the press the button. His job is not to choose, or to understand the choices . Responsibility is not delegated to the Seaman insofar as he is only the means to an end as part of the greater process.

In their role, the nurse retains agency. They can and in order to be effective occasionally must stand against that line of authority, consider the checks and balances and then still take it upon themselves to say no. That is the distinguishing factor. Healthcare professionals from the moment of their registration are not simply required to carry out instructions from persons more qualified, but also critically assess and challenge those instructions in the interests of their patients. 

I don't really give a toss about if nurses are nice or not, but the requirements of their baseline skillset extends beyond the vast majority of graduate jobs in the UK at entry level; and that is why their level of pay is at the very least justified.

She was complaining about her slightly better than minimum wage office job and I was saying how if you stick out a lot of jobs and move up through the office you can access much better positions even after as little as 1-2 years in high turnover places. Often those positions aren't jobs that usually get advertised (i.e. they only recruit internally) - for positions like team leaders. They also tend to be quite a bit more comfortable. For example in a call centre I worked in at college one girl who stayed on full time managed to leap-frog into HR director! Another person became ""head of training"", and these were girls who literally took debit card details over the phone for a furniture company prior to that. Then as soon as they can put ""HR Director"" on their CV it opens up a whole new line of jobs that would never have been available to them before. 

I was making the case that the job you apply for isn't necessarily the job you should set your sights on forever. Sometimes its worth biting the bullet to get through the door to get access to the nicer ""upstairs"" jobs. Unfortunately you have to be quite proactive to get those kind of jobs, and once you get them you need to carve out your territory so nobody else can get past you.

Is ridiculous when (our previous example and my favourite Caribbean island) only 80% of Jamaicans have access to adequate sanitation!

Loyalists make a big fetish out of flying the Union Jack over their neighbourhoods and painting kerbstones in red, white and blue, and this sort of thing happens in Nationalist neighbourhoods too with the Irish tricolour. A couple years back, there were huge protests and the odd riot in Belfast, when the council - split almost evenly between nationalists and unionists with the nonaligned 'Alliance' party holding the balance of power - voted for the Alliance policy of flying the Union flag only on certain 'designated days' (thus putting Belfast in line with the British mainland). Flags are a Big Thing in Northern Ireland - before the troubles, the late Ian Paisley even started off his political career getting Irish flags removed from shop windows in the 1960s.

So yes, flags are contentious, but what's happened here is that a number of nationalists have taken to flying the Palestinian flag, since they see parallels between the Palestinian struggle for self determination and their own fight for Irish unification (there's aspects of anti-colonialism and occupation in both fights, if you have your political goggles aligned that way). With Northern Ireland, hating on something the other guys like, purely because they like it, is pretty much an entire way of life, and so some Loyalists have taken to flying the Israeli flag in retaliation. So the identification game is roughly Nationalists-&gt;Arabs, Unionists-&gt;Israelis these days.

So what likely happened here is that some Loyalist, with limited cognitive and vexillological capabilities, saw a flag he didn't recognise, decided it somehow must be 'Arabic' (of course - what else?) and called the police, presumably on the grounds that he thinks they'd automatically side with him to crack the heads of the guys from the other side without specific reference to the law (suggesting that the complainer is likely an older gentleman from a time when the Northern Irish police were inclined to do just that).

On a brighter note, the beech trees are covered in nuts this year so those are also worth a try. I can't say they taste all that great compared to other nuts and they're quite fiddly but it's something you can tick off on your list.

So according to the Bechdel test, a sexist writer can absolutely write stories that are ""not sexist"". Although I would argue that the bechdel test absolutely does not prove whether a story is sexist or not. Just look at Pacific Rim, Mako Mori is a strong female lead character who's story arc does not resolve in a romance with the male lead. She has a completely independent character arc from the main character, but Pacific Rim fails the Bechdel test.

Clara - I think after the finale, he tries to make sure she has foundation in both lives since he knows what traveling through time and do to humans.

Would we both be racist or just me? Would one be a baseless accusation and the other based on statistics/a survey? I think you were very unkind to the point of racism and so far you have not apologised. 

I can apologise for my demeanor in this conversation but cannot apologise for facts. Your belief that not washing hands every time == nasty is based on your feelings. Your emotional response to that /r/TIL post was of disgust, disgust that re-affirmed your racism. 

I guess it would be ad hominem to say you cannot think less of Britons when your own position is no better but I am implying that it is hateful and fruitless to demean and insult another group just because you can. 

Historically, your belief is tenuous; though British sailors appeared in India smelly and unkempt, Britons rapidly adopted their hygiene customs. The British were (one of) the first to subscribe to germ theory and Florence Nightingale pioneered battlefield medical sanitary.

false,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; You seem to be arguing that it's OK for nurses to be poorly paid

No, not at all, you've completely misunderstood. **I'm arguing nurses aren't poorly paid**.

&gt; because they have the option of supplementing their income with bank/agency work.

I'm suggesting the ability to earn £25 an hour by picking up the occasional **entirely optional** extra shift is a job perk. There are many jobs where you simply cannot pickup extra hours and certainly not ones that pay the equivalent of twice your normal hourly rate. In the same sense that the relatively short training time, low training cost, availability of work and job safety are also perks.

&gt; I usually worked at least a couple of hours over my shift or came in early.

Unpaid hours are a huge issue in the NHS and I have some sympathy on this. Staff should not be silently subsidizing the NHS simply because the organization won't pay for adequate staffing.  In my experience of working in several departments it seems to vary enormously based on the department itself. Some are very good at getting people out the door on time, and others aren't. The ones that are good at it tend to be good at it because effective handover is part of their ingrained ethos, whereas in other areas its not. Having said that, pay is annual rather than hourly so staff need to be mindful of the hours they are putting in. Quite often I hear people bemoan it, but they don't actually raise it as a formal issue. But this is perhaps getting sidetracked into wider issues in the NHS. And indeed, **the NHS isn't the be all and end all of nursing**, and this thread is about salaries not NHS nursing. 

I think you're compounding the fact nursing is stressful (physically AND mentality) with it being underpaid, which I don't agree it is. 

As I said elsewhere, salaries are reached through a supply:demand combination of the jobs requirement, the number of people skilled and available to do it (and by extension the training time and prerequisites required) and peoples preparedness to do the work for a set price. The fact a job is stressful or morally worthy rarely translate into higher pay. However, while nurses may not enjoy pay for their stress they do enjoy a high degree of public respect for it and the intangible benefits that brings (or the more tangible ones like keyworker status).

Assuming you are a Basic Rate taxpayer or less, for every £1 you invest in your pension, the government will add 25p. That's a quarter of your payment.

If you become a Higher Rate taxpayer, the government will (effectively; it's complicated) add 66p to your £1; and they will allow you to earn £1.66 more as salary before you start paying Higher Rate tax, which saves you even more.

Your employer will eventually have to contribute towards your pension as well. Yet more ""free"" money for your pot.

The pension fund grows tax free (the fund cannot claim back any tax paid on dividends earned in the fund, but that's a minor issue in the scheme of things), which is saving you *up to* 20% in Income Tax and all Capital Gains Tax that might be payable. Only ISAs are taxed similarly, unless you start getting into, um, more exotic investments.

However, the most important thing when it comes to retirement planning is time. The sooner you start to save, the more you will have at the end and the less you will have needed to save to get there. Paraphrasing here: timing the market is not important - it's time IN the market that makes a difference. I don't have any stats with me, but I used to be able to produce quotes based on FSA percentages that demonstrated the cost of saving towards a target effectively doubled every 5 or so years. Using a very simple example:

- You have a target of (let's say) £1,000
- You have 20 years to get there
- At an assumed growth rate, let's say it will cost you £2.50 pm
- If you wait 5 years before starting, it will cost you £5.00 pm
- If you wait 10 years before starting, it will cost you £10.00 pm
- If you wait 15 years before starting, it will cost you £20.00 pm

When you reach 65, 70 or older, you may decide to (or be forced to) retire. You will have started your 52 week *unpaid* holiday. How much fun that holiday will be depends on how young you were when you started saving for it.

Also, it's important to note that last season under AVB we had the least pressing in ratio to how high up we played in all of Europe (i.e we stayed high up the pitch but never looked to win the ball back in the defensive phase). This is probably the main reason for the heavy defeats, because lack of pressing with the high line left constant spaces and enough time to find the through balls easily.

false,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; Why the need to reinvent the companion as someone who also has their own life?

Ever since the reboot, the series have focused more on the lives of the companions than ever.  Rose's boyfriend, Donna's family, Amy and Rory, etc.  BBC is really afraid of casting a Doctor people won't like, so they want the companions to be what viewers like and identify with instead.  Thus, the companions have largely all been ""modern day"" companions.

Furthermore, Doctor Who's production group has become addicted to doing location shoots.  If the go to an alien planet, they have to build sets or do expensive CGI (like parts of last episode).  Building new sets every week is time-consuming and expensive in the sense that you don't get to re-use them usually.  (Redressing of sets is a bit of a lost art; the last show that did a lot of it that I remember was Stargate: SG-1.)  This leads to cheap-looking sets, which look really bad now that the show has switched to HD.

So the vast majority of your shoots are now on location, which generally means you're restricted to the UK, which means most of your stories are going to have to be on Earth and often set in the ""modern day"".  Since your companions are also ""modern day"", it's convenient then to involve their personal lives, family, friends, etc. in the story.

&gt; Besides, I refuse to believe that the Doctor could return Clara to the exact instant they left, perfectly, every time.

The Doctor's ability to pilot the TARDIS changes as needed for the writer's convenience.

Someone wealthy 200 years ago, would be in our idea of poverty (UK!) today, they'd lack basic sanitation, health etc.  We often crudely define poverty a lower percentile, but that's again not really fair.

One of the greatest things I've seen is adoption of the internet, it went from being incredibly expensive, to so cheap I've got friends in *developing* countries who earn peanuts (&lt;£10 per day, for a household), I can skype.  I've even set up my mum teaching their child English (which funnily enough is something I've been meaning to work on, a project that connects OAPs with people wanting to learn).  We live in an age you can buy a rather decent computing device for the same price as 100 mars bars.  It's also looking like it's just getting better.

The technology is a great way of looking at this.  Like many round here I've a gaming PC, it's pretty kick ass if I say so myself, I can play many games at high resolution.  I could have a machine for maybe a tenth of the price, it could probably play the same damned games, just at a lower resolution.  Yet the raw measure of power would be a geometric difference (the computing power required to jump a resolution is more than just difference of squares!).

This is the point I am making, that wealth inequality and poverty are not directly linked.  Take someone living in a £5M apartment in London, are they 100 times better off than someone living in a £50k place in the countryside?  Some might argue the quality of life is better.

&gt;But, no, you're right. Only 'angry leftists' have a problem here.

Because anyone who looks at inequality measures globally quickly see's that places they'd probably not want to live, have less inequality.  Unless they are the super angry lefty type.
