It's called insinuation. Look it up.

&gt; Sometimes what you take from a message is more reflection of self than the other person.

So I'm saying that I personally need a defensive midfielder? Because I've already stated that I personally don't use labels like good or bad fans, so it can't be that.

&gt; Vitally need a DM? Name the wingers in the Liverpool squad.

Why? What does that prove? It's about reliance and importance not just numbers. We have few problems going forward but defensively we are thin in the midfield.

&gt; For DM, we have Allen, Gerrard and Lucas.

Like I've already said we have little problem scoring goals and in the final third, very few people if any think we need another attacker:

""Whether he's vital to the team at this present time in the position that he plays remains to be seen"" - Jamie Carragher on Konoplyanka.

Everyone agrees we need to strengthen the midfield, Allen is a good midfielder but is not great defensively, Gerrard has had mixed results in his new holding role, and Lucas is injured.

&gt;  I don't think it is as bad as our lack of wingers. 

Well luckily for the rest of us it doesn't matter what you think. Liverpool don't even rely on wingers in the traditional sense, we are a passing team, not a crossing team. That's why Coutinho is played on the left so often and Sterling can switch wings, they rely on passing and pace to link up with the center forwards not bombing down the wing to cross the ball in. I wish we got Konoplyanka, but we don't need him urgently, and no one thinks we do.",0,1391313413,null,0,false,0,cf4vc8g,t3_1wq54h,t1_cf4vc8g,t1_cf4tfhm,null,1432213767,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I'd say both would benefit from further devolution and an ability to pursue their own best interests. If devo max were on the table Scotland would probably be better off within the union. As it's not, independence is probably better than the status quo. 

But also, smaller countries tend to be better governed. There's piles of evidence to back up the claim that the optimum size is somewhere between 5 and 10 million people. Strong regional government trumps strong central government and both tend to be trumped by small independent states.

Simplistically, the economic argument only really matters in the short term. We can't predict too far out and the economics will depend on how well the country is governed. For me, there's the realisation that Westminster can't always put Scotland's interests first. A Scottish government could.

* IRL, this episode was written before the notion of a War Doctor was created. Moffat wrote this episode with the idea that the Doctor was going to have one more regeneration after Matt Smith.

* In the universe, the Doctor needed to die at Lake Silencio. The Silence knew about the Time Lord's ability to regenerate. The Silence would not know if this was the last time. They needed a full show to be convinced.

* Who was on the Beach instead of the Doctor? The Teselecta, a race of Time Traveling Miniature Humans who go after criminals from different time periods to punish them, lent the Doctor one of their ships. He was inside the suit.

* Why did the Teselecta know to do that? They were in the room with Melody Pond when she transformed into River Song. They assumed this was part of the process. Also, the Doctor was inside the suit directing.

* How would the know how to copy it exactly? They have on staff a woman that prides herself on getting things perfect. She would want it done perfectly.

* Why did the Teselecta allow one of their suits to be used for this ruse? Having the Doctor owe them a favor is probably more valuable than a suit.

* How can the Teselecta fake that kind of energy? The first time we saw them, they faked a motorbike. Why would faking time energy be any more impossible?",0,1391317990,null,0,1391318392,0,cf4wz41,t3_1wsa2g,t1_cf4wz41,t3_1wsa2g,null,1435506812,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

McDermott probably said he didn't want them and they argued. We all know that McDermott is a bit of a straight shooter, he's a principled man who doesn't compromise his views. This went against Cellino's way of micromanaging football teams from the top and he was sacked. I believe he may not have had the original intention to sack him but in the end thought it was necessary as their two styles did not mix.

I also very much doubt the board would've sacked Paul Hunt and let Haigh walk if they'd discussed the sacking together.

I can see this game screaming park the bus and play counter attacks. But I can also picture Chelsea owning a bit of possession. I am confident in Chelsea's defense. But I am also confident in cities offense. I predict, sadly. A 2-1 defeat. 

Ways we can break my prediction. 

1.matic just rapes ya ya in the midfield. 
2. Negrado and dzeko have off days. 
3. Another bad back pass from that defense to hart ;) 

Hope my prediction is wrong and we can get the 3 points. But my realist point of view is killing me in this matchup.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"In almost all release and buyout clauses it is the player that is making the payment, not the club - so it has to be paid in a lump sum.

In almost all release clause or buyout clause signings the clause isn't formally activated, instead what happens is the clubs just agree to do a normal transfer at the same fee, to save on giving the money to the player, having them pay it, etc. You can count the examples of a release clause actually being activated on one hand - eg. Javi Martinez was one. But in most other cases it is just a club-to-club transfer that just happens to be the same fee as the release or buyout clause.

This is the 'gentleman's agreement' part of how football transfers work. Clubs could be dicks to each other, but it will usually come back to bite them in the future, so most work out the deals amicably. Release clause and buyout clause deals are also *extremely* complicated, especially when the clubs involved are from two different nations. There are only a handful of agents who specialize in pulling them off, since there are many legal and tax implications involved.

So all that considered, it isn't so unreasonable for the Dnipro president to request that the payment be made at once, in the same way it would have been had the buyout clause been triggered formally. From his perspective he is already doing Liverpool a favor by agreeing to do the deal at the same fee as the buyout clause, but saving them from having to formally activate it - which would likely take weeks to pull off and would in any case require Liverpool to make a full payment (plus taxes).",0,1391325433,null,0,false,0,cf4z8w4,t3_1wq37h,t1_cf4z8w4,t1_cf4ktms,null,1432215570,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Yet I think I know what the issue is. It wasn't the sudden change, it was the pacing of the last few seconds. Bear with me for a second but for the entire scene, it's played in a very slow manner.

Yet as he's starting to change, it begins to cut between Clara and the Doctor fairly fast. To the point where it's actually a bit too fast.

Yes, it was shown during his speech, but when he leans back, the energy is glowing all around him.

I mean, certainly most critics have some connection or another to art academia, and often praise seems overblown to the casual observer, but I don't think there's any shame in being educated on a subject. Certainly when every third piece is 'transcendent' I think the critic needs a thesaurus, but expertise is merely passion + time + effort. Reading and studying artists allows one to discern the subtle differences between them, and be able to contextualize pieces historically, aesthetically, and with regards to their respective art movements.

It's much like any other pursuit. If I try a lot of different kinds of coffee, paying attention to the country of origin, preparation method and ingredients, I'll start to recognize trends and develop my personal palate. The casual coffee drinker might not be able to tell the difference between a Colombian coffee and a Brazilian one, but a coffee connoisseur certainly can. The same goes for wine, or cheese, or chocolate, or any number of things. But people are rarely criticized as 'elitist', 'out of touch' or 'pretentious' for being educated and passionate about coffee, and having invested time into studying and enjoying it. The tastes of critics might not overlap with those of the public at large, and that's fine, but it's inappropriate in my opinion for the public to decry experts.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"One of the reasons (some of) Hirst's art is interesting is because he examines through his work the nature of the art market. He's one of the few artists that I know of who is thoroughly modern in that he incorporates the finance aspect of contemporary art into his work. I mentioned For the Love of God; no matter the critical and public opinion of Hirst's work, the materials (platinum and diamond) mean that piece will always have an extremely high valuation, even if you intended to dismantle it and sell the bits. The human skull is in financial terms the least valuable part by far, and that is, I think, what Hirst wants us to consider. A human being died, and it's the platinum and diamond, the adornment, the cost of those things, which gets all the attention. It's sad, and it reflects the distorted sense of worth that permeates modern society where the end of a human life is so easily overlooked. Much of Hirst's work reflects on these issues. In having his concepts produced in a workshop by other people (in part because he lacks the craft ability to do some of the things he wants to do by his own hand), he turns his art into an art industry of its own. A logical offshoot from a larger market which treats works of art as though they are commodities produced to be traded. I'm not a huge fan of Hirst's work, but I do think he is misunderstood a lot of the time.

I would argue that what is happening to the art world as far as commodity trading goes (and what is a piece of art if not a commodity, nowadays?) is an inevitable result of existing within a capitalist society.

true,user_naem,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"The Government wants to improve its borrowing figures (which government doesn't?). Student loans are a problem because the government has to front the cash which comes straight from the deficit. The obvious answer is to fund the student loans company using private money rather than fat cheques from HM Treasury. But private investors don't want to lend to students as the T&amp;Cs are not what you would call commercial. In particular you can have below inflation interest rates very easily for most loans currently in repayment.

The question, then, is how to improve the terms of the loans so that investors will fund them. The government could just change the regulations so that the rate of interest is commercial; they have the power to apply this to loans currently in repayment. They could do this, but they won't, as every student and their parents would never, ever, vote Tory for as long as they shall live. 

The ""synthetic hedge"" idea is to create a layer between students paying back their loans and investors collecting the repayments. You'd have something like ""UK Student Loans Refinancing Co (2002)"" set up, which would receive repayments from students and then pass them on to investors; the right to receive such payments having been sold for huge amounts before an election. The layer would be underwritten by the government (i.e., us) and would ensure that the rate of interest effectively received by investors is agreeable, even if the actual rate paid by students is not.

If not we will probably need him bearing in mind we'll be in Europe and have more games to play.

Borini will come back as backup striker or a guy who will play out wide and cut inside. His tracking back is excellent. I witnessed him making a goal line clearance yesterday. Great to see. He looks confident for Sunderland. No reason why he can't be the same for us.

Wisdom returning may see the end for Kelly. It's probably the right decision. He hasn't looked the same since he came back and is at an age where it's make or break for his career. I can see him moving to a higher ecehelon Championship team or low/mid Prem side and hopefully doing well. Wisdom has progressed nicely at Derby and will give us cover at RB/CB. He may sneak ahead of Toure in the backup stakes if he kicks arse in training!

With Borini coming back and us likely to move for another attacker/wide player in the summer (Kono?) I would sell on Assaidi and Aspas. Tbh if Moses can keep playing well i'd rather we kept him over those two. Assaidi is similar to Moses in that they're both hit and miss yet he's much older. Aspas just isn't cut out for the Prem.

It is physically impossible¹ for their ISP to see what's going through their VPN.

I guess what's happening is their computer is configured so that only some of their traffic was going through the VPN - as others have said, what you're seeing is TalkTalk's DNS service.

Thinking about it, it would make sense for the PC to route only external IP addresses through the VPN, and not requests to the internal network (i.e. 192.168.x.y).

That would ensure that you could have the VPN set up and still do things like use files shared on another PC in the house, and print to a networked LaserJet. When you try and stream a movie from your media NAS server to your PS3, you wouldn't want that data going via the VPN.  

So the router will be set up by default to serve DNS to all PCs on the LAN - to issue their IP addresses by DHCP and to tell them ""get your address resolution from me"".

Each PC will be set up, therefore, to use the router for DNS… and the router will get its DNS from the ISP by default. Since the router is a local IP address ([192.168.1.1](https://help2.talktalk.co.uk/setup-support/how-do-i-find-or-change-my-wireless-network-name-and-password)) the PC won't route the DNS request via the internet, via the VPN.

Thus TalkTalk can presumably see what websites they're looking up, but not what data they're sending.

If your buddy fires up BitTorrent, then TalkTalk will know that they looked up [router.bittorrent.com or router.utorrent.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181301/how-does-a-dht-in-a-bittorent-client-get-bootstrapped) ([more info](http://superuser.com/a/592244)) but TalkTalk won't know what  data he transmitted to 67.215.242.138, or whether he even *did* contact that site after looking up its IP.

Hope this helps. I've only set up VPNs on two occasions, and it was a while ago, so I'm going off fading memory and figuring out what makes sense. But I'm pretty sure it's right.

Your friend just needs to change the address his computers use for DNS resolution (e.g. each PC could use [8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) to stop TalkTalk learning what sites he's looking up. Because those are external addresses, and not on the LAN, they'll be routed through the VPN.

true,[deleted],null,null,"An interesting analogy. However, i kind of meant the bespoke words used to describe art by institutions and certainly some criticism. If we're talking about art's popular image then I think the impenetrability of how it speaks sometimes is a viable concern. Especially when work can be so unassuming to the untrained eye. It could be sometimes that this indirect mode of speaking does offer some challenge to the audience seeking a deeper meaning of the work, believing in it as a viable translation. But even as a regular visitor and art student it seems sometimes as if the obtuse way of wording stuff is being deliberately pretentious and you have to read between the lines or just ignore it altogether.

Being educated isn't bad no, pretty much most of the art community has been taught by one institution or another, but if art is entertainment, then reading some stuff about art is what? Sadomasochism? It does seem that art closets itself too easily sometimes. After many schemes of work that have attempted to be more open to outsiders; like pop art which was unthinkable to then contemporary critics, art just crawls back for those that do visit galleries often and dismisses those with an insightful albeit repetitive criticism that contemporary art is shit instead of trying to be inclusive and a bit more simple with its terminology. It's not the root cause of its impenetrability but it is a good reason. This is a bit populist to be sure and I'm not calling a halt to all criticism with a verbose nature, but after all the demagoguery of the state controlling art and how that was bad, especially for people who thought like Greenberg. There was an ironic failure in through escaping the state, it has for the past 70 odd years been under the thumb and interest of a select group of people. Whether that be merely critics, the avant grade, whoever. And that's not to say actually that the control that the art industry has is not sometimes beneficial, but as you say that control is a bit of a hang-up. Especially when art seems so open now. Or at least potentially open, reading Edward Shanken on New Media Art and how its pretty difficult to sell as Modern Contemporary art made me question a few things.",0,1391337765,null,0,1391338305,0,cf51ii0,t3_1wpthu,t1_cf51ii0,t1_cf508ui,null,1432216847,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

ASTON VILLA FOR SALE - £200 MILLION

The American tycoon, who bought the club from Doug Ellis for £63m in 2006, is actively looking for a new owner who can inject more funds into Villa and take them forward.

Lerner, 51, has been hoping for a wealthy United States investor to buy Villa. His inflated asking price takes into account the £250m he has spent on players, plus redeveloping facilities.

Lerner knows he will not recoup all the cash but has been encouraged by the £190m Mohamed Fayed received from Shahid Khan for Fulham.

A source said: “Randy has been open to offers for Villa from some time — but wants quite a lot of money from the club.

“He has seen the £190m sale of Fulham but about £35m of that was a premium for it being a London-based club.”

The value of Prem clubs is soaring because of the new TV deal which pays at least £40m a season.

A deal could take around three months to complete and any buyer would wait to be sure Villa will definitely be a top-flight side next season before finalising a deal.

Former Villa boss Gerard Houllier, global sports director for Red Bull, has already gone public to state his company are not interested in tabling a bid.

However, having now worked in schools for a number of years, I would like to comment on some of the points raised here. A lot of comments focus on the fact that foods shouldn't be taught as good or bad, and that things like crisps etc. should be ok, as long as they form part of a good overall diet which is true. But while it's clear that everyone on this thread is well educated in what a child's diet should look like, the reality is that a lot of parents are either uneducated, or simply don't care, judging from some of the packed lunches I've seen pupils bring in, packed with crisps, fizzy drinks, sweets etc. If the parents are unwilling or unable to become educated about healthy eating, then it falls to us to instill that in pupils. The lack of education on subjects such as this among some parents is one of the main reasons we need to do PSHE (Personal, Social and Health Education) lessons in schools. Everything contained in these lessons, including those about a balanced diet, are things that pupils should be taught by their parents but, for whatever reason, they aren't.

People might also say that it's none of the school's business what a parent wants to feed their child, but I personally disagree with this. Of all the schools I've worked in, only one has not had a healthy eating policy, which meant pupils could bring in whatever they want, and the behaviour in that school was definitely the worst I've ever encountered. I realise that in itself can't be considered evidence, as there are other factors involved, but there are plenty of studies to indicate that healthy eating does improve children's behaviour on the whole. Trying to get 30 16-year-olds settled and focused when they're up to their eyeballs in sugar and caffeine wastes a ridiculous amount of time, that could, and should, be spent teaching.

Reading through your comments in the thread and you seem like the most short-sighted knee-jerker around.

3-2 Southampton

1-1 West Brom

3-0 Stoke

2-1 United

3-1 Swansea

Ignoring the fact that there is zero correlation between those two things, I bet this random skip-searching fella didn't really say that. The Guardian and the Labour party have been hammering that 'heating or eating' line for ages.

Then there's a whole lot of other shite misuse of figures:

&gt;An estimated 20% to 40% of UK fruit and vegetables are rejected even before they reach the shops.

This leads you to believe that they are just chucked in the bin. No. They're made into jams, spreads, soups etc.

&gt;Tesco admits to having generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste at its stores and distribution centres in the first six months of last year.

Well that's a shocking figure isn't it! But wait. There are 2400 Tesco stores that sell food in the UK. And the first six months of the year is 180 days. So 28500 tons divided up between 180 days and 2400 stores is equal to ~65kg per day, which doesn't strike me as a massive amount if you consider the size of some superstores and the 100,000's of tons of food that they keep on the shelves.

We moan about waste, but we'd also moan if companies sold out of date foods. And fwiw, I totally agree with the barbed wire on the fence around the skip area. If I had a store, I wouldn't want people rifling through my bins, likely making a mess, possibly injuring themselves (and leaving me liable). Also, companies pay a fortune to get rid of rubbish and Tesco are paying an arseload of money to through out that waste properly - something that most people who haven't run a business don't realise.",0,1391346137,null,0,false,0,cf52ovl,t3_1wsrmx,t1_cf52ovl,t3_1wsrmx,null,1432217469,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The whole thing just sounds completely off to me. In my experience it's incredibly rare to have business-to-business transactions where you actually have to hand over the money up front. Almost always you have a contractual purchase order and invoices and money gets paid within some timescale (usually 30 or 90 days), or gets paid in some agreed instalment schedule.

Have no experience in transfer dealings admittedly, but I would be amazed if it was typical in football for clubs to hand over the entire transfer fee before the deal can be completed, especially with the amounts of money typically involved.

Yes and in case you weren't paying attention (Because it doesn't seem like you were) That is what I was criticizing them for, you have just repeated the point of my argument to me as an argument, that is seriously stupid.

I said not great, your putting words into my mouth now and that is a sign of someone without a cogent point. He can provide some cover but he does not compare defensively to Lucas.

And what fruit is in season from November to February? Rhubarb isn't. Apples and Pears need to be saved from the autumn harvest and would, only 100 years ago or so, have been a treat for most people in winter. 

My point isn't about the seasonality of the foods we eat, but rather the idea that fruit has always been a necessary and ubiquitous part of our year round diet. 

I am also not denying that fruits are nutritious, or delicious, or even healthy (although, as I said, the high sugar content compared with similar vegetables can be an issue especially with things like fruit juice). What I am saying is that they are not an essential part of the diet and are almost always more expensive than vegetables which provide the same or more nutritional value.

true,b00ks,num30,Sandro,"&gt;Reading through your comments in the thread and you seem like the most short-sighted knee-jerker around.

I'm not a sherwood fan.  I think that is obvious.  I like what he did when he first showed up, but after a few games of watching him freeze out players, and play favorites, I can honestly say that I'm not liking him.

Out of all those matches that you listed, the only match that looked convincing was the 3-0 Stoke.  Every other game had at least a half of the shittiest spursy playing I've seen.  Palace absolutely dominated us in the first half and should have been at least 1 up at half.  We eeked out a win at Saints  by a miraculous own goal.  Swansea also played better than us, we were just lucky that Bony only scored one, and not the million other shots we allowed him to have because Sherwood refuses to play anyone in front of our back four.

On paper, when you see our scorelines, they look convincing, but actually watching the matches?  Not so much.  Add to the fact that we can't get our shit together when we play the current ""bigger"" sides, that adds to my alarm.  We have to play the top 5, a total of ten times, also known as 30 potential points (of which we have gotten 2 points out of 18)  If we can't win any of those, we are not going to challenge for top four..

So you can have all the optimism that you want, and I'll sit here and be a realist... and you can call me knee-jerk, or an asshole, or short-sighted, or what ever you want... but at the end of the day, I think I'm right.

**Flanno** - made some dodgy decisions but generally alright. Before we're too quick to criticise him we have to remember mistakes are normal, especially for his age, and this is the only way he'll improve.

**Cissokho** - was gonna give him my first sincere compliment on his overall performance but perhaps he just looks better today since we're not playing that well collectively. Superb run though, was really hoping he'd prove me wrong and provide that clinical assist.

**Sterling** - maybe our best player. Definitely our most threatening going forward.

**Gerrard** - now that I think of it, definitely our best player for the 1st half. Took over possession countless times. Playing that holding role perfectly.

**Coutinho** and **Hendo** - generally good but made some poor decisions in their passing. Both can look to improve in the 2nd.

**SAS** - doing well-ish (not to their standards) but I definitely expect them to pick it up in the 2nd. West Brom better be wary.

Also there's no celebrations that automatically come with a Jubilee, the government organizes it each time, and presumably with Home Office involvement.

In contrast the World Cup is an event held every four years and organised by a body outside the control of the UK government.

That's just another way of saying he plays the team he thinks is best. I'm assuming you're referring to the continued presence of Bentaleb. He was our best player again yesterday. Other than him over Capoue, who else has he frozen out? Holtby? - a decent player but far from the man to transform our team. Everyone else is injured. We don't know what he'll do with Lamela or Townsend. Also, are you aware of Adebayor? 

You're doing a lot of twisting the facts to fit your narrative. Puncheon should have scored his penalty but we rolled them in the second half. That was not a miraculous own goal against Saints, it was a well-worked move that culminated in Rose blasting in an undefendable cross. Swansea - do you watch any football at all? Players miss chances all the time so to purely single out Bony as missing loads is to ignore all the chances Soldado and Lennon have been spunking up the wall. 

&gt; of which we have gotten 2 points out of 18

Under Sherwood, if you're including United, it's 3 out of 6. There is also the defeat to Arsenal to take into account, granted.

*The date is 11 November 1918 which is obviously very interesting because it was [the day when the Armistice was signed and came into effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_with_Germany). Perhaps Wild was a fellow soldier who had refused to sign your great-grandad's book in memory of the auspicious day, so your relative wrote down what he said in verse instead. That is a complete guess but I like the story so I am sticking to it.*

upon that foreign soil

fighting for our freedoms 

is Britons [sic] sons of toil (soil?)

they are fighting for home and children

against the dastard hun

for they shall not tyranize our land 

not while we can handle a gun

3

they know we are out for business

A business they don't like

for they thought we should only bark

But they found the Bulldog went to bite


4

He said I'll walk through Belgium

and Lord it straight through France

Then I'll soon be over the water

and in London we shall dance

5

Tis the world I am out to conquer 

and to their knees all nations bring

For I am the only man on Earth

That the Lord ordained for a King

The World it must obey me

No matter what they say

for the world I shall conquer

Twas the night of the weekly concert

The barracks looked clean and bright

But one in that hall looked sad

As he heard the songs that night

2

But none knew what caused his sorrow

As a soldier sang this song

Twas the song of ""Home Sweet Home"" 

That the world has sung so long

3

The Colonels daughter saw his face

As the tears trickled down his cheek

She went to try and cheer his soul

And these were the words she did speak

Of childhood's happy days

When I used to kneel at mothers knee

Before I started the downward way

The soldier then told this story 

Of A praying mother so good 

Who had taught him when a child 

The way that leads above 

7

He told how he had trod in sin

of drinking and gambling too

How he'ed robbed his fellow creatures 

Forged his masters signature too

Agree with the first bit, but not so much at the second. We basically created two decent shots on goal all game - one was the goal and the other was the 1-on-1 that Suarez didn't quite put away. 

Defence shouldn't ever be making mistakes like that and it ended up costing us the game, but I'm disappointed that we just didn't seem to ever have any periods of sustained pressure in that game or make much in the way of chances. We never made it 2-0 to put the game to bed and we really need to be doing that against teams like WBA. 

All we did for most of the game was punt long balls forward and hope someone won the header and second ball (with the exception of Sterling giving them problems all day with great runs down the right). Can't blame Toure for being the sole reason we lost when pretty much the whole team was mediocre.

The fact that only two people died—compared with 326 in the earlier storm—is testament to the tidal barriers built in Britain over the past few decades. Yet the system that created many of those sea defences, and encouraged people to keep living in flood-prone areas, is being abandoned.

&gt;Since the 1960s the government has paid to build flood defences while insisting that insurers cover most properties in flood-prone areas. This arrangement has gradually become a casualty of austerity and climate change. Spending on flood defences fell from £629m ($972m) to £510m between 2010 and 2012. Simply repairing existing defences would cost £1 billion per year by 2035. New flood defences will be subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, with more land in effect surrendered to the sea.

The game against WBA was equally important so how can it be that the players simply didn't show up? 
It's not the players fault. They can't collectively say on their way to the away game ""Ok lads, we won 4-0 against Everton last week and now we play against WBA. Let's just play easy."" I blame Rodgers for this performance. Ferguson won the Premier League last year with the same squad that Moyes is now struggling with. Why? Because he knew how to motivate his players. Our recent performances, as well as the fact that we've never won more than 4 consecutive times, shows me that Rodgers still doesn't know how to motivate his players.

true,abowsh,1986,Oscar,"I expect football to be banned in some aspect in many states within a decade. Legislators in California are already talking about not allowing public schools to play football. Other states will not let kids play football until high school. This is inevitable. As much as the NFL is doing with Heads Up Football, it's impossible to convince players to not go for the big hit. 

This isn't going to happen overnight. The talent pool will dry up when states make it difficult to play the sport. It will become a regional sport because it's unlikely southern states will ban it soon. Public funding of NFL stadiums is already getting to a tipping point, and I expect huge backlash from taxpayers to come. There will be less public funding and fewer new stadiums will be built. Teams will hold onto older stadiums for much longer.

It's also not like these stadiums cannot be used for other things. NFL games are a minor part of a stadiums event schedule. There are far more concerts and other events that occur in a stadium than there are football games. The NFL will still exist, but it will fall off in popularity. People said the exact same thing about baseball. ""No way baseball fall off in popularity. It's the national pastime!"" Younger fans don't follow baseball much anymore. This will happen to the NFL. If you play basketball and soccer growing up instead of football, you will be more of a fan of basketball and soccer. 

The NFL will have to deal with safety concerns and anger from taxpayers. If left up to the city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Colts would not have a new stadium. But, we left that up to the state, an all the people who would benefit from keeping the Colts in Indy, while avoiding all the taxes that are focused on the city of Indianapolis, were all for keeping it. Giving a man worth $2B a brand new half billion dollar stadium isn't popular policy. These deals are already at a tipping point with the NFL at its all time high inpopularity. As interest fades, it will be much more difficult to justify giving billionaires free stadiums.

Not at all.  I think playing Bentaleb over others is a mistake, but the guy is a good player. I'm not denying that.  

Yup, I am talking about freezing out Capoue and Holtby, for a 19 year old.  It should be the other way around, or you should sell the players you are not going to play.

&gt;You're doing a lot of twisting the facts to fit your narrative. Puncheon should have scored his penalty but we rolled them in the second half. 

And you're not?  We rolled palace in the **second half**, but the first half was dreadful.  Against Palace. A team one point off the drop... at home.  

&gt;Under Sherwood, if you're including United, it's 3 out of 6. There is also the defeat to Arsenal to take into account, granted.

Obviously I'm not including United.  I said top 5.  Current top five, not last years top 5. Arsenal, City, Liverpool, Everton and Chelsea..  So again, 2 points out of 18.  Give me your silver lining there?  The fact that it isn't 1 point?

&gt;If I had to place a bet on who would finish 4th, I would opt for Liverpool. Is that a reason to utterly give up hope? No chance. Pull yourself together.

I'm not giving up hope.  I'm being realistic and not delusional.  Fuck me, right?  Do I need to suck the cock of optimism to be a supporter?  I'm entitled to my opinion, and I don't think we have it this year. So get off my back because i'm not joining in the the ""we can do it"" circle jerk.

If it is the conversation I'm thinking of, which is the age of the Doctor, the retcon only pertains to that detail of the series. From the Revised series forward, the Doctor is 900 years old. That's a Word of God retcon and it takes precedent over what came before it. 

The BBC did it to smooth out storylines from 2005 forward. That way, you don't have the situation where multiple writers make the Doctor older and younger than in previous incarnations. 

As for the other stories, they still took place. 

&gt; ... then what's to stop a writer or a showrunner from retconning the entire classic series out of existence making the Time War the default start, McGann the first traveling Doctor, and all the others just a dream or ruse?

Nothing. That's pretty much the end of the story right there. Future writers can decide to do that and there is not a thing that could be done to stop it.

Thing thing about franchises that fans don't understand is they do not own it. Sure they can fall in love with them and devote hours of time into making little fan theories about certain things, or make up new adventures with your favorite companions and favorite Doctors, but they are merely playing with someone else's toys and that's it. At the end of the day, the BBC owns Doctor Who and it can do with it as they see fit. 

Real question you should ask yourself: Has the BBC ever declared certain things out of continuity in the Doctor Who Universe? No. Everything Doctor Who related, movies, comics, Prose, and audio happened. Things merely fall out of continuity, like the series of adventures where the Doctor was a Woman or the Peter Cushing Doctor Who. 

The BBC could have decided that Eccleston was the 3rd Doctor behind McGann and Hurt, making Tennant the 4th, Matt Smith the 5th, and Capaldi the 6th Doctor.

true,doormatt26,null,null,"&gt; I expect football to be banned in some aspect in many states within a decade. Legislators in California are already talking about not allowing public schools to play football. Other states will not let kids play football until high school. This is inevitable. As much as the NFL is doing with Heads Up Football, it's impossible to convince players to not go for the big hit. Also, as a former Californian, California legislators are not a good barometer of national opinion. 

I don't think it will get banned any time soon. There are more half-measures that can be used to increase safety at the lower levels without completely gutting the talent base (better helmets, flag football, restrictions on forward passes, remove helmets entirely to make it more rugby-like). Players at the college and pro level are adults and can choose to play if they want. And thousands of them will until a different sport is more watch and more potentially lucrative. 

&gt; This isn't going to happen overnight. The talent pool will dry up when states make it difficult to play the sport. It will become a regional sport because it's unlikely southern states will ban it soon. Public funding of NFL stadiums is already getting to a tipping point, and I expect huge backlash from taxpayers to come. There will be less public funding and fewer new stadiums will be built. Teams will hold onto older stadiums for much longer.

I agree that public funding will get more stingy, but that's hardly a death-knell for football. Most stadium upgrade money is spend on luxury boxes, big screens, and fancy roofs. The game of football can do without those and still thrive. See: college football. 

&gt;It's also not like these stadiums cannot be used for other things. NFL games are a minor part of a stadiums event schedule. There are far more concerts and other events that occur in a stadium than there are football games. The NFL will still exist, but it will fall off in popularity. People said the exact same thing about baseball. ""No way baseball fall off in popularity. It's the national pastime!"" Younger fans don't follow baseball much anymore. This will happen to the NFL. If you play basketball and soccer growing up instead of football, you will be more of a fan of basketball and soccer.

Football is absolutely NOT a minor part of these stadiums schedule. They are purpose built for football. There are some, usually pro stadiums, that can serve multi-purpose use for exhibitions for other sports (soccer friendlies, outdoor hockey, MONSTER JAMZ) and some concerts. But concerts that can attract 80,000 people and maintain decent acoustics are few and far between, and there's not much else to do. You're also forgetting entirely about college football, where stadiums are built on campus expressively for football use. Bryant-Denny, the Rose Bowl, The Big House, Ohio Stadium, Beaver Stadium, Doak Campbell, Texas Memorial, the Coliseum, Death Valley... I could go on. ALL of these places fit 80-100,000 people and exist for 6-7 football game a year with little else inbetween. There are hundreds of smaller stadiums in the same situation. Concerts and other events will come nowhere close to replacing the loss of football events. 

The NFL is also more popular than ever, we're a long way from ""national pasttime"" arguments. Kids have been playing much more soccer than football for a generation now, and while soccer's popularity has grown, it has not been at the expense of football. This won't change. The vast majority of people follow football because they enjoy watching it, not because they played it. 

&gt; The NFL will have to deal with safety concerns and anger from taxpayers. If left up to the city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Colts would not have a new stadium. But, we left that up to the state, an all the people who would benefit from keeping the Colts in Indy, while avoiding all the taxes that are focused on the city of Indianapolis, were all for keeping it. Giving a man worth $2B a brand new half billion dollar stadium isn't popular policy. These deals are already at a tipping point with the NFL at its all time high inpopularity. As interest fades, it will be much more difficult to justify giving billionaires free stadiums.

Again, I'm with you that the billion dollar stadium deals are unpopular and will be more infrequent in the future. But it takes way more than that to kill off football. And it's not like the billion dollar owners can't fund their own stadiums if they really needed to, they just extract money from taxpayers because they know they can. 

But interest isn't fading, it's higher than ever, and it won't fade any time in the near future.

true,bananaheroin,null,null,"Against semi-decent opposition only combination in midfield that  worked good in a possesion based football was Lucas- Henderson-Allen, otherwise we were reliant on counter attacks ,defensive positional teamwork and personal brilliance of a front 3(2). Otherwise we got either high-scoring games on both ends with overrun midfield, or cagey games, where we tried to soak the pressure, and isolate our best attacking players against opp defenders. WBA did a very good job of closing down spaces, and making crucial interferences and tactical fouls in the middle of the pitch, far from their box. Margin for error in this games is high, we did a resilient defensive job in similar type of games against Aston Villa (a), MU(h), Everton(h). But due to unbalanced midfield , with the lack of movement from Gerrard, Henderson,  Suarez, Sturridge we relied heavily on Sterling, Coutihno (later Allen), to move the ball forward. Obviously that wasn't enough, and later in the game, when Sterling had to help in deffence, because of the Flanno-Kelly substitute, and Allen was too deep and everyone was closed down the game was effectively over. That way of playing is limited and not pretty, but in terms of results this season, before that game, it was ok. There were some bad passes, due to lapses in concentration in this game ( Flanagan, Henderson, Coutihno, Toure) and one of them proved to be very costly. 

So, unless something drastically changes, until the return of Lucas, or at least Sakho or Agger, I wouldn't expect high defensive line, possession based team performances. 

Gerrard, Sterling, Mignolet, Cissokho, Skrtel did what was required in this system. Others - average at best.

Personally, I don't like when we play this way, and with coming games mainly against strong opposition at home, and sides in relegation battle away having no other choice than playing in this system and not having a midfielder to help us play possession based football may prove very costly to our season. Because of the requirements of such defensive performances and tactical team work, we're  gonna be walking on a knife's edge (in games, and in an overall season).",0,1391359997,null,0,1391360327,0,cf56a5m,t3_1wt61f,t1_cf56a5m,t3_1wt61f,null,1432219131,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The chance of any retailer being found liable for anything after it's been placed in a bin are non-existant, as long as that bin complies with all current health codes. Same goes for personal injury.

I hate to break it to you, but you don't own Doctor Who. You as a fan may think it belongs to you because you've devoted countless hours of your life to it watching the serials, reading the prose, and listening to the audio books, but don't inflate your actual involvement with the series into something higher than it is. You are the liaison between your wallet and the BBC, the actual owners of the franchise. 

Yes, it sucks that the BBC declared one really minor detail of Doctor Who set in stone, but atleast the BBC is letting you have the other 99.999999999 percent of it. Sorry, but the age of the Doctor is the least important detail to fixate upon. So what if the BBC made him 900 plus in 2005? The Doctor has forgotten his true age so many times that it should not matter at this point. 

Compare that to what Lucas and Disney have done with Star Wars. Lucas has changed his mind about the Star Wars Expanded Universe so many times that the fans were forced to stop listening to him and make their own continuity. The fans dictated that the movies, scripts, direct novelizations of the movies, and PBS Radio broadcasts count as the first level of canon and everything else is levels 2-7 based on the factor of how much the community wants it to be true. Now, Disney comes along and decided to give the EU a good pruning and fans are upset because all of their work is going bye bye. 

Or look at Star Trek. The only thing that ever counted were the movies and the television episodes. Everything else never counted in the first place. 

At least the BBC is letting you keep the stories. Them taking away the age thing, which never mattered in the first place, is no reason to complain. ",0,1391361402,null,0,1391366596,0,cf56t6p,t3_1wszoa,t1_cf56t6p,t3_1wszoa,null,1432219425,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Being born in India and even living there does not make your ridiculous statement any less ridiculous or give you a soapbox to make such statements.

Classic defense mechanism. You realize I have more credibility than you regarding India and then proceed to deflect my point. Being born in India and living there gives me more credibility regarding experiences in India than someone who has never been or done research on it. There is a reason why on news shows, research journals and historical programs, they have people called ""experts."" I'm not saying I'm an expert, far from it. However, having grown up there, I do have experience and knowledge regarding my country, people and culture.

&gt;You can attempt to your nonsense sound more academic and credible but it doesn't change what was said. Both your statement about India people's priorities and the statement on eastern Europe are absurd.
Based on meeting a few people Ukraine and Bulgaria, it is stupid to say there is a cultural flaw in eastern Europe. You realise how large eastern Europe is and how many cultures there are within it? 

Read what I wrote and then respond. His statement regarding a ""cultural flaw"" was merely a ""I don't know what term to use here, but you get what I'm trying to say."" He's not actually trying to say its a cultural flaw, he just couldn't find the words to express what he's saying; hence why he used the quotes. I honestly don't want to get into a textual analysis of someone else's post because you're not willing to give someone some intellectual leniency and would rather cry ""prejudice,"" because that is what your sensitivities lead you to believe it is. He obviously knows not all Eastern European people are like this, but he is contending that in his experience of business dealings, this has occurred. So it may have occurred in the Liverpool situation as well. He shouldn't have to prove he isn't racially prejudiced first and then make the statement as if to add a caveat, just to appease people like you who are quick to jump upon your soapbox and claim everything that mentions cultural experiences+tendencies is racially prejudiced.

&gt;My simple mind? You seem to know a lot about me. Yes, anecdotal evidence is useful. The point is why make absurd statements about 'the culture' of a massive geographical area based on these experiences - just as you attempted about India? You mention sociology and let me tell you this sort of nonsense would not stand up in any social sciences. You sound like you are a uni student. Dressing your sentences up to try and make them sound like there is substance when there is none. Guessing first year. Still lots to learn. Good luck.


I didn't mention sociology at all...I mentioned that history has recently become more sociological and individualistic in narrative to gain an understanding of time periods. For example, we read individual accounts of people's lives so as to learn about the historical events and trends occurring. Just as an aside to this statement, I'd also like to point out geographical areas share cultural similarities, this is why people can make statements about culture. For example, many Indians don't eat beef because cows are sacred in the Vedas or that pork isn't eaten in a lot of the Middle East because of the Quran (IIRC). These aren't racially prejudiced remarks, and you wouldn't think they are either. This is because there are cultural similarities between people that exist and lead to a cultural tendency due to historical customary norms that came about through a shared historical narrative of a certain region of people. You claim that this doesn't ""fly"" in the social sciences, but you're misinformed. There are papers written on Russia's historical autocratic tendencies, or American individualism (FREEDOM) arising from manifest destiny and the ""shining city on a hill"" metaphor from John Winthrop's sermon on ""A Model of Christian Charity.""

Also, I'm not a university student. Good try though.

The downside of selling off the housing stock and not replacing it, it that the poorest paid members of society are priced out of adequate housing stock to live in, instead relying on substandard accommodation.

Then factor in Housing Benefit... If a council tennant became unemployed their rent would be covered by the council, they would not see any income for that property (but the surplus would allow for this) and the loss would be minimal.

But if everyone is in private rented houses the council (or rather the Govt) sees a loss for the Rental, the money 'leaves' the system and goes into a private landlords pocket (well his bank account for the Bank to use for his mortgage)

In the old Housing style the loss remained with the council and the Rent went no where, now the Loss is felt by the Taxpayer and the Rent goes to the Banks..

I'm not disagreeing that it's impossible to play at top intensity 38 games of the season. what I am saying is that it is important to play at the *necessary* intensity. There was simply not enough desire on show there today, limply finishing the game out at 1-1 is not good enough from a Liverpool side that should be trying to be one of the top teams in England.

Again, I think it's dis-analogous to keep referring back to last year. We are in materially different circumstances to last year. To set last year as an acceptable baseline is simply not good enough. In addition, the barest improvement on last year is not good enough. We need to be hitting at least 2 points per game and every draw we get pushes us closer to dropping below that minimum. We can't afford to be dropping points with a tough fixture against Arsenal coming up next week. 

I don't think it's either short-sighted nor ignorant to merely hold the team and Brendan Rodgers to the standard of respect that Rodgers himself has advocated.

Lampard is only deployed as a holding mid particularly given how often he likes to move forward.

I completely understand where the others are coming from in saying that BBC, its writers and other content creators shouldn't be told what's allowed and what's not based on how people would rather the story goes, but we're talking about continuity, not emotional preference.

Doctor Who is rare, almost unique, in that it bends space and time's relevance and allows for all kinds of stories. But, the truth is that it takes place within our universe, as far as we can tell, and the universe of the show is subject to the same laws as our own. The Doctor can bend or ignore certain rules, sure, but the show has made a point of saying that he can't go hog wild and do whatever he wants (""time can be re-written"" is something that his companions argue and debate over and over).

The point is that even though the show has endless loopholes available for plot, it should still at least make some kind of sense, else what's the point in any story at all? So, basically, while retconning is acceptable in a show that is based on time travel, ignoring certain rules or truths that were established earlier in the series calls into question not only the validity of that which was established earlier, but whether what is happening currently (which is effecting the change in continuity in the first place) actually matters, will not be over-written later, or will even be perceived to have happened at all in the future.

Breaking continuity is, to me, a fine line, and it really depends on how you angle it, as well as how many details you add in or acknowledge from before in order to make the change more acceptable.

And these are becoming more and more prominent. Brett Favre sounds like an 80 year old man right now because of his head injuries. 

The writing is on the wall. Aside from safety concerns, there are marketing concerns. They are following the same model that destroyed the MLB. They are trying to gain the casual fan at the expense of the traditional fan. They are marketing stats and changing rules to benefit fantasy football and make it more exciting for the casual fan. Do you not remember that the majority of the Wild Card games weren't even sold out a few days before the game? Corporate sponsors had to buy up thousands of PLAYOFF TICKETS to ensure these games would even be televised locally. The casual fan isn't going to spend $250 per ticket to sit in the nosebleed section. Especially when the football experience is much better on TV than live for most fans.

If certain foods are prohibited from a packed lunch, then there should equally be a mechanism available to force parents to send their children to school with an appropriate lunch. When a child is at school, a single set of parents should not be able to pick and choose which rules they follow. Note that I'm not saying the school should be able to set rules on child nutrition outside of school (though, to be honest, I think that in many cases that might be beneficial to the child). Primarily I'm concerned with the welfare of the child, not the well-being of either the parents or the school.

I never said it was a sure 3 points for showing up on the pitch, what I am pointing out is that Brendan constantly talks about respecting opponents with a performance. We did not give a performance worthy of the threat of West Brom today and we were punished for it. It is not the first time we've been complacent and dropped points against bad sides. It's not any use of Brendan to say we're happy with the point in this instance. He needs to recognise that the mindset was off for these games where performances were mixed. Regardless of the results of any title rival, there were 3 points on offer today and we did not take them, taking the foot off the gas after the goal. That is a lack of motivation and disrespectful to the opposition. That is not the Liverpool way. What I'm saying is that it has happened a number of times this season, and it is not how Brendan Rodgers says he wants to do business.

The concussion issue can be mitigated at the lower levels without taking away from the game in college and the NFL. 

I don't agree with the second point about marketing. How are they alienating the traditional fan? By a better stadium experience? Statistics (I would think traditional fans would like this more than casuals)? By calling more Personal Fouls and Pass Interference? The game is adapting for the internet and new styles of offense, but that's not ""better"" or ""worse"" than another kind of football, just like Barcelona's or Stoke's styles are ""better"" beyond the extent they get results on the field. Just different. 

The Wild Card ticket crisis was a result of a) bad weather b) ticket prices and c) the HD TV effect. The weather is a crapshoot and the HD TV effect is a trend across all major sports, not just football. The ticket price issue is an issue, but it's a market and if tickets get too expensive for fan to pay for, prices will go down. It's a market. Also keep in mind those people that would rather watch the game from home? They're still watching the game. IT doesn't make it any less popular.

Your response, which dismisses my explanation completely, misses my point. We know X story took place with the 10th Doctor after Donna Noble because he's alone. We know Y story took place in the 11th Doctor's run because it's a story with him and River. That's canon in Doctor Who and it's not even head canon. That's defaulting to the BBC's official policy on their franchise. 

2. The BBC made a minor change to the overall storyline locking the Doctor's age at 900 plus since 2005, which is one of the few set in stone decisions the company has made about their property. Grand scheme of things, it is a does not fucking matter continuity change, but it prompted a whole slew of discussion about it.

In the last three months, I've read:

* [*Raising Steam*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11275323-raising-steam) by Terry Pratchett - plot spanned too much time IMO, there was a lot of summarising the last few months, satisfying ending though

* [*Journey to the Centre of the Earth*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32829.Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth) by Jules Verne - obvious difference in attitudes compared to the present aside, Verne can do no wrong in my eyes

* [*Storm Front*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47212.Storm_Front), the first book in Jim Butcher's *Dresden Files* series - middling to good, IMO, but I'm informed the series gets stronger as it goes on; even if it doesn't, it's good enough fun for me to continue

* Finished Ben Aaronovitch's [*Rivers of London* series so far](https://www.goodreads.com/series/51937-peter-grant) - first was so good, the subsequent books are somewhat disappointing, the ""case of the week"" isn't sufficiently diverting to distract from the incredibly slow moving wider plot, and the twist at the end of the fourth wasn't as shocking as I feel it should have been

I'm also about halfway through [*The Hound of the Baskervilles*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8921.The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles) and [*Ringworld*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61179.Ringworld) as well as still having not finished [*The War of the Worlds*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds) because I think I've put it into storage by mistake.

Also, confession time, sorry /u/dead-yossarian, I DNFd [*Apocalypse Cow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12925656-apocalypse-cow).

It means you have complete choice to choose somewhere where the course and the place is right for you. If you like the north and like the course, go for it! Don't bother with the rankings for medicine! All the medical schools are regulated by the GMC so they all have a high standard. 

If you were going for another course, I'd say rankings matter somewhat. But for medicine, I just really want to get across the point that just because St Georges is low down doesn't mean it's a course you shouldn't consider. 
I hope that helps you not narrow down your choices. Look at ALL the course and look at ALL the cities. Find the ones that suit YOU.

I know on the whole this Reddit is anti-nuclear anything... but this isn't about whether we are going to be a nuclear power or not - that is another discussion. The bottom line remains that if we are going to be a nuclear power then Trident is the way to do it. Air, Silo or Sea Surface launched devices just don't offer what Trident does in terms of contingency and capability. I hear the LibDem argument that we don't need cold-war era nuclear capability anymore even if we are to retain some nuclear arsenal... but I don't accept that and neither do defense analysts at large. Our colleagues in the USA certainly don't accept it. The problem with this sort of platform is you don't need it, until you really need it. And these aren't things you can build overnight. Infact, these the sort of things that if you stop building, you can't build them again without really significant investment and several decades of lead time... one only has to look at the Chinese who spent decades trying to build up this capability, possibly even losing one of their first attempts at an SSBNs to an accident in 1985. Its only since 2008 that they've got this capability.

It all stems from two great misunderstandings - the first of what Trident actually is and how it works, and the second of the dogma of nuclear weapons themselves.

Yes, it costs money - but its money that can be selectively spent within the nation on security grounds.

Schools impose lifestyle changes on children all the time, why is this the exception?

(The question of whether or not a parent can afford it isn't the issue here. Parents who have trouble pulling together the money to provide a healthy lunch for their kids have options available: I haven't heard of a single British school without the option of 'free school lunches' for the less well-off.)

Clearly, I would prefer that the parents and the school find some agreement between themselves, but if the vast majority of parents endorse and follow a rule, why should the school be the one to back down? What I'm supporting is the idea that children should be raised according to what's best for them (as decided by society), not by the rules laid down by a tiny minority of parents who can't be bothered to follow the rules.

My question to you is: is it justifiable for the parents to repeatedly send their child to school with an inappropriate (according to school rules) packed lunch? Why? Surely it would easier and better for their child to conform with the others - it certainly wouldn't harm him.

just because the other people obey the rule doesn't mean they necessarily agree with it, and if there is a public confrontation then it shows that people definitely don't follow it.

true,corris85,null,null,"Here it is,, TL:DR release clauses exist in Spanish and german law but not English or other countries. The release cluases trigged for Demba BA ect.. are informal ones that the team never had to accept. Nikcub wrote quite a bit about this with sources so you can PM him.

&gt; This is all ignoring that release clauses don't exist in the Premier League, off course - and that the main conclusion from the Suarez saga in the summer[0] is that you can't do informal release clauses. Some media have fallen for reporting this story because there are thousands of Liverpool fans on twitter who are pestering them each day by asking what the Suarez release clause was - and the real answer, there isn't one, just isn't as interesting.

&gt; [0] I'll go over what that was. At the time Suarez signed his last contract, there were some agents who were trying to establish informal release clauses in their player contracts. There are no formal release clauses in FA / EPL contracts, unlike in Spain and Germany, so they had to create a way to insert them. The first one who did it was Ba at West Ham, he put in an £5M release clause by inserting a term into a section of the contract called special considerations, which is signed and also sent off to the FA. The agent chose his own wording.
&gt; A way to think about this is, imagine if you were at your bank and about to sign your mortgage papers, and on the last page of 20+ pages of standard type of contract you wrote in ""if I go bankrupt I owe the bank nothing"" as a clause and then signed the papers and got the bank to sign it. This is what these agents were doing, they were putting in ""Club will accept an offer of £10m from any other club"" etc. etc. and then signing the contracts. It shouldn't be a surprise that they didn't hold up.


&gt; A year later when Ba wanted to leave, the club accepted that clause and let him go, although not without complaining. Suarez's agent tried the same thing, but this time Liverpool challenged that those clauses aren't valid - and they won. The PFA head Gordon Taylor, who was called into the dispute by Suarez and his agent, came out and said that he knew there were agents trying to do this, but as far as he was concerned they weren't real release clauses. So despite the fact there had been a handful of release clause contracts in the EPL, and that some players had even moved on a release clause, these terms weren't valid (so those earlier clubs could have challenged as well).


&gt; What usually happens, and why perhaps those clubs didn't challenge, is that you have a verbal / off-contract agreement with the player. Eg. player agent would say that they only sign this contract on the proviso that the club qualify for the champions league, or that they only want to stay for another year but want the pay rise. This happens all the time. This is what Modrid and Bale were complaining about at Spurs. Most clubs don't rock the boat here, because you don't want a bad name with agents and future signings.",0,1391373562,null,0,false,0,cf5c0n9,t3_1wswe4,t1_cf5c0n9,t1_cf574fw,null,1435505843,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If one set of parents start sneaking in 'a little treat' to put a smile on their child's face; then by the very nature of schoolchildren, other parents will come under pressure to do some sneaking of their own. Then the rule itself is pointless - but actually, it sounds like a pretty decent rule.

It's like the no-trainers rule some schools operate. If one student is allowed by their parents to wear trainers (because it puts a smile on their face), then the rule may as well not be in place at all.

This story is being out to be about one pack of Mini Cheddars, but from what the school says, it sounds like that was simply the last in a series of rule-breaking.

I do agree that suspension is bad crack. However, putting all the blame on the school (as appears to be happening in this thread) is ridiculous. In my view, the parents deserve a lot more blame here.

Pellegrini won't change formation for our home game. Change would suggest they're a threat we've not faced before, in reality arsenal were a scarier side to face at Eastlands. No mata, which is a boost. Kompany and Demi just because it seems to be Pellegrini's favourite pair. Zabba and Navas to attack that LB spot that's vulnerable. Cole can't handle them 2. Yaya and Ferna need no explanation. Silva will help attack the front 2 defenders and Dzeko and Beast up front will tuck away chances from the wings. 

Jovetic will replace Dzeko who has Super Bowl fever and smashes the ball out the ground and into Salford, Kolarov for Silva and I wouldn't be surprised to see Milner replace someone.

I hope Coutinho reacts similarly.

My brain got all mushy and shit, the kind of mushy when you're audibly saying 'the fuck did she say?'. Now I'm a big rom-com-drama dude but lol, fuck this book so much.

Edit : Book is pretty short, I finished it in like an hour. Just 200 pages I think.

* On Writing by Stephen King - Well, I'm kind of a passionate writer but not good enough to make it to traditional publishing so I thought I'd step up my game. I'm still going through it, it's a very entertaining read.

* Full Dark, No Stars by Stephen King - It's Stephen King, the fuck do you expect? It's awesome.

* Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Cleary - This book was actually Logan Lerman's favourite book in the movie Stuck in Love and I'm weird so I decided I'd read it. It was pretty great, nice story over all.

* Short Stories by Leo Tolstoy - My mom gifted them to me when I was young, stories are pretty simple but great. Worth a read, especially The Death of Ivan Ilych

I'd also point out that while the Scots might not like having HMNB Clyde close to home, that is a separate issue - as is unilateral disarmament. My point is, putting those to one side, if the government wants us to remain a nuclear power - then Trident is the way to do it.

I would happily live within 30 miles of a nuclear weapon. The **only** danger from living close to a nuclear weapon is that it would theoretically be on a list of high priority strike targets in the event of a full on 3rd world war - but we'd all be fucked if that happened given the small size of the UK and the variability of the winds around this part of the world. It would only take one decently sized nuclear weapon to detonate pretty much anywhere on these islands to make just about all of it uninhabitable or at the very least rather unpleasant for those people unlucky enough not to be killed in the initial strike. It might not end the UK but it would be the total loss of our way of life and virtually wherever it went off, probably enough to kill hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions. 

I **wouldn't** want to live within 30 miles of a nuclear power plant - that is another matter entirely. Christ, imagine a Chernobyl scaled event at Bradwell with a westerly wind. Infact, I don't even want to.

Nuclear weapons are in and of themselves incredibly safe. They are amazingly complex, requiring a very specific perfectly timed set of events to detonate. There has to my knowledge never, in the history of the &gt;120,000 warheads created globally, ever been a full accidental detonation. 

If anything, that argument **supports** trident because:

* An air launched or land based alternative would need to make up for what it lacks in stealth with sheer numbers. Which would mean more of us would be within ""30 miles"" of them... potentially much more of us! And we only have to look to the recent US nuclear quality control scandels to see the kind of issues that can have. 

* The beauty of Trident is that at any one time, virtually all the **active** warheads are loaded on ICBMs in international waters at the bottom of the ocean. Sitting very peacefully, silently waiting. Doing their job perfectly simply by existing. Worst case the sub sinks and breaks apart, potentially releasing a comparatively small amount of radioactive material into the ocean. Not ideal, but its happened before and nothing major has come of it.

* If you look at [historical nuclear accidents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents), the majority of the most dangerous actually came from air launched systems - which are intrinsically at the mercy of the airframe they are traveling on... i.e. if the plane goes down, the weapon goes down with it.",0,1391379604,null,0,1391380662,0,cf5ep47,t3_1wtsfo,t1_cf5ep47,t1_cf5dxsd,null,1432223454,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For RAM/LAM we've got Sterling, Suso, Ibe, Alberto and potentially Coutinho or even Borini.  I'd say one of those is sufficient, but we could use one guaranteed starting LAM/RAM.  For the two, Lucas, Gerrard, Allen, Henderson, and Suso are probably sufficient for this.  Center backs we've got plenty of coverage there already.  RB is an issue for me.  I'd look for a new one and move Johnson on, using Flanagan as competition/backup.  LB I'd keep Enrique for now, but we need a proper backup.

You can get into it through the jobcentre and remain on JSA while attending a light training course that takes you through the basics of running a small business / self-employment, and then get a lesser support allowance for the first 4 months of self-employment once you declare the business operational.

I'm not gonna say it's the easiest or financially safest thing I've ever done, and tbh the marketing side of things for a home/SME focused IT support company is a bitch, but it's gotten me out of working in godawful shitty terrible offices and away from the pain of self-important middle managers, and for that alone I'm very happy to have done it.

edit: forgot to mention, a lot of local councils offer new enterprise grants and/or loans as well, usually in the range of £1000-1500, and the loans are usually zero interest, my council was one of those that had no such scheme (yay south-east, we don't need more businesses) so I ended up going with a low interest loan via the NEI instead.

Council tax would be a plus. But the maximum council tax is about £2K, exactly the same as for a large-ish ordinary house.

The procedure is now carried out using a road-mounted crane in a shaft adjacent to the depot, south of Waterloo main line station on Spur Road. This is only necessary for major maintenance work that requires lifting of the car body, as the Waterloo depot is fully equipped for routine maintenance work.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"# **Pellegrini Throws The Kitchen Sink at Jose**

Inspite of Aguero's situation, I expect Pellegrini to line-up in a 4-4-2 formation with Dzeko &amp; Negredo up front and trying to overload and run past our defenders.I suspect Jose will continue with the pairing of JT &amp; Cahill for central defense, both sitting quite deep. Azpi on the left and Brana on the right dropping deep in a tight back four should hopefully quell the Man City forwards' frequent forays into our defensive third. The wingers and the full-backs will need to be closely watched, too.

# **Madness In The Midfield**

The midfield is where the real battle is going to be and I suspect Jose will start with the trio of Matic, Mikel and Ramires/Lampard. Mikel to sit in front of the back four, Matic to man-mark Yaya and to provide an outlet for Mikel and either Ramires or Lampard for the late-runs into the box. I'm guessing Lamps will get the nod over Ramires - Lamps v Fernandinho is what Jose is probably aiming for, assuming Matic keeps Yaya quiet.

That leaves only two more spots in midfield and these will probably be occupied by Hazard and Oscar, rather than Willian. Willian has a better work-rate but Oscar offer greater creativity and we'll need one or both to track back against the overlapping runs of Man City's full backs. Zabaleta v Hazard should be a treat to watch.

# **Company for Kompany?**

Up top, Mourinho has the option of using either Ba or Eto'o and for some reason, I feel Ba will get the nod ahead of Eto'o. Both have their own advantages, to be honest. Ba's presence in the box will be useful to keep Kompany and Demichelis occupied, while Eto'o's positioning and poaching instincts can grab us a crucial goal at some point during the game.

The game will largely be played in the midfield, with more of the action in our defensive third than theirs but I believe that is exactly what Jose plans to do. Sit deep, draw them in, let the full backs overlap. Jose hopes to win the ball with the strength in numbers and then counter-attack with speed. The transtions after the turnovers will be crucial and I wonder if Ramires, instead of Lampard might be a possible starter, as a result.

# **What Could Possibly Go Wrong?**

There is a chance, however, that Pellegrini chooses to go for a single striker formation, for instance a 4-2-3-1 with Silva playing behind Negredo &amp; Dzeko coming in as super-sub. If this happens, expect to see Navas on the right and Jovetic on the left bombing the wings with overlaps by Zabaleta and Clichy/Kolarov respectively. Yaya &amp; Fernandinho would probably play the holding midfield. A 4-3-3 would still be a better bet in this situation, since the match-ups remain more or less the same - Yaya v Matic, Fernandinho v. Lamps &amp; Silva v Mikel. The last match-up - Silva v. Mikel is the one that will potentially result in a few interesting moments, hopefully they will go our way rather than Man City's.

# **TL;DR**

Chelsea to start in a 4-3-3 with BOTH MIkel and Matic in defensive midfield. 4-1-4-1 when out of possession, evolving rapidly into a 4-3-3 in counter-attack. Man City's defence is somewhat porous at times - even with Kompany marshalling it - and I believe that with the right attitude, the right moves and just a little bit of luck we can do what no one else has been able to manage yet - break Man City's unbeaten home record/streak/both.",0,1391384215,null,0,false,0,cf5go8g,t3_1ws5xd,t1_cf5go8g,t3_1ws5xd,null,1435505391,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

Why is rolling Palace in the second half not legitimate? Palace have been playing quite well recently. In the last 10 games the only teams to beat them are us, City, Arsenal, Chelsea and an on-song Newcastle. They're not a shambles. Hull, too, defended really well yesterday.

The silver linings are that under Sherwood we've only played one ""top"" team in the league in which we were competitive until the sending off, and that despite losing to Arsenal, City (twice) and Liverpool we are still in the reckoning. It's too early to make any sort of judgement. Everton next week will be interesting, we bullied them last time out.

&gt;**How is a comment's score determined?**

&gt;According to the same principles as a submission's score.

&gt;A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".

This book is taking me far longer than it should and that's because it's filled with some truly abhorrent characters and I can't tolerate reading more than a chapter at a time.  D'Artagnan is quite possibly my most hated character in all of fiction.  He is a villain like none other and such a massive far cry from the noble Dogtagnan.  Porthos is also quite the scumbag, Athos isn't that great, but Aramis actually seems okay.

Given that intro, you'd be half-right in thinking I hate this story.  Firstly, the way it's written, it begs to be read aloud.  The cadence of the language flows quite wonderfully, but when read in silence, it quickly grows cumbersome.

The 7th Doctor states that he is 953, so stating that the 9th Doctor is 900 is in conflict as must be rejected in favor of the previously stated figure.

&gt;That's a Word of God retcon and it takes precedent over what came before it. 

If a ""Word of God retcon"" makes the claim that the Doctor is really a muppet from the planet Melmac, are we to just accept that too?

&gt;Thing thing about franchises that fans don't understand is they do not own it.

I'm not claiming that I or any pother fan owns it. I do state that as a fan I expect the BBC to be faithful to the canon THEY CREATED. 

For example, you cannot have a continued Babylon 5 series and claim that John Sheridan was the first commander of the station because season one would conflict with that. You seem like you would be OK with that (correct me if I am wrong).

&gt; Things merely fall out of continuity, like the series of adventures where the Doctor was a Woman or the Peter Cushing Doctor Who.

The Cushing stories were never part of the continuity.

&gt;The BBC could have decided that Eccleston was the 3rd Doctor behind McGann and Hurt, making Tennant the 4th, Matt Smith the 5th, and Capaldi the 6th Doctor. They own the toys, well within their right to do so.

She was designed without a catapult or arrestor system, there was a brief flirtation with the idea of a redesign to allow operation with typical carrier based aircraft, but the current government decided the £100m per carrier wasn't worth it, so unless either we or some other country designs a alternate and decent STOVL aircraft, or the Harrier comes back from the dead (we've sold all our navy variants to the US marines) we're stuck with the F-35B, which we won't get until at least a year or two after the carriers are completed.

edit: /u/LancasterBomber says elsewhere in this thread that we'll have F-35's before carriers, obviously my understanding is the other way around but I'm not sure I wanna argue with someone whose username is LancasterBomber on this particular matter.

true,maybelying,null,null,"Sure, but the point I was sort of making is that Moffat's run has pretty much seen the Doctor as the focal point, with the other characters being developed only in the context of their relevance to the Doctor.  Because of that, the Doctor is a ""flat"" character in that you don't really have the opportunity to view him from different perspectives.

Turn Left was an episode that really gave more depth to the character of Donna, while L&amp;M was an interesting study of how ordinary people may see and interpret the Doctor.  In the RTD era we also got to meet the companion families, which not only helps flesh out the companions themselves but provide interesting foils that are not easily awed by the Doctor and don't trust him (excepting Wilf, that is.) 

Blink was simply a brilliant standalone episode.

The difference to me is that RTD emphasized the characters and their development.  The strong characterization could often (but not always) compensate for what were some really weak stories, and it just feels like it gave more variety in the episodes rather than each simply being a variation of how awesome the Doctor is.

Moffat's run emphasizes stories over characters with some ambitious wide-ranging arcs.  The Doctor is the main character and everybody else is ancillary to him.  When it works, it works well and when it doesn't, it can sometimes seem like a convoluted mess that was made up as he went along.  

My bias is clearly showing, if I had to choose I would prefer strong and interesting characters over complex and ambitious story lines - that is a personal preference and others would certainly feel different.  When I'm the mood for revisiting an old episode, I just always seem to choose RTD era ones. 

Anyways, I think Moffat is a brilliant writer and delivered some of the best episodes in either era.  I just have more of a reserved opinion of his show running, I just feel like he plays it too safe.  I miss having some variety from the same old story format each episode, and I simply find it hard to get interested in the characters themselves.

This is not the fault of the charities, but by taking part, they are implicitly condoning forced labour, which in some cases goes against the spirit of the organisation.

I will happily volunteer and do free work. I won't happily be forced to do that, though. It would have to be on terms that I'm comfortable with, for an organisation I want to be part of, i.e volunteering. Though taking away that choice doesn't affect the work itself, it does diminish the enjoyment and feeling of fulfilment from the experience, and it also removes any positive message this might send to future employers.

In cases like this, workfare may actually result in them becoming employed where as a traditional approach will see them on welfare for years if not decades.

The second instance where it might be useful is for people who have an aptitude in a certain area, but not enough experience to actually get a job. An example of this would be someone who is good with computers, but can't get hired because they lack experience. A few months at a placement would give them something to put on a CV, and give them a better chance of being hired because they will be able to demonstrate applicable knowledge.

The problem with the system that is being used today is that it is not targeted at specific people, instead it's used as a cudgel, and the placements are pointless retail jobs.

I agree with /u/mrjonnewman and /u/Evis03 that it's wrong for the public to be paying for private work and that it is undercutting and undermining other workers. JSA is a measly amount of money to live on and to think that people are having to work long hours, inhibiting their actual search for paid work, for such a pittance is disgusting. Sure, you can say the work offers experience but let's be honest, the jobs people are being thrust into offer very little in the way of experience.

&gt; (on the topic of chainsaws)
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Toksvig (interrupting Stephen): ""Oh, don't! It'll be a boy thing against a girl thing! It will be!""

true,ZapActions-dower,pertwee,Pertwee,"It's not really a reboot, but a revival.  Reboot implies starting over from the beginning, which it did not.

The most important thing to know is that the Classic series didn't do standalone episodes, at all.  The shortest story is 2 episodes long, outside of a 1 episode prequel (which didn't feature the Doctor or any of his companions) to a later 12 part story.  Most stories are 4 episodes long, but many earlier ones are 5-7 episodes long.  Doctor Who was created to fill a 25 minute time slot, so all episodes are about 23ish minutes long.

Ideas for watching old who, based on what I have seen so far:

* An Unearthly Child - this is the very first serial.  The first episode is great, the rest is very much not.  You can skip over the rest.

* The Daleks - it's the second Doctor Who serial ever, and the first Dalek story.  Best viewed with a close friend, possibly under the influence of alcohol or something else.  It's funny, but not because it's trying to be.

* Dalek Invasion of Earth - If you're only watching one First Doctor Dalek story, make it this one.  It's way better than the first, and has a pretty big first for the show.

* The Time Meddler - First Time Lord other than the Doctor and Susan

* The Chase - Probably my favorite Hartnell story.  Non-essential, but hilarious.

* The Tenth Planet - I'm skipping most of Hartnell, which is a crime, but there's a lot missing and this one is probably the most important after the first episode.  Get the version with the animated last episode.  You might have to pirate it.  I know a certain site, that's pretty kickass in my opinion, that has it.  Cybermen, and the first regeneration ever, don't miss it.

* Tomb of the Cybermen - More Cybermen, and you need to watch Troughton because Troughton is great and Jaime might be the best companion ever.  Nightmare in Silver is influenced heavily by this one, but this one is way better.

* The War Games - It's long, but huge for the mythos of Doctor Who.  This is the first time the Time Lords are named, and the second time you see one that isn't the Doctor.  It's long, but it's pretty great.

* Spearhead from Space - First Third Doctor story.  Every single first episode of New Who so far (we haven't seen Capaldi's yet) takes a leaf out of this one's book.  Essential.

* Doctor Who and the Silurians - First Silurian story.  Non-essential.

* Terror of the Autons - More Auton stuff.  Also, introduction of a *very* major character.  This whole season is all about him.

And that's as far as I've gotten so far.  I know you'll need to watch The Deadly Assassin, City of Death, and Genesis of the Daleks for Four, and Remembrance of the Daleks for Seven, but I haven't gotten that far yet.",0,1391402790,null,0,false,0,cf5ouax,t3_1wtxi9,t1_cf5ouax,t3_1wtxi9,null,1432228601,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

This being Matic starting and Mikel coming on for 15 minutes to see out the game. With Matic starting we would have had that driving energy throughout the entire game, which i think would have contributed to a goal or two. However, with Mikel doing his usual role, it did not give us the speed and directness we needed to break down a 9 man defensive line.
