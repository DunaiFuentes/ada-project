It's a fucked up mentality but seeing others hurt, specifically the ones you love because of your actions will harm you more than if you were the target.

Say you have two kids, ideally twins, one of them does something bad. Punish the innocent party, let them know you are punishing them for the actions of the other. Unless the offender is a sociopath things will change quickly. Wouldn't actually work on very young kids btw, have to be close to the age of reason, everyones a sociopath until this point.

As an example look at what feminism does in regard to rape. It doesn't attack rapists it attacks other men for allowing them to rape. I dislike feminism but the punish the innocent mentality amongst them helped them get where they are today.

Now these are pretty fucked up ways of dealing with things and if you use them it may very well say more about you than the scum you are attacking, but regardless they are effective.

It's my opinion (an a flaky one at that) that one of the mistakes in our society is to continue to explore epistemology at the absolute fringes of reality, instead of exploring it in complex, real situations.  

We as a society are so *gullible*.  Someone says ""I love you"" and we believe them.  Someone else says ketchup is bad for you and we just believe them.  Putin says ""oh those aren't Russian troops"" and the world is powerless to call the bullshit.  

I believe this is because epistemology, the study of truth and its sources, is dedicated to the absolute edge of reality, with questions like ""how can we know that this pencil actually exists?"" instead of questions like ""how can you know that the car you're buying hasn't had its odometer tampered with?""

I cringe when somebody uses that as a good thing. Our new builds are [some of the smallest in Europe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14916580), and this is nothing to be proud of, especially when we have developed our land so little.

If you're going to assume that everything must be in the centre, then sprawl is a problem. But only the smaller towns haven't done away with their ""main street"" or town centre plan, and most now have several ""centres"".

London and Tokyo are made up of several fairly self-contained cities and wards, for example.

I seems developing the brownfield only really benefits those with nice houses at the green belts, with the added benefit of shoe-boxing poorer folk in the middle.

In tests between November 2001 and Febuary 2002, screeners missed 70% of knives, 30% of guns an 60% of (fake) bombs. And testers were able to smuggle bomb making parts through airport security in 21 of 21 attempts.

This is absolute bullshit just so the transport security can say ""atleast we tried"", removing accountability from themselves.

&gt;MP pay should be linked directly to the minimum wage, how can they claim to represent people when they have no idea what it is like to live with little money in this country.

Do you mean MPs should be paid minimum wage? In which case you will only attract people who are willing to work for minimum wage, or worse, only people who can afford to work for so little because they are already very wealthy. We should pay MPs a salary which reflects the high quality and standards we expect of them. 

&gt;how can they claim to represent people when they have no idea what it is like to live with little money in this country.

MPs should represent their constituents by listening to what they want, and reflecting those wants in how they vote in parliament. People choose who is going to represent them based on who they think is best at the job, not who is most like them.

Misrepresentation of the facts. 47% of the trade goes to EU trade depots. Only about half that actually stays in the EU nations. The rest moves on to other countries.

Also, if we left the EU, that trade *would not stop*. If the EU stopped or restricted trade as a result of the UK leaving, they would be breaking both their *own laws* and *international law*.

Thirdly, all free trade agreements agreed by the EU and non EU partners would still be in effect if the UK left, so they would not be at risk either unless we deemed them unsuitable or not in our best interests.

""and European trade supports over 4 million jobs in the UK.""

Stop scaremongering. Those jobs would not disappear.

Then with the online system, your friend 'assigns' his/her ticket selection to you, then you can get on and buy both tickets at the same time.  

If only one of you has the membership, then you can buy the one ticket during the early release, then you can get on later right before general release and buy another ticket **pending availability**.  The person I talked to on the phone made it sound like you would probably be able to buy another ticket, but it was extremely unlikely that you'd be able to get another seat right next to your other one.

I ended up buying a membership for myself and one for my wife so we could be sure to sit together.  It was expensive, but well worth it.

Europhiles like to spread the scare story of how Britain would lose millions of jobs and all trade with the EU if it left. This is plainly not true. See my other comment on this thread in response to realsourlemonade.

Stability, is another. 

The EU, most likely inadvertently, has through its interference in sovereign nations created the perfect breeding ground for the ideologies and political parties Europeans as a whole said 'Never Again' to in 1945. These being extreme right wing Neo-Nazis and Ultra-nationalists. There are also moderate right wing parties that are not racist and just want their country back, but the big threat is the extreme parties.

Also, the EU's claim at stopping war is bullshit. Democratic nations do not go to war with each other. That fact, coupled with NATO and external threats are what have prevented a Pan-European war, not the EU. Hell, the EU in any form didn't even exist until the mid 70's.

EU Opaqueness is a third problem I've seen.

There is obviously a problem with corruption and dishonesty in the EU 'government'. Yet they continuously deny anyone the ability or access needed to vet and analyse the system to make sure nothing is wrong. This just breeds suspicion and prevents trust build up.

The EU needs massive reform into a more open and democratic system that it has at the moment if there is any chance of it surviving. As it is now, it will fail. Whether it fails quickly and bloodlessly, or slowly and devastatingly, I would not care to speculate on.

I mean fact are that Pašalić was a key player for Hajduk, and Halilović was a bench warmer for Dinamo that didn't get too much playing time.
Of course there's more of an competition at Dinamo and all, but even the impression Halilović left was nothing spectacular. He was lauded as the next Maradona, Haladona is the nickname given to him to take a piss, and yet his impact on the pitch even in Croatian league came to...nothing special. 

Pašalić on the other hand was pulling the entire team, at times all by himself, to have a season which although not perfect by any means, I think a lot of fans would describe as good all things considered.

Halilovic may be a better clown, he may be able to do wonders with the ball. I'm sure he'll find himself right at home over in Barca, they like clowns like that over there, but at the end of the day he's not effective. For all his technical knowhow around, his teams don't really benefit from it. Neither Dinamo nor the young NT really were a lot better because they had Halilovic playing for them.

If you can provide sources for your claims that aren't UKIP campaign material or originating from a UKIP-aligned thinktank then feel free.

Looking at what the Centre for European Reform has to say:

&gt; The UK has very little to gain by quitting the EU and much to lose. Britain’s interest lies in reducing the cost of trade with its largest trade partners – which the EU evidently does. The cEr’s model suggests that the country’s membership of the EU’s single market has boosted its 
trade in goods with the rest of the Union, and there is little evidence that trade overall has been diverted away from other major trading partners.

Now the cEr aren't an organisation I'd ordinarily agree with, given their affiliation to neoliberal politics, but their primary interests are money and the economic markets. When it comes to the outcomes of leaving or entering international trade organisations they seem a legit source of information.

The most interesting point they raise is that the UK can't dictate the terms of its exit as we actually have a trade deficit with the EU, so your assertion that trade would be unaffected is bobbins. 

You're also claiming our tourism industry, which is huge, would be unaffected... yet the service sector is by far the largest and most important sector in the economy. Are you saying a party dedicated to stopping the free movement of people between the UK and EU won't affect tourism?

&gt; Nice strawman, and nice try, but i never mentioned foreign people at all in my post.

I don't think you know what a strawman is.

Any unethical or criminal activity requires three things: a target, an opportunity, and motive.

Politicians are targets for bribery, there is no arguing with that. There are people and organisations that would happily pay a serious amount of money to influence the government.

The opportunity for it to occur is there too, you really can't and shouldn't monitor the movement of MPs 24/7 to prevent the possibility of bribery.

So that leaves you with the motive. Regardless of anything else people who get paid more money are less of a bribery risk. If an MP is poorly paid it's much more likely they could come into financial difficulties for example. 

Earning less doesn't make you less ethical, it just makes you more of a bribery risk. This isn't something to be disputed really, it's basic risk management. ",0,1404923926,null,0,false,0,cisnjoh,t3_2a851k,t1_cisnjoh,t1_cismmbs,null,1434627588,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

From the OPs post, the employer has just decided that EVERYONE is at fault.  It can't simply be decided, the employer must follow their processes and procedures.

You can object in writing to the deduction, asking her to conduct a full investigation to find out who the true culprit is, and then you will fully support her deducting that persons' pay, but she must not do it to you, as it could open her to legal action from all of you (including the hidden guilty party - after all, if she hasn't done her homework, it could be anyone, and since she can't prove it wasn't a specific person, the true culprit could even take action against her to get he money back - even though they are the one at fault!)

true,ZapActions-dower,pertwee,Pertwee,"First thing you need to know is that there are no singular episodes of Classic Who.  Everything is completely serialized into 2-10 episode stories.  I say 2-10, but there is only one 10, and 8 or two, and the vast majority of stories are 4-6 episodes long, with a couple 2 episode stories.  There is also a one episode thing but it doesn't contain any regular characters and is really a setup for the story two after it.

So!  That means that for every story you sit down to watch, you can expect to be watching at least 4 episodes of ~24 minutes.  And the best way to watch Doctor Who is from the beginning, all the way through.  It really is.  Time is really not a factor so much as patience is, and if you enjoy the show why intentionally leave stuff out?  It really should be about the journey, not just getting it done and out of the way.

If you are going to skip through anything, I'd skip through the First and Second Doctors and then start in earnest at the Third, making your own decision whether to move past a serial if you just really aren't enjoying it.  One and Two make the most to skip through because they are the ones who are actually missing whole episodes, and even whole stories.  I'll link some links to episodes you should definitely watch.

If you are dead set on cutting down, these next couple links + any other serials in which companions join or leave (easy to look up) make up a comprehensive list of what you should see for a mostly complete experience.  It does leave off a lot of hidden gems, but it's probably as good as you can get.  I would not skip *any* full seasons, as you're likely to miss a companion completely or come in most of the way through their character arc.

It is more about attitude to others than it is to do with class. They can be left-wing, right-wing or centrist, but what unites them is a sneering attitude towards foreign people and cultures.

We're not talking about racism here - that's quite different. The Little Englander is not defined by a belief in racial hierarchy but rather a slightly oblivious sense of English cultural superiority.

What am i supposed to be looking at here? This in no way disproves what i said.

""If you can provide sources for your claims that aren't UKIP campaign material or originating from a UKIP-aligned thinktank then feel free.""

....Someone has not been paying attention to the Government's trade reports.

Nothing I said came from UKIP.

""Looking at what the Centre for European Reform has to say:""

Really? You are quoting the EU? Try find a more reputable source.

""The cEr’s model suggests that the country’s membership of the EU’s single market has boosted its trade in goods with the rest of the Union""

*sigh* NO ONE IS SAYING WE ARE TO LEAVE THE EEC! The EEC is not the fucking EU. UKIP and other euro-skeptics want OUT of the EU, but we want to stay in the EEC. The British people voted to be part of the EEC back in the 70's, not the EU. We never got a *choice* on whether to join the EU.

Also, the EU's trade laws state that free trade agreements will be immediately created between any states that leave the EU, ensuring trade is not disrupted.

""The most interesting point they raise is that the UK can't dictate the terms of its exit as we actually have a trade deficit with the EU, so your assertion that trade would be unaffected is bobbins. ""

Erm...sorry, but no. The EU exports more to the UK than the UK does to the EU. The EU needs the UK, not the other way around.

As for trade being unaffected, it would be, as EU laws states that should a country decide it is going to leave, a free trade agreement will be instantly applied to them, so that there is no obstacle to trade. It is stated in the Lisbon treaty.

""Are you saying a party dedicated to stopping the free movement of people between the UK and EU won't affect tourism?""

Free movement does not deal with tourism, you twat. Free movement refers to immigration and emigration on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. Also, Euroskeptics, especially UKIP, have no problem with immigrants, so long as they integrate, assimilate, learn English, get a job and generally contribute to the nation.

Most immigrants from the Anglosphere and Central/Western/Southern Europe do do that. As do many from North Eastern Europe. The main problem is undesirables from South Eastern Europe, mostly gypsies, criminal gangs and the like who are already causing massive problems in Germany, France, the UK and various Scandinavian countries.

There is also the ongoing problem of mass immigration from non-EU sources. Far too many people who do not want to assimilate, do not want to learn English and generally do not respect or want to be part of our society come to this country, which is why i support a strict, rigourous Australian-style points system and tougher border control.",0,1404926632,null,0,false,0,cisoz5v,t3_2a851k,t1_cisoz5v,t1_cisnjmd,null,1435475560,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

- Improve the defense (e.g. Lallana's added pressing, Can's ability/depth in midfield, a new LB, and perhaps adding Lovren).
- Switch to one up top.  This adds a body (specifically Lallana's) in midfield on defense.  This will help tremendously.
- Improve on the wide forward slots, specifically the left side as Sterling is doing fine on the right.  This would be Markovic's likely role, offering pace and a tricky, attacking threat.  This improves the goal/assists contribution from that slot and Sterling is only going to get better on the right.
- Improved offensive contribution from midfield.  Lallana and to a lesser extent Can are both quite capable of scoring goals.

Overall, a bit less of a threat in attack, but improved defensively.  We'll score less, but probably concede much less as well.

I specifically reference the information I read when the Paris riots occurred in that its hard for young French immigrants to get work because both their name and address can work against them.  
In Britain I'd like to think (i'm not an immigrant so its hard for me to tell) that we're more classist in our discrimination in that we don't care what your name is or where you live as long as you dress correctly and speak well (i.e. not be obviously ""lower class"").  This makes it a bit easier for immigrants to get work and makes life much easier for children of those immigrants.

Also afaik France works on the premise that children born to immigrant families are not automatically French. They must apply for citizenship upon adulthood. This results in a large young section of the population that are technically in limbo and have to ask themselves:

&gt; Will I apply for citizenship, who am I? Where am I really from? Am I French?

as opposed to the English system where that isn't even a thought. If you're born here then you're British, this is your country. Job done.  

I see echos of this issue (and please correct me if you think me wrong as my understanding of French society is external) in other aspects of politics. Most recently the somewhat anti-Semitic comedian Dieudonné gets a ton of attention from the establishment while his followers might be feeling like Dieudonné's anti-Semitic transgressions are given more priority by the government than the racism they face on a day to day basis.

We're not arguing the philosophy of ethics here (though I could as I've studied it) we're talking about practicalities.

How the fuck do you expect to tell whether or not someone who was in financial difficulties would take a bribe or not? There is literally no way to tell until they've actually done it.

You can argue what you want, but the fact is if you're paid more money you're less of a bribery risk because you have more to lose. If you earn £300K a year and I offer to bribe you £50K to do something you're risking a lot more then if I try to bribe someone who earns £20K.

This really is basic risk management, you want to minimise the risk that someone in the house of commons will bribed. Unless you have a mind reading device that can 100% accurately tell whether or not someone would ever take a bribe you need to work of likelihoods. 

You keep saying that I've linked ethics to what people earn, which is literally what I haven't done once. Everyone has a price, if you think otherwise you are naive. Once you establish that, it's obvious that the person who gets paid more has a higher price, and therefore is less likely to be bribed.

true,alk3v,lfc99,,"You forgot to mention a returning Scouser who will bleed for the shirt until the ref stops the game to get him cleaned up. Lambert is going to be a good stop gap solution for Suarez even if we don't get a marquee striker and I think people are underestimating his potential impact. 

The thing about losing a world class player is that you don't necessarily try to replace him like for like. Recall Aquilani for Xabi? Merieles in the coming years too? If you pidgeon-hole a player to try and develop into a specific world class mould that they don't fit into and it hampers their style. I thought the DM role improved with Lucas at the helm when Masch was sold because the team adjusted around his style. Shame that Xabi and improved Lucas never played together because I am convinced that CDM pairing would be better than the Xabi-Masch.

Instead adapt the team and mold replacements to collectively create and score more than the team did before. How did the Scum deal with losing Ronaldo? They kept winning things even with him out. They bought quality wingers and bolstered their strike force to even out his creativity and goal scoring prowess across the team. And of course whiskey nose remodeled the team's approach to utilize those strengths. 

Suarez was going to go eventually. I'd rather it happen now before his value decreases after a bad season, because I personally think his last season with us will be the highlight of his career. He is not going to a team that will build around him specifically given Messi is their man. He's not going to get the ball enough and have the coach yell at him if he tries to do some of the stuff he did here (e.g. some of his more speculative dribbling challenges and shots). Barca surely won't put up with any of his antics or give him the attention he needs to control his behavior either. 

Suarez leaves a gap in creativity and finishing. Address that and we improve vastly. The Southampton duo of Lallana and Lambert goes a great deal forward there. Recall Lambert's assist tally. Additionally the money has given us license to improve out CDM backup and strikers long term. Getting a strong winger is all that is needed in my opinion (Sanchez/Greizmann or someone near that quality). Who knows, maybe Coutinho as winger will resurface (recall Suarez isn't necessarily quick, but quick-witted). 

IMO the following have to step up: Sturridge, Lambert, Coutinho (creativity), Gerrard (direct freekicks), Lallana/Coutinho (creativity), Sterling (creativity, goals). This doesn't have to be done by individual improvement either. If team chemistry increases that'll do too. It will be hard to replace Suarez, but the team maybe actually improve with him gone, mainly because Suarez and Sturridge aren't competing for chances anymore (which I felt started to happen late in the season). 

TL;DR The team can and will adapt. Brendan will shape the team how he wants which he's proven is a great footballing goal machine team that can blitz even the best in the league. The team will change how it plays however. No more pass it to Suarez and hope magic happens. It's got to be more calculated.",0,1404928046,null,0,1404928449,0,cispqz8,t3_2a88qa,t1_cispqz8,t3_2a88qa,null,1434628578,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Ethics is not affected by your earnings. We're not arguing about someone in financial difficulties here, we're arguing about a difference from a 66k to a 100k salary having a tangible impact on someone's susceptibility to bribery. 

My argument is entirely that an individual not in financial distress cannot be bought unless they are willing to compromise their ethics. Your argument that everyone had a price is facetious and this can be shown by example of individuals around the world refusing to leave their properties etc. In fact it's far more common in this cases that the petitioner starts to apply a negative stimulus as well as an incentive to try to get people to do something. 

Certainly, a difference of 50% of salary is not going to make an MP immune to the kind of money that can be thrown at them by a large industry.

No I'm quoting a UK thinktank that wants to reform the relationship with the EU and examines the potential economic consequences of different reform options.

It is, in as much as the single market has changed significantly since the incorporation of EEC into the EU, unless you are referring exclusively to the Treaty of Brussels? How does UKIP propose we get out of the Treaties of Maastricht and Lisbon without ending Brussels as well? Where's the precedent?

I kind of floated around to each little group, watched part of the game and tried to chat with the supporters. The group that had the most fans in the bar was by far Arsenal. I had thought about supporting them at first because I didn't want to be a fan of any of the top teams, but I also wanted someone who wasn't forever mid/lower table, a team with  bigger ambitions. 

After floating around I ended up standing with the Arsenal group. I started chatting with them, told them I was new to the prem and was thinking about supporting their squad. I hung there for a bit, it wasn't until near the end of the first half of their game, after chatting with a lot of their supporters I noticed something; ALL OF THE ARSENAL FANS WERE COCK SUCKERS, all of them. After telling them I was new they all started talking down to me. I tried to buy one guy a beer I was chatting with which he denied and said he wasn't drinking. Basically, they made me feel like a douche for standing there with them. Luckily, I remembered I was cool as shit, so I didn't watch the second half with them.

If you pidgeon-hole a player to try and develop into a specific world class mould that they don't fit into and it hampers their style. I thought the DM role improved with Lucas at the helm when Masch was sold because the team adjusted around his style. Shame that Xabi and improved Lucas never played together because I am convinced that CDM pairing would be better than the Xabi-Masch.

Instead adapt the team and mold replacements to collectively create and score more than the team did before. How did the Scum deal with losing Ronaldo? They kept winning things even with him out. They bought quality wingers and bolstered their strike force to even out his creativity and goal scoring prowess across the team. And of course whiskey nose remodeled the team's approach to utilize those strengths.""

Replace Suarez's goals and creativity, gain depth and you may see a net increase in performance.

UKIP wants to have Britain exit the EU, and become a trading partner, nothing more. How they plan on going about that, i havent a clue.

You did not provide 'sourced evidence' that supported your assertion that the UK needs the EU more than the EU needs the UK. In fact, it is the other way round. The UK is the largest market for many EU nations. If trade obstacles were put in place, the EU would feel it far harder than Britain.

Doctors want to know what you expect from a consultation (Its part of their training, communication skills focuses around ICE - Ideas, Concerns and Expectations) but if you go in starting with 'I want a referral' the GP is immediately going to be put on the back foot. No-one does that many years in training for anyone off the street to say 'Yeah, I know better than you, your just here to facilitate what I want'. Instead mention the physio's opinion, emphasise a referral is what you were hoping for, if possible get a letter from the physio. Provide the evidence for why you want the referral and they're far more likely to relent. Maybe even not a referral just yet, but mentioning the lump and getting scans.

Darren Bent is a proven striker, especially when he has the right support. But when you're told that you're no longer wanted and shipped off to a relegation fodder club it's bound to affect your confidence. That's why he didn't do well at Fulham.

N'Zogbia again is proven midfielder and can play in positions where we're desperately lacking skill. But being injured and told to train with the youth squad has probably damaged his confidence too.

Given, ok he's second to Guzan obviously, but while he's at the club he should be respected.


We need to save money, so these players may not be at the club forever. But while these players are here we should at least make use of them. Add to that when they're not playing their value is decreasing.

I had a problem which prevented me from walking more than a short distance, and I kept on naively waiting for it to recover, and going back to GPs. The situation went on for two years, mostly of GPs saying ""you're young, you'll get better"" until I realized that the only way to get the care was to pay for it. Within about three months of going to a private physio the problem resolved.

The thing which annoyed me about the process was that it would have been much healthier if some GP had actually been honest in saying 'this is a problem, but we don't have the funding to deal with it, I suggest if you have the money you should go elsewhere', rather than trying to bluff and bluster their way through, especially when that involves insinuating that you're a hypochondriac.",0,1404931184,null,0,false,0,cisrgeq,t3_2a83it,t1_cisrgeq,t1_cisexig,null,1434629384,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On a wider note, just like every other large organisation in history people can have good and bad experiences with a union. What appeals to me about them is that if I fail as a rep to do what I'm supposed to any member is free to table a motion of no confidence against me and have me booted form my post if I'm not doing well. People generally prefer to whinge instead of exercising their democratic power and making anything better, though. Usually because they perceive a union as a service they pay for, when it isn't really that at heart, at all. Bad union staff usually only exist in branches where members are apathetic. It's that old adage about all it takes for evil to triumph...

I wasn't impressed with my union presence and support in the workplace so I stepped up and became a rep. Now things are better. I'm not on here to preach, but these are organisations where members can get together and present their case about any aspect of the union and they have to be heard, so long as a motion is seconded it will be open to a vote and if it's felt that someone is bad with too much in-branch support it can be taken right to the top. It's a pyramid power system, just like most employers, only the pyramid is the other way up. So long as people are willing to put the time in to exercise their power.

No. My argument is that the more they earn, the less likely they will be put in a situation where taking a bribe seems like it may be a good idea.

You're just creating strawman arguments to knock them down, when I've never said them at all. Why the fuck would you bribe a soldier? Why would you bribe a low level civil servant?

Yeah you *could* bribe them, but the risk overall is minimal if you successfully do it. Bribing a senior politician or civil servant though is a big deal.

Either can pay, no one else minds generally. For me personally if I ask someone else to do something with me I assume I am paying unless I speak with them and change that.

You can do it if you want to, but it might be a little out of place in a pub. Can't be a bad thing though right?

Our midfield wasn't set up to have a defensive anchor, it was set up for Gerrard to control play and pull the strings, which he was amazing at.  When we lose possession we cover ourselves by pressing, not by falling back on our defensive midfielder. If we don't regain possession then our shape changes as we defend with the other 2 midfielders really pinch into the middle to cover him. I expect this to be a little different this season now that we seem set to play with 1 central striker instead of 2, but I don't think we'll be re dining roles that drastically through the middle.

Lucas absolutely could not play the role Gerrard does now, it would require a systematic change in our strategy to reinstall him as a defensive midfielder. And in doing so you have to bench Gerrard because they don't really work well together anymore. I think we are a substantially larger threat with Gerrard than we are with Lucas right now. I also think our defensive problems came from the fullbacks more than anything,  and then some bad errors on the CBs.

#3: Martial Arts/Aikido
#4: Pure crazy, Thermionic Jelly Babies
#5: Double-edged cricket bat that expands in size depending on how many enemies killed
#6: Transforms into a giant ball of fat and rolls over his enemies
#7: Wit, sarcasm, and ingenuity
#8: Drops panties like no one's business. His skill is getting women to sleep with him.
War: Ability to make tough decisions and live with it
#9: Anger, ferocity, all channeled from an event that wiped out his people. Also plays in a punk band on the weekends.
#10: Uses science and wit to accomplish goals. Has a similar skill to #8 but can never seal the deal.

First possibility is that they don't actually *know*. Everybody knew the rumours about Savile, including presumably the hospital managers and the police. Very few people had actual proof. Nobody is going to go to the police to report a rumour which they probably already know.

Second is that they are in on it, either getting paid or involved with the abuse. Or in the case of Savile, the millions he brings in might be making you look good and doing no harm to your career prospects. These things would be covered by existing laws.

Final possibility is that, implicitly or explicitly, they have been intimidated into silence. Risking your career, and possibly getting sued, to blow the whistle can be very difficult. If you are not the only person who knows, maybe if someone more senior than you also knows, you might just think let them speak up, not me.

They should go after anyone directly involved, obviously. And also anyone senior who had a pretty good idea what was happening but found it advantageous to turn a blind eye. I don't think it is right to go after any junior staff who might have seen something but were too scared to speak out.

Davies when he first broke onto the scene was a much better player than he is now, now he just looks lazy and doesn't have the energy that we want in a fullback.

His tackling is good and he is pretty strong, but positionally he is pretty average and can sometimes go missing. He tends to get in the wrong position, Ashley Williams bails him out and then they are both out of position as Davies doesn't have the awareness to fill in for Williams. Against top class wingers he gets annihilated as he isn't that quick.

Going forward he is hit and miss, sometimes he puts in a good cross but normally its just average and doesn't beat the defender.
It might be down to Laudrup as all the players looked bored under him, but this season I wasn't impressed and he certainly isn't Liverpool quality.

Only if it's related to your business. If they're handing out crazy letters to your customers you can chuck them out, but if they're acting like anyone else then you can't.

Religion is covered (as is the lack of a religion):

&gt; There is no specific list that sets out what religion or belief discrimination is. The law defines it as any religion, religious or philosophical belief. This includes all major religions, as well as less widely practised ones.

&gt; To be protected under the Equality Act, a philosophical belief must:

&gt; * be genuinely held
* be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint, based on the present state of information available
* be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour
* attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance
* be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.

&gt; Humanism and atheism are examples of philosophical beliefs.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Nowhere did I say all Muslims are antisemitic, but you already knew that.  Neither did I say that I'm OK with journalists vilifying Muslims.  

However, I think that it's a mistake for British Muslims to try to become professional victims over their treatment in the press.  

First off - I think that they actually get an extraordinarily sympathetic hearing in much of the media.  The BBC and The Guardian in particular bend over backwards to run positive stories of UK Muslims.  I also regularly see nominally right-wing publications make enormous efforts to be fair.  Of course, some papers have a more right-wing, even xenophobic bent, but that's exactly what you would expect with a free-press.  But, the speaker isn't making that differentiation.  Her charge seems to be that 'the media' as a whole is biased against Muslims.

Secondly - I think that given the disaster Islam has been around the world, instead of playing the perpetual victim, UK Muslims might want to reflect on just how lucky they are to live in such a tolerant society.  The UK is probably one of the most tolerant nations in Europe if not the world and far from being fascists, the British are the guys who *fought* fascism!

Conversely, I can't think of a single Muslim country I would want to live in and the more religious the state, the less likely I would want to live there.  At worst I could actually be killed for professing my atheism or wanting to express criticism of Islam.  

I'm also all too aware that given the opportunity, many British Muslims would love to restrict *my* freedoms and that Islam is an ideology completely in opposition to the secularist principles I hold so dear.  

Want to improve the image of Islam?  Instead of calling the UK press Nazis, perhaps British Muslims should be trying to reform their own religion.

It used to be a lot harder when I was a kid even, before there was such a thing as a transfer window. Players could come and go throughout practically any part of these season.

true,Lou3000,flair1,,"1.  Of the 7 we bought last year, Lamela, Capoue, Chiriches, Paulinho all spent significant time injured.  Chadli didn't really get much playing time, and Soldado had probably the worst season of his career.  The one player that actually played, Eriksen, won player of the year.

2.  Of the veterans, we had Rose, Walker, and Townsend out for long periods.  I think we topped the list of injured PL teams.

3.  The squad was a mess, no real preseason, coaching changes, tactical changes, and absolutely no stability.  

I don't assume we are top 4 quality, and unlike last season where there was a ton of hype, I don't have any expectations.  If we can stay healthy, maintain or build on our depth at a lot of positions, then there is no reason we can't challenge.  And as someone else said, you don't really have to consistently beat Man City to be top 4, you have to beat West Ham and Newcastle and relegation fodder (last year's Norwich).

  I think it's very easy to view the two of them as a partnership, and as Suarez is definitely the better of the pair, we assume that Sturridge benefits more from Suarez.

  I think it will be interesting to see Sturridge as a solo striker though, as he's worked pretty well in a partnership, and hasn't exactly lit up games for England when he's been the lone striker. Having said that, Liverpool should have an extra player not being a striker, which might give us more width and options to get the ball to Sturridge.

In tests between November 2001 and Febuary 2002, screeners missed 70% of knives, 30% of guns an 60% of (fake) bombs. And testers were able to smuggle bomb making parts through airport security in 21 of 21 attempts.

Are you picking her up? I would normally arrange to meet a guy there, specifically so as to a) avoid the parent scenario as my mum is *so nosy*, and b) to avoid the wretched awkwardness that might follow being dropped off again after an awful date. I'm sure your date won't be awful, but it's precautionary as ever. 

I always offer to pay my half. It depends on the girl as she might just assume you'll pay. I don't know her, after all. Mostly I'll offer my contribution to dinner, the guy will refuse and pull out his wallet, I'll offer again (out of politeness), he'll turn my offer down a second time and then I'll just thank him and let him pay. That's normally how it turns out, anyway. Sometimes I'll offer and he'll accept and we go halves. I don't mind either way as I always make sure I have enough on me to cover my portion. I might buy drinks later on for him instead. 

Guys will often open doors for me, but pulling chairs out is a bit much. I'm 29. I can handle my own chair. 

Depends entirely on the date, sometimes I've left with a kiss on the cheek, once or twice it's turned into full on making out post-date. Play it by ear. 

I'd say go for nice trousers or jeans and a button up shirt rather than t-shirt. I'm not expecting a full suit and pubs are casual, but a little bit of effort is appreciated. No tie.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"&gt;He's saying it because he was asked it in an interview, and unlike most politicians who hide behind their party line, he told the truth, and said what he thinks.

Point, except he could have waived the question precisely because of the current scandal. Especially since there are whispers that it includes people from multiple parties. Farage himself may not be guilty but he's very much aware of the importance of image and people's perspectives of him and interview or not, this will affect those things.


&gt;MPs are underpaid.

Okay, I'm gonna need you to go right ahead and elaborate on this. Like, a fucking lot.

&gt;It is right that we should end this abuse of the system and just pay MPs a proper salary, in line with what a profession such as a headteacher earns.

Headteachers and teachers are classified as Civil Servants (At least that seems to be the case. I found the details of a teacher I knew while working for Greenwich Council under employee details, and the details were up to date) if you're going to equate the salary of a head-teacher to that of an MP then it implies equal skill or responsibility in the chosen profession. That isn't always the case. We pay Headteachers so much because in order to become a Headteacher you have to spend years in the teaching profession and excel at it to such an extent that you can then rise to it. An MP may not necessarily have that ability or that experience, especially not a career politician who does nothing except vote whatever way the party demands and participate in the occasional debate.",0,1404945907,null,0,false,0,cisz7bv,t3_2a851k,t1_cisz7bv,t1_cisj57y,null,1434633507,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Then its linked to the minimum wage in a completely arbitrary and meaningless way, hence my confusion. If you double the minimum wage, your salary has no relation to the minimum wage any more.

&gt;almost total job security

They have to pass a new job interview every 5 years. They have terrible job security. 

&gt;MPs should represent their constituents by listening to what they want, but living on £66,396 plus expenses will cause a person to be so detached from the reality of most of their constituents that they cannot possibly hope to act in a representative way.

So does a head teacher earning £100,000 a year not know anything about reality, and so is not fit to teach children how to be part of society? 

&gt;Why tackle massive increases in energy costs when they don't effect you or your party donors? Why tackle massive increases in mortality of disabled people and use of food banks when they don't effect you or your party donors? 

Because believe it or not, many people become politicians because they actually want to help people. Plus we have elections, which allows the people to keep their representatives in check. If they do the things you suggested, they wont be elected next time around. 

&gt; If you think MPs are chosen based on ability, and are representative of their constituents then you are living in cloud cuckoo land.

What ability do you think MPs should be judged on? 100m Sprint? We have local elections, people choose the candidate they want to represent them in parliament. Its a democratic system and it works well. Look at someone like George Galloway, who was elected outside the main parties, does his election not represent his constituents? If people want to elect someone outside of the main parties they can. 

&gt;Some of us work for less than minimum wage, with no holiday allowance, are faced with massive increases in bills year on year, with no increase in pay and then are told that £66k is not enough to get by. It's a cruel joke, and not one I will pay for willingly, downvotes be damned.

No-one has said that its not enough to get by. We pay people what they are worth, doctors have a high salary because its a skilled, difficult, time consuming job. They are worth the money. A good head-teacher who can really help raise a generation of children and help them achieve their best is worth 100,000 a year. The people who run our country, who make trade deals, who increase investment in the UK, who decide what infrastructure needs to be built. We want the best people possible to make those decisions. Contrary to the absolute rubbish you were saying earlier about the job being easy, its actually one of the most difficult, time consuming and stressful jobs there is. We want good people doing it and we should compensate them for the work they do. ",0,1404946043,null,0,false,0,cisz9vn,t3_2a851k,t1_cisz9vn,t1_cisuexp,null,1434633558,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;

&gt;___The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781___ is a 1783 large [oil painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_painting) by [John Singleton Copley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton_Copley). It depicts the death of Major [Francis Peirson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Peirson) at the [Battle of Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jersey) on 6 January 1781.

&gt;The Battle of Jersey was the last French attempt to seize the island of [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey), and one of the last battles with invading forces from a foreign nation in the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles).  The invasion was organised privately by Baron [Philippe de Rullecourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_de_Rullecourt) but funded and supplied by the French government, and was intended to remove the threat that British naval vessel based in Jersey posed to American ships in the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War).

&gt;Approximately 1,000 French soldiers, commanded by de Rullecourt and an Indian, [Mir Sayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Sayyad), landed at La Rocque, [Grouville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouville), overnight on 5–6 January. They occupied [St Helier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helier) early on the morning of 6 January. They captured the [Lieutenant Governor of Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Jersey) [Moses Corbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Corbet), in bed. Although he surrendered, Peirson, the 24-year-old commander of around 2,000 troops of the British garrison, refused to surrender. As Peirson organised a counter-attack, a French shot killed him. Lieutenant Philippe Dumaresq of the Jersey militia took command of the British forces, which comprised detachments of the 95th Regiment of Foot, [78th Highlanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Regiment,_Duke_of_Albany%27s_Own_Highlanders), and [Jersey Militia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Militia). The British forces quickly overwhelmed the French, most of whom surrendered.

Holiday homes are taxed at 50% (variable, up to 100% dependant on area) for council tax. https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/second-homes-and-empty-properties

Likewise, empty houses attract council tax, but at a similarly reduced rate.

The idea that they were paying nothing 'because it was a holiday home' doesn't stack up.


Council tax is a burden on the _occupants_ of the property, not the owner.  See, e.g. http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/council-tax/who-pays-council-tax

If you live there, and it's incorrectly assessed, they you would be liable for the tax.  I would not move in there without letting the council know that you have moved in, and then let the council sort it out.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Okay, I'm gonna need you to go right ahead and elaborate on this. Like, a fucking lot.

MPs have been underpaid since the 80s when Margaret Thatcher was in power. She refused to raise the salaries of MPs because she thought it would make her look out of touch with the people who were struggling. So instead she encouraged all MPs to use the expenses system as an unofficial way of supplementing their income. Each successive government has continued with this tradition. No-one want to raise MPs salaries by a large amount, because the public won't like it, so they just let the expenses continue.  

A proper salary would remove the need for expenses and make the whole system fairer and less open to abuse. 

&gt;We pay Headteachers so much because in order to become a Headteacher you have to spend years in the teaching profession and excel at it to such an extent that you can then rise to it.

We pay headteachers a large amount because a good headteacher can be hugely beneficial for a school, in how its run and managed, and help the children there achieve the most out of their time there. There isn't actually any requirement for a headteacher to have a teaching qualification, and many people chose to leave high powered, high salary careers to become headteachers becuase their skills are highly sought-after in this profession.

In the same way, many politicians come from the business world, such as Nigel Farage, who was a city trader, or from other backgrounds which may be desirable. Many politicians do have a lot of experience, the average age of an MP is 50. ",0,1404947294,null,0,false,0,ciszx1t,t3_2a851k,t1_ciszx1t,t1_cisz7bv,null,1434633966,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's not to say there is nothing wrong, but I don't think it warrants a specialist input yet. What do you want to see a specialist for? The only place they would send you apart from physio is to ortho. Orthos will operate on a knee to fix it if required. Before they do that they would do an MRI. None of these steps would make the pain any better.

Silly question, but how much pain relief is she taking and how often? 

If you think about the list of things that could potentially be wrong vs the list of things a specialist would be able to fix, you would understand the gp's decision more.

Here my list of the common knee complaints, the likelihood of that being what's wrong and what you would do:

Simple musculoskeletal injury. Very common. No investigations needed. Resolves by itself with regular pain relief and time.

Arthritis (degenerative or rheumatoid or psoriatic) too young to have degenerative. Initially managed with pain killers. Even it is was arthritis (very unlikely) it is too soon to tell and the clinical picture will become more apparent with time.

Ligament damage or cartilage damage. Slight possibility it might be this but she was only running. It can happen but usually happens with deceleration / twisting injuries. This would be apparent on physical examination and you knee would also be clicking and locking. It would have also swollen up A LOT and would usually be painful enough that you would need to go to A/E. This can be fixed by a ortho surgeon usually after confirmation with MRI. not very likely and you've been to your GP and been examined so he / she would have ruled that out. 

TL;DR take regular pain killers and make sure you take them regularly. It will get better with time and if it doesn't you should just go see the same GP again. He knows you and will be more likely to do something since the first plan didn't work. But be patient and give it rest and time. There is no magical fix (apart from regular pain relief)

Hope that helps.

Also, secularism and Islam isn't as contradictory as you paint it but you'd need an extensive knowledge of the evolution of sharia law for you to realise that, I suppose. I agree Muslims in the UK need to engage more, yet I don't agree that they should stop calling out bullshit articles and news when they see them simply because they might be seen to be playing the victim card. The daily mail is the most popular news website in the world. If you cannot see that it's reporting on Muslims is grossly unfair and often blatantly false, then you'll never see it.

&gt; Lord Dacre is himself a frothing autocrat. An absolutely foul-mouthed boss, who constantly screams the c word at just about anyone. He would have read my Open Letter to David Cameron and yelled that “that cunt Fry needs another fucking dressing fucking down” — just the kind of language that his paper would prissily decry of course, there’s the glory in the vile bastard’s hypocrisy. He sends his son to Eton, but somehow mocks me for being posh. He bullies, swears and shrieks, but presents his paper as having the values and standards of a misty Midsomer Britain. He decries indecency on one page and pushes his male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another. His cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail is that no one decent or educated believes in it. Which is what you can say about psychics, mediums, homeopathy and the casting of runes, but that makes it, like them, more exploitative and wicked, not less.

&gt; Dacre is, all those who have had the misfortune to work for him assure me, just about as loathsome, self-regarding, morally putrid, vengeful and disgusting a man as it possible to be. His power is absolute. Cross him either in private or public and you will be assassinated by his sycophantic squad of columnist minions, all of them infected with his brand of repulsive hypocritical and gleeful spite, ready to vomit out a screed against the BBC (watch this hilarious Vine loop as an example http://entertainment.ie/wtf/Watch-If-you-think-Sky-News-was-bad-with-the-royal-baby-coverage/202884.htm ) or any other institution they hate.

true,catdoctor,null,null,"Here's what I have. Have not removed duplicates, so it's long:   
Hartnell - the Rescue - as close to a modern 2-parter as the classic series gets. Truly excellent and written by David Whitaker.
Troughton - the Mind Robber - the most surreal story of the whole show, about the land of fiction. Well written, well acted - no complaints.
Pertwee - Carnival of Monsters - the best Pertwee story. Demonstrates the glam-rock sensibility of the Pertwee era while also being absurdly good.
T. Baker - City of Death - possibly the best Doctor Who story ever, written by Douglas Adams. Huge influence on new who. 
Logopolis (4th
Davison - Caves of Androzani - best-directed/acted story, with a truly excellent script to boot. As dark as Doctor Who gets.
C. Baker - Vengeance on Varos. Vicious, biting satire that works even better in the world of reality TV.
McCoy - Ghost Light. There's nothing quite like this in televised Doctor Who. A surreal and extremely dense story about social Darwinism (and real Darwinism.) Or Remembrance.


Also “Genesis of the Daleks” and “The City of Death.”

I always recommend The Robots of Death as a starting point. It's pretty standalone, features the most popular Doctor (Four) and one of the best companions (Leela), is a standard length Classic Who story, is well paced, easy to follow, and above all it's damn great story.


1-Aztecs, Regin of Terror and the Romans (i really like his pure historicals).
2- The War Games, Mind Robber, Tomb of the Cybermen (and power of the daleks if you don't mind the reconstructions)
3- Inferno, Green Death, Silurians
4- Genesis of the Daleks, Horror of Fang Rock, and City of Death
5- Kinda, Earthshock, Caves of Androzani
6- Vengance on Varos, Revelation of the daleks
7- Rememberance of the Daleks, Happiness patrol, Curse of Fenric


The Dalek Invasion of Earth
Can't go wrong with either Tomb of the Cybermen or The Invasion
Terror of the Autons
Genesis of the Daleks
Caves of Androzani
Vengeance on Varos
Remembrance of the Daleks

1st - An Unearthly Child Part 1 (because it's excellent), then the Aztecs. The rest of the first serial isn't that great and the Aztecs is not only a good story but interesting in how it sets up some of the rules for Who. (Fixed points of time etc.)
2nd - Tomb of the Cyber-Men - Just an all around good story.
3rd - The Daemons - Pretty much the quintessential UNIT story. (Alternately, you could pick anything from season 7, as I think it's Pertwee's best)
4th - Genesis of the Daleks - It allows people who are fans of the new series to see where Davros comes from, explain that this was the story that started off the Time War, and plus it's just a good story.
5th - Caves of Androzani - best-directed/acted story, with a truly excellent script to boot. As dark as Doctor Who gets. It gives you a real sense of Davison's Doctor as he sacrifices himself to save Peri.
6th - Vengeance on Varos - Vicious, biting satire that works even better in the world of reality TV.
7th - Curse of Fenric - This is one of the best stories of the era, gives a sense of what McCoy's Doctor is like and his relationship with Ace. I thought about including Remembrance of the Daleks, but I didn't want to include two Daleks stories.
Earthshock
Hand of Fear
Tomb of the Cybermen
Black Orchid
The Two Doctors
Edge of Destruction 
Web Planet
Talons of Weng-Chiang

Every Doctor Who fan should watch the first episode of ""An Unearthly Child."" It's 20 minutes of your time, and (with the exception of a random racist line by the Doctor) it stands up as great television even by modern standards.
After that, I would recommend hitting the highlights, roughly in order. You can find suggestions from any ""Best Episodes of Doctor Who"" list, but I'm going to give my recommendations. This is based on a weekly ""Best of Classic Doctor Who"" night I'm going to be hosting later this year with a group of friends.
The First Doctor
Episode One of ""An Unearthly Child""
""The Daleks"" features the first appearance of a little alien race you might have heard of: the Thals.
""The Edge of Destruction"" introduces the idea that the TARDIS is alive and sentient. It's also a really tense two parter, roughly the same length as a modern episode.
""The Aztecs"" is one of the better Historicals that isn't missing any episodes.
""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" features the departure of Susan and the Doctor's iconic ""One day, I shall come back"" speech.
""The Time Meddler"" is the first appearance of another Time Lord (although the term hadn't been invented yet), and also uncharacteristically funny for a Hartnell story.
""The War Machines"" almost feels like a modern Doctor Who story, and also features the only occurrence of the character being referred to in universe as ""Doctor Who.""
""The Tenth Planet"" is the first Doctor's final story, and the first appearance of the Cybermen. The Cybermen look rather silly at first glance, but in my opinion they hit the uncanny valley in a way that makes them a little creepier than other versions of the Cybermen, and their voices make them even more unsettling. The final episode is missing, but there is an animated version.
The Second Doctor
""Power of the Daleks"" episode one. This one is missing, so there are only reconstructions, but it's one of the reconstructions I would recommend watching, if only because this is the first time in the series that a new actor is playing the Doctor. That's a pretty big landmark.
",0,1404949101,null,0,false,0,cit0se8,t3_2a8a1m,t1_cit0se8,t1_cism6e5,null,1434634246,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3
true,catdoctor,null,null,"""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" is the first complete Troughton story. In my opinion it is a little overrated, but it does have some nice moments and it's worth seeing if only because it's discussed so often when people talk about the Second Doctor.
""The Enemy of the World"" was uncovered and released just last year, and it's a doozy. Troughton plays the Doctor AND the villain, and his performance is incredible. In my opinion, this is the best story of the Black and White era of Doctor Who.
""The Web of Fear"" was also recovered and released with ""Enemy,"" and it takes place right afterwards. Watching the cliffhanger connect the two of them gives a good idea of what watching the series back then must have been like. It features the first appearance of the Brigadier, although at this point he's a lowly Colonel and UNIT doesn't exist yet. The villain is The Great Intelligence, which you will know from series seven of the modern series. There is one episode missing, but the rest of it is good enough to suffer through the reconstruction for.
""The Mind Robber"" is one of the stranger Doctor Who stories ever. The less you know about it going in, the better. It's best to just let this story unfold.
""The War Games"" is Troughton's epic ten part swansong, and it earns every one of those ten episodes. It features a character who may or may not be the Master (depending on who you ask, I say yes) and the first appearance of the Time Lords as a race.
The Third Doctor
""The Spearhead from Space"" is his first story. It is also the only story from Classic Who that is available in HD, as it was shot on film. It's pretty good.
""Inferno"" is a good one, but like ""The Mind Robber,"" the less you know going in the better.
""Terror of the Autons"" is actually not that great, but it's the first official appearance of the Master and it has a lot of really weird, campy stuff going on, so it's worth seeing anyway.
""The Mind of Evil"" is one of the Pertwee episodes which was recovered only in a black and white version, and it's stronger for it. Black and white fits the dark mood of this story very well. A bit of a political thriller with some interesting moral questions.
""The Daemons"" has it all: demons, black magic, the occult, and a cast that is clearly having a blast filming everything on location.
""The Three Doctors"" is one of the stories that I'd argue every Doctor Who fan should see, even if they're not into Classic Who at all. It's the first multi-doctor anniversary special, and while Hartnell is barely in it due to his failing health, Troughton and Pertwee are a delightful double act.
""The Green Death"" is the departure of the Third Doctor's iconic companion, Jo Grant. It drags a little in a couple places, but the bittersweet final scene is worth sticking around for.
""The Time Warrior"" is the first appearance of Sarah Jane Smith AND Sontarans. It's a pretty breezy four parter after so many 6 and 7 part Third Doctor stories.
""Planet of the Spiders"" is Pertwee's swansong. It drags in a couple spots, but it introduces some interesting ideas about regeneration and its parallels with Buddhism. ""A tear, Sarah Jane?""
The Fourth Doctor
""The Ark in Space."" Yes, I'm telling you to skip ""Robot."" It's rubbish. ""The Ark in Space"" is basically ""Doctor Who does ALIEN years ahead of time."" There's a bit with green bubble wrap that people makes jokes about, but if you take the effects on their own terms, it's really well done.
""Genesis of the Daleks"" rewrites Dalek history, and has been framed as the opening shots of the Time War. Come for the Nazi parallels, stay for the Doctors ""Have I the right"" speech.
""The Brain of Morbius"" is just a fun piece of Gothic Horror homage, with a Frankenstein, a Monster, and a cult. You might know the Sisterhood of Karn from ""Night of the Doctor.""
""The Deadly Assassin"" is the first story to feature the Doctor sans companions. I actually think this one is overrated, but it is a turning point in how the Time Lords are depicted, and it's discussed often enough to make it required viewing.
Season 16. All of it. It is one story arcing over six serials, and frankly it's some of the Fourth Doctor's best stuff. The Doctor has been recruited by The White Guardian (defender of Order in the universe) to recover all the pieces to the Key to Time before the Black Guardian (the personification of chaos) can get his hands on them. It features the first incarnation of Romana, who is my personal favorite companion.
""City of Death"" was written by Douglas Adams under the name David Agnew (script editors weren't allowed to write episodes at the time). It's funny, breezy, and probably the best Fourth Doctor story all around.
""Logopolis"" is the Fourth Doctor's swansong. That alone makes it required viewing, but it's also really good.
The Fifth Doctor
""Castrovalva"" is not my favorite Doctor Who story by a long shot, but I consider every Doctor's first episode to be required viewing, with the exception of the 4 and 7. Also, this one basically continues the story from ""Logopolis.""
""Kinda"" is my favorite Davison story. It's one of the weirder and darker 80's Doctor Who stories. There's an urban legend that it was ghost written by Kate Bush, and while that is untrue, it certainly feels like it could have been written by her.
""Earthshock"" is a pretty decent Cyberman story, and it features the death of a companion, so it's pretty important.
""Snakedance"" is a sequel to ""Kinda."" If you didn't like ""Kinda"" you could probably skip this one, but if you did check it out.
""The Five Doctors"" is the 20th anniversary special. Need I say more?
""The Caves of Androzani"" is not only Davison's final story, it's also universally acknowledged as one of the best episodes of Doctor Who ever, including the new series.
The Sixth Doctor
""The Twin Dilemma"" episode one. No need to suffer through the entire thing, but one should see the first episode just to see how dreadful the whole thing is. Probably the greatest drop-off in quality between episodes that I've ever witnessed in any TV series ever.
""The Two Doctors,"" although really I only watch it for the Troughton.
Season 23, also known as ""The Trial of a Time Lord."" This is the story that introduces the Valeyard. It is also a real step up in quality from the previous season. One almost begins to see how Colin Baker could have been a much better Doctor than he was, given more time and better writing.
The Seventh Doctor
Skip ""Time and the Rani."" Seriously, it's awful. Sylvester McCoy is one of my favorite Doctors, and I don't want anyone's first impression of him to be this.
""Paradise Towers"" is a ton of fun, on the other hand. It's the funniest the show has been since Douglas Adams was writing it. Build High for Happiness!
""Delta and the Bannermen"" is a fun romp through the 50's and rock and roll. It also has my favorite companion-who-never-was, Ray. She's clearly a prototype for Ace, and while I love Ace, I would have loved to see Ray be a proper companion, too.
""Remembrance of the Daleks"" is my personal favorite Dalek story ever. The twists and turns of this one are unreal, and so is McCoy's ""Ultimate Power"" speech.
""Battlefield"" is the final appearance of the Brigadier on Doctor Who. Also, did you know that the Doctor was Merlin?
""Ghostlight"" is creepy and cerebral, with a dark sense of humor. Everything you want in a Seventh Doctor story.
""The Curse of Fenric"" is the last good Doctor Who story. Even though the production quality is non-existent, the script and performances carry this one home.
""Survival"" episode three. This isn't a good story, but it is the final story of Classic Who. It's worth it for the show-down with the Master and for the final ""somewhere out there"" speech, which makes me tear-up every time.
I don't have the space to do 8, but that's a whole 'nother entry, anyway.

But what we can do is strike early and snag quality players while other teams dither.  Just look at Liverpool - before most teams even got on the phone they'd already signed Can, Lallana, and Lambert, with bids for Markovic and Origi well under process.  None of these names are world beaters being chased by Real Madrid, nor are any of them (aside from them overpaying for Lallana and Markovic perhaps) outside our budget.

Last year we struck early with Paulinho, a player who might have gone to a bigger club had we waited (regardless of the fact that I think he's been largely useless for us and Brazil since, he was still a good signing at the time).

Some clubs pay a premium for locking in deals early, but there is also a premium for waiting too long.  There's no way we would've paid as much for Lamela if it wasn't a last minute deal.",0,1404949148,null,0,false,0,cit0t7q,t3_2a3flc,t1_cit0t7q,t1_cishm44,null,1434634252,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,backtowriting,null,null,"I've read several comment pages on /r/islam on the subject of whether secularism is at odds with Islam and many commenters seem to think it is.  

For instance:

[&gt;Islam is most certainly not compatible with secularism, I don't think anyone who read the Quran can make a fair, objective and honest case that says otherwise...](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/23sagh/islam_and_secularism/) (10 upvotes on r/islam)

I agree with you that most Muslims most likely don't give a damn about me, but still- Islam is an ideology, which in practice tends to be intolerant of criticism and one in which free-speech is a foreign concept.  In this regard, it's little different from many other religions, but unfortunately, it's fundamentalist Islam which is currently proving to be the biggest worry of the day.

&gt;I don't agree that they should stop calling out bullshit articles and news when they see them simply because they might be seen to be playing the victim card.

By all means complain about bad or inaccurate stories, but this speaker seems to think that Muslims are being vilified like the Jews were in the lead up to WWII.  Now, that really *is* playing the victim card! If it really is that bad, then how on Earth could you explain why so many Muslims want to come and live in the UK?  Can't imagine many Jews wanted to emigrate to Hitler's Germany.

And let's not forget that Islam is an *ideology*!  As such, it has absolutely no right to be shielded from criticism.  I agree that it's wrong to vilify  individual Muslims, but I absolutely do not agree that there is anything wrong with criticizing the religion of Islam, which as far as I can tell is a nasty, ignorant and backwards ideology fully deserving of criticism.

Edit:  It's getting late and I don't think I gave a very good response regarding the compatibility of Islam with secularism.  I think there are Muslims who approve of secularism and I essentially have no problems with that subgroup.  But, I would argue that the more religious and more conservative members of this religion do tend to hold views which are least compatible with secularism.

Islam is an ideology of its time - 8th century Saudi Arabia.  As such it reflects the morality and superstitions of that era.  I don't think it's intrinsically evil, but the rest of the world has moved on.

Is it backwards?  Most certainly!  Like every other religious text, the Quran is completely wrong in every non-trivial observation about the universe and it's completely at odds with modern physics and biology.

Is it nasty?  Well, yes it is.  Pretty much every surah in The Quran fantasizes about punishing unbelievers with hellfire for an eternity in the afterlife.  Forgive me, but as an atheist I'm not particularly fond of that.

It's also deeply misogynistic - remind me of that passage in one of the hadiths about how hell is filled with nagging women.

OK, so that's the religious texts, but what about Islam in practice?  Well, it's not doing too well is it?  It seems that Muslim nations are lagging behind the West in just about every measure.  Perhaps some of that is the fault of how the West has treated Muslim nations, but it's certainly not all our fault.  Seems to me that clinging onto an 8th century ideology isn't bringing people wealth, happiness, peace or anything good.  Rather, it's holding back a billion people in ignorance and superstition. 

I don't for one second think that Muslims are intrinsically any more prone to violence or ignorance than anyone else.  We're all humans and Muslims as a population aren't genetically any different from anyone else.  However, I do think their *ideology* is backwards, antiquated, potentially dangerous and ill-suited to living in the modern world.

&gt;The __FIFA Club World Cup__, commonly referred to as the __Club World Cup__, is an international [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) competition organised by the *Fédération Internationale de Football Association* ([FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA)), the sport's global governing body. The championship was first contested as the *FIFA Club World Championship* in 2000. It was not held between [2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_FIFA_Club_World_Championship) and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [International Sport and Leisure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Sport_and_Leisure). Since [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_FIFA_Club_World_Championship), the competition has been held every year, hosted so far by [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), the [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) and [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco). Morocco is due to host the [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_Club_World_Cup) edition.

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"My logic is mind boggling? You're the one who thinks a player only officially belongs to a club after he's officially been announced. You seem to not recognise that contracts are official documents and hold much more weight than an official unveiling to the media, which holds absolutely no weight at all btw.

I think it's a done deal yes, but as I've said many of time I'm not telling people that it's 100% done and only that **I think** it's done, my personal opinion. I base that opinion on the fact that he's already completed his medical(100% confirmed, by many reliable sources and by himself) and as I've said, usually when a medical is held before a fee is agreed the contract will also be sorted out and a pre-contract will be put in place to ensure that as long as x team arrange a fee that the player must sign for x team. This is to avoid other teams coming in later after you've already held talks and paid for a medical and stealing him. Not only that but it wouldn't have made sense to bring him in purely for a medical before the World Cup when he was unfit and had to get subbed before 10 minutes had passed in his previous game due to injury. Also it wouldn't make sense fly him in to get a medical, to fly him out for the World Cup, fatiguing him even more just to fly him in again after the fee had been arranged to discuss personal terms when the two could have been done at once. Logic dictates the chances of him having signed a contract are pretty high and he's currently enjoying his holiday having a nice rest ahead of next season whilst knowing his future is secure at Chelsea. No doubt he'll be unveiled the day before or the same day the Spain players return to Cobham.

If you don't think it's done, that's fine. You can also say that, I don't mind but don't start saying stupid stuff like he can't be official until he's been officially announced, because it doesn't work like that. Teams don't even have to officially announce their players if they don't want too. If Chelsea really wanted they could sign him not tell anyone and just have him turn up for the first game of the season to play, doesn't mean he can't play because he wasn't officially announced and therefor isn't a Chelsea player. It's just like PSG only officially announced Luiz a few days after he had signed for them, it doesn't mean for those few days he wasn't a PSG player.

As long as a player is a contracted to a team he officially plays for that team. I think Costa is already contracted to Chelsea, he may not be, w/e but one thing that is 100% certain is that he doesn't need to be announced for it to be official.",0,1404954487,null,0,false,0,cit3a7m,t3_2a1yg9,t1_cit3a7m,t1_cit2cb2,null,1434635610,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The problems last year had more to do with coaching issues, poor tactics, injuries, and players used poorly. I didn't see any desire, or heart whatsoever and I saw a lot of good players being benched over issues with the coach. Our squad was very young as well, and are only going to improve. This year, we've got a good coach who gets a lot out of his players, and who doesn't bring the drama of an AVB or Sherwood. Lamela is going to be fit, and he, like many other of the new signings have something to prove. Holtby, Lamela, Townsend, and Paulinho are all young and talented and desperate to prove that they can perform at the top level of the premiership. Soldado isn't so young, but I assure you he's dying to find the net this year and not be known as a massive flop in the transfer market. Last year, no one had a pre-season, and everything was a mess from the get-go. This season they're going to know what it's like at the top level, and have a full pre-season to work together. The only things we really need right now are a striker (or two), a left back, and a couple of reliable central defenders. We'll pick up a couple and come into this season prepared this time. The top 4 are making high profile signings as per normal but that doesn't mean anything. Has Costa ever played in the premiership before? What about Sanchez?

Peterborough etc is in the middle of some of the flattest land in the country, but it has very good transport links.

Good places for a bit of wilderness? The Lake District, Snowdonia, the Western Isles, hell, pretty. much 80% of Scotland and a fair amount of Wales.

Well, I suppose there is an analogy to be drawn, but I never particularly felt any sympathy for those Northern Irish Catholics who became professional victims either- those who whined about how persecuted they were whilst simultaneously cheering on (or at least refusing to criticize) the IRA's bombing campaign.

However, I *do* support those who were able to bring themselves to condemn the perpetrators of that violence.  Those who saw that killing civilians was a crime, no matter who was doing the killing.

I think that part of what worries me about Islam is that there isn't a strong tradition of self-criticism.  Yes, there are a few relatively weak condemnations of violence, but for the most part we're seeing Muslims retreat into victimhood - complaining that they're being unfairly persecuted or targeted by the West.  So, for instance, /r/islam is currently dominated by stories about Zionism and how evil Israel is, without any posts criticizing Hamas.  

I *do* feel sympathy for the vast majority of Muslims who are not violent and for the vast majority of Western Muslims who want nothing more than to live in peace.

We have a video of Rodgers explaining when he was first a coach that he could play with a double pivot and a single pivot in his 4-3-3. He explained the strengths and weaknesses of both but nowhere in that video did he say we will play with one holding all the time no matter what. We've played Hendo and Lucas in a double pivot as well as Stevie and Lucas. Lucas/Allen have also been the single holding mid so why couldn't we just play Stevie further forward?

No other top European club has their image messed around with by know-nothing, highly paid, charlatan kit designers the way we do.

The colours of a club are a key part of their heritage and how they identify themselves and are identified by others.

Liverpool wear red shirts, shorts and socks.

Real Madrid wear white shirts, shorts and socks.

Barcelona wear claret and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks.

Inter Milan wear navy blue and black striped shirts, with black shorts and black socks with a navy blue trim.

AC Milan wear red and black striped shirts, white shorts and black socks with a red trim.

Arsenal wear red shirts with white sleeves, white shorts and either red socks with a white trim or white with a red trim.

United wear red shirts with white shorts, and black socks.

We wear... whatever some pretentious arty fuckwit with a marketing degree draws up, while hungover, in his lunch break.

It's a joke, and is currently one of my biggest bug bears with City at the moment - I know, we're spoilt now! In all seriousness though, it is an issue. Before I invite calls not to buy it, I won't be, and rarely do regardless. I speak from a postion of wanting to preserve the club's identity, not a gullible consumer wanting to buy a pretty new kit each year.

Look at it this way. We're finally being noticed abroad and playing in Europe regularly. Very few neutrals will know what our traditional colours are because the cretins designing our kits are disregarding our heritage and being given the freedom to make any of their shitbrained ideas a reality and have our players turning out in them.

Manchester City wear sky blue shirts with a white trim, white shorts, and sky blue socks.

Those are our colours.

Minor variations are to be expected given these desingers want people [mugs] to spend their money on a new kit every single year, but they should be just that, very slight variations - not complete overhauls and disregarding the club's identity.

The finest kit we've had in recent years was in the 2010-11 season. That is the archetypal Manchester City kit, and should be used as a template to design other kits. No Manchester City kit should differ too much from that design.

The new kit is a monstrosity, and not fit to represent this club.

And while most of the writers are clearly passionate about the club, they don't let that cloud their judgment with knee-jerk reactions and what not. I think they're doing a fine job.

As for Goulding's thoughts on **Lucas**, I think I agree: Lucas could certainly offer much needed depth in that deep-lying role. He could easily start in a pinch, be a great rotation candidate as the fixtures pile up, and can come on as a sub and help lock down a game.

Unfortunately, injuries have derailed Lucas' comeback and now it seems as if he doesn't quite have a place here... I also understand that Lucas may have bigger ambitions, wants regular playing time, etc. etc. so perhaps he'll want to leave Liverpool FC to get that. And it seems like the club are willing to let him go.

But, ultimately, I hope Lucas stays. And stays healthy. Because if he does that then I think he'll be an incredibly valuable part of the team.

Think about it... Martin Skrtel was left for dead around this time last season whilst Daniel Agger was praised and cemented into the starting XI. How the tables have turned!

Maybe Redondo came close. Makelele relied on positioning. Matic looks like he can be just as good with the added power and strength and height. 

If you want to see a poor mans Masch, look no further than Medel. He has all the mental attributes, technically however, he doesnt. Thats what a Masch without technique would look like.

I miss Mascherano. One of the best midfielders to have pulled on the shirt. And to think Senor Rafa explained tactics to him with stones and pebbles when he was trying to sign him.

&gt;as he developed a more consistent delivery of an end product.

Disagree. His finishing was very good in some matches, but when you speak of end product when referring to a winger, he doesn't 'provide' much. In fact the opposite: he wants other players around him to create for him. Doesn't usually take on defenders, passes back and tends to drift into the box to score goals instead of creating them. Very reminiscent of Malouda, who did the exact same thing.

&gt;

&gt;__Holland__ is a region and former province on the western coast of the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands). The name *Holland* is also frequently used as an informal *[pars pro toto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_pro_toto)* to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted, especially outside of the Netherlands, but some individuals, particularly from the other parts of the Netherlands, dislike the use of ""Holland"" as a substitute for ""the Netherlands"",  or even find it insulting. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) as a [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County) ruled by the [Counts of Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Holland). By the 17th century, Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic).

&gt;Today, the former [County of Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Holland) roughly consists of the two Dutch provinces of [North Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Holland) and [South Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland), which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the [capital city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_the_Netherlands) of [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam); the [seat of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_of_government) of [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague); and [Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam), home of [Europe's largest port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Rotterdam).

I think he has a great deal of confidence but that confidence is mis-placed. He leaves a lot of lads open on the pitch and is dispossessed far too often for my liking.

I never quite understood his captaincy. Even off the pitch (seeing him in LUTV interviews) he seemed quiet and introverted as opposed to having any real leadership qualities. He did not seem like the type who would motivate other players or even dictate the pace and form on the pitch. He had a habit of fighting hard for the ball, running the length of the pitch and then completely failing to deliver to the wings or striker.

As a box-to-box midfielder he has bags of stamina and he works very hard but he has a great 50-60 yard pass and cross on him that he never seems to use. When he does us it, it normally comes off brilliantly but otherwise he is selfish and holds the ball far too long usually with the hopes of scoring. He also has a great shot on him and he *knows* it but he employs it at strange angles and often too early, usually while the opposing box is filled with defenders.

It would be wrong for me to say that he has had little impact on our last couple of seasons. He has made a difference but he needs to use his head while he is out there. I don't think that he is one for the future, obviously, given his age but he could have an impact if he learns to work more effectively with the rest of the squad.

 I didn't suggest you were.

&gt;However, I think that it's a mistake for British Muslims to try to become professional victims over their treatment in the press.  

I know it possibly looks like victimhood or claiming some special status, but in this case I think she was simply drawing attention to a genuine problem.

It may look like they're professional victims because the media report what they pick up from speeches and press releases - in other words, from professionals with something to say. But I think it's a mistake to attribute this pleading to Muslims in general.

&gt; I also regularly see nominally right-wing publications make enormous efforts to be fair.

Much less than half the time, from what I've seen.

&gt;Of course, some papers have a more right-wing, even xenophobic bent, but that's exactly what you would expect with a free-press.  But, the speaker isn't making that differentiation.  Her charge seems to be that 'the media' as a whole is biased against Muslims.

I agree that the relatively liberal media are fair to Muslims, but she's making a point about the right-wing media. Possibly it's misleading to describe them as simply ""the media"" but I think it's fairly clear which outlets she's talking about.

&gt;Secondly - I think that given the disaster Islam has been around the world, instead of playing the perpetual victim

Again, that's the most outspoken ones. If you listen to spokesmen (it's usually men) for other religions like the Catholic Church or the Church of England, you'll hear the same victim-playing language.

&gt;UK Muslims might want to reflect on just how lucky they are to live in such a tolerant society.

They do. Honestly, most of them do.

&gt;Conversely, I can't think of a single Muslim country I would want to live in and the more religious the state, the less likely I would want to live there.  At worst I could actually be killed for professing my atheism or wanting to express criticism of Islam.  

Well I can't think of one either. Until a few years ago I might have suggested Turkey, but not any more.

&gt;I'm also all too aware that given the opportunity, many British Muslims would love to restrict *my* freedoms

So would many Christians. Look at abortion, same-sex marriage.

&gt;and that Islam is an ideology completely in opposition to the secularist principles I hold so dear.  

Again: The Church. They have Bishops in Westminster.

I think you and I are part of that ""rampant secularism"" I keep hearing about.

&gt;Want to improve the image of Islam?  Instead of calling the UK press Nazis, perhaps British Muslims should be trying to reform their own religion.  Perhaps it's *they* who need to become more tolerant.

Which fails to answer the charge.

 I've been worried by the attitudes in the media and the language used. The continual presentation of Muslims as Others , as an alien group of one mind rather than rounded individuals like the rest of us. All this separation of Us and Them. It _is_ the kind of stunt pulled by the Nazis. It makes it easier to dehumanise people, to attack them without being opposed.

Would it not be in the best interest of the the solicitor to get as much money as possible? Or do they just want to get these cases out of the way. I'm on my 4th solicitor at this firm as its been going on so long :(

I moved away from it to focus on baseball, but i had always known of the larger teams in England, like Scum, Chelski, the Cowboys, the Cowboys, and Jennifer Lawrence, as well as a few in spain and germany. But i didn't really watch much except for the Champions league final, and the world cup. I also played FIFA a ton starting in 2010 so i picked up on players and who they were. But basically, in 2011 ESPN showed highlights of the defending Champions League Title holders getting demolished seemingly by one player. 

Having watched the 2010 Champions League Final i knew what a force Inter was, and obviously it was an impressive Feat to win, and win in the fashion that they did. So suffice it to say i instantly became a Gareth Bale fan, and grew seriously into a fan of Spurs the instant we bought Dempsey. Clint was my hometown soccer hero from the New England Revolution, and the USMNT, the only people bigger than him were Landon Donvan, David Beckham, All 3 iterations of Ronaldo (Fat, Portuguese, and small), Leo Messi, Bale, and Pirlo. so spurs bought one of the 10 best players in the world to me... yes i know i was ignorant then. But basically you had a bonafide american on your team, and this 22 year old kid, who just ran and ran and ran.

Lukaku is solid but not proven yet. We don't know if he can do it against tight defenses. I don't think he can tbh. Not as starting striker at least. Very good to not set all our hopes on him.

true,ChuChuNesby,null,null,"As already mentioned, if you want to practise law in Scotland then you will need to be qualified in Scots law. The GDL will teach you the law of England and Wales; there is no such thing as ""UK law"".

To answer your other questions, I did the GDL a few years ago at BPP and I'm now an associate at a Magic Circle firm (where about half of the associates also did the GDL rather than a law degree). I don't think that doing the GDL puts you at a disadvantage compared to those that did a law degree and I would say that the LPC is the most useful thing when it comes to practising.

I found the teaching at BPP to be good. They record all of the lectures and you can watch the lectures from the other BPP branches if you prefer a particular lecturer. The course is very fast-paced and there is a lot of material to work through. However, it's not designed to be an ""academic"" course so BPP will spoon-feed the essential bits of the material to you and there are frequent recap and tutorial sessions to help it all sink in. Also the exams are very predictable so it's possible (and, depending on how good your memory is, necessary) to selectively revise for them. 

I should point out that unless you actually want to practise law, I would not do the GDL. I doubt very much that employers in other sectors would care much about whether you have done it and it's an expensive course. If possible I would try and find an employer that will pay for it. A lot of the top law firms will pay for the GDL and the LPC and provide a maintenance grant.

Also, if you actually want to advise firms (I don't know what a ""law consultant"" is or would involve but I presume it involves advising on the law) you will need to be a qualified lawyer which involves more than doing the GDL.",0,1404983310,null,0,1404987773,0,citd9pm,t3_2a9qtl,t1_citd9pm,t3_2a9qtl,null,1434640477,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

He had been in town with his babysitter.[1] The second victim, 12-year-old Tim Parry, received the full force of the blast and was gravely wounded. He died on 25 March 1993 when doctors switched his life support machine off, having asked permission to do so from his family, after tests had found minimal brain activity.[5] Fifty-four other people were injured, four of them seriously.[4]

&gt;The __Twelfth Doctor__ is an incarnation of [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), the protagonist of the long-running [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) [television science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. He is portrayed by Scottish actor [Peter Capaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi).  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a [time travelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel), [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid) [alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life) from a race known as the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lords). When the Doctor is critically injured, he can [regenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who\)) his body, and in doing so gain a new physical appearance, and with it a distinct new personality; this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme's inception in 1963.

For all that the lack of finishing got painful. Remember that season when we had Crouch and Kuyt up front and Crouchie specialised in soft headers aimed right at the keeper and Kuyt reliably blazed over from 8 yards. I think we made more chances that season than we did in last season but some matches we couldn't buy a goal.

What Kuyt does have though - which is priceless - is the ability to raise his game when the team needs him. He'd miss sitters for 10 matches then get a great goal from a tight angle just when we desperately needed one.
