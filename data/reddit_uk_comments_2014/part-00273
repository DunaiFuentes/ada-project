Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is paid for up to 39 weeks. You get:

90% of your average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first 6 weeks
£138.18 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks

SMP is paid in the same way as your wages (eg monthly or weekly). Tax and National Insurance will be deducted.

Well, it's illegal to call for the deaths of homosexuals.

&gt;The fact a gay celebrity would come out and criticize the EDL rather than the mosque is what makes him a useful idiot. 

I don't think your argument is sound. Yes, perhaps he should criticize religious types for decrying homosexuality, and once he has gone through the list, a few years later, he could then decry everyone else that is against homosexuality.

Him specifically coming out against the EDL should not mean he is required to speak out against every other homophobe at the same time.

The other important point this article makes is something that the Yes campaign has been far too silent on. I do not doubt an independent Scotland could go its own way and be successful. But, in the short to medium term, things will be worse off - financial markets and businesses will not respond well to the uncertainty, money will flow out of the country, stocks will fall, and until the currency issue is fully resolved things will be very difficult. If the country is committed to independence, then a few years of hurt may be an acceptable price to pay, but the Yes campaign has stubbornly refused to admit the fact that a yes vote will cause hardship in the short term at least, and has refused to release plans for how to deal with a new period of austerity.

&gt;This has NOTHING TO DO with Alex Salmond or the SNP, this has to do with Scotland and its freedom. So its misleading all the way through.

Well that's not strictly true. A lot of people feel that Salmond is deliberately misleading the people of Scotland, playing on their pride for the nation to obfuscate major holes in his policy. A lot of respected economists have already gone on record to say that a split from the Union could be a major problem for Scotland, Salmond has done little to really address these concerns. 

&gt;It mentions the NHS, the NHS is already being sold off in England. And that's not an opinion, its a fact.

That's legitimately a very frightening prospect, but then a leak today has shown that the SNP are looking to make significant cuts to NHS spending should they come into power. Are wholesale spending cuts better?

It seems like Scots voting ""yes"" just want to get rid of the Tories and are willing to jump from the frying pan and into the fire because of their hatred. There is no guarantee that the Scottish MP's in Holyrood will be any better than those in Westminster, in fact they could be far worse (something few Scots seems to consider). 

&gt;It even has ""A No Vote is a Vote for change"", that is a single most dumbest thing I have ever read.

Well seeing as the heads of the 3 major parties in the UK have just signed a pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland should they vote ""No"", then clearly there will be change following the referendum. I don't see how that is dumb at all. 

&gt;Just say it out loud, ""Vote No to independence"". Just saying it out loud should be enough for any rational human to know what way they should be voting.

It would be the case if Scotland wasn't part of a mutually beneficial relationship with the United Kingdom that stretches back almost 300 years. It's not like Scotland are pushing for independence from an evil empire that invaded against their will.

And all the events, all the concerts, the reviews. All London. There was a complete lack of awareness or concern in media that people lived beyond the South East. Finally people noticed there was a faraway place called ""Manchester"" when Oasis and that whole movement happened, but they've happily managed to forget about it now.

When I went to university, I was astounded how insular and ""small town"" the London students were.  All they wanted was to go back to London every weekend, whereas those of us from provincial towns and other cities were much happier just exploring and living in a new location. Also, all the ones that were really really into politics-as-a-career (not student politics, who tended to be more northern) were from London.  They would all have gone straight into politics with no interest or care or experience in the rest of the UK.

Then remember all the millennium spending?  Remember all the big things they did in the rest of the country?  No?  Because they did nothing. Fuck the north, fuck the west, fuck the midlands.

&gt;Well that's not strictly true. A lot of people feel that Salmond is deliberately misleading the people of Scotland, playing on their pride for the nation to obfuscate major holes in his policy. A lot of respected economists have already gone on record to say that a split from the Union could be a major problem for Scotland, Salmond has done little to really address these concerns.


You can say that the other way around as well. Many major people have said scotland will do better alone and will prosper.

&gt;NHS Budget

Hmm, This is a tricky one I don't know what will happen it could come to the case were in an independent Scotland the NHS might not need that much funding. We don't really know until someone from the SNP speaks up about that document. and they will need to do it fast so I agree with you on that.

&gt; 3 Major party heads

Heh, The pledge means nothing, Promises have been broken before they can be broken again. A report from the house of lords has stated they want a referendum from all countries within the UK to vote on whether Scotland gets more powers or not. Will they get what they want? Meh time will tell, but independence is the only way to fully get all the powers.

&gt;Scotlands relationship

Imo all countries should be independent and supported by the population. We won't turn into some 3rd world country over night. We have the 14th richest economy and the chance to do something with that money ourselves. It can go very well with us if scotland puts the right leaders in place.


There's alot of benefits to both sides. But this letter is seriously stupid. If you don't know what to do vote for us because nothing will change yay! That is just seriously 0 cards left to play in all of this and you are now begging for people to vote no.

- Shows a lot of promise coming through the ranks at Sunderland

- Makes a big move to Liverpool, moving away from his hometown and boyhood club Sunderland. Himself and his family cop criticism from Sunderland fans because of this ""betrayal"".

- With Kenny's faith, Hendo shows a few glimpses of potential in his debut season, but he never finds form. Now the media are on his back. Maybe Hendo isn't good enough.

- New management and things get worse. Joe Allen is brought in and Hendo seems to be phased out. Hendo considers his footballing future - he is advised to move away from Liverpool to get playing time and better develop; he's still young, he has plenty of time. Brendan Rodgers publicly states that Henderson is surplus to requirements.

- Against all advice, and seemingly logic, Henderson refuses to leave Liverpool and states that he will fight for his place. Even Liverpool fans can't help but chuckle at this lad. Henderson is clustered with Andy Carroll, Joe Cole, and Charlie Adam as the expensive waste of Dalglish's term.

- With lack of depth in the squad, injuries see Hendo make his first appearance of the season against Swansea in December. 0-0. With every game, Hendo attracts less and less criticism.

- Hendo scores in the 5-0 against Norwich, and assists Liverpool's first against Arsenal, and scores their second. Suddenly, Hendo is involved with Liverpool's goals, and there's nothing anyone can do except praise him.

- In 2013/14, Hendo is at the heart of the Liverpool team, playing 35 games in BR's most successful campaign to date. Liverpool look on track to snatch the league, but then a reckless slide tackle in the dying seconds of a 3-2 win over Man City sees Hendo gain his first career red.

- Hendo is sent off and banned from two of the last 3 league games.

- Hendo watches the slip from the sidelines. 

- Brendan Rodgers states that he knew the title was gone as soon as Hendo was given Red.

- 2014/15 Liverpool make a rocky start to the season but stabilise under Henderson's influence as vice-captain; it's like there's two Gerrards on the field.

- Liverpool go on to win many league titles and trophies during the span of Hendo's career as VC/captain and he is heralded maybe the best LFC captain of all time, because he just never stopped running.

His movie will be called ""Never Stop Running"" or ""The Captain with Bad Gait""",0,1410859484,null,0,false,0,ckjq33m,t3_2ghy4e,t1_ckjq33m,t1_ckj9oqn,null,1426987978,33,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,33

&gt;__John ""Big John"" McMichael__ (9 January 1948 – 22 December 1987) was a leading [Northern Irish loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) who rose to become the most prominent and charismatic figure within the [Ulster Defence Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Association) (UDA) as the Deputy Commander and leader of its South Belfast Brigade. He was also commander of the organisation's cover name, the ""[Ulster Freedom Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Freedom_Fighters)"" (UFF). The UDA used this name when it wished to claim responsibility for attacks, thus allowing it to remain a legal paramilitary organisation until August 1992 when it was proscribed by the British Government.

So many people are relying on high property prices as a retirement fund that the government has geared policy to protect them (and the lenders who gave them the money - i.e. the banking sector). This has been to the detriment of the young. It is also in danger of going very very wrong if/when the bubble goes pop.

I understand why you would put your savings into property - it's one of the few places you can earn a decent interest (most rentals yield a decent 5%+ interest, especially when you factor in average house price rises in the last year or so). You're also right that you'd be stupid to abstain from it out of ideology - why hurt yourself if everyone else is doing it anyway. My worry is that the attitude you take is shared by the vast majority and it's taking the whole country on a fast track to big financial problems.

Personally, if I'd had that £15k 5 or so years ago and a south facing roof, I'd have put a 4kW array of PV panels on it - the return before the rates were pulled back were about 14% over 25 years!

I think it's more a case of discarding an ancient political model, one that worked fine while there was still an empire, one that for a time looked to be progressive and more advanced than any other in the world, but failed to live up to its own promises. And in the last 40 years while the rest of the world has modernised we are left alone on an island pandering to an elite that exploits us, pays us bugger all and expects us to vote for them to keep them in a job.

We still share an island, a language and several interests. History is something we will always share, but it needn't be the future. Maintaining a political union is not something that should be done for the sake of tradition; hell, human sacrifice was considered a tradition on the British Isles a couple of thousand years ago! While there may be an argument for reinstating human sacrifice in extreme cases (I'm looking at you, Tony Blair) I don't think that history always provides the best model for the future.

I don't see Scottish independence as the end of the UK, I view it as a means to modernisation for the whole of the British Isles. And from the ashes of the union, I hope for a new beast altogether.

You cant look at an existing system as it is today, and then use the performance figures to predict following a massive political change, because change changes things. What makes economic success under the security of the union might not u under independence, so assuming all the spending income and revenues generated and spending will be unchanged is complete horseshit.

The case for scottish independence made in this presentation is only valid due to scotland not being independent, once the cost of business increases for cross border trade and commerce and scotland loses its price smoothing of goods ( i.e different prices in scotland than in the uk) all this completely changes.

Its like moving out from your parents house claiming you put more money in rent and bills than you take out in food and services because your job is so good, and decide to move out.

But on moving out find that all the local properties for rent are not in commuting distance for your job, so you have to get a different job that pays less, and means you are actually worse off than before.

Independence changes everything, you cant use pre independence data  in support of independence performance unless its extreme, or orders of magnitude different.

&gt;Why? It was bone dry and traffic was light. There were no pedestrians up there and no schools or old people’s homes.

Revenue, that's why. A van like that can rack up thousands in fines on a nice stretch of road.

Our approach on road safety is to treat drivers like idiots and crack the whip and enforce penalties and fines for those that breach them, this is further skewed by the fact the local police force can keep the revenue generated from the fines so they are financially incentivised to catch more and more people.

If they really cared about motorway safety for example they would make motorway driving a compulsory part of the driving test and make sure people are comfortable with changing lanes and driving in conditions which they will have to face once they get their license.

Also we should enforce no-overtaking rules during peak times for large vehicles like they do in Germany. The number of near misses I've witnessed because a large HGV pulls out is incredible. Almost every time I drive on the M25 I see some arsehole in a goods vehicle out to create an accident.

 Sherman's system is based on the English language,  where each letter has an equivalent symbol. Other systems align the symbols with English phonemes. So the ""e"" symbol for the words ""we"" and ""wed"" would be different because it makes a different sound in the pronunciation of the word. There's at least one version that is a symbolic language referring to words, not graphemes or phonemes.

You can if you do it at the time of handing the title deeds of the house over to alex, and in fact, that's what you would do, and what everyone does when getting rid of a property, and it would only be fair that he takes on the debt.

He's not discussing a built up urban area here... visibility is usually pretty good on A-roads in daylight / dry conditions. 

&gt; Which is great until everyone tries to go at 80mph in three lanes and there's a crash.

Now this was on the M1 - there's no reason traffic *couldn't* hit 80mph assuming everyone is competent. Also most road users react to issues around them and I doubt 70 to 80mph is going to make a huge difference to that. Also: Autobahns in Germany manage this *and more*.

Not really. If you're going to be penalised for small infractions in an artificially slowed area that is built for travelling faster on - you really do find yourself worrying that you're going to slip up and edge over the mythical barrier. Nobody wants a fine. 

Your tips are fine for people who have infinite flexibility in their travel plans. A lot of people don't have that flexibility.

Seriously - we don't need a nation reduced to a crawl by bad open road ways - we're not talking of urban areas here, but the trunk roads used to travel reasonable distances.

2) The idea that the UK would give some of the control of its currency to a foreign country is just not even on the cards. That has never happened, and it never will.

3) Any situation in which Scotland uses the GBP would involve Scotland using a currency which it does not have control over. While this still means Scotland is an independent country it also means Scotland does not have full fiscal autonomy. In fact, at the large scale Scotland would be less in control of its economy than it is now.

Personally I think this is crucial as Scotland's key trump card is its exports. Its good to be an exporter in Europe right now and Scotland has lot so high value, desirable exports. With the trade agreements being made with Canada (CETA) and the USA (TTIP), there are serious markets opening up, but Scotland will need a weaker currency than the GBP to fully exploit them.

They can try and peg, but there's the problem.

The official rate might be 1:1, but the market will set the real rate.  If the real rate is worse, the Scottish government (at best) ends up subsidizing currency traders,  at worst, and probably more realistically given Scotland's lack of reserves, there's a huge incentive to get your money out of the country (this applies to Scots, companies operating in Scotland, and foreign capital).

So how can they make the market rate 1:1?  Answer: Build up a currency reserve, act fiscally prudently, and build investor confidence.

Investor confidence is starting from a very low start point, simply because there is a lot of uncertainty about an independent Scotland, it's relationship to the rest of the UK, and EU, and it has no credit history.  It doesn't help that the Yes campaign has been promising the Scots lots of extra public spending, and certain parts of the Yes campaign have promised a ""day of reckoning"" with businesses who opposed them, nationalizations, potentially repudiating debts, etc.  

So if Scotland wants the market rate to be 1:1 it will have to be MORE, not LESS fiscally responsible than the rest of UK.  Who really thinks that is likely in the short-term?

The role of a club captain is:
(a) To be a link between the manager and the players.
(b) Link between the players and the club
(c) Link between players
(d) Link between the players and the outside world (media, fans, etc)
(e) Ambassador for manager, players and club.

I hear a lot of complaints but which players have been at the club long enough to do this role - don't think players, think senior enough to represent players to manager, each other and to Levy?

I had this discussion with my brother and the shortlist we came up with was:
Lennon (age 27, at club 9 yrs)
Townsend (age 24, at club 16 yrs)
Rose (age 24, at club 7 yrs)
Kane (age 21, at club 12yrs)
Kaboul (age 28, at club 5 yrs)

Clearly Kane, Rose and Townsend are not senior members of the squad and could not speak with any gravitas for or to the players. Which leave Kaboul and Lennon, if you had to argue which of the pair was the most natural leader I cannot see how you could arrive at Lennon so Kaboul gets it by default.

In respect of everyone else, they haven't been at the club long enough to have the respect of the senior figures at the club (Levy and board).

I used to walk the moors in the dry daylight - people still do. (Just make sure you keep off the moor and on the path at the full moon).

But he makes a flippant comment about sheep. Hit a sheep doing 80mph and you've a good chance of losing control and killing yourself.

&gt; Now this was on the M1...

I understand your point and I also support increasing the motorway limit to 80mph. But if cones are down some people get nervous, there's less room etc. The main problem is as someone else mentions here and that is the frustration caused by cones being there but no work being done.

&gt;Not really.

Really - if you can't stick to 20mph without constantly watching the speedo and not looking outside you need to be off the roads.

&gt;Your tips are fine for people who have infinite flexibility in their travel plans. A lot of people don't have that flexibility.

Which road user can't plan ahead and either set off in time, or tell the place they're travelling to what time they'll be there based on the road conditions ?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; (and indeed before it too in barter economies). 

There is _no_ anthropological evidence that I'm aware of (and I've regularly heard it said by anthropologists) of any barter economy which existed before the advent of money.  There _are_ examples of societies which have 'reverted' to barter having had a money society, but none which precede it.  What generally happened in earlier societies was that people 'borrowed' from each other and then returned 'gifts' of similar values at some later date, a social credit system if you like. This helped societies to gel, because people were always in debt to each other by small amounts, and then they'd periodically meet up and settle debts, either as individuals, groups or as a whole tribe (or whatever) - kind of harvest festival type of thing.  When things really got out of whack they'd have debt forgiveness by the ruler/king/tribal elders or whatever, like the Christian debt jubilees.

I also think wealth is much more important than you imply.  Firstly because it enables people to become rentiers rather than socially useful value adding entrepreneurs or workers (which does enable people to become more politically active/involved and attain political control for example).  Secondly because it provides essential reserves which give you time and distance from the capitalist fray - you don't have to sell when times are harder (and prices are lower), you can buy when the time is ripe and blood is on the streets too, you don't have to sell your labour cheap because you need to make rent or feed your family, etc.  Income is like a shower, it can be turned off at any time and you get dry real quick.

There is an utter fixation on SILLY DANGEROUS SPEEDING in this country, whereas the majority of people who get caught speeding are doing a maximum of 20-30% higher than the limit.

You can't measure safe driving in miles per hour. You can't measure safe *speed* in miles per hour.

Contrary to popular belief, most drivers are pretty damn good at setting a responsible, safe speed and then reducing that as necessary when the risk of an obstruction increases. If you had no speedo in your car, do you think you could get in and drive safely? If your answer is no, then you shouldn't be on the road, but if your answer is yes, what does that tell you about that little dial on your dashboard flicking up and down?

Any speed above 30mph is potentially quite deadly. If we are to trust drivers to mitigate their deadly speed to avoid accidents, the actual number of the speedometer is of little relevance. If I'm doing 70mph on the motorway and hit someone, they'll die. If I'm doing 80mph on the motorway and hit someone, they'll die. It's not about fucking around with and reducing arbitrary limits that were set at a time when most domestic cars could barely get to or even above the limit, and had drum brakes and minimal safety features. It's about Reducing awareness and bettering driving education. If I want to do 80mph on a clear, dry motorway, why **shouldn't** I? 

If we put more emphasis on awareness of a safe speed and better awareness of obstructions, we'd be doing a much better job at road safety than just setting a number everyone has to follow.

Well he is a comedian in part - you'd be hard pressed to take that comment seriously, it being Clarkson who made it. 

&gt; I understand your point and I also support increasing the motorway limit to 80mph. But if cones are down some people get nervous, there's less room etc. The main problem is as someone else mentions here and that is the frustration caused by cones being there but no work being done.

Glad you see that - and I do also appreciate that with some cones it means less manoeuvring room and at high speed that could be dangerous. It's a tricky one - we don't complete road works nearly fast enough in this country and often cone off areas that simply don't need it. 

&gt; Really - if you can't stick to 20mph without constantly watching the speedo and not looking outside you need to be off the roads.

Again I think this was a little hyperbole but having fines and unforgiving speed cameras constantly in place does make you super-sensitive to making sure you don't go over the limit. Then there's almost always cars that don't care and go faster anyway (the cameras might not be on, right?) so the natural instinct is to speed up to average with the traffic.  

(I don't think I'm alone in that - I really dislike being constantly watched by speed cameras).

A period of extended tube strikes once led to a series of bus journeys home one week, all I remember of those was that they were drawn out and we weren't home until dinner time.

(Note: I'm talking about generalised stereotypes held by people here, not my own views on people from other regions)

The stereotype is that the UK generally gets shitter the further north you go until you hit the Scottish border, at which point the shit counter resets..

EDIT: Probably a more accurate version of the above is that the UK gets more shit the further away from Holyrood or Westminster you get (probably because the two parliaments tend to put the interests of the immediate region over the needs of the outer regions).  Scotland generally stays quite nice since it is a small country though there is some roughness in Glasgow and the far reaches. North England is the furthest away from both capitals so ends up being the most destitute. Although Wales has its own regional assembly, it has nowhere near the same influence as the Scottish or UK parliaments so it has the roughness levels of the midlands in terms of distance to London. Northern Ireland ends up being a warzone since it is the furthest away from everything.

Obviously, this is all very tongue in cheek, but there is some truth to the claim that the capitals have a very distinct sphere of influence in terms of investment...",0,1410865188,null,0,1410866283,0,ckjr3zn,t3_2gg1g2,t1_ckjr3zn,t1_ckiyond,null,1426987500,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also as a careers adviser this kind of thing makes me cringe: ""I have no practical skills... Cutting down trees and making paths..."" You do have practical skills, don't sell yourself short. I hear such comments all the time from my customers and I think ""why are you talking people out of hiring you?""

Going to the websites of major chains works pretty well. For example Weatherspoons, Sainsburys etc mainly advertise on their own sites eg http://www.wetherspoonjobs.co.uk/home/career/find

Smaller places may hire if you just rock up, be charming and ask. In fact quite often bars, coffee shops etc display a staff wanted poster in the window. This won't work at national chains which have centralised recruiting.  

Don't forget that Christmas hiring is about to start. If you get in at this time of year and do well employers are likely to keep you on.

Get the National Careers Service to check your cv and read the site for useful tips. (Disclaimer: I work for them but I'm also a big fan and it's free to you). https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx

A good cv makes a lot of difference. Also list all the skills you have used in your life for work/projects etc and think about how they transfer. For instance if you've organised an exhibition that has great transferability to retail work with your eye for display and ability to interest customers and engage with them.

Many, many times I've been on motorways without the changing speed limits, but with signed garrisons warning of people in the road, obstructions, etc, and from my experiences people are pretty good at reducing speed (albeit not by much) and leaving greater distances.

Even excluding McGann, we had five different Doctors, three of which each had their own subplot (ie, Last Day of the Time War, Elizabeth I, and the Zygons) to resolve in the runtime, and consequently, even that felt a little bit cluttered. 

Strictly speaking, they already recast Hartnell a few times. The First Doctor was played by Richard Hurndall in The Five Doctors, and they had a voice actor copy his voice for the fiftieth, since Hartnell never said the word 'Gallifrey'. I also think using David Bradley playing Hartnell in An Adventure in Time and Space is an exception. He was playing Hartnell, rather than the Doctor, since the focus of that particular program was the story of the show being commissioned and its early years, and the effect it had on Hartnell's life. The actual in-show stuff didn't play much of a part.

Good question.

The difference between religion and e.g. Doctor Who, is that religion claims it's the truth.  I have nothing against nonsense in general.  It's only when absurdity is presented as fact that it becomes a concern.

&gt;But everyone has a right to live their lives in peace if they don't want to ""engage in robust discussion"" about their beliefs.

I'm not knocking on people's doors asking them whether they've heard the bad news!  I absolutely agree that people have a right to believe what they want.  However I also have a right to criticize any idea I want.  

Really, it's no different from political discussions.  Anybody has the right to criticize any political idea whatsoever and the same goes for religion.  That doesn't mean you should be collaring people on the street and start lecturing at them.  But you should be able to express any opinion you want about religion.

&gt;If the actions of a handful of Muslims provoke non-Muslims here to attack, abuse and bully Muslims here then it's not British Muslims who are the problem. It's those attacking them on a pretext.

As everything here I just listened and decided I'd form my own opinion but I soon agreed with everything I read about Johnson here when I saw him go off the pitch during the Man City game when we were all out of substitutions. I mean.... C'mon! I broke my foot once while playing football in high school and I stayed and played 4 games until it was too much. I didn't know my foot was broken though, if I did I would've left because whatever its just high school, but still !!! 

It just felt like wheres the love? Did you fall out of love with liverpool? Did you fall out of love for football?

You have people who are passionate about their jobs and you have people who stare at the clock as soon as they enter the office and unfortunately Johnson's attitude of late has been the latter. 

I would love nothing more for Johnson to be back to the level he was at during his prime because he'd easily be our best right back. But atm I would much rather manquillo and I have absolutely no problem with Flannagan as well as he gives it his all every match, throws his body on the line, and gets so pissed when a foul is called against him even though it most of the time is rightly called.

The yes campaign has said -

&gt;Professor Allyson Pollock warned that reforms in the NHS south of the Border could lead to 'serious' consequences for Scotland by resulting in reduced funding.

&gt;She said a Yes vote on September 18 would free Scotland from the 'stranglehold' of the Westminster Treasury by enabling politicians to fully control public finances and NHS policy.

Yet the leaked document shows that the SNP is planning a half billion in cuts for the year 2020 when they would be an independent nation, according to their beliefs, when iScotland would be ""one of the richest countries in the world"" according to Salmond.

&gt;The document warned that ""baseline funding increases"" and ""financial cost pressures"" had created ""significant challenges"" for Scottish health boards.

This while Scotland has had a devolved Parliament since 1999 , the Barnett formula automatically giving giving a proportionate share of the funding, NHSS control being fully devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the SNP holding a MAJORITY in the Parliament since 2011.

Your average yes voter know things aren't going to be plain sailing after a Yes vote, there may well be many struggles and temporary hardships. But once you realise how terrified the establishment is of independence it become easier to dismiss what can seem as impartial advice as scaremongering. 

If Scotland gets independence the UK may well lose its seat on the UN security council due to the debate sparked about nuclear weapons. They may be calls for devolution across England - ending century old notions of Westminster sovereignty. There will no doubt be calls for further devolution to Wales and Northern Ireland. The dominance of London, and the city of London, will be seriously questioned. There may be calls for the scrapping of FPTP. A third of the land mass, resources and exports will be lost.  

A Yes  vote will be the end of the establishment as we know it. They know that and they are pulling out all they can to terrify the people of Scotland to vote No.

""The financial challenges facing the Scottish public sector are well documented. In October 2010, the UK government outlined spending reductions in almost every area of the public sector over the next four years. As Scotland receives most of its funding from the UK government, the reductions will have a significant impact on the amount of money available to the public sector in Scotland. The Scottish Government estimated in October 2010 that its budget for day- to-day spending and running costs will fall by £3.3 billion in real terms (11 per cent) from £29.2 billion in 2010/11 to £25.9 billion in 2014/15. The overall decrease is most pronounced in 2011/12 as the budget falls by £1.7 billion in real terms (six per cent) to £27.5 billion.""",0,1410869225,null,0,1410870381,0,ckjs105,t3_2gjjri,t1_ckjs105,t1_ckjrvcv,null,1426987073,-9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-9

From http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx:

&gt; You can get free NHS prescriptions if, at the time the prescription is dispensed, you:

&gt; * are 60 or over
* are under 16
* are 16-18 and in full-time education
* are pregnant or have had a baby in the previous 12 months and have a valid maternity exemption certificate (MatEx)  
* have a specified medical condition and have a valid medical exemption certificate (MedEx)
* have a continuing physical disability that prevents you from going out without help from another person and have a valid MedEx
* hold a valid war pension exemption certificate and the prescription is for your accepted disability
* are an NHS inpatient

Some key points:

Free for 60+ - which are the age group most likely to require medication, so that covers a big chunk

NHS inpatients - if you're in A&amp;E, hospital etc... and get given meds, that counts as a prescription. This also covers a big chunk.

I think it's a paradox to say those who wanted equal rights for their own would blow up others. 

Unless they are really radicalised by some personal event. Which was probably when someone who was part of a small team in the RUC/ARMY did something to hurt them; and then propaganda helped make the whole force a bogeyman. 

Surely they'd have just joined the civil rights movement if they were looking equality and not their own dominance; ""ourselves alone"" after all?

That's essentially my point; you're making the whole of the RUC a bogeyman, when a small number of units acted in such a fashion; while the IRA as a whole was a terrorist organisation.

Like I can see why Bobby Sands joined. Because he was bullied by scummy loyalists. Propaganda made him take up arms against the state though. The state and scummy loyalists living in north Belfast are not one and the same. But I can see how it's easy to associate the two. Look at the loyalist ""taigs are getting everything their way; lets attack the cops"" mentality of today; prime example.

Firstly, Lo - not low. They're separate words.

Second, a dispassionate reading of the frank mountain of verbiage offered on the impending economic catastrophe should Scotland vote Yes leads one to the honest conclusion that there will be turbulent and difficult times in the short term while things are settled and market confidence is established - but the structural elements of that economy itself (even completely discounting Oil) are sufficient to keep us fat and happy once the dust settles.

Attempting to overplay the 'setting up a new country is difficult and there will be tough times initially' card into 'THE SKY WILL FALL' has been one of the most significant mistakes of the No campaign.

Third, while economic reality is indeed an important consideration it is by no means the *only* consideration, which is something No overlooked completely until the last week and why we now have the leaders and media scrambling like madmen to present some non-dystopian vision of a future Scotland after a No vote.

But:  If Scotland does leave the UK, our relationship changes.


If Scotland does go its own way, the rest of the UK and the Westminster Parliament, no longer would have any duty or responsibility for looking after Scotland's economic or other interests.   

So don't expect the rest of the UK to go out of our way to help Scotland.  We wouldn't do things to help Scotland, if they cost us money.  So don't expect us to lend you money on easy terms, or to continue to support Scottish-based banks, for example.

Scotland's NHS may be safe in Scotland's hands, but don't expect the Scottish NHS to make use of specialist heart or cancer centres which are only available in England, without paying commercial rates. 

Don't expect to get BBC content (apart from BBC Scotland that is) without paying commercial rates for it.  Oh yes, and iplayer will be blocked in Scotland too (just like it is in the USA), as you guys should be paying BBC World to watch BBC programs.


And Scotland and the rest of the UK would become competitors.  

So, for example, if we can attract companies and businesses and investors to relocate from Scotland to the rest of the UK,  we would do it - just as we currently try to attract companies and investors from other parts of the world to relocate to the UK.

Actually we can do that with people too. If you think there is a brain drain of Scotland's best and brightest to  London and the Southeast now (because of financial incentives and other reasons), wait until we start trying to actively encourage it.

You don't like the banks threatening to relocate from Edinburgh?  At the moment, they're threatening to, maybe with a degree of political posturing, and maybe with some real concerns.  But wait until we actively try to encourage them to relocate from Edinburgh to the city of London.  We'll give them tax breaks, cheap office space in the world's biggest financial centre, and they'll be close to the world's biggest transport hub in Heathrow.   They'll have a home market of 60 million, instead of 5 million. And they will be financially be backed by one of the world's largest central banks, the Bank of England, rather than whatever much smaller reserves a new Scottish central bank might be able to cobble together.

Or if we can attract tourists to come to London or Cornwall or North Wales or the Lake District, instead of Scotland, we'll do that too.

And if we can buy oil &amp; natural gas cheaper from UAE or Oman than Scotland, we'll do that.


If these things costs jobs &amp; prosperity in the Scotland, well that will be sad, but we'll do it anyway, because we no longer have any responsibility to support jobs &amp; prosperity in Scotland.  Our sole responsibility is to maximize jobs &amp; prosperity in the rest of the UK.



And finally: You won't have ""a new relationship with England, Wales and Northern Ireland""

You will have a new relationship with the UK as a whole, now a foreign country.  A country that you are no longer part of.   We won't treat you badly or go out of our way to hurt you, but don't expect us to treat you any better than Malta, or Cyprus, or Ghana, or any other foreign country that we were once (but no longer) associated with.

Chances are those two dangerous drivers, and I fully denounce their behaviour, made up less than 0.1% of drivers that you encounter. 

Additionally, we aren't talking about single country lanes here with various obstacles and obstructions, along with tractors and cyclists - I wouldn't want the speed limit increased there because there is a demonstrable increase in risk with an increase in speed limit. We are talking about dual carriageways/motorways which, from my experience, the research that I've done and from what I read about every day, could benefit from an increase in speed limit.

&gt; Now, maybe you're responsible and safe, I don't know. 

To give you a bit more knowledge:
 - I was trained in driving by a fully trained Police Officer with 20+ years service, and have driven on skid-pans and all sorts of other terrains in a variety of vehicles.
 - No accidents in 7+ years of driving, and I spend a lot of time on motorways, am in London a few times a week, and other roads up and down the country.
 - I've driven a multitude of cars, but currently have a 230bhp+ RWD sports car.

I would not like to be doing 80mph with an impatient driver behind/in-front of me, but because we are speaking about motorways and dual carriageways here, that is incredibly unlikely to happen.

If you're head of a hospital in a small town and one with more money in London poaches you, the next best person fills the job and they're not always qualified. As a result some hospitals are run very well and others run poorly. 

If your heart is in trouble travel to the Royal Battle in Reading where you'll get the best care in the world, if you want to have a higher chance of dying head to the Isle Of Wight.

The rate of patient death in the UK is 20% lower than it was 10 years ago. This is despite the fact that almost everyone now goes to hospital to die - even if there's absolutely nothing you can do to help someone. The population is getting older and the NHS has been sued for £15bn - a large portion is from 'no win - no fee' lawyers who know how to skim the system.

If you don't like the system go private, but if you think they're any better you'd better find out what for as in some cases they're shameful:

I hasten to add that it's not just the BBC but mainstream media in general.

The thing with media bias is you'd expect both sides to be concerned about it. Although it's favourable to the No side right now they could easily find themselves on the other end regarding coverage of other issues.

Just recently you've got the whole RBS/Lloyds/Nick Robinson incident. First the BBC reporting stuff that had already been reported, ignoring facts about the story and then you have Nick Robinson asking a question, getting an answer but trying to misrepresent what happened even though there was a video.

Another recent one is the BBC taking pictures of Yes marches, rallies and anit-bias protests that only show there to be about 10 people there. When photos contradict this with their own photos they try to say the crowd was there for something else (shopping) despite the fact Saltires and Yes stuff is everywhere.

Look at history. The majority of wars fought, or when people's rights are taken away, are based on religious belief. Almost every religion, when tip-toed around, can find cause for 'offence' in many seemingly harmless situations.

As with all religions, you have a large proportion of good-natured, nice people who don't force their beliefs down anyone else's throats, then you also have the ones that turn their beliefs into a crusade to crush those who believe in a different diety.

I am not saying, nor have I ever said, that ""Islam is bad but ALL religion is bad."" Religion, when practised in the way that I imagine was 'intended,' can instil good core values into people and help them deal with our crippling insignificance and mortality in this Universe, but most religions are or have at some time been used to take people's rights away and used almost as an excuse to treat other people as 'lesser.'

true,Bill_Murray_Movies,null,null,"I'm far from a fan of Bill Kewright and I would much prefer our club was ran by a much more competent man. I think to write off my reasoning as 'totally irrational' is very sweeping. I'll give my counter arguments to your points below:

**He's an Evertonian through and through**

- I agree but I don't think this necessarily means you're the right fit for the club. Joey Barton is a huge Everton fan - I also don't want him anywhere near the club. Kenwright has also used his Evertonian status as a way of convincing illinformed fans that he is the right man for the job. His constant remarks about sitting in the Boys Pen is a running joke between Everton fans.

**He may not be the richest, but he gives every penny he can to help the club**

- As of today, True Blue Holdings (the conglomerate Bill headed to buy Everton Football Club) have invested £0 in to the club. We have operated strictly via the money earned by the club and the fragrant selling of club assets since he took over. Bill Kenwright's business friend, Robert Earl, who purchased 23% of shares in Everton Football Club, which was supervised by Bill Kenwright, has also invested £0 since purchasing a stake in the club.

**He allows managers total control over footballing decisions**

- I agree with this point. I just wish he would allow someone else total control over the financial decisions of the club too.

**He goes to pretty much every game**

- So do I. I do not deserve to run a Premier League football club based upon this. Nobody does. It's an absurd reason to defend the man's footballing business acumen.

**The stadium plans show the romanticism in him. He wants to keep us in the heart of the city at all costs**

- Seriously? How long have you supported the club for? Do you not remember our last catastrophic proposed stadium move?

**He is responsible for the community approach which has helped Everton become (arguably) the most likeable club in the league**

- This is an extremely subjective argument. Everton do outstanding work with the community but so do a lot of other clubs. But, again, this has absolutely zero to do with the man's footballing business acumen.

**He's balancing the books and helping us stand on our own two feet**

- How has he balanced the books? Debt is now three times greater than from when he originally took over (it stood at £45m before the new television money that we inherited this season). We don't own our own training ground and we have sold all of our assets other than the players we have. Can you please elaborate on your point?

**His christmas radio show is fucking boss**

- Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with how efficient a football chairman he is.

The vast majority of you points are empty. 'He's an Evertonian! He goes the game! He has a Christmas radio show!' They don't mean anything in regards to being a successful chairman. I really don't want to be mean as we are on fan forum and we are all Evertonians but I think the points you made to defend Bill Kenwright are awful.

Nial Quinn was a Sunderland fan who gave an obscene amount of money to charity. He became the club's chairman, invested money, helped rebuild the team and then stepped down so a more astute business savvy man could guide the club. Bill Kenwright should do the same thing.

Road usage should always be factored to allow the safest travel from A to B by any means whilst factoring in the surrounding environment. 

When it comes to motorways averaging speeds down to 50 or 40mph from 70mph despite low traffic and high visibility – that’s inappropriate and unnecessary.  

It’s easy to argue that safety is always key but take that to its logical conclusion and we’d be doing 20mph all across the land regardless of terrain or situation (which, I’m sure you’ll agree, is impractical!)

And, frankly, I think the government at Westminster has a very poor record in addressing longstanding Scots complaints against it. If it weren't for the fear engendered in 1979, what devolution there *has* been in Scotland would never have happened. I've read the McCrone Report, too. It's no wonder a large proportion of Scots don't believe a word any English politician tells them.

The ""No"" campaign seems to have been smugly assuming an independence vote couldn't *possibly* go against it and has pretty much ignored it -- until the past week or two, when the ""Yes"" side began edging above 50%. Then, suddenly, Cameron is promising a haggis in every pot. It's all awfully transparent.

And a old Scots friend in London tells me in yesterday's email that he and his local compatriots wouldn't be at all surprised if, in the event of a ""Yes"" win, Cameron sends in troops to occupy the Scots Parliament. There's no trust there at all, especially on the part of the Scots.

However, it took fifteen years for that to be granted - a power which in the USA, for example, is available to ""school districts"".

Tax rates, corporation and income, vary between states and provinces, sub-national entities issue bonds, control labour policy and so on. They are able to shape economic policy for local conditions.

It is strange that the countries we consider closest to us: Australia, Canada and the United States (""the anglosphere"") are all federations with strong powers for the members.

Scotland should get the government it votes for and not just when it happens to coincide with what a much larger neighbouring country wants. 

So I guess the marriage analogy would go something like this: In the marriage the couple discuss things and have a vote on various things like the household budget, what groceries to buy, what holiday to go on and so on, however due to the nature of their marriage one partner has nine votes and the other just one. Therefore whatever the more powerful partner says goes, if that happens to coincide with what the other partner wants, then there are few complaints, but if when their votes do not coincide, too bad, they do what the more powerful partner wants, even if its against the wishes of the other partner or even detrimental to their health.

On 26 December 2008, at an event at the Parc de la Villette in Paris, Dieudonné awarded the Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson an ""insolent outcast"" prize [prix de l'infréquentabilité et de l'insolence]. The award was presented by one of Dieudonné's assistants, Jacky, dressed in a concentration camp uniform with a yellow badge. This caused a scandal and earned him his sixth court conviction to date.  
  
On 29 January 2009, he celebrated the 80th birthday of Faurisson in his theater, in the midst of a representative gathering of Holocaust deniers, right-wing radicals, and radical Shiites. Dieudonné and Faurisson further appeared together in a video making fun of the Holocaust and its commemoration.  
  
Dieudonné started a trend among his supporters of getting photographed making a unique gesture he invented and dubbed the ""quenelle"". For some it is just a vulgar gesture of opposition to French institutions, for others it is an antisemitic gesture and was dubbed a ""reverse Nazi salute"" because while a Nazi salute involves an upraised straight arm, the quenelle involves a straight arm pointed at the ground.  
  
In December, while performing onstage, Dieudonné was recorded saying about prominent French Jewish radio journalist Patrick Cohen: ""Me, you see, when I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I think to myself: ‘Gas chambers... too bad.”    
  
In February, Dieudonné was banned from entry in the United Kingdom.  
  
In September, French authorities opened an investigation into Dieudonné on grounds that he condoned terrorism after mocking and showing footage of the killing of U.S. journalist James Foley by describing it as ""access to civilisation.""  
  
   
Yeah seems like a pretty misunderstood, stand up guy really. Regardless on your opinions of whether the Quenelle stand for racism or anti establishmentism is a grey area. Dieudonné has deliberately kept the gesture vague as to not be further accused / convicted of hate speech and racism.  
  
Benny (and Anelka for that matter) both know who the guy is and what he stands for. It doesn't matter whether you're doing it to assign yourself with only the anti-establishment said of it. This is the guy you are associating yourself with. A racist holocaust denier. Which is bad enough to be illegal in parts of Europe. Given our clubs links and heritage and the area we're in within London in particular is beyond stupid to get involved in.    
  
Even if Benny was good enough to play for us anymore (and he's not) he doesn't deserve to come back. The fact he's been offered for free and still no ones come for him speaks volumes frankly.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The Spanish will probably say there is no constitutional entity with which to negotiate with until Scotland becomes independent.

In that case they would be incorrect. The UK has stated that they will honour the result of the referendum, and until such time as Scotland leaves the UK is Scotland's representation within the EU.

&gt; A successful independent Scotland would act as a great motivator for other secessionist movements, which would be a real pain in the arse for the powers that be.

Conversely, several existing EU members were part of larger EU members in the past.

That they managed to make that transition smoothly, and that the EU is far better off with them than not, means they're unlikely to have any major problem with the idea of a country leaving one union to join another. Although the big three do dominate, 40% of the countries in the EU are Scotland's size or smaller - small countries are really not that rare.

Taking Spain in particular, their objection to secession is purely for unilateral secession. Their concerns about Catalonia are rooted in their constitution which explicitly defines Spain as having ""undissolvable unity"". This arose out of their civil war, which was only 75 years ago, and there's really no comparison between that and Scotland.

&gt; Whereas, if an independent Scotland was an abject failure along the line of Albania, which is what it will be, these other secessionist movements would have the wind taken out of their sails.

I think it's extremely unlikely that ""an independent Scotland would be an abject failure along the lines of Albania"".

That being said, idiots are idiots. I'll be honest with you, I exceed the speed limit on motorways and dual carriageways. If it's quiet and safe to do so, you'll find me with cruise control on at 75/80. Does that make me an idiot?

&gt; My point was wholly in response to your claim that drivers are mostly responsible, to provide examples of when drivers have not been responsible.

Fair enough, but you have provided two personal examples of bad driving, out of what are probably thousands of other perfectly safe driving that you (pardon the slight pun here) run into every time you go out onto the roads.

Lets look at some stats, rather than circling around personal experiences:

 - The DfT has [118,403 recorded car accidents in 2011](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9277/rrcgb2011-04.pdf).
 -  Of these accidents, lets say that 43,752 of those were caused by Impairment, Distraction, Behaviour, Inexperience, or by a stolen vehicle or a vehicle being used in a crime. All of which are or could be argued as being dangerous.
 - There are roughly [36 million drivers in the UK](http://www.rac.co.uk/pdfs/report-on-motoring/rac-rom-2014-v16-compressed).

So, if 43,752 drivers of 36,000,000 total had an actual accident as a result of dangerous/careless driving, that's 0.12%, which is a tiny fraction of it. You increase that number by ten-fold and you still only have 1.2% which is still a very tiny minority of people on our roads behaving dangerously.

I'm currently looking for viable statistics on speeding, careless, dangerous driving statistics but coming up short at the moment.

In response to the following:

&gt; Point being: lots of drivers are idiots. How are you going to mitigate that problem if speed limits are changed?

Well, lets say that I can suddenly reform our general driving policy on education and law:

Legally: 

 - Increase the speed limit on Dual Carriageways and Motorways to 80mph (potentially 90mph)
 - Increase fines for breaking this speed limit.
 
In terms of Education:

 - Minimum amount of 20 documented driving hours required to take driving test.
 - Mandatory Motorway induction *at some point* either during learning, or immediately after getting your license.
 - Harsher fines for tyres with illegal tread, driving without insurance and not having an MOT.

The past few days has seen a *very* highly co-ordinated response from the government and media, I've seen nothing but total bombardment negative news to a Yes vote on a level I've never seen until the YouGov poll gave a scare recently. 

There's no chance for a Yes vote at all now, anyone that was undecided has been bombarded by a massive campaign from not just the UK government but from pretty much all governments in the West + the entire Western media. Not to mention economic threats from major Western corporations.

Nobody cared before because nobody thought Scotland would ever vote yes. Then opinion polls gave people a scare and you saw the Western machine wake up from its slumber and quickly put things down with a ruthless efficiency.

It can only work in the West though, as you need a large amount of countries and corporations to be all working together and there's no room for dissent. 

In Russia or China they don't have the kinds of external support mechanisms to run a machine like this, so they have to result on brute force to get their way.

You can't even have one Western country entertain the idea that Scottish independence is even half decent. That's why only news of North Korea supporting independence is out there.

Yes. EU members are required to make a commitment to joining the Eurozone, but no country can be forced to join.

There are [five criteria for joining the Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria) and one of these criteria, ERM II membership, is [completely voluntary](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm):

&gt; Participation in ERM II is voluntary although, as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area, a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro.

This is why Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Sweden are in the EU but not in the Eurozone. Several plan to join eventually, several have [no plans to do so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_and_the_euro).",0,1410876694,null,0,false,0,ckjuo4d,t3_2gk15p,t1_ckjuo4d,t1_ckjujqy,null,1426985770,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I realise our chance conversion wasn't great, but had Rose passed, had Adebayor not been pulled back when shooting, had Kaboul not fluffed his lines, had Adebayor gone with his left foot when Chiriches slipped him in... etc etc. It's occasional poor decision-making but also decisions going against us. 

But, frankly, scoring two away from home will do the job more often than not, and we were very unfortunate with the goals we conceded.

Had that game finished 0-2, everyone would have come away thinking it was probably a fair reflection.

The signs are good, and we're very close to things clicking into place. And, also, some of our football was fluid, nimble, direct-but-not-too-direct, and at an exciting pace.

Every QPR fan I've talked to has said they wouldn't want him back.   
  
&gt;We could use him for squad rotation when the matches begin to pile up. I doubt we'd risk playing Vertonghen at LB in a League Cup match for example.  
  
My point is that he's worse than both Rose and Davies who are both fully fit and 6 + 9 years younger than him. Then there's Vertonghen who is more than competent there. There's no point in having him when he'd only be 4th choice.  
  
&gt; He deserves a chance to prove himself again. It's almost the same situation as when AVB made Adebayor train with the reserves. Weren't we also trying to load him off at the time?  
  
He's not played since the world cup (in which he was awful), so will also be nowhere near match fit.  
  
It's not the same as the Adebayor / AVB situation at all. With Ade, he had a good season, then AVB came in, ditched him, then he came back and was awesome.  
  
Benny on the other hand  wasn't brought back by AVB or Tim and now Poch... baring in mind how much we needed a LB under AVB and Tim.   
  
We still are trying to offload him, he's been told he can leave for free...

You may recall some years ago (but probably not since I am guessing you're too young by your posting history) that Paxman asked Michael Howard the same question about 17 times during an episode of Newsnight.  Howard gave an answer in response each time, but it wasn't the answer to the question posed.  And Paxman repeatedly asked him ""why aren't you answering the question. Did you...(repeat original question)"".

A fair summary is Howard didn't answer the question.  He answered a question - just not the one posed.   

And the same sort of summary applies to Nick Robinson's question.

In any case, the real question about whether Nick Robinson is biased, is would he be equally tough in questioning people on the other side of the debate.  And I think, most people know he would.  He doesn't let any politician off the hook.

London real estate is always a pain in the ass to deal with, really commercial real estate period is a pain in the ass, and has numerous potholes that can catch an investor.

Traditionally in real estate development you would look for an area where you can get property comparatively undervalued and then develop it and sell for profit. You would spend a huge amount of time looking for indicators that a specific area is due to improve and grow and invest there.

Well, Tottenham may at times resemble Beruit during the civil war and may be 8 miles from the center of London which are drawbacks, but the  property will be valued lower than if you were to go look in other parts of the city. 

More importantly than the pricing...because we are building a new stadium and some other projects in the area the government has effectively agreed to some minor sponsorship of gentrification of the area. Means that their is both private and government investment going into the area to improve it.

Now knowing that the government and private investment is going into the area that is a pretty big signal that there is some serious potential for profitable investment in the area.  If you were to say....own a major football club that is leading the charge for improvement and development it may put you in a position to flex some muscle and really capitalize on that development.

BORIS BEREZOVSKY’S present has now been returned. One day in 2007 Mr Berezovsky (pictured left), the exiled Russian oligarch, pounced on his onetime business partner and now sworn rival, Roman Abramovich, in a Hermès boutique in London. “I have a present for you,” Mr Berezovsky reportedly said, serving him with a writ for what would become a $5 billion lawsuit—the largest in British history. Today, after a four-month trial last year, Judge Elizabeth Gloster announced her verdict, siding wholly with Mr Abramovich and dismissing Mr Berezovsky's claims “in their entirety”. Whatever evidence Mr Berezovsky and his associates presented, Mrs Justice Gloster wrote in her judgment, was “vague, internally inconsistent, exaggerated and, at times, incredible.”

At its core, the case centered on whether, as Mr Berezovsky claimed, Mr Abramovich threatened him into selling his share of the Russian oil major Sibneft, along with other assets, at a greatly undervalued price after Mr Berezovsky fell out with President Vladimir Putin and fled Russia in 2000. (Mr Berezovsky parted with his stake of Sibneft for $1.3 billion in 2001; Mr Abramovich sold his own stake of the company for $11.9 billion in 2005.) For his part, Mr Abramovich said that Mr Berezovsky never owned a part of Sibneft at all, but rather that Mr Abramovich paid him for krysha, which literally means “roof,” but in the world of Russian business suggests a combination of access, protection, and generally making sure the necessary things happen and the unwelcome things don’t.

There was a sad, Shakespearian feel to the whole trial, with the unmistakable sense of an apprentice outpacing his onetime master: in the mid-1990s it was Mr Berezovsky’s political connections that made him a necessary partner for the upstart Mr Abramovich; by the early 2000s, however, with Mr Berezovsky on the outs with the Kremlin and living abroad, it was the ascendant Mr Abramovich who wielded the upper hand. The trial was, at times, a salacious and outlandish spectacle, providing a rare look inside a rough-and-tumble business world that is usually hidden behind high estate walls and layers of lawyers and bodyguards. Testimony was peppered with all the colorful details of high-stakes commerce, 1990s-Russian-style: huge tabs for mistresses, chartered private jets and villas on the Côte d’Azur. That kept the courtroom packed with Russian journalists even after their British colleagues lost interest.

If it could be said that Mr Berezovsky had a legal strategy, it was to make the whole case a kind of metaphorical referendum on the Putin era, a political matter rather than a commercial one, in which the supposed strong-arm tactics of Mr Putin were the real matters on trial. He cast himself as a magnate who fell afoul of the powers-that-be in the Kremlin and then saw his business empire taken from him—not all that dissimilar to, say, the now imprisoned former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Perhaps he thought he would be a more sympathetic plaintiff if he was not the victim of a murky business arrangement gone bad, but of some kind of personalised persecution. (He stuck with that approach to the very end: outside of court after the verdict, Mr Berezovsky said he had “the impression that Putin himself wrote the judgment.”)

Whatever Mr Berezovsky’s exact strategy, it certainly failed. The court made its decision narrowly on the facts, the best it could understand them. Mrs Justice Gloster was scathing in her criticism of Mr Berezovsky, calling him an “unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes.” Her excoriation of Mr Berezovsky goes on for two pages, concluding that the “bottom line of my analysis of Mr. Berezovsky’s credibility is that he would have said almost anything to support his case.” Her assessment of Mr Abramovich, however, was more glowing. He “gave careful and thoughtful answers,” the judge wrote, calling his conduct as a witness “meticulous” and “frank.”

Clearly, Mr Abramovich, wherever he is—he was not in court today—is drinking champagne tonight. Who really won, though, and who lost? Even more than Mr Berezovsky, it is possible to say the Russian taxpayer has emerged as the real loser. The trial produced hours of testimony about state property sold off in the most opaque of ways, with profits from those sales then reinvested to influence domestic politics. The real winner in this battle is harder to identify. Both men saw their reputations and personal histories tainted with the emergence of uncomfortable and unflattering details. And the trial certainly did not help to improve Russia’s already troubled image as a place where doing business is a strange, messy affair not worth all the associated drama.

In the end, tonight’s drinks should not necessarily be courtesy of Mr Abramovich, but on the tab of both men’s British lawyers, the real victors of the saga. They took home untold millions in fees. Outside court today, Mr Berezovsky says he is considering an appeal—surely worth a toast in the halls of the City’s law offices this evening.",0,1410878721,null,0,false,0,ckjvlom,t3_2gk5hv,t1_ckjvlom,t3_2gk5hv,null,1426985335,18,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18

&gt; The difference is, … Ask a Muslim who wrote the Koran, and almost all will say it is the direct word of God, ask if it must be taken literally and almost all will say of course it must.

I'm pretty sure if you went to your local mosque and asked for the imam, he wouldn't tell you that it's ok to enslave unbelievers, and he'd have a pretty thorough rationalisation of how he can coexist with these words in a book that's the ""literal word"" of god.

I have absolutely no idea what his explanation would be, and we might find it pretty contrived and silly, but the fact of the matter is that there are literally millions of British muslims who believe in the rule of law, who would reject vehemently any suggestion that it's ok to stone gay people.

The problem with the current discussion (that I see on this site, in particular) is that it's impossible to have a real discussion about these kinds of cultural problems amongst British muslims, because it's drowned by the slander that ""all muslims"" believe X (X being whatever happens to suit the argument that the problem inherent and endemic in their culture).

If you need evidence of this, just look for comments made in this subreddit by British muslims - they're very rare, presumably because most British muslims realise there's no point in trying to talk sense when the masses are ranting.

My guess is No will win a close vote and then we will have to see if decentralisation happens or not. I suspect the sort of minor additional powers discussed will be granted and all the key economic powers that would actually make a difference will be retained by Westminster. If substantial powers were on offer they would have been a key part of the No campaign and the vote would not be close.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"So if I'm reading this right here's what happened (According to Alex Salmond)

Scottish NHS writes a report saying *""prices are going up, we'll need another £400m ish to maintain services at current levels in the 2015/16 year""*. This is the report that's been leaked.

Scottish Parliament then passes a bill that raises NHS budget by £800m.

Can anyone find the bill he's talking about? Because as far as I can tell there wouldn't even need to be the bill passed. The 2012 Holyrood budget spent £11.35bn on the NHS and commited to budget increases for the next three years.

In 2013 the NHS budget became £11.9bn (4.8% increase over previous year)

If there's the same increase again for 2014 that's another £570m to £12.4bn. Not quite the £12.7bn he mentions here.

So either;

* The 2012 budget didn't have the same increase every year
* There was a different bill passed to increase the NHS spend outside the 2012 budget
* There was no bill and the increase has been on the books since that 2012 budget.",0,1410880101,null,0,false,0,ckjw9nu,t3_2gka7w,t1_ckjw9nu,t3_2gka7w,null,1426985024,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's the kind of chance-from-nothing ability that he had, and other than Sturridge (the goal against Stoke at the start of last season being a great example) I don't think there's really anyone in our team right now who can score through nine or ten players behind the ball.

Our team is ridiculously young at the moment, and it'll get better, but it's really something they're going to have to get to grips with quickly, because I can't see many teams this season looking to come to Anfield and actually play proper football.

I don't know about gay people, but a third of young British Muslims think that those converting to another religion should be [executed.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/thinktanks.religion) And more than a third would prefer to live under sharia law.	

This is of course only one poll, but the results are worrying.

&gt;The problem with the current discussion is that it's impossible to have a real discussion about these kinds of cultural problems amongst British muslims, because it's tainted with the slander that ""all muslims"" believe X (X being whatever happens to suit the argument that the problem inherent and endemic in their culture).

I understand what you are saying, and of course I don't believe that you can say in any circumstance that all Muslims believe X.

But I have had a similar problem on this site when trying to explain that cultural differences can play a part, and that saying that someone did something because of their cultural background does not mean that I am implying that all people from that background will do the same.

For example, when discussing the Rotherham sex abuse cases, I have made the point in the past that part of the reason these men did what that did was that they live in isolated Pakistani communities with poor integration with the rest of society, and that some aspects of Pakistani culture, such as their treatment of women and what the age of consent should be, can play a part in why a man from a community like this would commit a crime like child rape. 

That is not to say that all Pakistani men will commit rape, or even that all men from communities like those will commit crimes like that, but it is easier for someone who wants to commit this kind of crime to do so in such an environment, as opposed to for example a white working class environment, where being labelled a paedophile will likely get you beaten up or killed.

My answer is 'no' in short - but to expand that's because I appreciate that reaction times and physics play a big part. What might be recoverable between 70 and 80mph might *not* be between 70 and 130mph. 

I don't see there's such a big difference between 70 and 80 as to make it impractical or over-dangerous for motorway / large road conditions - and other countries do work this way without incidents, proving it is workable. 

&gt; Would you be ok with people going at 60 through a school zone at half 3, or would the police be able to pull anyone over at their own discretion and legally fine them?

Kind of following on from what I said above - no I wouldn't be OK with 60 through a school zone - too much opportunity for danger. I'm also OK with 30 in urban areas.

Outside of some kind of maths or accounting primer - anywhere in the real world - this comparison is wholly bogus.

Whatever the cause of that tramp's misfortunes, it was something far more commonplace than Trump's circumstances. 

Trump was the victim of his own poor business decisions, but was given the opportunity to restructure a multimillion dollar debt not only because he had collateral, but because his creditors recognised the risks they faced if they drove him into actual bankruptcy.

Effectively Trump welched on his loans and got away with it - this is something he was able to do, pretty much because he was born rich.

Had Trump gone into actual bankruptcy, he would still been permitted to continue living in his multimillion dollar mansion - the consequences he faced were wholly different from someone who sleeps in the street under cardboard boxes.

Under the current union it makes sense spending money locally as it supports the economy, hence it makes sense for the uk to buy scottish even if scottish is more expensive than chinese, because a pound spent in scotland drives growth in the uk. So something that cost £1 from china might cost £1.10 from scotland, but when you factor in the value of supporting the economy actually be the equivalent of 90p.

Once scotland becomes foreign this all is lost, there is only price and quality considerations.

If the UK wants 400million pound ships built, it will treat scotland just like any other foreign country, and Scotland's economy will be as successful  as its international market is.

I'd also say there were plenty of games where he'd score very early on and open the game up too, and basically stop it turning into the kind of game we saw on Saturday. 

He was a player who would somehow wriggle through three or four defenders, or drag players out wide, win penalties, etc. Teams couldn't just put one or two men on him because he'd still find a way to get the ball and do something with it. I feel plenty of teams tried to park the bus and failed because Suarez would just wreak havoc with their back lines, and it took a team with the confidence and discipline of Chelsea to really manage it. When Suarez had the ball defenders would lose concentration because they'd be too worried about him to keep the shape and make sure they were picking up other dangerous players like Sturridge or Sterling.

I'd like to think that Sterling might get to that sort of level in a couple of years, but at the moment it seems that he's not quite as effective against compact defences as he is when teams are happy to give him some space.

It was an overreaction, though. Even if one conceded that Nick Robinson's report was biased (which many wouldn't), it was relatively minor.

RBS was convicted in the US of LIBOR rate rigging and fined $612m - UK taxpayers are picking up most of the tab because UK taxpayers own 80% of RBS. 

Nobody went to jail.

RBS was also convicted of rigging the equivalent Yen interest rates.

The rigging of market rates was operated as a criminal cartel by the 12 major banks who set the LiBOR rates. A selection of articles https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=RBS+libor+fine

Barclays were one of the banks convicted - it cost Bob Diamond (CEO) and Marcus Agius (Chairman) their jobs but they didn't go to jail.

Marcus Agius to this day has retained his job on the BBC board of governors. Why wasn't he fired? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Agius

HSBC was convicted of massive money laundering for Mexican drug cartels over a period of several years. Again nobody went to jail. Large scale money laundering for drugs and terrorist cash is endemic among the large banks. 

The SEC and the FSA do NOT regulate banks - they protect the boards from prosecution.

The major banks are operating a massive criminal cartel and the people responsible for it are getting away with it with only the occasional trivial shareholder fine as a so called ""punishment"".

If you encourage criminal behaviour, as the FSA and SEC are most certainly doing, the only thing you can be sure of is that you will get more crime.

Until bank CEO's and other board members start going to jail for their frauds things will never be fixed. The UK banking licences of the major criminal banks should be taken away (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Barclays, HSBC, UBS, Citigroup, Deutschebank etc.). They have proved themselves to be criminal organisations and therefore unfit institutions to hold such a licence.

What annoys me is that people sometimes assume that we should be spending that kind of money just because we used to be able to.  You have to find the cash before you spend it - in reality for us that means securing the finances and the location to build a stadium that can generate big enough revenues and perhaps attract more investment.

Let's talk about the old days some more. In 1986 Everton got badly screwed over by the European ban, arguably more than any other club.  After that, in the 90s we got taken over by a kopite, in the form of Peter Johnson, who seemed to have something other than the clubs best interest at heart (hell, they even changed the ownership rules because of that ""character"").  Bill Kenwright stepped in and shored up the ship when it needed doing.  He got a club, that had seen John Collins publicly say that he'd been lied to about signings and investment.  Where signings would come in and out on a revolving door.  He turned it into the place it is today, where players like Baines are showing loyalty, because it's a club that really cares about it players and it's community.  That comes from the top.  I used to think that Moyes was a gentleman, but then I saw how he behaved at Man Utd you start to see that at least some of the clubs style comes from Kenwright.  He did the right thing when he got rid of Walter Smith, and I think he got the right man for the job in David Moyes - a man who could build a stable club from nothing.  Now I think he maybe held on to Moyes too tightly, for too long, but well, when the time came he did he right thing again, despite almost everyone I know (myself included) saying ""Oh no, not Roberto Martinez"".  And all this time he's been trying to get the stadium built, clearly it's hard, but he's been trying.  Maybe we'll get there this time.  I hope so.  Everton today might not be the club it was in the 1985 or 1970, but it's a better club than the one Kenwright bought, and it's looking up.

IMO, he has the best off the ball movement in our team and for example, just look at that goal of the month. When he's playing well, he can be the one that could penetrate the tough defense apart from Hazard, of course.

Willian is more of a type of player where we can use when we needed to keep possession and play with patient build up. He's not the one who will run to spaces like Schürrle but he will provide that stability and work rate especially playing against the bigger sides.

true,technicalthrowaway,null,null,"Personally, I think people underestimate the impact of role. We're all familiar with the Zimbardo prison study, sometimes known as the Stanford prison study: get random nice people to assume role of guard or prisoner, in nearly all cases, the nice normal people assigned the role of guard will become power mad asshats and the nice normal people assigned the role of prisoners will become rebellious criminals. Even if we accept they are now horrible people, I'm sure they were nice beforehand.

I refuse to believe that there are so many lying thieving bad people elected into positions of power. I think it's to do with the role, both the effect of role on character, and also the practicalities and possibilities afforded by certain roles.

E.g. people who break manifesto promises, in a lot of cases, I think they believed they could make their promises come true, but then when they're in the position, and they have all the information, they realise it's simply not possible.

Maybe that's just me giving the benefit of the doubt, being a starry eyed sheeple, or assuming that people are better than they are. But the question is effectively ""do you like these people, or do you think they're conspiring to make your life a misery"". Hanlons razor: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."" I think another reason why people dislike them is because they didn't know what we expected them to know. Even if we accept them as a bit dim, that doesn't necessarily make them bad or dislikeable people.

I'm sure a lot of the politicians (including the 3) are nice friendly people. I'm sure they're all pretty well educated and would make for interesting, civil and sophisticated dinner conversation (assuming that's your thing). I think a lot of us would probably like the major 3, in the same way we like posh or wealthy TV entertainers, it's just the context in which we know them casts them in a very bad light. Combine that with media perceptions and depictions of them, and it's no wonder everyone hates them. 

Do I honestly think ""one or more of these three men is a pretty OK guy, and a good leader/politician/has his head screwed on properly""? Without actually knowing first hand what they have to deal with, with what resources/options and how they've dealt with it, I don't really think it's fair to say. They all seem relatively civil and have made better choices in their lives compared to a lot of people you'd meet on a night out in a lot of big cities.

There are degrees of free market capitalism.

The other main requirement for a free market economy is the very strong application of the Rule of Law, so that when people harm others (e.g. by fraud) they are handed deterrent penalties to discourage criminal activity in the future. CEO's of major crony Corporations in the UK, the US and (to a lesser extent) the EU NEVER go to jail no matter what white collar crimes they commit.

true,Wargame4life,null,null,"Yeah but the world doesn't just consist of scotland and the UK, this isn't WW2 and U-boats are not sinking shipping so that england will starve.

If the UK needs something scotland has it can source it elsewhere, scotland on the other hand doesn't have the market power to get the same deal.

In its simplest form illustrated by a very simplistic example,  lets pretend scotland has 5 people and the UK has 50 (for simplicity) and everyone needs a car, the cost of sending a ship to the island is £100 and each car cost £100 .

In the UK the price of a car is therefore £100 + (£100/50) = £102

in scotland the price of the car is £100 + (£100/5) = £120

Now imagine instead of ""car"" its ""car parts/materials"" and both scotland and the UK makes its own cars (same prices), and the cars are identical.

So The UK can charge £103 for its cars and make a profit, but scotland has to charge £121 to make the same profit as the UK.

So the UK can charge £120 for a car netting a profit of £18 per car but if scotland did this and charged the same, it would lose £1 for every car sold.

Why would france or anyone else buy a scottish car for more money when they can buy a UK car for less?

Why would scottish citizens buy a scottish car for more money when they can buy a UK car for less? 

This fundamental principle is why we are better together.

Scotland needs the uk more than the uk needs scotland , but the uk wants scotland to stay because then we could make cars for even less £100 + (£100/55) = £101.81 and everyone is better off.

So scotland on its own  has to pay £120 for each car

UK on its own £102 for each car 

Scotland and Uk together as one £101.81 per car.

If you think the UK desperately needs scotland you are mistaken, economically we lose much less (19p in the example) co pared to what scotland loses (price increase by £20 in the example).

10 times then population, ten times the buying power, and 10 times the sharing of infrastructure/cost/burdens.

true,swug3,,UKIP,"Being English and looking into Scotland. It makes no sense for going independent. Its just a repetition of various Historical events. Which will lead to a weaker Scotland.

**First reason: The Economic situation:** 

Alex Salmond has not answered a single question on the Economy. How are you going to pay for everything? Where is the money going to come from? The Currency Union plan is a ridiculous one- We have seen what happens when Economies share a currency (Euro Crisis), So why now, does Alex Salmond think its a great thing to do?

**Second Reason: ""We can get the Government we really voted for""**

The biggest lie in the entire campaign. Due to PR in Scotland, the SNP get a disproportionate amount of the seats. Therefore, their claim that ""Westminster is not representative"" is also a claim people should be levelling at the SNP. Therefore, the Scots after independence could get time and time again, a Government the people didn't want. 

Interesting fact: 14/21 of the last Governments in the UK were voted into power with the help of Scottish votes.

Another interesting fact: The SNPs 11 seats were used to vote in favour for a vote of no confidence in 1979- Thus leading to a Thatcher Government.
See Scotland? You do get the Governments you want!

**Third Reason- Getting the rUK to agree for Independence**

Now that's going to be the hardest part, Polls have suggested that if Scotland goes independent, the rUK are going to give Alex Salmond a hard time. The majority of the rUK want Scotland to get nothing from the rUK. Why? because Alex Salmond has decided to treat the rUK has taken a very anti-English/British Stance. What Alex Salmond has done was awoken a part of the English that has been lying dormant for years. Its the part where we see England as being great and that England really matters. Thus opening some really old wounds. (A joke (in bad taste) I hear a lot- English people say let Scotland get independence then invade them after)

**Fourth Reason- Bringing the country together**

Oh boy, now this, this is an issue. Whatever the way the vote goes, near enough half of the population will be angry and annoyed- In a No vote, you can get another referendum and try again (Quebec model). In a Yes vote though. Half the people will want to remain British, Alex Salmond has already split the Nation (Team Scotland vs Team Westminster) trying to get people to work together after this is going to be a struggle, and it may be a struggle that Scotland will not be able to deal with

**Fifth reason: Relationship with the EU/NATO**

So Scotland gets Independence- Its now a new nation. Therefore, it does not join the EU automatically, it has to go through a membership process that will take years. This means Scotland gets no subsidies from the EU to help out Scottish businesses. It also means Scotland gets no say in ANY EU matters. Also, due to Unanimity, One nation can vote for Scotland not to join the EU and they won't join the EU. 
In terms of NATO- Again, Scotland has to reapply. This is also a long winded process. NATO will want to keep trident in Scotland (close enough to deter Russia further). Therefore, Salmond won't be able to get rid of the Trident programme.

**Sixth Reason- Unrealistic timeline**
Really? 18 months to get independence, How can you set up all necessary departments, get through the discussions and deals in that short amount of time. Its Impossible.

The list can go on and on. The reason- SCOTLAND CAN DO IT, WE ARE AWESOME AND WE CAN FACE ANY CHALLENGE. Is a pitiful reason, patriotic yes, able to whip up support yes. Sensible, No. The risks are too great to be worth the Risk. **Vote No** This is a decision that you will regret for generations to come.

For your interest:

In its simplest form illustrated by a very simplistic example,  lets pretend scotland has 5 people and the UK has 50 (for simplicity) and everyone needs a car, the cost of sending a ship to the island is £100 and each car cost £100 .

In the UK the price of a car is therefore £100 + (£100/50) = £102

in scotland the price of the car is £100 + (£100/5) = £120

Now imagine instead of ""car"" its ""car parts/materials"" and both scotland and the UK makes its own cars (same prices), and the cars are identical.

So The UK can charge £103 for its cars and make a profit, but scotland has to charge £121 to make the same profit as the UK.

So the UK can charge £120 for a car netting a profit of £18 per car but if scotland did this and charged the same, it would lose £1 for every car sold.

Why would france or anyone else buy a scottish car for more money when they can buy a UK car for less?

Why would scottish citizens buy a scottish car for more money when they can buy a UK car for less? 

This fundamental principle is why we are better together.

Scotland needs the uk more than the uk needs scotland , but the uk wants scotland to stay because then we could make cars for even less £100 + (£100/55) = £101.81 and everyone is better off.

So scotland on its own  has to pay £120 for each car

UK on its own £102 for each car 

Scotland and Uk together as one £101.81 per car.

If you think the UK desperately needs scotland you are mistaken, economically we lose much less (19p in the example) co pared to what scotland loses (price increase by £20 in the example).

In Ireland the general opinion of the EU is it's a pain in the arse but it's been good for Ireland. Look at where our society and living standards were when we joined, and where we are now. So the politicians figured ""people are smart, they'll vote yes"" and basically didn't bother their arses to campaign in any significant way. At the same time, the No campaign blew wads of cash and went all out media blitz to get their message across.

What happened? The No campaign, basically unopposed, won out. When it happened, suddenly all the previously silent ""Yes"" politicians came out to the media basically saying ""WTF did you guys just do? Sure we forgot to tell you, but voting no actually means X, Y and Z for Ireland"". Suddenly opinion polls in Ireland, after the vote, changed to show that people regretted their vote.

What had happened was people felt they knew nothing about the treaty, the Yes campaign hadn't actually done anything to inform them other than to say that everything the No campaign said was bullshit. So eventually, the referendum was run again and this time the Yes won resoundingly.

This is happening in Scotland right now. Big difference is there will be no second chance. The No campaign figured that independence was just the pipe-dream of a minority of Scots and didn't really bother to field a real campaign.

I suppose a counter argument would be ""well if they were *really* decent people, they would come out and explain exactly what's stopping them and why, regardless of how secretive it maybe"" but I suppose a lot of them do try and explain. But the reason why we have people in these positions is because the bigger picture takes a lifetime of exposure, education and training to even begin to try and grasp. I don't think even the most worthy explanation can encapsulate the lessons of a lifetime. 

e.g. Someone who hasn't spent a good portion of their life on the Web could read the appropriate comment ""inb4 'nice try Ed/Dave/Nick'"" as a stupid, misinformed, hate-worthy comment, just as someone who hasn't spent a good portion of their life in politics (e.g. most of the population) would perceive appropriate political decisions to be stupid, misinformed and hate-worthy.

Don't be dense.

&gt;If I were to rip the speedometer out of your car and force you to drive around, does that make you suddenly unsafe? Do you not think you could drive safely?

absolutely. You couldn't either, and if you think you could, you're a dangerous driver. 

Let's look at the example in the article you're defending: [This is the road](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2gjmrt/jeremy_clarkson_no_kids_traffic_or_oaps_so_why/ckjrk06) that Jeremy Clarkson thinks 60mph is too slow for. It looks pretty clear, right? you could do 80mph down that no problem.

Only it's not actually safe to do 80mph, like someone points out further down. Even though someone on the thread clearly thinks that would be a reasonable speed. If you ripped out your speedometer you'd probably gravitate towards 80 if you felt that 80 was a good speed for the road, which, if it were all long and straight, and there was a central divider, it probably would be. But it's not, so if you drove at 80, you'd probably kill yourself and potentially some other people too. 

&gt;You don't think our education, car safety mechanisms, braking technology and general advances in automotive technology have anything to do with that?

Wow, that's precious. You think that the only two options are ""speed limits are responsible for 100% of road safety"" or ""speed limits are responsible for 0%""? you actually think people are arguing that nothing other than speed limits can help road safety? for someone complaining about reasonable discussion you make some insultingly bad arguments. 

&gt; but don't kid yourself in thinking that motorway and dual carriageway safety hinges on everyone driving at or below 70mph.

Christ, how can you not understand this? it's really, really basic critical thinking, I thought everyone had figured out that situations can have several contributing factors by the time they left primary school. 

If people stopped driving with rubber tyres and started using metal ones, accidents would increase. If people started dumping oil onto the road, accidents would increase. If people stopped following the speed limits, accidents would increase. If people started driving while using their phone, accidents would increase. *All of these things* affect the number of accidents that happen, ok? there are *several* important factors, and if *any one* of them changes, the accident rate will change too because the accident rate hinges on *all* of them.

Absolutely.

Salmond uses highly optimistic figures of £1.2Tn Oil remaining.  Estimates range from £1.5Tn (an outlier) to £120Bn. Figures in the proposed balance sheet for Scotland use the 2010 Revenues of £10Bn a year, [yet last year they were ú4.2Bn](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/scotland-deficit-12bn-alex-salmond-damages-case-independence-economy-oil-revenues-fall) [Second Source](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2754728/SIR-IAN-WOOD-Why-Salmonds-wrong-Scotlands-oil-Its-running-faster-thinks-says-British-billionaire-built-North-Sea-fortune-makes-impassioned-plea-save-union.html)

Then there's the fact that 'Yes' Assumes that the cost of borrowing to Scotland will not change. It will change because the unbacked fledgling economy will be seen as very much higher risk. [Scotland will pay around 1% more on money it borrows, at least,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24140981) than it does as part of the UK. It will spend more servicing debt. This is money that cannot be spent 'doing good'.

All of this means that an Independent Scotland faces a [£12Bn Funding Gap](http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2014/06/independent-scotland-faces-12bn-funding-gap-warns-ifs/). Austerity will hit Scotland harder and for longer as a separate entity than it has the UK together. The UK will bounce back into Surplus several years ahead of an independent Scotland and start reducing its debt sooner.

The EU question is also of Key importance to Scotland - because your economy hinges on it. Salmond has repeatedly stated that special exceptions will be made for Scotland. The EU itself begs to differ. Scotland will have to endure the same process as every other applicant nation. This will take 5 years minimum, probably more like 10, and would involve an independent currency and founding a central bank.

[Here's a nice roundup of the problems facing an independent Scotland](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/scotland-and-snp-fooling-yourselves-and.html)

And, you can ignore some of the warnings some of the time, but you can't ignore all of the warnings, all of the time. The tide of educated opinion has been almost unanimous: An independent Scotland will be worse off for the short and medium term.

Of course, this debate is not entirely about the economics of the situation. Many will be willing to suffer n the short term if it allows a fairer, more directly controlled governance for the future.

My argument is this: You cannot deliver a more socially equal society when the economy is not able to support it. Socialist Policies cost MONEY. A Stronger economy is better for everyone: More jobs, more tax revenue, more public spending. Scotland COULD build a strong, independent economy, of that I have no doubt. But not by the proposed mechanisms, and not right now, and certainly not without it's own currency. This is an uncertain time, post GFC and with Russia sabre rattling. Scotlands needs will be best met by remaining in the Union that has served it well for 300 years, as it enjoys a resurgent economy that is far outstripping the rest of the Eurozone.

Independence now wouldn't be independence at all (since it would be chained to a foreign economy by way of a currency it has no control of), and it would be at every cost to the Scotland we no doubt both care about deeply.",0,1410886732,null,0,false,0,ckjzseu,t3_2gh8dm,t1_ckjzseu,t1_ckjx5f8,null,1426983382,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Scotland absolutely can exist as a state no one is claiming they cant, the question is compared to the standards and services they currently enjoy, will things be as good, better? or worse?

Scotland is projecting its future based on calculations done while in the union assuming all trade and contracts wont change, and its ""money in the bank"" while enjoying a multi discount and economies of scale.

Once the actual realities kick in and business shifts, prices rise and the cost of borrowing heavily increases, the cost of doing business increases and your closest competitor, the uk, can outperform you and undercut prices easily.

Also the negotiation power of scotland is completely diminished and holds almost no leverage compared to the leverage of the uk over scotland.

He reveals that he and other journalists have experienced more hostility and intimidation than they would normally expect in a country like Scotland, that this has been unpleasant and that it has appeared to come mainly from some nationalist elements supportive of the Yes campaign. 

It's short on evidence, definitely. It's anecdotal and so people can choose to dismiss it if they wish. But I don't think it's fair to characterise it as *demonising* the Yes campaign. He is careful to make the point that abuse has happened on both sides, and that it is only *some* Yes supporters that are behaving in this way. He also offers some thoughts about why that might be the case, and why it might not be a good idea, whilst offering a fairly positive assessment of the Yes campaign's vision for an independent Scotland.

So, he's not tarring all Yes supporters with the same brush and he's not using the alleged abuse and intimidation to try and invalidate the Yes campaign as a whole. 

People can quite reasonably demand evidence of the heckling, abuse and intimidation he says he and other reporters have experienced. I suspect they have not, until now, considered it the story they should be focusing on. The referendum is the story, not them.

I always used to say this, but recently I've stopped. Not sure why. I suppose I've gotten to a point in my life where I don't see the need to explain all of my actions to everyone, so it could be that they feel similarly. It could be that people in power who know they've done something that isn't what people expected and don't want to explain because it'll look like they're making cheap excuses.

Remember Nick Clegg apologising? Who's to say he was just pandering? He may well have felt it was the right thing to do given the situation, but he was just taken the mickey out of and fobbed off as trying to save his own ass. Maybe his original supporters should've patted him on the shoulder and said, ""it's alright, Nick, you did your best, try harder next time"" rather than call him malicious, stupid, spineless, etc.

Tangent aside, I see what you mean about the bigger picture &amp; experience thing.

Why people in this sub can't have a civil discussion is beyond me, bt I'll bring myself down to your level because apparently acting like a dick is the only way you can interpret the things being said to you.

&gt; absolutely. You couldn't either, and if you think you could, you're a dangerous driver.

I'm sorry, I'll bow down to your extensive 60 hours of driving experience. I've probably so far in my short time clocked up 200/250k miles on Britain's roads, as well as a few abroad with a 0 accident record, but please, tell me more about my complete inability to drive a car safely without knowing precisely what speed I'm travelling at.

The fact that your driving ability would go out the window in the case of speedometer failure is the most frightening thing in this thread. 

&gt; Only it's not actually safe to do 80mph, like someone points out further down. Even though someone on the thread clearly thinks that would be a reasonable speed. If you ripped out your speedometer you'd probably gravitate towards 80 if you felt that 80 was a good speed for the road, which, if it were all long and straight, and there was a central divider, it probably would be. But it's not, so if you drove at 80, you'd probably kill yourself and potentially some other people too.

&amp;

&gt; Wow, that's precious. You think that the only two options are ""speed limits are responsible for 100% of road safety"" or ""speed limits are responsible for 0%""? you actually think people are arguing that nothing other than speed limits can help road safety? for someone complaining about reasonable discussion you make some insultingly bad arguments.

The funny thing about cars and drivers is, we don't *want* to kill ourselves and others around us. We also, surprisingly, don't want to total our cars which is why people will set a speed they feel suitable for the roads. 

In the case of a blind hill or corner, the difference between 70mph and 80mph is negligible. If you hit something at exactly 70, it will have a very similar outcome to if you hit the same thing at 80. In this case, I blame road planning and the local council for not reducing the limit down to 50 or below for this obvious hazard.

Millions of accidents each day are ***prevented*** because drivers have reduced speed when necessary. It is this: ""reduce speed when necessary"" behaviour, exhibited to excellent effect by drivers everywhere, that is the foundation of our entire road safety system. People aren't fucking stupid - 99% of them will reduce their speed when necessary. You claim that increasing the speed limit to 80mph on some dual carriageways and motorways will suddenly cause mass amounts of danger, death and carnage? People are charged with the responsibility of using deadly speed wisely on a second by second basis and the rarity of accidents in the general scheme of things proves beyond doubt that the vast majority are well up to the challenge.

Ultimately, we're going to go round and round on this issue, but the plain and simple answer is that increasing the speed limit to 80mph on suitable motorways and dual carriageways, with a bit of consideration given to areas that could be deemed as to require a reduced limit, will be about as harmful as lightly tinted windows or listening to music while driving. Go and get some more driving experience, research road accident rates and causes ([this is a useful one to get you started](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9277/rrcgb2011-04.pdf))

If you want something to moan about, go and inspect the tyres on the next hundred cars you see. Illegal tyres (which are horrendously common) and borked brake-pads cause more accidents than exceeding the speed limit by 15%, which is why I'm running 19"" Pirelli P0s, carbon D&amp;G discs, Street Hawk brake pads and SS braided brake lines.

For those who don't want the whole thread above, here's what I wrote on the subject.

What Anelka, and too a lesser extent BAE have done, is: 

They've expressly supported someone who has been convicted on multiple occasions of making defamatory anti-Semitic comments, that's what they're ""guilty"" of. See below:

Basically, the comedian who popularized the quenelle [Dieudonné M'bala M'bala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M%27bala_M%27bala), has long been known for his far-right views and has been convicted and fined for numerous anti-Semitic comments (check the Court Actions section of his wikipedia page, linked above).

While the player's themselves haven't ""done"" anything anti-Semitic outside of the gesture, some of them, Anelka for sure, have explicitly stated that they did it as a show of support for their friend, Dieudonné"". [Anelka tweeted](https://twitter.com/anelkaofficiel/status/417002216306663424): ""This gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend, Dieudonne."" 

Furthermore, Anelka has since been pictured wearing the [same shirt](http://www.lemeilleurdupsg.com/images/news/image/anciens/anelka-tshirt-quenelle.jpg) as [Dieudonne](http://allainjules.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dieudonnc3a9.png?w=500&amp;h=316). And pictured [making the gesture with him.](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/01/article-2532121-1A59260200000578-302_634x498.jpg)

To draw an American analogy, this would be like an athlete claiming support for Rick Perry, who has [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/?v=0PAJNntoRgA) up, with the immortal quote of: “*I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m a Christian, but you don’t need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there’s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.*” 

Then the athlete coming out and saying that *they themselves* aren't bigoted or anti-gay, despite their open support for someone who is.

In conclusion, no one (individual or group) gets to decide whether or not a particular action is offensive. The people offended do, in this case, Jews. And despite the fact that numerous Jewish leaders have openly called for support for this to stop, some people (cough, Anelka) continue on blathering about how it's an ""anti-establishment"" symbol, not a religious one. A decision that is out of his hands.

**tl;dr: Bigotry, and support of it, is bad.** ***Always.***

&gt;

&gt;__Dieudonné M'bala M'bala__ (born 11 February 1966), generally known by his stage name __Dieudonné__ (French: [djø.dɔ.ne]), is a [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people) [comedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian), actor, and [political activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activist). His father is from [Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon) and his mother is French. Some of his performances and associations have been controversial and he has been convicted for [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism).

&gt;Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, [Élie Semoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Semoun), humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in [Dreux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreux) against the [National Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(France\)), the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist.   On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an [Israeli settler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement) whom he depicted as a [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi). Some critics argued that he had ""crossed the limits of antisemitism"" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) and the [Jewish lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_lobby). 

&gt;Dieudonné approached [Jean-Marie Le Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marie_Le_Pen), leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends.  [Holocaust denier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denier) [Robert Faurisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Faurisson) appeared in one of his shows in 2008.   Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as ""memorial pornography"".  Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) charges.   Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities.       Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following.  His [quenelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_(gesture\)) signature gesture became notorious in 2013, particularly after [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) [Nicolas Anelka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Anelka) used the gesture during a match in December 2013.

45m is pittance in comparison to most clubs, and it is a totally controllable level of debt. For example, Chelsea are in £958m of debt, Villa are in £189m, you get the idea. Yes we don't own our training ground, but would you rather we had our shitty old facilities at Bellefield? New facilities allow us to attract a higher calibre of player.

Also, you wish he would allow someone else control over financial decisions? Really? Ever hear of Robert Elstone? He is far from perfect but, again, we could have a lot worse.

I didn't say going to the game made him a perfect chairman, but would you rather we had someone who didn't go and failed to appreciate what is important to us?

By no means do I think Bill is perfect, but look around us in the PL. Look at Newcastle, Cardiff, Villa, Tottenham. Look at how much better he is than some other clubs, and be pleased we don't have a Venky's or a Tan anywhere near our boardroom.

true,Danibaldi,null,null,"I have a few issues with the argument that we shouldn't be independent because we get from the union more than we get into it (in terms of public spending).

Firstly, Wales does not have a lack of resources or economic advantages at all; we actually have a wide variety of factors in our favour like tourism, green energy (as has been pointed out on a number of occasions), high proximity to a worldwide financial hub (London), agriculture, etc etc. We don't have Scotland's oil, but most countries don't. We actually have more natural resources than Ireland but are nowhere near their GDP or average wage, for example. 

I think that this is because we have a national infrastructure that is, quite frankly, appalling. 
Wales doesn't have electrified rail yet, the only country in Europe besides Albania and Moldova that can say this. Being able to travel from the south of the country to the north is difficult (even on the train we have to go through England 90% of the time). To get from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen on the train, you have to go through England. 
We have a pathetic media. We have genuine national concerns - how is our health service being run? Are we educating our children well? Why is our language declining? Is our government performing well? But these questions aren't scrutinised by a national media. The BBC gives us the same news coverage as a region of England with none of these concerns and British newspapers don't have a Welsh version, like they do in Scotland. 
The average wage in our country is very, very low, and the number of people on benefits is high. This is by no means our fault, it's a sign of the failure of the governments we've had to make Wales a good place to invest. These facts also make Wales a relatively cheap place to live and this attracts pensioners and more people on benefits - not exactly going to improve our GDP per capita, is it? I want to reiterate though that I have no problem with people on benefits - they have been failed by the government. 

In many ways, Wales doesn't look like a country. Scotland is independent in a lot of ways that Wales isn't anyway, no matter the result of the referendum, and they have been able to build something that resembles a national infrastructure even without political independence. 

Wales, as I see it, has two choices. We can continue to be a part of the UK and take the relatively comfortable existence that comes with that. Yeah, we're consistently the poorest region of the UK (and even at times the EU) but we're actually getting back more than we put in. If London creates wealth, it does sometimes trickle back down to us. When they make a loss, it's normally us who actually pays for it in the form of austerity (because we are a dependent nation), but we still get more than we give. We can either settle for that, or we can go independent. It'll take a lot of effort, and it won't be easy, but we would be able to instigate truly national policies that increase investment in Wales and creates more jobs. As probably the most famous living economist, Joseph Stiglitz, says - it's not the size of a country or even its resources that makes the difference, its their economic policies.

Wales has a decision to make.",0,1410892045,null,0,false,0,ckk2qiw,t3_2gjm16,t1_ckk2qiw,t3_2gjm16,null,1426981939,15,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,15

This leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place. 

If IS takes over KSA they will have oil revenues beyond their wildest dreams. They won't be descending into a failed state any time soon. And if we mess with them they will cut our oil supplies off.

But if we back KSA this will cause a tidal wave of resentment and help IS recruitment and funding. Bin Laden was partly motivated to attack because of the US presence in KSA. 

Iran might seem an unattractive ally, but we will need to work with them if we really want to sort IS out.

&gt;I'm sorry, I'll bow down to your extensive 60 hours of driving experience. 

right, so, you don't seem to understand that I am a *completely legal driver*. I am not some outlier here. Literally anyone who is at any stage from getting a provisional license and insurance to having 60 years of experience driving is allowed on the roads. If you are seriously suggesting that someone who has just passed their test should be allowed to drive at whatever speed they think is acceptable, you're insane. 

You want to insult me just because you think you're ryan gosling? go ahead, but bear in mind that you're arguing that I'm not a good enough driver to be allowed to drive without speed limits, *at the exact same time you argue everyone is a good enough driver to drive without speed limits*. You are not thinking critically about what you're saying at all, and it really shows. 

&gt;The fact that your driving ability would go out the window in the case of speedometer failure is the most frightening thing in this thread.

the fact that you think that having 250,000 miles driven makes you some kind of omniscient driving god who can tell exactly how capable everyone is of gauging driving conditions is probably beating it out, actually. 

&gt;The funny thing about cars and drivers is, we don't want to kill ourselves and others around us. We also, surprisingly, don't want to total our cars which is why people will set a speed they feel suitable for the roads.

Oh really? No shit, people don't intentionally crash. I am so dumb, clearly if people don't want to crash they just won't, because everyone has perfect judgement. That must be why there are zero road accidents ever.

You're trolling at this point. There's no way you aren't. I give you a fucking direct link to someone saying they would drive dangerously fast on a road, and you're so blind to the possibility your vast driving brain could be wrong about anything ever, that you just pretend it doesn't exist. 

&gt; People are charged with the responsibility of using deadly speed wisely on a second by second basis 

and most of them judge the right speed by what the limit is set at. 

What you're going to be doing now, and in the next reply to me, is changing your argument from ""all drivers everywhere should be able to drive at what they think is the fastest safe speed possible for every road"", to ""some people can safely drive 10mph faster than the limit on wide, safe, multiple lane dual carriageway"". Then you're going to pretend that you never said ""Speed limits have nothing to do with safe driving, and are simply an arbitrary number everyone aims"", that you're not commenting on an article written about one of the roads not in the categories that you're refining your argument down to, and that you aren't claiming that a motorist's opinion on what the speed should be is just as safe as a speed limit.

Secondly your country has the opportunity to determine its own destiny, free from the dabbling of the political elite of Westminster. A yes vote will result in many difficult years but if the Scots are brave enough to grasp the nettle I feel that you have the resources, both material and personal, to sort out a political system that represents *you* and build an economy that benefits *you*.

true,confluence,null,null,"I don't think that criticism of the execution of a story idea means that Who fans don't appreciate subtlety in storytelling.

I don't mind ambiguity. I have a problem with plot twists which expect me to strain my suspension of disbelief to its breaking point by accepting a contrived and unlikely alternative explanation for an event.

A good twist makes you think ""oh, of course! That's so clever!"" Or at least ""I didn't interpret those events in that way, but in retrospect I can buy that interpretation."" A twist that makes you think ""but what about..."", and ""but now that event makes no sense"" is not a good twist; it's a plot hole.

I can buy pretty much all the alternative explanations offered for the other events in the episode: the Doctor not noticing that he dropped the chalk; subconsciously writing on the board; the door opening because of pressure differences; whatever. In all these cases, the two explanations (the innocuous one vs ""the monster did it"") are *equally likely*. The events just seem ominous because we're freaking out about the monster. This is ""ambiguity"".

While your mileage, obviously, may vary, I found that the thing-on-the-bed scene went far beyond using a spooky atmosphere to make something innocuous seem ominous.  Yes, it's *possible* for there to have been a child on the bed, and this possibility was lampshaded in the dialogue, so clearly the writers expect us to see this as the same kind of ambiguous event as the others, but I find it to be a lot more poorly thought-out.

So many things had to have happened in a really, really specific way in order for there to have been a child on the bed that this explanation feels very contrived and unsatisfying. The child had to have sneaked in while avoiding being seen by two people who were unexpectedly under the bed, or the Doctor who presumably came in shortly afterwards.

As his seasons wore on and he got more and more slapstick-y in his movements and ""Oh! I'm so brilliant!"" moments, I was afraid I might injure myself with all the eye rolling. I also took issue with how much violence there seemed to be in his seasons. More than with others, I think, and so much of it perpetuated by The Doctor, which just seemed wrong. 

But at its core, the character itself was still about finding the beauty of the universe and the grace and wonder in things that are different. About outsmarting and understanding more than insulting and cutting down and diminishing, and about togetherness and loyalty and the innate beauty of the human spirit winning out in the end. Those are the things that I took with me from the very first time I watched Doctor Who, when I was an awkward 13 year old girl who was interested in things that girls ""shouldn't"" be interested in and was ignored and cut out of a family that didn't understand me or encourage me. And now I feel like the things that I really connected with back then are being taken away, and it makes me really heartsick to see, and I don't know who to blame for it: the writers who put the words in the characters' mouths, the actor who refused to play the part unless a list of demands for the character's direction were met, or the fans that were so vitriolic and horrible about the things they didn't like.

2) Emergency Department Consultation

In addition there are things such as sexual health clinics, who treat both men and women but whose specialists often have a background of obs/gyn.

It's basically set up like this because it's more cost effective. GPs have broad training: As part of their training programme they have to take Senior House Officer posts in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Emergency Medicine, Paediatrics and Orthopaedics. Many will also hold a [DRCOG](https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/careers-training/drcog/). 

The common contraceptive options are well known and there usually is an agreed formulary between CCGs or health boards etc. that GPs will refer to when prescibing. If there is a problem with the common contraceptive methods then they would refer for a gynae opinion.

I will wait for waters to calm down and either buy stock or travel to scotland to buy some real estate. iScotland wont be better economically ,at least in the short term, but it is still a market of 5m people, with a gdp per capita of 45k us$ with around 40% of the population with tertiary education.

The Tories are already doing a good job at it and they've already privatised what they could get away with. We've seen some local police forces take on G4S staff, we've seen ATOS put in charge of assessing disability benefits and cocking that up so hard that it's irreversibly damaged their reputation as a company, and we've seen Royal Mail sold off as a private entity. He also tried to sell off Britain's forests. With the secret TTIP talks going on, the NHS and the health systems of other European nations could end up even more privatised too. 

David Cameron is like a parasite, sucking the country dry of any easily liquidated assets. If it weren't for the Lib Dems holding them back, Cameron would have probably done so much worse than he actually did.

&gt; ""Scotland will have a currency union with the pound,"" he says. Untrue.

This is the one point where I feel Alex Salmond is being delusional especially since one of his proposals was to supposedly make Scotland a tax haven. Unless he's willing to adopt the same interest rates as what the Bank of England sets, he will be on his own in that regard and a currency union would not be possible without a negative impact towards the United Kingdom.

&gt; ""Scotland will remain within the EU."" No chance.

[Brussels have clarified that if Scotland leaves the UK, it leaves the EU.](http://www.dw.de/independent-scotland-footloose-but-not-eu-free/a-17912094) However, there is very little stopping them from applying towards EU membership post-independence.

&gt; The English no longer have any power over the Scotch NHS and are so committed to heir own that they spend more on it than he does and made it a central point of that Olympics thing.

It's a bit of a myth that slavery is widespread in the region. The workers are low-paid, true, but generally they are there voluntarily and make a profit. [The Walk Free Foundation investigated this and estimated that around 0.2% of the working population are slaves](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/17/this-map-shows-where-the-worlds-30-million-slaves-live-there-are-60000-in-the-u-s/), and they include bonded labour and indentured servitude in their definition. Even one is too many of course but it is not as widespread as people tend to perceive. There are definitely problems with working conditions to resolve though.

&gt; Hundreds have died building stadiums for the Qatar World Cup.

In the interests of balance, note that [the organisers have stated that zero workers have died building the 2022 stadiums](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/13/us-soccer-forum-asia-qatar-idUSKBN0DT1I520140513). It seems far fetched but most of the work hasn't started yet so maybe it is not such a ludicrous claim. 

The assertion that workers are dying came from a report in the Guardian, who took the figures of all deaths of migrant workers in Qatar, which included deaths from natural causes.

&gt;Ed Miliband was forced to abandon a walkabout in Edinburgh after he became caught in a crush of media and pro-independence protesters, who drowned out his interviews with shouts of ""fucking liar"" and ""serial murderer"".

&gt;**A *small* group of yes activists** ran after reporters and TV crews who had gathered outside the centre as they were ushered inside to watch Miliband's walkabout, leading to chaotic scenes.

&gt;The activists began shouting loudly, drowning him out, and **adding to the *crush of photographers, reporters and Labour activists* who had gathered around Miliband, the Scottish Labour leader, Johann Lamont, and Margaret Curran, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary.**

&gt;Several attempts to meet shop workers had to be cut short amid the noise and crush, before Miliband was ushered out through a side exit, chased by a throng of news media and protesters.

&gt;Miliband's aides said the Labour leader had chatted with shop staff and voters for about five minutes inside the shopping centre, posing with several women for selfies, before the media had been invited in.

&gt;Miliband's spokesman said he was not fazed by the disturbances or the crush of media. ""It was a bit of a squeeze. We would have liked to have spoken to more actual voters,"" he said.

true,tardisrider613,tardis,TARDIS,"Yeah, there are a lot of missing episodes from Hartnell and (especially) Troughton, but in many cases you might have partial stories that remain--for example, *The Underwater Menace* is missing episodes 1 and 4, but episodes 2 and 3 are around. ''

Where to start with older Doctor Who? That answer is easy: Start at the beginning--*An Unearthly Child*. Just that first episode--you probably won't want to watch the rest of the cave man story. Then for Hartnell, move on to the second story *The Daleks* (Is it *the Daleks* or just *Daleks*? I can't remember off the top of my head and I'm too lazy to look it up right now, but whatever) and *Dalek Invasion of Earth*. Those will give you a good taste of Hartnell, and you can google around to learn which stories sound appealing to you. Personally, I like the historical stories (except for the Gunfighters) and *The Time Meddler*.

Patrick Troughton has the highest number of missing episodes, but among the episodes that still exist, I'd say you definitely need to watch *Tomb of the Cybermen* and *The Ice Warriors* (some episodes of that are missing, but they've been done in animated form) as well as *Web of Fear* and *The War Games*. 

Then you're into the Jon Pertwee era and there are no more missing episodes. It's hard for me to say which ones you should watch, as that might imply that there are some that you shouldn't watch, but for sure you should check out his first one *Spearhead from Space* as well as some with the Master like *Claws of Axos* or *The Daemons*, which Pertwee often said was his favourite episode. My personal opinion is that nobody but nobody could ever be the Master like Roger Delgado, but I'll let you form your own opinion on that. Great non-Masters stories include *The Sea Devils* and *The Time Warrior* and *Invasion of the Dinosaurs*.

Tom Baker has too many good stories to count--well, not literally, of course, but I'm getting tired of typing. Watch *Genesis of the Daleks*--which does indeed drag a bit, but is still fantastic--and *Pyramids of Mars* and *Robots of Death* and *Talons of Weng-Chiang* and *Ribos Operation* and *City of Death* and *Logopolis*.

And now I really am going to quit. But google a bit and see what sounds interesting and what other people recommend.

true,Jackisback123,null,null,"&gt; in the act of committing and indictable offence (resisting arrest and assaulting two police officers)

Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty is a *summary only* offence, as per [section 89(1)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) of the Police Act 1996. As such, there's no power of arrest under section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 19**8**4.

However, you're right in saying that assault with intent to resist arrest, as per [section 38](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100) of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, is an indictable offence, and so a person other than a constable has a power of arrest under S.24A PACE.

So, what powers could he have used?

##[Section 24(A)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
&gt; (2)Where an indictable offence has been committed a person other than a constable may arrest without a warrant
     
&gt; (a)anyone who is guilty of the offence;

There are some other criteria that need to be met, but for brevity (and because I know they would be met), I won't mention them here. If you'd like me to explain the whole section, feel free to ask and I will do.

##Common Law power of arrest to prevent a breach of the peace.

A breach of the peace occurs (as defined in R V Howell 1984) 

&gt; **whenever harm is actually done** or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed **through an assault**, an affray, a riot, unlawful assembly or other disturbance.

Any person can make an arrest where

&gt; (1) **a breach of the peace is committed in the presence of the person making the arrest or**

&gt; (2) the arrestor reasonably believes that such a breach will be committed in the immediate future by the person arrested although he has not yet committed any breach or

&gt; (3) where a breach has been committed and it is reasonably believed that a renewal of it is threatened

##Use of force - section 3 of the Criminal Law Act

[Section 3](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 says:

DO NOT reduce your investment in the sharesave scheme either, if at all possible. Check the rules of your scheme, but every one I have ever had allowed the cash to be retrieved instead of shares if the price moved the wrong way. It's a no lose bet.  

Track your ""net worth"" instead to help you feel much better about the situation. The credit side is your sharesave and debits are the credit card etc. Try and whittle away at the credit card side - well actually NO - unless psychologically you prefer to reduce it. Just do NOT let it increase - ever. 

Instead, put any possible spare cash into a savings account &amp; add it to the ""net worth"" spreadsheet.

We're going to need to change this in the second half somehow. Adyran seems like the only real game changer that we can bring on when I look at the bench, though. Sloth on for Bianchi or Austin would probably be an improvement, too. Maybe Byram could do something at a push, but we're definitely looking at needing some Brazilian flair if we're going to get back into this.

That said, actually playing forward-thinking passes and finding a teammate would be an improvement. So would not pumping balls in to the box for Sharp - who seems to be half the height of the Bournemouth defence - to try and defy gravity to have a chance at winning it.",0,1410896771,null,0,false,0,ckk5f40,t3_2gkyir,t1_ckk5f40,t3_2gkyir,null,1426980688,2,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,2

true,omgdave,null,null,"I can't speak for the Grad scheme, but I was on the Futures scheme some years back so elements of this are probably fairly applicable. I've been through a number of assessment centre sessions when I was applying to grad positions, and also been involved in some assessment centre exercises while at university, where people from IBM came in to run them; what I've written below seems fairly typical of my experiences and those of others I've spoken to.

My memory is a little hazy as I've been through four years of university and I've since been working in the real world, but what I remember is that the assessment day had five sessions to it (FWIW I was applying for a technical role on the Futures scheme, so the more business-orientated candidates may have had some different experiences):

* **one-to-one technical interview**: we talked about technical experience, interests, things which bugged me about technology, where I thought things might go, what I wanted to get out of my career, etc. The chap I spoke to was someone I actually knew of from one of the mailing lists I followed, so that was an interesting experience.

* **one-to-one business/ interview**: went through those ""give me an example of a time where you've *verbed* a *noun*"" kind of questions, talked about previous jobs, etc, talked about future career direction, and so on

* **group teamwork exercise**: our exercise required us to use ""materials"" to build something, with the goal to maximise the size of the building and minimise the amount of material needed. Not much to say about this really as I didn't really enjoy it and IIRC our team didn't do so well.

* **group decision making exercise**: from a list of things, we had to pick the five most important and justify them. This is looking at how well you can articulate your own opinion on the importance of something compared with someone else's thing, but also looking at how you can react and respond when people disagree with you. Do you fight for your thing unwaveringly? Do you just shrivel up and resign your opinion to the pit of insignificance? Do you take onboard other peoples' opinions and use them to enhance and augment your own, where you might ultimately decide in fact that what you thought was important, is not as important as the other things in the list.

* **aptitude test**: essentially re-doing the thing you've probably done online at home. I guess it's to make sure that it was actually you who sat the test online, rather than someone else on your behalf. 

I hope this helps you somewhat. I loved my year at IBM; it really helped set me up for the career which seems to be unfolding at the moment, and set me off with some very high expectations. I really believe I wouldn't be in the job I have right now were it not for that year (I also did a placement year at another tech company, but that was more hardware focused and hence less relevant to my current role in software engineering).

Some were 6 episodes, and there were even a few that were more--8 to 12 episodes. So when you think about Hartnell for example, you could say he was in about 29 stories spread out over 139 episodes. At least that's the tally listed on wikipedia; even if it's wrong, you get the picture, I think. 

Some of the earliest stories had individual titles for each episode, but theywere clearly parts of the same story. So if you get the DVD for an old first or second Doctor story like ""The Daleks"", each individual episode will have a different title, but they're all clearly one story--just like chapters in a book that make up one story. After a while, they all just used one story name, but each episode would just have the part number. So if you watch a six part story like ""Genesis of the Daleks"" the individual episodes are ""Genesis of the Daleks, Part 1"" followed by ""Genesis of the Daleks, Part 2"" followed by ""Genesis of the Daleks, Part 3"" etc on up to six. Sometimes they said ""Part 1"" and sometimes they said ""Episode 1"", but whatever.

Remember: the 'true question' being sought in this indyref is not Scotland versus Westminster. Or Scotland versus England as how some people perceive the SNP campaign, i do not disagree with this. It is actually a matter of big government vs little government. Westminster vs Holyrood, Westminster vs Senedd, Westminster vs Stormont, and of course Westminster vs London Assembly.

What we need are state's being formed over more homogeneous cultural regions through out the Untied Kingdom. This would have to think about how England is being administered. Such states would have to replace some local government for greater devolution to work, that is replace some council services with combined state services. 

For example of and idea of UK states are: Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, North East England, North West England, East England, Cornwall, South West England, South East England, West Midlands, East Midlands, East England, and of course London.

You could be arrested for possessing a cricket bat in public if they suspected you were carrying it as a weapon, eg if you were swinging it around on the high street on a Saturday night.

Machetes, throwing stars, flick knives etc are automatically classed as weapons because there is no legitimate reason to be carrying them in public, so no requirement to prove intent.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"8 hours a day plus 7 overtime. Let's assume the basic pay is today's adult national minimum wage, £6.31, and overtime is time and a half, £9.465. For one day, he should have been paid  £116.735 (one hundred and sixteen pounds, seventy three and a half pence). Assuming no days off at all, that's £42,608.275 per annum, for a normal year, or £42,725.01 for a leap year.

There were three leap years in the time he was enslaved - 2004, 2008 and 2012. So the total is £554,257.78 for exactly thirteen years.

But that doesn't account for annual leave entitlement. Full time workers in the UK are entitled to 28 days paid holiday. Full time is taken as 40 hours per week for this calculation. He worked 105 hours per week, which is 262.5% full time, entitling 73.5 paid days leave at 8 hours a day, for 588 hours worth of work. If we go by 15 hour days at 28 day annual leave, it's 420 hours of work, though; I'm going with the former version as the latter doesn't account for the overtime. 588 hours at £6.31 is £3,710.28 per year. Thirteen years worth of that comes to £48,233.64.

Adding the hours worked and the annual leave comes to **£602,491.42** owed. Not counting deducibles like tax and national insurance.

Now, a quick tax calculator on the annual salary figures (not including annual leave reimbursement, I don't know if that would be counted as an expense or as takehome pay so I'm not including it) tells me that he'd pay:

* For normal years (calculated using this tax year): £6,670 income tax and £4,083 in National Insurance.

* For leap years (calculated using 2011-12 tax year): £7,102 income tax and £4,236 in National Insurance.

So that leaves an annual income of:

* For normal years: £31,855.275

* For leap years: £31,387.01.

So taking all that into account, after tax and national insurance has been deducted (using 2013-14 and 2011-12 tax rates, so save me doing it for every single year), the total comes to:

**£460,947.42**

That's just pay, minus tax and NI, plus annual leave reimbursement. That doesn't account for compensation for being enslaved and cut off from family and being denied medical care, etc.

So the way I see it, these people should be paying him that amount (plus compensation), and they should be paying the government £141,544 in unpaid tax and national insurance on his behalf.",0,1410897875,null,0,false,0,ckk62cu,t3_2gk09w,t1_ckk62cu,t1_ckjwjnc,null,1426980386,55,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,55

true,Murumasa,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,"I'm sorry to say but you are somewhat naive. No one has ever entered politics who didn't want to gain power. Whether they want to use that power to benefit those they care about, or are egomaniacs, all of them want control. Today there are very few non career politicians in most parliaments and governments around the world. The point of politics is to win the game of politics; power in the last few decades has not been dispersed amongst the people but concentrated in those already powerful elites.

You don't have to hate politicians. But 'their own gain' is the entire purpose of the system. Some choose money and when they leave politics move into the private sector, some fight for an ideology, some just want to be the person on top. They all want a 'better' country but as we don't all just demand a egalitarian society (and even if we did it would only take one person who wanted more to destroy it) then all they do is support their own interested parties, whether that be neo-liberal pro corperate politicians or left wing liberal pro a strong state politicians. 

Though I agree that the 'nicest, most moral, clever person in the country' would be hated, because they have to make decisions that often half the population finds egregious. Why do you come from a position that they could be politically neutral, there are  no politically neutral issues even for those populist ideas that have the majority of support by the general public.

The Department for Work and Pensions declared that Mr Simester had not been actively looking for work whilst he was recovering in hospital from 13 years of slavery. The Prime Minister has been said to support the decision, calling Mr Simester a ""scrounger"".""*

*""The trial of the Messrs Doran has been suspended indefinitely today as it was revealed Mr Simester has been unable to afford to pay for the trial in its entirety. This is due to the Government declaring that it is little more than an employment tribunal which, due to a recent change of law, must be paid for by the offended party. The Cabinet today unanimously supported putting Mr Simester to work at Cariad Farm under the Workfare scheme.

This may be what happens when people who don't normally interact with the democratic process do so, but it damn well isn't the way it should be.

&gt;Its not like you are going to get punched in the face for voting no.

You really don't understand that the Yes campaigners have genuinely intimidated the No's by their actions, do you? Whether you want to call that ""wet"" or not I don't care, I don't want a brick through my window.

&gt;I know it isn't as bad as people have been reporting for one simple reason, for the last week we have had television cameras everywhere and there has been exactly zero footage filmed of people being violent due to this referendum.

The sheer volume of vandalism which has been carried out is enough to tell me that a lot of people on both sides are very much exhibiting mob behaviour and not mature democratic spirit.

&gt;So please stop trying to dampen or make it seem as if what is happening in Scotland is a bad thing

It's a fucking terrible thing, we're never going to be able to put this back in the box. The genie is out of the bottle and that can't be undone.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Ireland isn't part of the Schengen, due to being part of the EU before it was implemented. This means we don't need a border.

That Ireland isn't part of Schengen doesn't address the previous two claims, which were:

* If Scotland wants open borders with rUK, it will have to allow rUK to dictate its immigration policies and its border controls (Ireland has an open border, yet doesn't have its immigration policy dictated to by the UK).
* Open access to a foreign country come independence would be completely insane (except that's exactly what the situation is with Ireland).

&gt; It's gonna be difficult for Scotland to stay out of the Schengen area

Scotland's only land border would be with another non-Schengen country, and that country's only other land border is also with another non-Schengen country. Granting Scotland an opt-out from Schengen would make absolutely no difference to anyone else in the EU.

I think by far the most plausible outcome is that Scotland would simply be part of the [CTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area) rather than Schengen, and all three countries on the British Isles would remain outside Schengen together.",0,1410898506,null,0,false,0,ckk6ffw,t3_2gk15p,t1_ckk6ffw,t1_ckk0bl6,null,1426980216,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Take a random sample of individuals aged 90+ and show them a picture of someone who isn't white and ask them what they are looking at. I can guarantee you the majority will give you an answer that you, and most other, would consider politically incorrect in modern society.

My SO's Grandad calls them ""darkies"". My grandpa used the n word all the time. There's no malice though, it's just they got taught that they are acceptable words to use, and old habits die hard.

There's nothing wrong or immoral with that - they genuinely can't help it. If your grandparents are 90+ years old and 100% politically correct all the time, then I assure you, they are in the minority.

Implying an old person is a horrible or racist individual because they say something politically incorrect by modern standards is on par with calling them stupid or horrible or lazy for being incontinent.

It sometimes gives us something to direct our anger at, at the thought that there is a politician in power trying to ruin the country. Fact is though, any of the 3 'main party' leaders would do what they think is best for the country. None of them are out to destroy it. History judges them more by their faults than their achievements. 

I don't like Cameron as the PM, but compared to Clegg and Miliband, there is a certain strength to him that the other two are lacking. He cuts too deep though. We all knew that we needed *some* cut's for the deficit, but when you see the military being cut, and front line policing being cut, and perhaps most annoyingly of all, places like hospitals and care homes being brought down, that is some bad politics. 


I voted Lib Dems during the last general election (which is funny considering I am now leaning in favour of UKIP). My first thought when Clegg and Cameron joined in the coalition was 'oh, Clegg has some power, this could be good'. But of course he basically fizzed out into obscurity and irrelevance. There's also the fact that he is heavily into the European Union. I would like to leave it but the fact that Labour and Lib Dems wouldn't even offer a referendum because they are afraid that the public might give them the wrong answer results in a big loss of respect from me. 


Then of course, there is Ed Miliband. 
&gt;Miliband looks like he'd have trouble turning on a radiator, never mind run the country.


&gt;Miliband looks like his only experience outside politics was in a nappy.

Thanks to the people who posted those comments. That's twice now that I've cleared my nose reading this thread :P


I can't take Miliband seriously. I know there is more to politics than just looks, but he is not a person I could rally behind. I mean seriously, if something major ever happened, such as a WW3 breaking out and Miliband were to address the nation, could you really take him seriously?


Every time I see him out on the street meeting people, even if people are nice to him, he looks like he doesn't want to be there. Like a fish out of water. I know what I am saying sounds shallow, and indeed to some degree it is, but I like leaders to have charisma.

When people choose to believe well reasoned critique of how it just doesn't work that way are called ignorant is laughable. 

And who exactly thinks that the bankers were stupid? Most think they were incredibly smart, they played the game and won, they got their profits, bonuses and often kept their jobs. They did this by knowing how to play and abuse the market. If you don't think that's possible in the post-independence world of somewhat keeping the pound in its current form then you're asking for it really. 

The international markets have the potential to take Sterling (or the Scots Pound) to the cleaners depending on what happens.

He may have some differences to his personality, appearance, and approach, but ""suddenly verbally abusive borderline autistic"" doesn't fit with any of the regeneration patterns that we've seen. 

Add to that the fact that he's not being playful by any stretch. He has told Clara that she's ugly, stupid, incapable of solving problems, over-emotional, pointless, and childish. Every episode I watch is like going back to that teenage girl that I used to be who was constantly being torn down by the people who were supposed to support her. And maybe I've taken the message a little more closely to heart than some others, but the message that ""Different Isn't Bad"" and ""Intelligent Is Admirable"" is something that literally kept me going some years, and it's the message that was - for a long time - at the heart of the show and was the actual answer to the question ""Doctor Who?"" We may not know his name, but we knew who he was and what he stood for, and it was always compassion and problem-solving, and caring and friendship and love winning against all odds. Now it's just a mean man saying horrible things to the person in the show that's supposed to represent the fans, and taking special care to point out all of the ways that he thinks he's better and therefore unattainable and not for you. It hurts the girl inside my 34 year old body that felt ugly and stupid and slow and unlovable to have a character that has gotten me through some really dark times speak with the voice of all of those people who were so awful to me.

I am English by the way, so view that how you will.

Now there is no doubt in my mind that the whole campaign has been a shambles, and that the referendum should have been about a large majority, not 50.1 vs 49.9, but there are all sorts of things wrong with the whole shebang. However, should the votes be cast in favour of independence then so be it. Where I stand is this: an independent Scotland would force the rUK electorate into some sort of action. It would force the major parties into reform of some description, possibly back to their original *raison d'etre* (in the case of the Labour Party, at least) and hopefully into a decentralisation, where local groups and councils can work properly, where local people can go to local shops...

    stop that

Well, hopefully you get my drift. Regional boroughs and councils are hamstrung by Westminster, who have become increasingly irrelevent outside of the M25. Scotland's independence should (not necessarily will, though: I grant you that) prompt Westminster into giving localities more clout and power to act independently.

My dream is to have the House of Lords abolished, and replaced with non-party affiliated people. Whether or not they are voted in is neither here nor there, what is key is that they should have no political (or otherwise) agenda: as non-partisan as possible. I feel that a Scots vote of Yes may contribute to such a change. And, as I've pointed out in a different discussion, I don't feel that Scottish independence necessarily means the break up of the UK, just a means to modernisation for the collective nations.

The rest of the defense did well for the most part, the opponents had some great chances but our midfield didn't make the same chances do to being under pressure, I felt the midfield should have done more to give the defense cover.


Balo and now Borini are players who will play their part this season, they will work well with our pressing system. Lallana and Sterling showed some glimpses of their quality, but they were a bit off tonight with some of their passing and last touch.


Migs has improved a lot, he tries more and passes from the back more, but coming off his line to open the goal isn't one of them. He really needs to stay a bit conservative when the ball is under the control of the striker.

However, (and I must stress this is poking into the future therefore could not happen) the change won't come about. 

If Scotland leaves, a progressive Labour Government will not be able to exact these changes (Predictions are the next Government will be Labour but based on Scottish MPs). As the Government will be Right wing, this will push David Cameron out and a more right-wing Eurosceptic Leader in. This makes change a lot harder. Therefore, if people want to change Westminster they need to vote No. That's the only sure fire way for getting change. (The Government will end up being right wing as England normally votes more right wing)

Devolution is a tricky business, it needs to be done right, or it will lead to the fracturing of England

(Personally I see Devolution as the UK going back in time, back to when we had separate Kingdoms I.e. Wessex and Mercia)

I do have to agree with you, the whole Referendum has been done shockingly, by both sides- Alex Salmond has just pissed off the English and gone all Brave heart (Great job Alex, we really live in the Medieval times) on everyone. The Better Together camp has had chance after chance to nail the independence side coffin down, but Allistar Darling was a poor choice (I'm 18 and I feel I could have done a better job than him xD). Overall, its made me feel ashamed as being British and more proud in being English.

(Oh and the only way being English will matter in this, is when as I have said before, the Negotiations happen, that's going to be a real test on Salmond's character and views- He's not facing a few people, he's facing the emotions of an entire nation)

1) The English voting bloc isn't vastly different. FPTP exaggerates differences, the left wing vote in Southern England is remarkably split between Labour and Lib Dems, and the SNP's nationalism uniquely appeals to ex-Tories. With all the odds in their favour, the Conservatives in England would barely have scraped a majority in 2010. The Tories are still the nasty party.

2) Miliband won't destroy the NHS. Labour have pledged to repeal the Health and Social Care bill and support exemption for the NHS from TTIP. Despite the hyperbole and spin, New Labour did *not* privatise the NHS. This is pushed very heavily by the right wing as a way of neutralising the issue, but objectively it's just not true.

3) The oil is a lightning rod for nationalism. The rest of the UK has or has had plenty of finite resources that are being or have been expended. Scotland has done well out of the union. If you think that Scotland can't survive without the oil, if the oil is *that* important... well, it's going to run out anyway, so Scotland will need to be in a union of some kind that can help it when there's no oil left.

My biggest concern is that the nationalists have poisoned the well; that we'll see a rise in nationalism all across the country. Civic or not, nationalism is bad.",0,1410901671,null,0,false,0,ckk89c9,t3_2glamx,t1_ckk89c9,t3_2glamx,null,1426978528,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

true,Danspencer95,Churchill,Churchill,"Hi there, I'm about to start my second year of the Natural Science tripos, having done both Physics and Chemistry in the first. I'll pass on any knowledge I can.
It is yes true that physics is 'harder' than chemistry in first year, in no small part due to the chemistry lecturing being brilliant and the physics lecturing pretty awful (this is a widely held view for first year).
Physics is similar to A-Level in the sense that if you can just do it, you'll not have to put as much work in as to Chemistry, but I didn't know anyone that this was the case for due to the step up.
Chemistry at Uni *can* be about regurgitation *sort of*, but university exams try to remove this, they want to test your understanding of the subject, not your memory. Despite this, I found putting a lot of time into physics had less of an effect on ability than doing so in chemistry.
Bottom line, you got in to Cambridge, you'll be fine in whichever you pick. If you're not a supreme physics God, Chemistry will probably make your life easier, but if you have a burning love for Physics, then take that!
Lastly about the lectures being full of brainboxes. Yes, they're in every subject, just quietly resent them like everyone else does!

You do know that Eric Holder used to be a partner in a major law firm for Goldman Sachs?

The deals I have heard about have been no admittance of guilt and a trivial share holder fine (as per the cases cited in the NY Times article you posted). The fines are far less than the profits that were made from the criminal activity and if something is profitable it will expand.

The NY Times often overstates the scale of the fine - often they are tax deductible or are not the actual monetary amounts - the banks are getting benefits in kind from how the money is used.

It very much sounds like you are very much part of the process and ignorant of what really goes on. People within the process often live in their own little bubble and never read alternative viewpoints. This was and still is a very common problem within the investment banking world, the political world and the government bureaucrat world.

Almost all of the investment bankers I've spoken with are extremely ignorant about how the current financial, monetary and banking systems actually work. Only a very few people at the very top are actually in the know. People like Lloyd Blankfein, Jamie Dimon and Hank Paulson.

If you work at the SFO or the FSA there is a very high probability of your being extremely ignorant about banking too. They certainly don't teach their employees about it, so the only way you would know is if you spent your own time researching it.

Having said all this Mignolet is not a bad keeper, Just unbalanced and weak, Lovren is not a bad CB just poor positionally (fairly vital for a CB though) and Lallana is not a bad player at all just incredibly overpriced, a bit overrated and hard to fit in our system well (he works best in front of two great DMs like at Southampton so he's central and free to roam/press).

At Barca everyone gravitates towards the ball, which is why you'll notice Cesc always chasing the ball. The way we close the ball down is when the ball enters a specific player's area, that player is become active and closes the ball down. 

For example, when the opposition team's RDM has the ball and passes it to their RM/RW, Matic, Hazard and Oscar would become active, and Cesc would not need to close the space down as much and you'd see Schurrle/Willian on the right wing staying on the right wing. 

Barca's system is so fluid that everyone close to the ball would be required to close it down while those not near the ball would act as cover for the players who are now out of position trying to win the ball back.

Its a subtle difference but it is extremely important in today's game. Its pretty much why we are able to ""park the bus"" while Barca would have a very tough time doing it.",0,1410902445,null,0,false,0,ckk8oav,t3_2gjpnq,t1_ckk8oav,t1_ckjr99l,null,1426977269,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

Most teams would have been happy to sit back at 1-0 and take the win, but we were only spurred on by the goal, as though we were at the end of the first half instead of the second. I am not convinced it's as big an issue as many seem to fear however, after all Villa had basically that one chance all game and Ludo had a total of two shots on target. We need to give Lovren and Sakho more time together, though I am still not convinced on Mignolet and hope Valdes comes in. We also need to adapt to people looking to catch our fullbacks out of position and hitting us on the counter, but that was always going to be a problem once people saw the attacking we demonstrated last season.

Edit: one more thing to add; in my view we are in a good position right now. Yes, teams know the way we want to play now and so have had to adjust to that - twice in a row we have seen teams that came to Anfield with very specific game plans. This is a good thing, it shows that instead of teams being able to play against us the way they *want* to play, we are forcing them to play a certain way to try to nullify our threat. So far it has worked well, though injuries have been a factor - City sat back and gave us possession and looked to break, Villa took their chance from a set piece, Ludogrets made us work very hard for the win and were probably unlucky not to draw, but when teams play us and try to play *their* way, a la Spurs, we show our quality.

Ireland was largely built and stabalized by transfer payments from the EU budget during times when the EU was a friendlier, wealthier, more generous place. Nobody in France and Germany and the UK has the appetite to fund or stabilise an experiment in Scottish independence. That appetite was there with respect to Ireland. It won't be there for Scotland. Because the times are over --- nothing to do with Scotland, nothing personal. Just foolish timing on Mr. Salmond's part. 10 years ago, yes, Now, no. That's what is not being said when Mr. Salmond announces he is in ""negotiation"" with the  EU. With EU who ? Italy? Nobody cares. What are the major funding nations of the EU saying? What is Angela Merkel saying? And that's the scary part. Her electorate is in no mood for even one Euro of uncertainty over German taxes in respect of Scotland. The UK would not want to pay for it. France cannot. If there are trouble, it would likely be perceived that Scotland invited those upon itself deliberately --- not worth bailing out. Consequently one would find that negotiations around EU entry would stipulate to this effect up front and impose severe austerity conditions. I find it incredible that anyone would, off their free will, want to trade the UK for ""the Troika.""

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Firstly, the UK does to some extent dictate Ireland's immigration policies through the CTA

The CTA is a mutual agreement between Ireland and the UK. Both countries are free to pursue their own immigration policies as they see fit, and both operate quite different policies (Ireland uses a skills-based system rather than the UK's point-based approach).

&gt; Ireland actually wants to join Schengen, but can't because they have no borders with the UK.

Given that the UK isn't in Schengen, why would Ireland feel any need to join? The land border with the UK is the only thing that would be affected.

&gt; And open access to someone who isn't in the CTA is madness, as it makes the UK's immigration policies useless.

The CTA, and to a large extent Schengen, deal with cross-border travel by foot or by car within the EU. They are about simplifying freedom of movement within the British Isles/EU, not restricting entry into the British Isles/EU.

It is not an ""open door"" immigration policy, nor does it prevent immigration checks at airports or ports.

&gt; While Scotland getting into the CTA is a possibility, we have to remember that the EU has changed a lot since the original addition of the opt outs: The EU has been far less tolerant of countries getting opt-outs, and to just give one to a new country would be setting a precedent that the EU doesn't want.

While opt-outs aren't handed out on demand I think the EU is an extremely pragmatic organisation (hence the development of things like '[enhanced cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_cooperation)').

Scotland receiving an opt-out for Schengen would make absolutely no difference to anyone else in the EU, whereas requiring Scotland to adopt Schengen would only affect the rUK.

I think it's extremely probable that a Scotland which was willing to forgo the UK's other opt-outs would easily get a Schengen opt-out in exchange.

&gt; Now if this was the only thing Scotland was looking to keep that would probably be managable, but with Scotland also wanting to do a bunch of other stuff the EU doesn't like (Like keeping the pound), it's gonna be one long hard battle in a series of long hard battles.

The EU does not require countries to drop their national currency prior to joining. It requires new members to make a commitment to joining the Euro however there is no required timetable [for adoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2gk15p/spanish_warn_independent_scotland_would_get_euro/ckjuo4d).

true,TheAmazingJPie,null,null,"I am from Rotherham, I know people involved I the police department, and I want to have a say before this turns into a shitstorm. 

Firstly, I am glad he is gone. No matter how good or bad at has job he is, the gratification he can give to the victims by standing down outweighs what he can do in his role.

Now, I propose a question. Has anyone here actually read the report? If you have, great. I support what ever judgement you hold. If not google 'Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham' You can download it as a PDF. 

Notice the word exploitation and not rape, abuse or assault. The majority of these cases involve people who have been failed by multiple people leading into the position that they *want to be used in this way*. It gives them emotional support that tey don't receive elsewhere. They have been failed first and foremost their own parents. Who are probably white British citizens (Thanks BNP, EDL etc. for making it impossible to get around the town for the past month.). Once this happens they are moved into care homes who *cannot* provide enough support for them because either they are overcrowded or lack the resources (Care workers do a wonderful service to our country but they aren't superhuman.). These victims break out of their homes to go and see these people because they want to do so. Hence 'exploitation' and not 'abuse'.

Next, I want to express the opinion of a family member in the police force:

I don't like the PCC and I don't agree with everything he does but he is very good at managing the resources of the force which is helping to improve us and get from where we were four years ago, on the end of a sex scandal, to being a police force with some of the best training and resources to combat sex offences.

Lastly, I'd like to address Rotherham as a whole. It's not a great place and probably never will be. However, having lived here for 9 years now, the rate at which the whole town has grown is spectacular; the infrastructure is much smoother, cleaner and   nicer to use than ever before. People I've seen have sledged Rotherham on here and 5 or 6 years ago I'd have believed them but not now.

He scored a whopping 2 goals for us while here, both of which did not affect the result of the games they were scored in. However, the reason I *really* think he was our worst player was his performance in our [3-1 defeat to League Two Shrewsbury Town](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14539194) in the League Cup. This was not that long after signing for us, and he was utterly hopeless and outmatched by players apparently three divisions worse than himself. I actually traveled up to that game, and I couldn't believe how badly it went. The team was poor but Lita was amateurish, losing possession constantly and offering zero threat in attack.

Now, I've watched the Swans in all four divisions. Lita is without a doubt the worst player we've had *compared to our standing at the time*.

true,Matt-SW,null,null,"&gt; right, so, you don't seem to understand that I am a completely legal driver. I am not some outlier here. Literally anyone who is at any stage from getting a provisional license and insurance to having 60 years of experience driving is allowed on the roads. If you are seriously suggesting that someone who has just passed their test should be allowed to drive at whatever speed they think is acceptable, you're insane.

Wow. At what point did you jump from me pointing out your lack of actual driving experience to suddenly condoning people driving at whatever speeds they like? At what point did I say ""driving experience means that you can drive at whatever speed you like?"" Pretty big jump there.

My point, that sailed quite astonishingly over your head, is that being able to judge every element of a road's condition and other factors is not something that just immediately becomes apparent after passing your test, or even in the immediate solo driving hours that follow. The fact that you latched on so hastily to the idea that a non-functioning speedometer suddenly turns a person into a dangerous driver is possibly one of the most absurd things I've heard in the speed limit debate. I'm not even saying this to try and score cheap points - I'm being completely serious. No competent driver with any modicum of *actual* driving experience would suddenly become inexplicably dangerous without knowing **exactly** what speed they were travelling at. If you can't sit in a car, travel at a unknown speed, look around and ahead and judge whether or not the speed you're travelling at is safe to do so, you should definitely not be on the road. I know for an absolute fact that I could go about my daily business without a speedometer, with absolutely no change to the high level of safety and awareness I put into my driving.

&gt; You want to insult me just because you think you're ryan gosling? go ahead, but bear in mind that you're arguing that I'm not a good enough driver to be allowed to drive without speed limits

This again? At what point did I make *any* correlation between the experience of a driver and whether or not they should follow a speed limit? Remember, we're discussing raising an actual limit, and whether current limits are 'correct,' so to speak, and not driver experience versus 'safe speeds' to travel at.

&gt; Oh really? No shit, people don't intentionally crash. I am so dumb, clearly if people don't want to crash they just won't, because everyone has perfect judgement. That must be why there are zero road accidents ever.

You've missed the point. Again.

An inexperienced or 'bad' driver is one who either makes a bad judgement call or causes a RTA through carelessness. Often, a speed related crash happens because someone didn't judge a situation properly, not simply because they were going too fast. You could have someone travelling at 300/70/80/140, but if someone is going to pull out on them point blank, both drivers have made an error. The driver pulling out either failed to look/see the oncoming driver, or the oncoming driver completely misjudged the road / was acting injudiciously. 

Don't get me wrong, there are absolute idiots out there who will push cars to their limits and will drive with a complete and utter disregard for other people, but these are not to be confused with simply 'speeding' drivers.

&gt; You're trolling at this point. There's no way you aren't. I give you a fucking direct link to someone saying they would drive dangerously fast on a road, and you're so blind to the possibility your vast driving brain could be wrong about anything ever, that you just pretend it doesn't exist.

I haven't pretended that the article doesn't exist, I'm pointing out that Clarkson's argument is that a number of roads have unnecessarily low limits. He may or may not be wrong based on **this** specific example of a road, but he's right in the general scheme of things. If the M1 Northbound (and I say Northbound because I can rarely get to J4-1 without hitting traffic/congestion heading Southbound) is light, dry and quiet, there's no reason I can't push my car a bit further. I would never argue for ridiculous speeds like I've heard of some people being convicted of, but if I know I can stop in time, and conditions are good, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to go faster. The Government even considered increasing the limit to 80mph on motorways, but backed out for some vague reason of various pieces of road quality, and not down to driver safety.

&gt; and most of them judge the right speed by what the limit is set at.

Chicken and egg. I'm heading into NW London tomorrow. I'll set cruise at 70 and, if the road isn't **as** congested as it usually is, I'll show you exactly how many people pass me on the dashcam.

&gt; What you're going to be doing now, and in the next reply to me, is changing your argument from ""all drivers everywhere should be able to drive at what they think is the fastest safe speed possible for every road"", to ""some people can safely drive 10mph faster than the limit on wide, safe, multiple lane dual carriageway""...

It's like... you're psychic! At what point did I say drivers everywhere should be able to drive at any speed they deem safe on any road? Yes, I said that current limits are arbitrary numbers, but that doesn't mean they're *always* wrong. 

&gt; Then you're going to pretend that you never said ""Speed limits have nothing to do with safe driving, and are simply an arbitrary number everyone aims"" that you're not commenting on an article written about one of the roads not in the categories that you're refining your argument down to, and that you aren't claiming that a motorist's opinion on what the speed should be is just as safe as a speed limit.

Again, you some inane ability to jump to the most extreme interpretation of something said. I don't **know** the road in question, and neither do you, but I believe whole-heartedly that if he could see far enough ahead and wanted to go faster, then slow when the risk of an obstruction increased (such as a junction or a tight bend) he should be able to.

I wouldn't hate Scotland, but if Scotland does leave the UK, our relationship changes.

If Scotland does go its own way, the rest of the UK and the Westminster Parliament, no longer would have any duty or responsibility for looking after Scotland's economic or other interests.

So Scotland can't expect the rest of the UK to go out of our way to help Scotland. We shouldn't do things to help Scotland, if they cost us money. For example, we should lend Scotland money on easy terms, or to continue to support Scottish-based banks, for example.

Scotland's NHS may be safe in Scotland's hands, but I wouldn't expect the Scottish NHS to make use of specialist heart or cancer centres which are only available in England, without paying commercial rates.

I wouldn't expect Scotland to get BBC content (apart from BBC Scotland that is) without paying commercial rates for it. Oh yes, and iplayer should be blocked in Scotland too (just like it is in the USA), as Scotland should be paying BBC World to watch BBC programs.

And Scotland and the rest of the UK would now become economic competitors.

So, for example, if rUK can attract companies and businesses and investors to relocate from Scotland to the rest of the UK, we would do it - just as we currently try to attract companies and investors from other parts of the world to relocate to the UK.

Actually we can do that with people too. There is already something of a brain drain of Scotland's best and brightest to London and the Southeast now (because of financial incentives and other reasons), but we should start trying to actively encourage it, as its in our economic interest.

You Scots don't seem to like the banks threatening to relocate from Edinburgh? At the moment, they're threatening to, maybe with a degree of political posturing, and maybe with some real concerns. But if Scotland leaves the UK, we should actively try to encourage them to relocate from Edinburgh to the city of London. We'll give them tax breaks, cheap office space in the world's biggest financial centre, and they'll be close to the world's biggest transport hub in Heathrow. They'll have a home market of 60 million, instead of 5 million. And they will be financially be backed by one of the world's largest central banks, the Bank of England, rather than whatever much smaller reserves a new Scottish central bank might be able to cobble together.  And that means more money and economic growth for the rUK.

And if we can attract tourists to come to London or Cornwall or North Wales or the Lake District, instead of Scotland, we should do that too.

And if we can buy oil &amp; natural gas cheaper from UAE or Oman than Scotland, we should do that too.

If these things costs jobs &amp; prosperity in the Scotland, well that will be sad, but we'll do it anyway, because we no longer have any responsibility to support jobs &amp; prosperity in Scotland. Our sole responsibility is to maximize jobs &amp; prosperity in the rest of the UK.

Like I said, I don't want these things done to spite Scotland - far from it - but simply because they would now be a separate country, and the rUK government's responsibility is to maximize the prosperity of the rUK, even if costs our competitors (including now Scotland).


In summary, I don't want to treat an independent Scotland badly or go out of our way to hurt an independent Scotland, but neither would I expect us to treat Scotland better than any other foreign country.  

The responsibility of the rUK government will be to the people of rUK, not to people of foreign countries, even ones that we used to be associated with, be they Cyprus, Malta, or Scotland.


And P.S. 

If Scotland repudiates its share of the debt,  I'm not averse to the rUK government removing every current UK government asset (which the debt paid for) North of the border, before granting independence.

If two individuals bought a house together, and took out a joint mortgage, and one of them subsequently repudiated any further mortgage payments, he couldn't reasonably expect to keep using share of the house. The same applies to UK government assets in Scotland, whether they are Eurofighters, government computer systems, air traffic control systems, or whatever.

EDIT: Their rarity can't be stressed enough. Cabaye's an ""average"" deep lying playmaker and he's still pretty great on his day. Think Xavi, Pirlo, and at a push, Scholes. They're legendary players because the act of linking defense to attack takes serious vision to pick out a great pass. Barring a sweeper, I think filling a DLP slot for any side might be a hard ask.

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Salmond and accept that he is the greatest politician the world has ever known, even greater than Winston Churchill!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, Tory Unionist who had served 1500 years in Westminster and understood the necessity of the United Kingdom and fully supported all decision made by the British Parliament stood up and held up an orange sash.

”How was the United Kingdom formed, Jock?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite drunkenly and smugly replied “through the oppression of the free-born men of Scotland, you stupid Sassenach”

”Wrong. It’s been 300 years since the Act of Union. If it was formed through the conquest of Scotland, as you say, and we are a democracy … then Scotland should be independent by now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of The Complete Works of Robert Burns. He stormed out of the room crying those Scottish crocodile tears. The same tears Scots cry for “gàidhlig” (which today is spoken by so little people that the language is virtually dead) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth to pay for pointless additional lettering on road signs. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Jock McAngus, wished he had been born English and become more than a sophist nationalist intellectual. He wished so much that he had could find solace in the community of British nations, but he himself had argued against it!

The students applauded and all voted No in the independence referendum that day and accepted David Cameron as their duly elected leader. A lion named “Britannia” bounded into the room and perched atop the Union Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. Rule Britannia was sung several times, and the Queen herself showed up and abolished the Scottish Parliament.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the heart failure from too many fried Mars bars and Alex Salmond was executed for treason.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"I am going to choose one or two for each Doctor since it is really hard to pinpoint one for his entire life cycle.

First Doctor: 

The Edge of Destruction (this is where he really starts to warm to Ian and Barbara and owns up to his mistakes) or The Dalek Invasion of Earth (where he really commits himself to fighting evil and sees of his granddaughter Susan so she can have her own life)

Second Doctor:

Tomb of the Cybermen (especially the moment when he comforts Victoria in contrast to his dealings with the Cybermen) and The War Games (where we get a better idea of his relationship with his own people and how far he will go to save the day regarding the big picture)

Third Doctor:

Probably Planet of the Spiders (where the Doctor has to face his fears of death/regeneration and the consequences of his own greed) although the Three Doctors deserves a mention for the fact that we get to see how the Doctor sees himself for the first time.

Fourth Doctor: 

Genesis of the Daleks (where the Doctor confronts his own morality) although

Fifth Doctor: 

The Caves of Androzani (after all the death and suffering he witnessed we see how far the Doctor will go to save someone regarding the small picture)

Sixth Doctor: 

The Mysterious Planet (where we actually get to see a bit of the Sixth Doctor's compassion for Peri and how they could be friends despite his rude arrogant exterior) It's just too bad they couldn't continue this characterization in the rest of Trial of the Time Lord and killed Peri off.

Seventh Doctor: 

The Curse of Fenric (shows how far he will go to do what he believes is right and to save the day from evil including completely breaking down a companion)

Eighth Doctor: 

I will go with audios for this one and say Lucie Miller/To The Death. These two are probably the crux of the breaking point of the Eighth Doctor where he all but loses his lighter romantic optimism. They are likely the source of his path which leads him to becoming the War Doctor in The Night of the Doctor.

Ninth Doctor: 

Dalek (when we see how much the Time War scarred the Doctor for the first time)

Tenth Doctor: 

I would actually choose The Stolen Earth/Journey's End for his one since it is the reason why he decides to travel alone and forms the emotional basis for why he becomes Time Lord Victorious in The Waters of Mars.

The Stolen Earth/Journey's End (where we see how the death's of others and the loss of his companions and what happens to them after he/they leave affects him)

Eleventh Doctor: 

Amy's Choice (where we get a better insight to the Doctor's darker nature and self-loathing) or The Snowmen (where we see that no matter how alone or lonely the Doctor is or feels he will always be drawn back into the world of exploration and adventure)

Twelfth Doctor: 

It's early days yet but I would say either Into the Dalek (where we see the Doctor's compassion and his hatred in equal amounts) or Listen (where we see how far the Doctor's curiosity will lead him down a rabbit hole)",0,1410908211,null,0,1410908863,0,ckkbkeb,t3_2glku4,t1_ckkbkeb,t3_2glku4,null,1426974276,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"What's hilarious to me is that the area of the UK that's most similar politically to Scotland is [Greater London](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/on-policy-scotland-is-far-from-most-of-britain-but-not-london/) yet I've seen so many idiots, on reddit and elsewhere, insisting that everyone North of the Midlands is a socialist and everyone South of it votes UKIP or Tory. 

Scotland is the only UK country to have ever given the Tories more than 50% of their votes, their decline in Scotland isn't because Scottish voters shifted to the left, it's because the SNP adopted Conservative policies and put a Saltire flag on them.  

I don't get why London is held responsible for the whole of UK politics, but the people in Yorkshire or Cumbria etc. who vote for those politicians are somehow 'victims' of evil London. It's ridiculous.  

And don't give me that 'we mean the City of London and teh evil bankers' crap. The nationalists have no problem with the City of London and the bankers when they want to promise a currency union and for Edinburgh to still be tied to the City of London as a financial centre. 


The 'Yes' campaign is promising a panglossian outcome where somehow the fossil fuel industry and the Green Party are going to waltz off in to the sunset together, where businesses and the wealthy can have tax cuts whilst public spending goes up, where those who want to keep the pound and those who want to adopt the Euro can all have what they want, everyone can have their own personal utopia ---- and yet they are painting the 'no' campaign as only offering the current UK coalition government. The fact that we have political pluralism in England, Northern Ireland and Wales gets nary a mention. The fact that the Tories needed to form a coalition with the Lib-dems to even get in to government gets nary a mention. 

They keep on harping on about how the 'No' campaign is 'negative' for asking basic questions, yet they are painting a picture of English politics that is completely stereotypical and which totally denies the basic fact that the way to change the government in Westminster is to get involved in party politics, help select candidates and then vote in Westminster elections, pure and simple. 

If Scotland does separate they'll still be very much influenced by Westminster politics, the SNP is promising people they'll have continued access to the NHS services in England for example, well if Scots want that to be the case why vote against having any right to determine how those services are run? 

As a UK citizen currently I'm very much affected by decisions made in Washington and Brussels, I have a say in the latter place but not the former. I have some ability to influence EU policy which affects my future, but if US politicians decide to further deregulate their financial markets risking another global banking crisis and recession or launch a stupid war which the UK could get dragged in to - I don't get a say in that. 

I'd rather be a small fish in the big sea than a big fish in a tiny lake and I think Scottish people are better off being 10% of the UK electorate than being cut off from it. Especially since devolution gives them so many powers within Scotland anyway.

You've got Lallana out there who has played decently, but missed nearly all preseason and it shows in the link up play. 
Balotelli is playing alone up top and when he drops deep/holds up the ball we should have the wings cutting inside to give him options, as well as someone from midfield running near him to lay it off to for maybe a quick one two. However this rarely happened. When this did happen we looked much more dangerous (think start of the 2nd half). 

Overall I'm just happy to steal the 3 points from Ludo tonight but obviously we need to be much better. The team knows this and as they become more comfortable with each other as well as the tactics, we will see much better performances.

true,crucible,null,null,"&gt; tbh, a dual carriageway won't really cut it if it's only one; a motorway would be needed - dual carriageway won't be able to cope too well if there's needed lane closures.

Good point, and one which I hadn't considered fully. The A55 across North Wales is mostly dual carriageway and its often beset by delays if one lane needs to be closed because of roadworks or an accident.

Of course a lot of the M4 across South Wales only has two lanes on each carriageway - from the end of the motorway near Pont Abraham Services, most of the section from Swansea to Cardiff, the elevated section past Port Talbot, the Brynglas Tunnels near Newport etc.

&gt; Rail would be better, but it'd need to be something pretty damn serious, and preferably on the same gauge as the rest of the continent - cheaper to source better parts, faster, more efficient, more reliable, etc. Get that in place, run it, say, Pembroke - Newport - Chester - Bangor - Pembroke, and you've got something that could likely compete or exceed the english transport routes

Yes, if we were building a new railway it would be to the common European standards - the only difference to the existing railways would be a bigger loading gauge. Hopefully that would get cargo off the roads too, you could just have smaller vans for local deliveries at the end of the railway line, things like that. Or put the [lorries on the train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_highway#mediaviewer/File:RoLa_Loetschberg.jpg) for most of the journey.

Personally I would say start any new line at Pembroke Dock  and then follow the existing South Wales Main Line past Carmarthen, Swansea and Cardiff to Newport but then make sure you build it up inside Wales so go through places like Abergavenny, Builth Wells, Newtown, and Welshpool. 

Between Welshpool and Wrexham you would have to follow the border, from Wrexham you could go through Chester but that line is going outside of Wales. Not sure what you do then unless you build a new line to Shotton or massively upgrade my local line, maybe going through Chester is a better idea after all!

Question is with that route you are passing a lot of towns and cities, do you stop the trains in all of them in which case you only need trains with a top speed of around 100mph but good acceleration / deceleration capability.

Or build alongside existing lines to keep serving the local traffic, only serve the larger communities with the new line and go for something with a higher top speed. !50mph would be enough really. Cardiff to Holyhead [by road](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Shrewsbury,+Shropshire/@52.7147022,-2.7496869,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x486f7655f4dc15c3:0x6ed7820778d6cdc4) is only 197 miles, if you used the fastest trains that can reach 190, 200 mph or so would they get up to a decent speed before having to slow down again for the next stop?

Borrowing rates affect government spending and debt, worse rates=worse debt and lower spending. That is hugely negative, especially for a starting country.

And it's not irrelevant to most people in the country, most people may be ignorant of it but it's the basis of the economy and if it goes wrong you're screwed. There will be massive inflation, as there was in every country that tries this. But hey, if you really think following in the footsteps of Zimbabwe is the way to go then good luck to you.

However what you must understand is that those of us who grew up during the Thatcher years are far more bitter and twisted than most people your age can understand. Our parents were the original baby boomers, we saw them sell off any chance of a proper democracy in the 80s and with the gradual dismantling of the NHS and other public services we realised the price everyone paid right from the word GO, the truly sad thing is that everyone at the time *begged* for it. *Begged.* My dad was a union leader, but bent over when BT got privatised. I pity him for it.

What Scotland's independence means for the left is this: we have no voice in Britain any more. We are shouted down because the Murdoch press tells ordinary people that socialism = stalinism. We have no power to give the working man what he wants. But if part of the UK is able to stand up, to stand up and tell the elitist right that it's wrong, that privatisation of public services is a huge pile of shite, that government power does not represent the views of large parts of the British Isles, that a bunch of Old Etonians do not know the best way to run the country.... surely it's worth a punt?

The short term will be full of turmoil, certainly. Many pro-independence folk are only looking for one thing. But in the long term I think a yes vote will result in a more progressive government, greater decentralisation and ultimately a fairer system. I honestly think that things couldn't get any worse right now (unless dear ol' Bojo took up arms and held parliament to ransom of course) so why not take a punt on something different?

I don't think Salmond is the right man to lead Scotland, but he's certainly an agent for change. I hope that he will do the right thing and allow a better man to pull the nation forward, but as a catalyst he's in the right place at the right time.

As a solo striker he doesn't have the influence on the game you need in that system. If were are to play him as a lone striker, I think he needs a  CAM capable of doing that part of the game for him. This is what I think Rodgers was trying to do against Villa. He played Coutinho behind Balo, but Coutinho has really not been firing and quite simply does not add the influence of a player like Sturridge, and I do believe Coutinho's position for the future is more central. 

Maybe if Sterling were put in behind we'd have more luck, but I'm in no rush to go back to the double pivot. I'd like to see Lambert start against West ham.

Alex Salmond however, won't relinquish power, He is here and he is here to screw Scotland over in the long run. Scotland may become really successful economically however, with him in power, it wouldn't matter, he'd push people to the extremes and take up arms.

We only have to look at Northern Ireland to see what happens when you push people to extremes,marginalise their views and misuse and abuse History. It's an extreme circumstance, I accept that, and I really hope I am wrong but with Salmond and his cronies in power, its not looking pretty for Scotland.

Another issue which is other looked in all of this. The EU referendum. If Scotland remains part of the UK- Its most likely that the UK will remain part of the EU. However, (I perceive this) the rate that England is going, Its becoming more right wing and anti EU. Therefore in 2017, I would speculate that the UK will leave the EU.

Most of the time this sub is just an upvote party/jerk around whatever flavour of the month seems to be trending. I swear in my time here I've seen this sub flip multiple times between Lucas being a world-class CDM who is vital to how the team works and Lucas is a completely useless and redundant player that we should offload. Same for Sterling when he had a rough patch before last season. And now with Coutinho. God forbid some of our younger players might have a couple of weeks where they're not quite on top of it, you'd think their entire career has just vanished overnight.

Or how last season we went from ""we can totally win the league"" to ""our team isn't good enough"" in the space of about a week when we lost to City and Chelsea over Christmas. Then a few weeks later we went to ""we have no chance of top 4 without signing a new defensive midfielder"" after some dodgy games against Villa and WBA. Then we won 5-1 against Arsenal and suddenly we were title contenders again and didn't look back. 

At the same time, don't think this match shows anything. Especially when, like you say, Brendan is switching the squad around and experimenting a bit. For example I think it's far too early to write off our defence without Skrtel when he's only been out a couple of matches.",0,1410911076,null,0,false,0,ckkcx8r,t3_2gleid,t1_ckkcx8r,t1_ckk7dcl,null,1426973026,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

You try and refute that ""dropping a nuclear warhead from a plane doesn't make it detonate "" by citing an example of  a nuclear warhead dropped from a plane that didn't detonate,

Not only was the dropped from a plane specifically stated by me because i know there have been several incidents where exactly this has occurred, and every time they have not detonated  but also because i know the difference between a ICBM warhead and a warhead launched/dropped from an aircraft.

to think an ICBM in 2014 which has all sorts of fail safes and accelerometers to ensure it only arms if it follows an expected ICBM launch profile, is comparable to  a 1960s tech bomb that is deliberately designed to be dropped from an altitude in the same way as if it fell is bad enough

But to actually think a claim of "" you can even drop a warhead from a plane and it wont detonate"" is refuted by examples where bombs did exactly that and didn't go off is insane 

In short,  from a warhead perspective its a bigger notable recordable difference being fired up in a missile then falling down from extreme high altitudes  compared to be dropped from a plane , a warhead knows its not in a missile better than a warhead in a plane knowing it is being dropped accidentally.

Not to mention the technology difference between 1960 and 2014, no one has or uses 1960 warheads they were all long destroyed and replaced with much fewer more modern systems with many more failsafes and different delivery methods.

You could load up a bomber with as many MRVs  as you want and drop them all from a plane and not one will go off.....not one! (unless you specifically design them to)

There is nothing different about Dyspraxia or ADD or any of the other things in that vein that require a free laptop that I can see. Why should somebody be exempt from purchasing their own kit just like all the other students. You have computing resources available, just because you have to get up early to get on a PC (not that I believe that at all) is not an excuse.

Why don't you give me the relevant info if you can see how many are available at any given time? i.e how many PC's and how many students. Given that the vast majority of students will no doubt own a computer (most of them had a PC of some sort at home even when I was at uni) I just don't believe that there isn't sufficient resources available.

Stop avoiding the question, I will reiterate it for you.

Why should somebody with dyslexia or any other learning difficulty get a free laptop over a poor student? If they are capable of doing a uni course then surely they are capable or working behind a bar like I did or simply having parents provide it. On the one hand you want me to believe that it's oh so difficult to get on with out a free laptop if you have dyslexia yet perfectly capable of completing a degree. Pure bullshit.

Under Benitez and to a much greater extent under Houllier we'd always tend to sit back and be more defensive once we held a lead, and a lot of the time it would trip us up and we'd concede an equaliser having lost all momentum in the game. If you score on the 86th minute then by all means shut up shop, but I'm more than happy for us to try and score a second goal when we're 1-0 up after 40 minutes. 

I remember nervy games like the one against Chelsea in the 2005 CL Semi-Final, where Garcia scored in the 4th minute and we basically just defended for the the remaining hour and a half. And sure, it worked and we won the game, but inviting the other team to just have free pressure and set up camp on the edge of your penalty area is a hard game to play and I don't think we have the defence for it right now.

There's no way we should be pushing for another goal at 90 minutes when we're leading, but at the same time I really don't feel we have a squad yet where choosing to defend and invite pressure is our best option compared to trying to score another to secure the game.

The UK cannot, of course, tell Scotland *now* that they would accept a currency union, because they need the deterrent message.  However, if it were a Yes, the UK would want a currency union because, from that point in time, it would be in the UK's interest to keep trading with Scotland using sterling (a currency they have control over) rather than Euros (which they have no control over).

The currency union would have to be created prior to negociations with the rest of the EU, for Scotland to have a strong foot when it enters those negociations.  Given the many tremors happening in Europe at the moment (e.g. current conflict with Russia is threatening Europe's oil and gas supply) the EU would do well to accept Scotland even on a non-Euro basis, because it basically means arriving to a situation that is as close as it can be to the status quo ante.  But this is assuming that there wouldn't be a serious carrot dangled in front of Scotland to actually want to change over to the Euro.  A good deal is a good deal, and Europe certainly knows how to present good packages to countries with a small economy.

Edit: a lot of English people think that joining the Euro is something that countries aspiring to join the EU must accept to qualify for membership, even if they don't want it.  The truth is that, so far, all the countries that have joined under these conditions see joining the Euro as a plus point.  They *want* to join the Euro.

Migs could have done better, but once Lovren goes to ground and doesn't get the ball, the striker basically has a free moment to look up and pick his spot. He's not at that bad an angle, he's decently close to goal, and if Migs is still on his line then he's beaten no problem unless the guy hits it straight at him. 

I'll agree he's made a bad split-second decision and staying on his line would have been better, but you can't expect the goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet when the other ten players on the team go AWOL for a minute or two. If Mignolet is in a position where coming off his line or not is the difference between them scoring or not scoring, then it's already not his fault.

EU cannot possibly put itself in a situation in which a country is seen to be leaving the EU.  

The Spanish are in a weak position anyway, their government's finances are on life support, deficits being negociated and renegociated with the ECB on a quarterly basis.

Go take a look at the chances we didn't score from our 0-1 loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup last season for why rushing out is often a better idea. We could have scored 4 or 5 goals in that game if Fabianski wasn't so damn fast off his line to get to the ball before Sturridge/Suarez/Sterling every time.

Right now ""yes"" is united for a common cause - but there are diverse and divisive reasons for voting 'yes'. The moment the campaign wins, it fragments once again into factions pulling for their own vision of Scotland, and their own slice of power.

Most people are in agreement that Devolution, if offered, would win by a landslide. Therefore voting for Independence under these terms, which would actually make Scotland MORE dependent on the UK, with LESS say in it's own affairs and all the problems of divorcing Scotland from a Nation is suicidal.

As someone who was a Liverpool fan through the era of David James and Jerzy Dudek, I really don't get why you'd be all that bothered - Migs has gloves coated with glue compared to either of them. There was the goal last season where Andy Carroll basically took him out, and other than that I really can't think of a goal we've conceded from a cross or corner because Migs has come to claim the ball and failed. 

Migs has his flaws, but I really don't think him losing a 1-on-1 where our opponents went through our entire team in two passes is a signal that he's the worst thing about our defence, and it's kind of irritating to see this sub just go for him because Johnson wasn't playing, and clearly *someone* has to be individually at fault for our shitty performance today.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;So what if two weak as shit male coppers go out on patrol together?

It's all relative. Two males who are weak as shit for males are probably still going to be as strong as the two average females. But two females who are weak as shit for females are going to get their shit handed to them every time by anyone other than a weak as shit female. 

&gt;I've worked with five foot nothin' Female officers who would have you or me for dinner in a fair fight.

No doubt the exception, rather than the rule. I won't kid myself that there isn't small women who know BBJ that could probably pin me. Or kick boxers that could knock me out with a roundhouse kick or some shit. 

But how many female bobies are trained in kick boxing or BBJ to intermediate level? The extreme minority.

I've wrestled girls who think they're 'strong' (rugby players) and it really doesn't take much to overpower them even completely untrained and sedentary.. That's with only a ~2 stone weight advantage too.

&gt;It's more down to personal attirbutes than gender

No, gender plays a huge role in who performs better in anything physical. It's why we don't mix genders in football, olympics, boxing, etc. It's not uncommon to hear stories of pro female tennis players getting wrecked by ball boys, for example. 

[And there's this classic..](http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,543962,00.html)

Athleticism lends its self completely to the male gender due to our biological make up. This isn't me being harsh to women. There's probably hundreds of millions of women fitter and faster than I am.. But we're not talking about special cases. We're talking average vs average.  

&gt;and besides that women are often far better at avoiding physical conflict in the first place through use of words.

I don't doubt this. 

&gt;Also, remember the footage of the Woolich murderers getting shot by the female cop? I wouldn't mind two of her in every police car...

A gun is the ultimate equalizer. A bullet doesn't come from a gun faster when a male shoots it than it does when a female shoots it. ",0,1410915479,null,0,false,0,ckkf0d3,t3_2gkmok,t1_ckkf0d3,t1_ckkeid9,null,1426970939,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

River Song: The blue switches!

River Song: Yes they're blue: they're the blue stabilisers! [presses the button and the TARDIS indeed stabilises] See?

River Song: Okay, I've mapped the probability vectors, done a foldback on the temporal isometry, charted the ship to its destination and... [presses a button, the cloister bell clangs] parked us right alongside. 
The Doctor: Parked us? But we haven't landed! 
River Song: Of course we've landed; I just landed her.

For the years before that he was third choice on the national team to Reina and we both know that Reina wasn't at his best as far back as four years ago, but still better than Valdes. I don't think he's a bad keeper and he may even be better than Mignolet, which is why I think we should pick him up, but I still see him being outside of top 5 best keepers in England. I'd put Hart, Cech, Courtois, Lloris, De Gea and even maybe Szczesny ahead of him. Hopefully I'm proven wrong but I'd be surprised. I also think that people without goalkeeping training often miss some of the subtler points of what makes a keeper good and many of those are where I find Valdes lacking. I've seen him drop crosses or make obvious mistakes that anyone would pick up, but other things like being beaten near side, hard hands vs soft hands that creates more problems for the defence, over-reliance on using his feet, not setting for shots, and making positional mistakes. 

Barcelona weren't amazing last year but I'd hardly say they crumbled, also having a significantly weaker back up doesn't necessarily mean Valdes is good, we'd similarly struggle if we had to play Jones for months straight. If he keeps up his form from last year then great, if not well at least we have good keeper competition. I would not use the descriptor ""top class"" to describe Valdes, though I would only throw that out for a handful of keepers. He is better with the ball at his feet than Mignolet, so it may be a good option, but I'm saying don't expect it to be like when we had Reina at his best, because it most likely won't be.",0,1410916236,null,0,false,0,ckkfcyn,t3_2glgre,t1_ckkfcyn,t1_ckkes9f,null,1426970658,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

He finally gets what he needs to save both of their lives and then loses half of the antidote in the process so he can only save his companion, nearly dying for good in the process. His last two thoughts in the world were the Master telling him to die and his guilt and sadness over failing to save Adric who he calls out to in his mind.

*Eight's regeneration* was also monumentally sad. I mean he tries so hard to stay out of the Time War and save the few people he can, but as the war rages on he can do less and less. He ends up saving Cass who freaks out that he is a Time Lord and decides that not only committing suicide is a better option but that if he dies with her it would be the best possible news she could get. He tries in vain to save her and dies in the process, likely for good if he had not landed on Karn. Then he is resurrected by the Sisterhood, receives the guilt trip to end all guilt trips, and finally decides to break his promise and fight in the Time War. One of his final thoughts is to be happy that the transformation will be painful.

But yeah Ten's was pretty sad if a bit drawn out. But I mean he was followed around for about half a season and told repeatedly how he would die which would probably mess up anyone. He tried so hard to be a good man but the universe kept breaking him down: first Rose is stuck in a parallel universe, then the Master died just to spite him and Martha's family is nearly destroyed, and then Donna had to be mind wiped. So he decides to travel alone to spare anymore pain to himself or his prospective companions. But with no one to tell him when to stop and being reminded of all the times he couldn't save people he goes over the deep end and sounds frighteningly like the Master for once. He even practically had to fight the Time War all over again first stopping the Reality Bomb plan to destroy the universe by the Daleks and then the End of Time plan to destroy the universe by the Time Lords.

Just because you are dyslexic does not mean you are unable to work, earn money and do all the other things other students do does it?

Ideally, yes - but we know nothing of the circumstances there. I've been in HARD prolonged fights 4-5 on one with drugged/psychotic detainees - big blokes losing badly to a single skinny fella until they get co-ordinated and get cuffs on or whatever. People with a good adrenaline hit can have superhuman strength. In one memorable incident I had to restrain a psychotic 50Kg woman for four hours with 2 other colleagues - one a powerful rugby player, the other a slight woman, and me in the middle. She kicked our asses for four hours and it was all we could do to stop her injuring herself. She didn't fatigue at all.

The guy was clearly just being talked to and was sat in the car, and it's his initial shove that caught the coppers off guard. Ok, so the bundle isn't pretty, but they rarely are. Fights don't happen toe to toe. And, for what it's worth, after the initial takedown the two officers (with the help of the lad) DO effectively restrain the bloke. You see a nice arm bar go on there, then the cuffs, then it's game over.

I see it as a training issue far more than a physical attribute one. After a few years and a few too many close calls, I took up Jiu Jitsu in  my spare time. Fights started to go my way a lot quicker after a couple of years of that - with less chance of injury to both myself and suspects. If you can keep a calm head and apply just a modicum of technique to the situation, it's far better all around. The couple of days a year 'Officer Safety Training' were wholly inadequate. YOu need to train this stuff regularly so you have a learned response. You don't (in normal policing roles) come into physical conflict often enough to keep your eye in, you have to train regularly.

Talking to these people, they have no medical condition such as autism or dyslexia but still get the use of a laptop in examinations which gives them an unfair advantage since most of today's young people can type faster than they write by hand. Spell-Check also means they always get full marks for SPAG (Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar). I, myself, have been told just how easy it is to get a laptop for use in exams. All you have to do is see the Student Support Leader at your school at complain that your hand-writing is illegible and is losing oyu marks. They will tell you to write a page about anything (note that apparently they will even recommend you write messily on purpose) and then assess your handwriting. This is how easy it is across a lot of schools and this is simply stupid. You should at least have to inform places you apply to that you had to use a laptop to achieve the marks you did but this doesn't happen. They receive the same qualification with probably better marks due to an unfair, undeserved advantage.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"The reason I called horseshit is because: 'You can train a man to be sensitive to women's issues, but you can't train a woman to be as strong as a physically fit man. '

Which ignores a number of factors:

* Out and out physical strength matters almost never. We don't arm wrestle suspects or have bench press competitions. We also have handcuffs - which are instant wrist locks with incredible leverage. All officers are trained in their correct use. Note how the linked fight is over the moment handcuffs go on?

* Women may in fact diffuse fights by their mere presence. Drunken idiots will square up to a male officer, but it takes a total douche to try it on against a female cop (in my experience).

* ""you can train a man to be sensitive to a womans issues"" Rly? You make it sound like women are superfluous to requirements.  Some men are excellent at the touchy feely stuff, some women aren't. We need people of both (all?) genders to accurately reflect the people we serve.

Better? I also posted this elsewhere.

&gt; Regardless of the size/gender differences, POs should surely be at least physically capable of handling suspects when they're 2 on 1, right?

Ideally, yes - but we know nothing of the circumstances there. I've been in HARD prolonged fights 4-5 on one with drugged/psychotic detainees - big blokes losing badly to a single skinny fella until they get co-ordinated and get cuffs on or whatever. People with a good adrenaline hit can have superhuman strength. In one memorable incident I had to restrain a psychotic 50Kg woman for four hours with 2 other colleagues - one a powerful rugby player, the other a slight woman, and me in the middle. She kicked our asses for four hours and it was all we could do to stop her injuring herself. She didn't fatigue at all.

The guy was clearly just being talked to and was sat in the car, and it's his initial shove that caught the coppers off guard. Ok, so the bundle isn't pretty, but they rarely are. Fights don't happen toe to toe. And, for what it's worth, after the initial takedown the two officers (with the help of the lad) DO effectively restrain the bloke. You see a nice arm bar go on there, then the cuffs, then it's game over.

I see it as a training issue far more than a physical attribute one. After a few years and a few too many close calls, I took up Jiu Jitsu in  my spare time. Fights started to go my way a lot quicker after a couple of years of that - with less chance of injury to both myself and suspects. If you can keep a calm head and apply just a modicum of technique to the situation, it's far better all around. The couple of days a year 'Officer Safety Training' were wholly inadequate. YOu need to train this stuff regularly so you have a learned response. You don't (in normal policing roles) come into physical conflict often enough to keep your eye in, you have to train regularly.

As a counterpoint, I've had to step in to help colleagues when I was off duty on a number of occasions - always male officers, generally due to the factors I mentioned above - drugs, alcohol or fight or flight response.",0,1410916924,null,0,1410917270,0,ckkfoos,t3_2gkmok,t1_ckkfoos,t1_ckkf8tf,null,1426970360,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8
