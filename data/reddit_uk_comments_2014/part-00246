Works well when the overloaded midfield is working in your favor, forcing the opposition to run the play down the lines. But if they manage to get through the middle and past the CDM, one of your CBs has to come running back to the center or leave your keeper in a one-on-one situation.

In your scenario, its obviously not Fazio making the run.

He could play up front if Lukaku is injured, resting or shifted out wide (which the Arsenal games proved last year how effective he can be there), or deeper. He can play in the hole (probably more advanced than Ross) while Barkley is injured, and whilst he is tired or we need a more energetic closing down player for tactical reasons... He can also play on the wing; whilst he won't be happy to so this week in week out, he would be our best player in that position.

Welbeck is the sort of player we should be pursuing if we want to carry on telling people we are top 4 contenders. If we don't sign players like him, then we are one bad injury away from dropping 15+ points, because we had to field Championship level lads.

No, definitely not - I'm in complete agreement here IF you're looking at other stats and take in the whole picture.

Remy is 4 years older than Welbeck, likely to come at the same fee, scored a few more goals than Welbeck despite Welbeck being played as a winger for most of last season. 14 in 26 is an impressive stat, but 10 in around the same amount of matches as a left winger is, in my opinion, more impressive considering Remy was the focal point of the Newcastle offense.

I think Welbeck would be a superb replacement for Jay Rodriguez considering he's 2 years younger, quite probably cheaper, available now, and used to playing at a much higher level than Rodriguez. Simply, I think if we can get Welbeck we'd be fools not to.

If you were the President of the US, and you and your top generals ordered the military to occupy the US you would be ousted by it.  Because, much like the UK military swears an oath to the Royal Family and not to the PM, the US military swears to uphold the constitution, not the president.

The value of the 2nd Amendment is in the fact that it really does kill any theoretical chance of armed tyranny.  You simply don't take over a country in dictatorship fashion overtly, if its civilians are heavily armed.  Because your soldiers will be forced to enter combat with the people they are supposed to protect.  We have known for some time that people will follow morally questionable orders given by authority figures - not all Nazi soldiers hated Jews, for example, but manipulation and lies kept them believing they were doing the right thing.  When soldiers are ordered to act against their citizens, and are faced with resistance, they might be less comfortable taking those orders.  Thus, the only means for an insidious individual/group to enact a tyrannous dictatorship in the US is through subterfuge, which is countered, I suppose, by an intelligent populace and true democracy (the US perhaps struggles on those counts, but we'll see).

In a sci-fi, food for thought kind of way, the ""militia against government tyranny"" thing might become a little more important in the future, if ever drones and robots and terminators and shit become the majority in military, because those can be controlled at the press of a button, no matter who presses it.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"I really don't buy this, ""Ade got better service than Soldado"" argument for two reasons.  Firstly, even in the games when Soldado DID get good service, he was still wasteful.  For all his good work in the first half of the season in terms of assists and build up play, he was so much less effective all round towards the end of the season (albeit whilst in and out of the team).  

Secondly, one of the reasons Ade gets better service is because he's a better/easier player *to* service.  Soldado will NEVER get the same service as Ade because they are not the same type of players and a lot of the balls that Ade can still benefit from are just ones that Soldado cannot use.  

I haven't given up on Soldado.  As mentioned, he did a lot of good in the first half of last season, even if his finishing was awry.  He has talent, a good pedigree, and generally a positive influence on the squad.  He just needs confidence in front of goal.  However, this whitewashing of his fuck-ups by insinuating he just didn't have the service and was totally deprived of good scoring opportunities is, for me, a fallacy.

(By the way, I assume the good assist you mention was vs Southampton.  That was a great cross, but in the end still required Adebayor to pull off a wonder-finish.  I wouldn't say this is evidence for Soldado to start as a lone-striker; more that he is effective when playing with another striker.)

true,Tective,null,null,"Right, but you're thinking that gun crime rates are high because there are lots of guns in Chicago, because the restrictions are not effective because you can simply go out of state for one and bring it back in, thus rendering them largely moot, right?  Surely then in those states where guns are considerably easier to get, we should see higher crime rates, because there's no need to circumvent any restrictions, no?  But in practice that's simply not the case.

The fact is that the US has far worse problems than guns.  The place has horrific poverty (in those places where violent crime is highest, of course), the education is suspect, the religion is insane, and often disgustingly hypocritical, the government is literally corrupt at all levels, and the attitude, social climate favour greed and getting money above all else.  Why, why would you go after guns when there are so many other issues to fix, that affect more people, that cause more problems, and that are far less objectionable.  Like it or not, there are legitimate reasons for guns to be available to own in modern civilization, it is not black and white, but I can't imagine anybody who would object to serious attempts to reduce the wealth inequality and help the poverty-stricken.

In my dream world the US deals with all its other shit first, and kills off its lucrative firearms industry, criminalizes a significant proportion of its citizens, empowers its criminals, undermines its constitution, and potentially kicks off a civil war *last*.

I don't think guns *cause* crime, although they are certainly one of many tools used to accomplish it.

I suppose it varies extremely by person.

What would you say about the Czech Republic?  A European country with a decent level of firearm culture and ownership, and significantly less of everything than both the US and the UK - ~330,000 crimes in 2009, with a population in 2011 of about 10,562,214\*.  There were [3.9 million crimes in England and Wales alone in 2011/12](http://www.mycrimeprevention.co.uk/home-garden-security/home-security/crime-figures/crime-figures-for-2011-12), spread between about 56,000,000 people.  Obviously this is all sorts of crime and not just violent/firearm-related because I get up at 4:30am for work and it's eleven now and I don't know why the fuck I'm still on here.

I'm guessing population size and income inequality play a large role in violent crime rates.

Whether it is fair to apply the same logic to detention centres is a bit less clear cut. There are people in there who know damn well they don't have any right to be here, and they are really no different from any other criminals.

There are also people who will ultimately be allowed to stay. They have had to come here without prior permission because of the situation in their own country, but might be found to have a valid case. Of course, we don't know which people this will apply to.

On balance, I don't think it is the end of the world if residents in detention centres do their own cooking and cleaning for less than minimum wage. After all, the rest of us do.

When people vote in a general election, what is at stake for the victor? Pretty much, a mandate for the right to legislate on anything they want; every policy issue possible. From financial services regulation to transport budgets to the national grid to intellectual property law reform to foreign policy to the health service; considering such a wide and diverse remit, how educated or informed do you think a typical voter has to be in order for him to earn the right to vote? When does society pass this inexact burden of knowledge?

If you treat the electorate like idiots then they will behave like idiots. 

In police commissioner elections the public vote on one very specific policy area; local policing.

Lolno. It's linked to over 60 diseases and cancers, [and even moderate drinking can increase your risk of cancer and strokes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606050)

I can think of numerous practical uses for guns, hunting being a major one which directly benefits wildlife.

What uses does alcohol provide that isn't getting shitfaced and having fun?

Let's put it this way, 67% of adults in the US drink and there are nearly 90,000 deaths due to alcohol. 34-40% own guns and there are around 30,000 gun deaths.

If an equal amount drank and owned guns, there would be more deaths from alcohol than guns.

&gt;Only kill people when they're being driven by an idiot

Same could be said about guns.

&gt;and more illegal (and deadly) than drugs.

Are you seriously saying guns are more dangerous than something like cocaine and heroin?

true,DeathByCocktail,scot-Lothian,Haggis muncher 5.75 -6.97,"Story time! I had the day off today and visited my parents, who are of pensionable age but still working as they love what they do. My mum was telling me that earlier in the week she was in the supermarket and saw four Muslim blokes with Glaswegian accents, who had presumably been at the local prayer group and were dressed in the traditional robes etc. (apologies for not knowing the right name), which is very unusual in that area. People were apparently staring at them and gossiping. This was in Ayrshire, which isn't exactly a cultural melting pot for anyone who isn't familiar with it.

None of this surprised me, having grown up there but what *did* was that she was visibly shaken when she told me that she found herself thinking ""What are *you* doing here?"" She's as socially liberal as they come but still saw those men and, on some level, identified them as 'other' and a threat. Their neighbour is a Muslim who's married to a Scot and they get on like a house on fire, but she still felt uncomfortable that day. She knows that it was utterly irrational and seems to genuinely hate that it happened. She believes that, on some level, the way in which Muslims are portrayed in the media has wheedled its way into her brain and triggered that response, which she's both upset and pissed off about.

Globally, there are a lot of horrible people who are Muslim. We see it constantly and I would never try to defend their actions. Killing people in the name of religion isn't cool. When my mum- a 63 year old Scouse antiques dealer- starts to freak out for absolutely no reason when she's doing her shopping, however, I think that it's time to look at how the press are presenting these people. It was a wake up call for her but, OP, I imagine that your workmates haven't had that yet. Sure, I understand that people living in areas that have become heavily populated by an ethnic group that keeps to itself may feel threatened and in a way I understand that. I'm in no way denying or, indeed, supporting the horrors of Islam, but I think that there are a lot of normal, otherwise rational Brits who are finding themselves feeling afraid of people who are just trying to get on with their lives.

true,wrigley2345,eng-dorset,Dorset (Living in USA),"The chance of hitting spectators is an extremely specific scenario that is certainly not always going to be the case. Most crime of this nature is going to be conducted in low population areas, except for the reletively uncommon mass shootings. Even then, you are not always going to be surrounded by civilians. If it was a threat, the vast majority of concealed carriers, who I assume we are now talking about, would be sensible enough to only fire if it is not a danger to the surrounding public. One real life example of that is the 2013 Clackamas mall shooting - A civilian had an opportunity to shoot the shooter while his rifle was jamming, but chose not to after spotting a woman who had a chance of being hit [\(Source\)](http://www.kgw.com/story/news/2014/07/24/12405148/) Incidentally the sight of an armed civilian most likely made the shooter kill himself and stop the rampage.

50 feet is only 15 meters. That is really not very far to be able to fire with an effective level of accuracy. It is safe to assume that the vast majority of Concealed Carriers will have trained with their weapon extensively at the range, so this will not be alien to them. You are right, you probably couldn't accurately fire at him as, no offence meant, I think it's safe to assume that you have not trained with handguns very much, living in Worcestershire and all. 

Unfortunately the trained professionals are not always there. If a guy starts to shoot up a school or any other public space, they can do untold amounts of damage in as little as a few seconds. The best police response time in the US is 4 minutes. The average is 10 minutes. Dozens of people can be killed in that time. An armed civilian, if lucky/unlucky enough to be there when it starts, can immediately try to stop the threat. As much as it pains me to link to buzzfeed, here is a quick list of shooters who have been stopped by members of the public with their own personal firearms. [Link](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/10-potential-mass-shootings-that-were-stopped-by-someone-wit)

I can understand the feeling in r/UK, it is very hard to imagine the UK being in the same position in the US. Armed civilians in the UK would be utterly stupid, as 99.9% of criminals here don't have firearms. In the US, the culture is irreversibly ingrained with gun culture and as a side effect hundreds of thousands of black market, illegal weapons have made it into the hands of criminals. There is no possible way to get rid of them, so the safest measure to take is allowing the public to defend themselves.

Yea if he was earning £100,000 p/w *after tax* then it'd cost the club £145,000 p/w (£7.5m a year).

The idea is that you won't have an external owner pumping a club full of cash over a season or two then leaving the club in serious debt if it doesn't work. FFP isn't created (as far as I am aware) to narrow the gap of rich and poor clubs. The aim is to get all clubs either turning a profit or at the very least not making a loss season after season. 

&gt; Are the owners of teams such as Man City so damn rich they are ok with losing 50m a year?

Take Chelsea as an example, when they were bought by Abramovich he spent heavily in the first few seasons and turned a loss in order to establish Chelsea as an elite club in a short space of time. Same thing happened at Man City. Once that process is done, the owners can then maximise revenue through merchandise, creative sponsorship deals etc. because everyone loves a 'winner'. PSG are undergoing a similar transformation. Most mid-to-lower table clubs are constantly on the brink of going pop, [a lot have over the last twenty years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_\(British_football\)) 

&gt; It seems damn near impossible for teams such as Bayern, Real, and Barca to be knocked off their perch of continued dominance.

He put a lot of effort into it and did come up with some awesome performances but ultimately, I don't think it was enough.

On the other hand, I think it was too easy to write Smith's Doctor wrong as everyone believed he should have these odd moments of pure childishness where he'd flap his arms round a bunch and say dumb stuff. It was too easy to make stories fall apart around Smith's Doctor because, ultimately, I don't think Smith's Doctor really worked. 

All that being said, it's clear Capaldi is ready and willing to give feedback about the writing and mould the Doctor the way he wants the character to be. From recent interviews it's clear that Capaldi has a very definite idea of how he would like his Doctor to be. More over, I think Moffat has matured as a head writer since taking over and that Capaldi plays to Moffat's writing skills far better. I think they're going to make a great team and I think we're in for a treat.

There are no teams that solely succeed on man-management. I just wish the whole ""redknapp played the best spurs football in X years"" would stop being taken without a pinch of salt. Lets be honest, we had some fucking incredible players. 

1) Bale - now most expensive player **Ever**.

2) Luka Modric - Widely considered the **Best CM in the world**

3) Ledley King - Considered by many to be one of englands **Best Central Defenders Ever**

4) Rafael Van der Vaart - Sold to us by Real Madrid and has had a incredibly successful career to say the least

I'm sorry but the next time we have a squad with an iota of the player calibre of that, we'll challenge for the title with relative ease. The reason redknapp will guaranteed never manage a top club again is his loud mouth and lack of tactical aptitude. I don't need to remind anyone on here of his tactical decisions but they were nigh on pathetic.

As far as this youth development goes, i'm positive some of the shittest managers I've seen have spotted talent from time to time. Steve Kean found and kept on Jones at Blackburn for example.

The game is highly customizable and allows users to change player names, stats, team names, jerseys, stadia, and also allows for league creation. So the community gets together, creates kits, edits leagues, teams and stadia and posts the edit 'option files' on Pes forums. From there you just paste the files into your console and voila!
&gt; So in the end Pes has everything Fifa does with the exception commentary for created items. Eg the commentary will not say ""arsenal,"" or ""Bvb"" etc. On the whole it's pretty sweet.
&gt; Some forums are pesgaming.com or wenb.com
You download the file that corresponds to your region, bles or blus, add it to a usb and paste them into the Pes folder. I should mention that every time a patch comes out, you must repeat process with an option file compatible with the version/data pack. Any creator who takes his files seriously will post new option files within a few days of a new patch.

You missed my clarification: 

&gt;rather than respected social intellectuals *in that particular regard*

The PUoS and Royal Society points are entirely irrelevant to his status as a faintly ridiculous self-appointed grandee of New Atheism. 

His work as a scientist has earned him substantial credibility, *in that field*. 

In philosophy and theology- entirely separate fields? The man's an absolute laughing stock. It's like saying that Frank Sinatra's professional recognition as a singer lent him the credibility to speak as a voice of authority about social issues in the third world- he might have a *voice*, but there's no reason to consider it a *respected* voice. 

Dawkins has done an astonishing amount of work to cement his place as an object of ridicule since *The God Delusion*- that disaster of a twitter account lends dismal insight into the kind of mindset that's fuelled his stance as an atheist intellectual.

He doesn't have the expertise to comment on philosophy or theology, and that *destroys* him. Being one of those voices speaking the loudest doesn't affect the issues with his ridiculous, narrow-minded view of the world.

I'm an atheist (or at least agnostic about the issue), and his antics make me feel almost embarrassed to bring the topic up. His demagoguery might have caused a media fracas, but it certainly doesn't hold any respected status in the field he decided to venture into.

I get it.  People can't win the argument against atheism, so they go for ad hominem attacks.

Balotelli still has to prove his commitment and IMO doesn't deserve a spot over Sturridge, and playing a 442 Diamond leaves us with Lambert and Borini for depth/impact subs. I don't think that's the best course given the amount of matches this season. Maintain a somewhat predictable starting 11, change it to a 442 if the match calls for it, the players are fit for it and there's not 2 other matches in the next week. 

I'd be more comfortable with a predictable 11, giving the current squad the chance to develop and produce, and Balotelli, Markovic and Can/Allen as impact subs than having our 2 main sources of goals on the pitch at the same time.

Here's a marvellous goodbye letter from an AC Milan fan:
http://www.milanobsession.com/2014/08/my-love-affair-with-mario-balotelli.html?m=1

I think most of the antics involving Balotelli have been largely overblown. Such is today's media. He was 19-22 when the worst of it happened. He's 24 today, seems more settled (got engaged this summer) etc. The worst of it has to be behind him.

There's two very noteworthy things about the Liverpool team of FSG and BR:

1) the club will not overpay, they'll rather do without. Eventually, this pays dividends in negotiations. Sellers know FSG/Henry/Ayre won't be made fools of.

2) Many ""borderline"" and/or fringe players from other teams have flourished at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers. This could be a factor in Balotelli's decision. Am I too optimistic to think: ""Well, it's time to concentrate on my career and cut the crap!"" from Balotelli's POV? Maybe. But one dares hope!

Another important aspect about getting such a world famous headline grabber (apart from the ever-popular jersey sales) is that he'll rid Sturridge, Sterling and other of approx 17.329 articles about how they're faring in filling Suarez's boots. When it comers to media attention, he's a veritable sponge and quite used to it.

On the pitch, our attack won't be much easier to deal with than last season. Against AC Milan, teams could assign 2-3 defenders to stick to Mario like leeches, since their threat was quite one-dimensional. Will this work against a team that also sports Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and other such types? Certainly not! Balotelli is excellent at ghosting defenders in a low energy sort of way. Attackers really don't need to run like a $Icelandic_footballer_you_won't_know on amphetamine to creative an effective pressing situation; they only need to give the midfield time to change shape and thwart passes that'll bypass it.

Granted, I may be a bit optimistic, but the best case scenario with this marvelous young group with the addition of Mario Balotelli is fantastic.

If you're curious about *why* he's so widely mocked, try asking somewhere like /r/BadPhilosophy - it's got a substantially higher proportion of people who've actually studied philosophy than /r/Philosophy, so you're likely to get a proper, more comprehensive answer there. 

&gt;I get it. People can't win the argument against atheism, so they go for ad hominem attacks.

This is complete rubbish. 

The problem with Dawkins is that he doesn't fully understand what he's critiquing- his arguments are superficial, and his underlying ideological worldview is so utterly stubborn and limited that he's incapable of even engaging with some of the arguments against him. 

I used to have a lot of time for Dawkins. Then I started studying the fields he's railing against. He's really one of the single worst advocates that the New Atheist movement could have hoped for- partially down to the unnecessarily unsound arguments, and partially down to the fact that the guy's *such an ass*.

There are an enormous number of intellectuals and philosophers who respect Dawkins.  They may not agree with his every word, but he is acknowledged as an important intellectual.  So, sorry if you know redditors who don't like him, but so what?

&gt;The problem with Dawkins is that he doesn't fully understand what he's critiquing

And what exactly is there to understand?  There's no evidence for God.  Not a single shred.  Not a scintilla.  Does Dawkins need to read the entire reference works of a theology department in order to state that fact?  

He's not missing anything, because there's nothing to miss!  The day someone comes up with evidence, *any* evidence at all indicating the existence of a creator God then you can fault him if he doesn't make the effort to learn about it.  But that day will never arrive.

I worded it poorly, let's say 'sustained use'. Most gun deaths do not happen during 'regular use', regular use defined as the reason you own a gun.

So if I were to own a gun for hunting or sport shooting, most deaths would not occur during the usage of my gun for these activities. I hope this clarifies it a bit. 

In comparison people generally own a car for transportation and most deaths occur when you are using the car for transport.

Regardless by far the vast majority of car deaths are due to accidents, which are not intentional. The great majority of gun deaths are intentional. A valid comparison would be between deaths from car accidents and gun accidents.

As for Sterling v Coutinho at CAM, I'd pick Sterling based on current form.

First and formost: Your point about alcohol causing diseases is frankly just a downright stupid comparison for the points you were trying to argue.

 I guarantee most sane people would rather die 40 years later from alcohol related cancer than to die in minutes from a gunshot wound. The two are frankly incomparable and that was really a poor point to bother arguing your case with. 

EVEN if you include those deaths, and we accept that there are far more deaths due to drugs and alcohol (which is true), and do you know how these deaths are caused? Most of these are entirely self inflicted, due to either short or long term alcohol poisoning, drunken accidents causing someone to fall off a building/fall in front of a car etc.

Ok there are people who havent been drinking who die from others mistakes (i.e. drunk drivers), but there are very strict laws on this, and people ever caught drink driving are severely punished.

Now guns, guns can kill anyone extremely easily, in fact its what they are literally designed to do. 

Even in the hands of well trained people, one accidental shot and that could be it, boom, someones life gone in an instant.
Also most gun deaths are not self-inflicted at all, dead as a result of others guns. 

Now I know its not really fair to say those who died of alcohol poisoning and self-inflicted alcohol related accidents isn't extremely sad, but in a way its kind of their own fault, they knew the risks they were taking and it backfired, horrific still, but especially in the long term cases its their own fault.

Now call me crazy but if I'm going to die I think I'd much rather die to my own stupidity on alcohol than to be shot dead by a stray bullet from some gunfight completely unrelated to me in any way. 

If you saw someone walking down the street with a bottle of cider or a baggy of cocaine would that instill any sense of fear into you? No probably not. Why? Because that stuff isnt lethal unless you overdose yourself. Someone cant just come up to you and kill you using alcohol or any sort of illegal drugs. 

A gun however? a gun can be used to kill as many people as you have bullets. 

Like seriously, I know you have a strong pro-gun agenda but if you really want to argue your point you shouldn't try to make poor comparisons of lethality. Anyone who isn't thick as two planks can see that guns can cause death far more easily and quickly than any drugs or alcohol.

&gt;Ok look. Here's the thing: Guns are FAR more dangerous than drugs or alcohol.

5% of households own a gun in England and there was only 124 or so deaths in 2011. Most were suicides.

http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compareyears/280/total_number_of_gun_deaths

8.2% used illegal drugs last year and there were 1496 deaths due to illicit drugs.

**If an equal percentage of population owned guns and did illicit drugs, there will always be more illicit drug deaths.**

&gt;I guarantee most sane people would rather die 40 years later from alcohol related cancer than to die in minutes from a gunshot wound. The two are frankly incomparable and that was really a poor point to bother arguing your case with.

This is not the point. Do you really think guns are more dangerous than illicit drugs or alcohol in the long run? By this logic cars are far more dangerous than smoking because smoking diseases don't materialize until later in life.

 But regardless cancers are not the only deaths associated with alcohol, alcohol also makes accidents far more likely. A lot of murders involve drunken victims and offenders. 

If an equal amount of people owned guns, drank alcohol or illicit drugs do you think there would be more gun deaths than both of the latter?

&gt;EVEN if you include those deaths, and we accept that there are far more deaths due to drugs and alcohol (which is true), and do you know how these deaths are caused? Most of these are entirely self inflicted, due to either short or long term alcohol poisoning, drunken accidents causing someone to fall off a building/fall in front of a car etc.

Stopping right here. By far the majority of gun deaths are suicides, not homicides or accidents.

""Where To Drink?
About a 15 minute walk away from the visiting supporters entrance, is the Thomas Frost pub on Walton Road. This Wetherspoon outlet, is a fair sized pub, that had a good mixture of home and away supporters, when I last visited. Rob Elmour adds; 'We found the Thomas Frost on Walton Road packed out, so we tried the Bradleys Wine Bar, which is just further down and across the road. It was very good. not a wine bar at all but a proper family run local with a good selection of beers including some real ales. Good mix of fans all very friendly.' More information can be found on the Bradleys Wine Bar website. Peter Bennett suggests the following; 'Pubs on Walton Lane or The Spellow outside Goodison are recommended.' 

Otherwise you can walk along Priory Road (where the away coaches drop off and park) or across Stanley Park, going away from Goodison over towards Anfield. The Arkles pub, the usual haunt of away fans visiting Anfield is also popular with away fans going to Goodison. It is about a 10-15 minute walk. At the end of Priory Road, turn right into Arkles Lane and the pub is up on the left. It also shows Sky Sports.

Tom Hughes adds 'The city centre is usually the best bet for a pre-match drink, There are hundreds of pubs available ranging from designer types to real-ale and saw dust bars. Near Lime Street Station there is the big house (the Vines) next to the Adelphi which is worth a visit. Nearer Goodison 'The Hermitage' (a friendly pub, 5/10 minutes walk up Walton Lane and under the bridge) on Queens Drive is also okay'. 

There is a Wetherspoons across the road from Lime Street Station, plus at the station itself, is the Head of Steam, which is listed in the CAMRA Good Beer Guide and also has a large screen showing sporting events. Also, the nearby Crown pub also recommended to me. Alcohol is served in the away section of the ground, including beer from the Club's sponsors Chang.""",0,1408760775,null,0,false,0,cjy1bl4,t3_2eblwf,t1_cjy1bl4,t3_2eblwf,null,1427400814,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

Don't worry about me like the amount of groups I go to break stereotypes its unreal.

My bipolar is controlled, there's a huge difference with what you percieve as bipolar and what it actually is to be bipolar 

Anyone with views regarding bipolar please go onto /r/bipolar, and just read through the posts there. As much as you believe its all about mania its really not

The meds I take don't actually do much they just stabilize me so they don't really get noticed

But I understand all those who think these things because people only hear about the negatives of bipolar. Personally I wouldn't be me without it, its great most of the time regarding creativity

I hope this has cleared a bit of tension

You get two absoulte engines of player with Matic and Khedira who could run for days and offer a a lot of defensive secruity but you also get another side. Both Khedira and Matic are great passers, both I think have been severely underrated in this category. Khedira moves the ball around perfectly with his short passes and can get the ball forward quickly and precisely, something that we were missing at Chelsea for a while. Matic on the other hand can provide both great short passes as well and some killer long balls. He collected 4 assists last season (more than Oscar and Willian) and he was our most defensive midfielder! With these two taking turns coming up and Fabregas given all the freedom he can with the added security behind him we can get the best out of all our midfielders.

He is also a ***huge*** Jose favorite and is getting fucked over by Madrid right now. I really can't see Jose not already have asking Chelsea to try and secure him.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Why would the UK leave any of these agreements?

Well, I don't know, either, but that's UKIP's whole shtick - get us out of the EU, it'll solve all our problems, and we'll worry about everything else afterwards.

&gt; Many nations I suspect follow the EU standard and in return are protected, why would the UK be any different?

If you read the first link I posted above: *There is no unconditional protection for these names on products both made and sold outside the EU. However there are a number of bilateral agreements with the EU for some level of enforcement. Agreements of this type exist between the EU and Australia, Canada, Chile &amp;c.*

How do we police it, and file appeals and stuff, if we're not in the EU?

&gt; *commonly agreed standard* more people that have to agree on something the longer it takes

Indeed, but 28 countries agreeing things together collectively is still much quicker and more efficient than making 28 separate agreements (or 28², for that matter). It ensures we don't have contradictions, too - that we don't promise one country a monopoly on something, and then make another trade agreement breaking that monopoly.

&gt; Has this happened to any of the other nations not in the EU but in Europe? I don't see why leaving the EU would negate all of these, surely could still adhere to a common EU standards on food?

I don't know the situation with Norway, but it's in the ever-closer relationship with the EU, not the opposite.

As I said before, UKIP's core policy is to get us out of the EU, and that presents loads of problems.

If we leave the EU then we still have to follow their standards when we sell our goods there, but we don't have any influence on setting those standards.

And wrt Norway, I see that it ""is not a member state of the European Union (EU), but is closely associated with the Union through its membership in the European Economic Area (EEA), in the context of being a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member.""

Now UKIP's whole spiel is *get us out of the EU, everything else comes second*, but I don't think they make any distinction between the EU, the EEA or the EFTA. I have to admit that I don't know the details, but I'm in favour of European collaboration, and I don't care about the name of the treaty we use to implement that.

&gt; Thought the point of the EU was that we would only deal with one?

Well, exactly.

&gt; Are you sure they don't, admittedly I have only recently started to really look into them, but I find it strange to think they have to been covered.

If you're serious then the more you look into UKIP, the more you'll discover their complete dearth of credibility.

&gt; I agree with you entirely, however painting their approach as stupid denies any possible merits a discussion may hold.

I thank you for your patience today - after I wrote my last reply, I did worry that I'd been a bit of a knobhead. 

However it's a pretty regular thing for people to post questions here, and then to argue with the responses that they dislike. Most self-post questions in here are not genuine questions, but rhetorical ones - they author has already made their mind up, and basically posting here for confirmation or to show how clever they are.

This applies particularly to stuff related to UKIP because, I'm sorry to be so direct, their approach *is* fucking stupid. 

I'm sorry to say that, and I have to tell you that this is a matter of particular frustration to me - I wish I could see better how to improve dialogue.

But IMO if you're asking ""what about UKIP?"" then you've already put the cart before the horse - UKIP is a proposed solution, but before one implements a solution it's necessary to know first what problems you're trying to address.

A lot of UKIP's voters turn to it as a solution to the problems of immigration, for example, and the reason UKIP appeal is that no-one else can offer quick and easy answers. UKIP are able to offer easy answers to these problems, because they'll never have to deal with the ramifications. Leaving the EU allows us to control immigration from the eastern enlargement countries, for example, but it brings with it all these other problems, ones which UKIP just handwave away, because those problems are basically irrelevant to the brand UKIP is selling.

&gt; what I wanted to discuss, namely *Does the potential stagnation of Europe lend more credence to UKIP?*

Well, I told you already, I don't really know what you mean by ""potential stagnation"", but if I guess right then you may find my answers a tad unsatisfying, because I don't see promoting the economy as a primary duty of the state.

I see the state's primary duties as protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and I don't assume unlimited perpetual economic expansion as desirable, even if it was possible. And I don't think it is possible - if you learned in economics class that it is, then I think you had a bad teacher. I don't believe we can continue burning fossil fuels forever, and it seems to me like the economics-class model unlimited expansion depends on the pretence of unlimited natural resources.

I believe that GDP is a very poor metric, because I don't think that money makes us happy - it doesn't give us more free time to spend with our families, for example. Now that might seem like a stupid hippy thing to say, but politics is fundamentally about achieving goals, about how we want to live our lives. If your primary political goal is expanding the economy, then I have to ask why you chose that one? Personally, I consider wealth inequality a more pressing concern, and social mobility a more worthwhile aim.

Having made that disclaimer, the mainstream parties are the ones which are credible on international affairs - Lib-Dem, Lab and Con all buy into the current global neo-liberal circlejerk, and the only reason you don't hear them being vocal about it or arguing with each other is because they're largely in agreement. There will be some debate on the details as the election approaches, but none of them are advocating we leave the EU, as UKIP are.

If I use the example of stilton cheese or yacht certification, it's because they're the first things that occur to me - that I happen to know about, or which are familiar commonplace examples. The same principles apply to automotives and aerospace.

Europe and the USA are the two largest global markets for cars - I think, if you look into it, you'll find that automotive type approval was a big deal about 20 years ago. The words ""homogenisation process"" spring to mind in reference to how the EU unified its standards for automotives, but I think moves are now underway to eventually unify US and EU standards - at present those are very different, and they largely prevent the same models of cars being sold in Europe and N America (Canada just piggybacks on US Federal requirements).

UKIP's policy on this matter is to leave the EU - that would allow us to buy cheaper cars built without crumple zones or airbags, but I don't see that as advantageous. We would then have no input into the EU standards process. You ask if UKIP is credible, I hope that answers your question. You talk about ""nimbly"" negotiating trade agreements with other countries (UKIP like to emphasise how much we have in common with Canada and Aus), but automotive and aerospace standards are hugely complicated and take years to draft - we don't want to be doing it twice. 

The Labour and Tory leaderships live and breathe this stuff - there is now an established political career path that involves working as a MP's assistant &amp;/or in the party's research unit for a number of years, before standing as MP. George Osborne did this, for example. If you look into this I hope you'll be as horrified as I am about how cliquey and nepotistic it all is, but at least the result has been that our leaders are well mentored, understand the global arena and don't come up with silly ideas like sticking up 2 fingers to the EU. Oh, UKIP are constantly lying about the costs of the EU, by the way.

The final thing I want to mention is that South America is yet a divided market - the economies you mention as booming consist of a number of countries, collectively described as ""emerging"" and ""developing"". There were riots in Rio this year, Venezuela is ""sliding into chaos"" and Argentina is in the middle of an $82billion debt restructuring / crisis / bankruptcy which could see the country falling back into chaos. The trade agreements we lack with these countries are because they're not ready for it.

true,LocutusOfBorges,eu,York / Derby,"&gt; I may be drawing myself into a horrific argument here but wasn't Christopher Hitchens against the Bush administration? He said that the only thing he could agree with him on is the invasion of Iraq because it would stop Saddam Hussein from using his country as his personal playground. 

Given that that's the single most historically significant action the Bush administration took, that's the thing that I expect will stick as the years go by. But, yes- that's what I was referring to, primarily. 

&gt;You also mentioned that there are appropriate ways of dealing with faith schools; I'd like to hear the other side of the coin on issue. How would you deal with them?

*Engaging* with them. The sneering abrasiveness the New Atheists treat the things with isn't conducive to dealing with their problems at all- all it does is give them ammunition to put up a defence. 

Naturally, I'd prefer that faith schools didn't exist at all- they've no place in formal education in a secular society. But given that we're not dealing with a clean slate, and *plenty of faith schools provide excellent educations*, a more appropriate method of dealing with them would be to accept their existence, and focus energies on *actually enforcing* things like mandatory sex ed, for example- with active encouragement of anonymous reporting from within the student body. 

So much activism in this sort of respect is focused on abolishing the things altogether- that's simply not going to happen in the foreseeable future.

But Dortmund spiked too hard with too much young talent to keep them with revenue for salaries. It was almost they should have kept some of the older players to temper their team till they could afford to increase salaries and build slower. But FSG has slowly allowed young talent to gather underneath the seemingly aging side. Its worked brilliantly, buy'em low, sell'em high. And have commodity that no one else has to make young talent flourish, Brendan Rodgers. Its effing maddening to think of were we were 3-4 years ago.

I've lived here for a long time and as far as I know there isn't really a City-specific bar, but there are a few good spots that show Premier League games every week. 

The first would be [Brit's Pub](http://www.britspub.com/) in downtown Minneapolis on Nicollet mall. Brit's is a good place to go on the weekends to catch a match. There usually isn't a huge crowd and it's mainly Arsenal, Chelsea, and United fans but you'd be able to catch a City game there. Food is pretty good (especially breakfast for the early weekend games) and there are usually some OK beer specials ($4 Amstel/Heineken or whatever). 

Another good spot to watch some games would be the [Nomad World Pub](http://www.nomadpub.com/calendar/) on Cedar near the U of M West Bank Campus. This is a great soccer friendly bar with decent drink specials. Downside is they don't serve food but there's some great options close by you can walk to and bring some food in! The Nomad is also your HQ for the Minnesota United games (/r/minnesotaunited).

I've been to both and frequent Brit's mainly because it's easier for me to catch a bus there. I hope this helps a bit.

There are those that are opposed to the increased and overt commercialization of sport (which doesn't necessarily make you a socialist), but most people realise that in order to be competitive you have to do things like sell donuts. 

Many would look to the German model and suggest that success can be had without using a corporate model, but the idea of that happening in England is pure fantasy. So we take what we can get. As far as corporations go, I can't think of many in this sport that have gotten more credit than FSG. 

When corporate issues such as ticket prices, sponsorships, etc come up, you see a sharp divide between American and English supporters. The American experience has been one of commercialized sport for decades, whereas in many ways the Premiership is still in its relative infancy. What seems distasteful to a Liverpudlian will seem as moaning and ingratitude to the American fan. Fortunately, the only places these fan experiences typically overlap is on the Internet.

It was average 16ish degrees in the North West a week or so ago, and that's in August. How would any monkey survive? 

Also, there would be a huge public safety issue. In the UK, people who go into the wild for walks etc are very lucky in that there are very few dangerous animals. I'd probably say that deer are the most dangerous animal we have, and deer aren't exactly looking for a fight. Monkeys, however, are pretty fucking dangerous. Chimpanzees have massive strength and agility, and gorillas have HUGE fangs; this would destroy the relative safety of exploring the UK's outdoors, as monkeys are very territorial and aggressive.

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"&gt; Although Sunderland boss Gus Poyet remains hopeful that the club can re-sign last year’s joint top scorer Fabio Borini, the Black Cats are now looking at a second season-long for the Italian, rather than a £14million permanent switch, after using a large portion of their transfer budget on £10m capture Jack Rodwell.

&gt; Ex-Sunderland loanee Danny Welbeck has been mentioned as an alternative to Borini, with Manchester United reportedly prepared to let the England international leave Old Trafford.

&gt; Poyet would be interested in Welbeck, yet only on loan, rather than the £15m price tag which has supposedly been placed on the 23-year-old’s head.

&gt; Sunderland are also looking at potential options at the back, with only six defenders currently in the first-team squad.

&gt; Poyet’s fellow Uruguayan, Sebastian Coates, has been mooted as an option for the defensive void after the centre-half was one of five players made available by Liverpool earlier this week.

However, with Sunderland only able to loan one player per Premier League club, the Black Cats are waiting to see what happens with Borini.


Please take Borini over that carthorse Welbeck. They better come up with that £14m from somewhere. Then if they wish to loan Coates they can. In all probability Borini is now more likely to go back to Italy with Napoli interested.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;Now UKIP's whole spiel is get us out of the EU, everything else comes second, but I don't think they make any distinction between the EU, the EEA or the EFTA. I have to admit that I don't know the details, but I'm in favour of European collaboration, and I don't care about the name of the treaty we use to implement that.

I sure we would remain in such bodies for trade as not doing would be idiotic.


&gt;However it's a pretty regular thing for people to post questions here, and then to argue with the responses that they dislike. Most self-post questions in here are not genuine questions, but rhetorical ones - they author has already made their mind up, and basically posting here for confirmation or to show how clever they are.
 
Most people are 16.


&gt;I'm sorry to say that, and I have to tell you that this is a matter of particular frustration to me - I wish I could see better how to improve dialogue.

I would suggest that you seriously try entertaining the concept and see where the advantages can be found, most notably the speed of trade a flexibility it offers. 

&gt;But IMO if you're asking ""what about UKIP?"" then you've already put the cart before the horse - UKIP is a proposed solution, but before one implements a solution it's necessary to know first what problems you're trying to address.

Well In several interview I have heard Farage state that he wants Europe for trade but not laws

&gt;Leaving the EU allows us to control immigration from the eastern enlargement countries, for example, but it brings with it all these other problems, ones which UKIP just handwave away, because those problems are basically irrelevant to the brand UKIP is selling.

I see immigration as one more interesting points of discussion, the UK is desirable enough, people will come, but we just get to be more picky.

&gt;Well, I told you already, I don't really know what you mean by ""potential stagnation"",

[Japan, their economy basically didn't grow for 20 years, several economist are now suggesting that Europe could be on the brink of something similar] (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/17/europe-lack-growth-japanese-stagnation-austerity-germany)


&gt;I don't assume unlimited perpetual economic expansion as desirable, even if it was possible. 

Technology tends to beat this argument of a regular basis, fracking being the latest example

&gt;And I don't think it is possible 

There are a lot of people of this planet, many of whom we do no trade with, to say no more growth is possible is I think very wrong. 

&gt;it seems to me like the economics-class model unlimited expansion depends on the pretence of unlimited natural resources.

Technology again destroys this

&gt;Personally, I consider wealth inequality a more pressing concern, and social mobility a more worthwhile aim.

Well if the EU stagnates or worse goes into deflation and depression, the UK could see southern European levels of unemployment, which by some measures are already the same as the 1920s 

&gt;Europe and the USA are the two largest global markets for cars

At the moment, just wait until Asia develops a large middle class, this is why the next 20 years are so important and a tanking EU that we are stuck in could be a problem. 


&gt;UKIP's policy on this matter is to leave the EU - that would allow us to buy cheaper cars built without crumple zones or airbags, but I don't see that as advantageous.

Nor do I, but I don't think this is an express policy of theres

&gt;We would then have no input into the EU standards process. 

Yes that would be annoying


&gt;You talk about ""nimbly"" negotiating trade agreements with other countries (UKIP like to emphasise how much we have in common with Canada and Aus), but automotive and aerospace standards are hugely complicated and take years to draft - we don't want to be doing it twice.

Well thats a matter of economics, if it is viable companies will, there are huge markets out there  


&gt;The final thing I want to mention is that South America is yet a divided market - the economies you mention as booming consist of a number of countries, collectively described as ""emerging"" and ""developing"". There were riots in Rio this year, Venezuela is ""sliding into chaos"" and Argentina is in the middle of an $82billion debt restructuring / crisis / bankruptcy which could see the country falling back into chaos. The trade agreements we lack with these countries are because they're not ready for it.

Lets pretend the EU does stagnate, as good as 0% growth for the next 10 or 20 years, EU nations as they have done will continue to fight among themselves as the situation get more dire, quite rightly wanting the best deal for their nation. While all this is going on Asia and South america are rising, growing at 5%, a fair rate, so there economy will got from 20Trillion to 32Trillion in 10 years then 32 Trillion to 53 Trillion. Now that is presuming all goes well, but you can see the problem, in the space of 20 years Europe goes from a comparable sized market to one that is almost half the size.  Trade with Europe is not going to be the UK's main source of growth Asia and South America are, our economy need to adapt to face that reality, now Europe is all well and good when things are fine, they have even managed this crisis fairly well, but 10 or 20 years without growth and the problems that will go with that. Not pretty. Hence my question  *Does the potential stagnation of Europe lend more credence to UKIP?* To which I think it does, do I advocate leaving Europe? No, but do I think such a scenario makes a stronger argument for leaving , yes!  ",0,1408783782,null,0,false,0,cjy7xy0,t3_2e9gvo,t1_cjy7xy0,t1_cjy30p1,null,1427397594,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Bear in mind the founding aims of the EU were to combat the extreme forms of nationalism that had devastated the continent during the 1st and 2nd world wars. Not to regulate the wattage of cleaning products. It's hard to imagine how 2200W hoovers are going to result in the 4th Reich. 

As others have said, the EUs justification of the importance of this is dubious at best and the maths doesn't really hold up. At the end of the day, if 2200W hoovers are really good and people want to buy them then that is entirely their own choice. Ultimately as consumers they have to pay for their own electricity and if they need more then that is creating a market for more power generation. There is nothing wrong with that. 

It is not the fault of consumers for buying products that are good. It's an example of the ethos within the EU that feels it can meddle in anything it wants, no matter how large or small. It is the disregard they give to national governments, whilst simultaneously preaching that their democratic legitimacy comes from the fact democratic governments signed up to the EU.

I did not claim that Iran started the war. Saddam clearly did for the reasons you mentioned. However, he did so with no formal US support in terms of money or arms. He only started minor support in 1982 when Iran started winning on the battlefield and more substansive support when the US started thinking he had a serious chance of losing.

In addition it would be wrong to claim that they directly provided him with chemical weapons, instead more accurate that they provided the materials to make them. 

In both there is a difference between what was claimed before and what you claimed. The US supported Iraq to prevent it from losing and collapsing to what they believed to be a worse enemy, not because they wanted to use them against another enemy. If that were the case they would have provided the important training, battlefield logistics and weaponry that would have provided Iraq with a much greater military advantage from the very beginning of the war and encouraged him to attempt to overthrow the regime rather than merely occupying a small portion of land to gain a diplomatic victory and concessions, which was Saddam's initial aim.",0,1408786703,null,0,false,0,cjy8ej9,t3_2eabhc,t1_cjy8ej9,t1_cjy8b5l,null,1427397330,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It is very clear that a war is not considered a jihad if the intention is to force convert people to Islam, to make territorial gains for economic purposes, to annex nations for colonial purposes or to settle disputes.

There is argument that the establishment of the caliphate is about strengthening Islam, but the convert or die policy removes it's status as jihad...

Been a while since I studied there, the union bars seem a lot less busy now than in my day but I don't doubt it is still very social. Edinburgh is pretty weak for nightclubs but very strong for pubs. There are also loads of societies (student ran clubs).

Not sure where you're coming from, but Edinburgh is a city and has a strong student population. It is a highly residential ""lived in"", pleasant city, very walkable and good transport. Rental costs are a bit high and quality a bit low though.

The uni is or was known for a lot of ""yahs"" (rich English kids studying History of Art). I'm not really sure what the issue is meant to be there, but people do mention it so figured I shouldn't leave it out.

There's loads of international students at the uni, and in Edinburgh generally as it is a very cosmopolitan city.

Trying to reduce carbon emissions to prevent global warming is an absurd and ineffectual way to address climate change which won't work.

Perhaps those goals are noble, but I for one have no ambition to party like its 1699. I love my car, I love this computer, I love the creature comforts of modern life.

The real answers to climate change, if there are any, lie in innovation and new technologies. Areas like carbon capture being an excellent example.

I'm so glad I live in a country that takes a much healthier approach to guns than the UK or the US. Here in Canada gun control proponents got gun registry passed, it didn't do shit in the end so the government announced plans to scrap it.

Chicken littles said there would be an epidemic of gun violence afterward. It got scrapped anyways and homicides and gun crime declined to record lows in the two years following the repeal.

true,Fluorophore1,null,null,"*1) What's the university atmosphere like over there ?* 

I'd say the atmosphere is overall very good.  The university has an excellent reputation and the city is lively, so there are lots of things for students to do besides studying.  The flip side is that the university has had criticism in the past few years for poor student feedback and for the student union doing things that are unrepresentative of what the whole student body wants.

*2) Are there dorms and stuff or is it like a house if residence for students and what it like ?* 

In the UK dorms are very rare.  Most of the student accommodation is flats where you will have your own private room with sink, desk and bed.  The flat will be shared with 3 to 11 other people (depending on your halls) and you will share a kitchen and bathroom.  The bigger flats sometimes have two kitchens and two bathrooms.  Halls are the cheapest accommodation you'll find in the city because the rent includes heading, electricity and internet as standard.  Hall rents start from £80 per week.  For a private rental, the costs will be around £100 per week but that doesn't include your electric, heating and internet.


*3) What's the city like in terms of things to do for fun on the weekend etc.* 

There's something for everyone in Edinburgh.  Drinking, dancing, art and theatre, lots of sports clubs, etc. 

*4) How many international students go to the university ?*

Zillions.  Particularly on postgraduate courses, but if you're undergraduate there will still be plenty of international students. Edinburgh is quite liberal and friendly with low crime (at least in the old town and student areas!) so no worries there. 

Also check out /r/Edinburgh_University and pages like [the international office](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/visiting-exchange/overview) and [accommodation services](http://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/accommodation/)

true,baddada77,lfc68,,"&gt; JH: How did Milan get the best out of him? 

&gt; Often they played him on his own up front. Not everyone agrees that this is his best position though. **For one thing, he likes to come short and involve himself in the play. Therefore the man who should be in the penalty area often isn't.** Prandelli had to remind him that he is there to finish moves not start them.

&gt; Also, if you're on your own up front, you're the centre-backs reference point. You'll get kicked more. That only gets Balotelli more and more frustrated and he loses focus. Is that what you want? **Some believe he should return to where he played at Inter and at City, out on the left so he's not as much of a target, and can cut inside or pick up second balls.**

This is what I thought. He likes to come short and link the play. Sturridge does this too. I have no problem with them alternating as a twosome with one dropping deep to link play and the other staying in the box. That should work well. 

I'd also forgotten he used to play on the left for Inter (it was a while ago). That was where he first announced himself as a serious talent. He would cut in and smash long shots, he scored some belters back then as a kid.

Further, they did not intend to occupy Iraq, merely to create a theocratic regime sympathetic to their interests (and counter to Saddam's, the established forces in the region and yes, the wests)

Where I strongly disagree with you, as does the evidence, is the threat that Iran posed to Iraq. Ayatollah Khomeini called on Iraqis to overthrown Saddam's government, called for Islamic revolution, had request cross border skirmishes and were believed, even if wrongly to have been behind the 1979-80 riots towards an islamic revolution. Considering there were a number of assassination attempts which killed 20 government officials the idea of winning a small term military victory to force the Iranians to stop their efforts was, in part, a defensive action.

This was augmented further when, in 1982, Iraq had been thrown out of most of Iranian territory and sued for peace, which was rejected by Iran for logical geopolitical reasons in favour of a continued war with the parital intention of encouraging regime change and revolution amongst minorities. If you don't think sending 100,000 revolutionary guard troops into Iraq to try and break their lines was not a threat then it will be problematic to convince you otherwise.",0,1408797666,null,0,false,0,cjya9kc,t3_2eabhc,t1_cjya9kc,t1_cjy94fz,null,1427396409,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He/she was visited by representatives of the BBC, not Doctor Who. Also, as much as I sympathise with the person who was running the site, they are within their rights to take measures to stop them. It may not be the most philanthropic thing in the world, but at the end of the day the BBC are a business.

This has nothing to do with the guys at Doctor Who, and everything to do with the BBC. Boycotting Doctor Who won't achieve anything, and it doesn't help anyone.

How I deal with this is alt tab for 40 minutes or so, or maybe go do something IRL for a while then come back. (Or even just wait 10 minutes to avoid getting grouped with the same players)

Well, then you follow them, let them be the centerfold of the game. If you're going to push the lanes without him, you're 4v5. However, if you're pushing HIS lane as 4, you are 5v5.

Usually I get carries that do that, they think that their Sven needs to get 6 items before a fight, so we usually just go follow him around as 4, using him as bait etc to force a 5v5 encounter.

I think finding a job will be the hardest part and that will dictate everything else. I am pretty specialised in my skill set so I can't help you with general job info too much.  [Reed](http://www.reed.co.uk/),  [monster](http://jobsearch.monster.co.uk/) and [indeed](http://www.indeed.co.uk/) seem to be highly recommended job sites. The local rags I know of are [Wales online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/), which also has a job section. 

Personally I'd suggest you look at areas such as Cardiff, Swansea or at a push Newport. The reason being that they have great links to places like London, which I guess will be on your list of places to see. Houses are cheaper up the valleys but public transport can really suck, esp on a Sunday. Websites such as [zoopla](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/) and [rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/) will give you an idea of rent and cost. You do get less for your money from what I understand of the US house market. 

Not sure about if you have your driving licence but I hear that car insurance is more expensive (compared to Hungary at least!). Traffic along the m4 can be bad. Fuel prices are also much worse so try not to have a large commute. Train/bus tickets are not much better unless you book well in advance and travel outside of peak times.

As far as I know only Windows Nokia Lumias do this as iPhone and others have blocked it unless your ISP agrees.

From what I gather 3 can't actually do much about this.  Well, they never did to me.  

The downside is you have to have a Windows Phone.  After careful consideration I decided it wasn't worth the free unlimited tethering if I had to use such a shitty phone.

It doesn't tell you a lot, and some of what it does tell you is misleading. It's not great to recommend it to someone as a way to find out what is available.

I just checked it for my exchange, it still doesn't say TalkTalk has LLUed it even though they did it over a year ago. The only way you'd know this is if you went to TalkTalk or one of their wholesalers and checked.

It's a great way to continue the ""BT is the only thing I can get"" myth, even though getting BT means being able to choose from many more companies than that.

As I said, sites like ISP Review and ThinkBroadband are a lot better at telling you about ISPs. Find one you like and see if it is available. It probably is, since most of them use BT's network and the rest also use TalkTalk's network (and they're LLUing seriously small exchanges now, like mine)

In an ideal world there'd be some proper impartial website that listed what infrastructure exists and what ISPs use it. Samknows could probably do that if he cared.

&gt; any case they will pretty much all promise to cover you

Any quality ISP will let you check before you order, and the result of this is fairly concrete. Very scummy ones might promise and then fail to deliver.

&gt;
&gt; I think he can be. I would be cautious though. Don't believe that it will be different this time. That's what they said when Balotelli went to City and when he went to Milan and, as discussed above, there was more reason to believe it would be different and Milan, the club he supported as a boy, than anywhere else. I feel it'd also be arrogant for Rodgers to believe that he holds the key to unlocking the potential within Balotelli. The likes of Roberto Mancini and Cesare Prandelli did too.

I liked this. A lot of people on this sub have been insisting that Balotelli's temperamental side will quickly and easily disappear because of Brendan and Steve Peters, or how well the fans will treat him. I hope that's the case, and it'll all definitely help. This was a great deal for the club that I really think will pay off (success-wise, it definitely pays off financially), but it's unreasonable to think that there won't be problems along the way.

true,BoredPenslinger,,Salford White,"Especially when we don't have the players for it. You need a solid anchor, and then someone who can play off the front two. Both of these need to be athletic and cover a lot of ground. We've got none of that.

We've got central midfielders (Austin/Tonge/Murphy/Bianchi) who can spray it about and shoot from distance, but have no legs. We have no wingers. We've got a gaggle of centre halves who aren't good enough. A diamond won't work.

Why don't we play a system that our players fit?

Play an extra centre half. He can float about and cover the other two. Tell Byram to pull his fucking finger out and bomb on, and let Warnock get forward a bit on the other side.

The three central midfielders can ponce about a bit, and take it in turns to trot forward and shoot, or hang back and take the ball from centre half. Sheer numbers means they'll HAVE to intercept something.

Up front, let Sharp be the poacher he can be, and then use either Smith as a target man, or one of the others as a nuisance centre forward that Sharp can hang off.

Something like:

GK: Silvestri

DC:Cooper
DC: Pearce
DC: Bellusci

WB: Byram
WB: Warnock

MC: Austin
MC: Murphy
MC: Bianchi

SC: Sharp
SC: Smith


Then again, we've just equalised, so that'll paper over the cracks for another eight or nine minutes.

But there are other ways to get money out of the business. for example the business might decide to buy other assets such as cars, a big mansion, holiday for the owners, travel expenses. As owners you can decide to virtually expense anything from your own company. the cars, house and everything else would be under the companies name though.. but seeing as you own the company.. it doesn't really matter.

I'm guessing your parents have other investors? if they do, then approving these expenses will be harder. this kind of business model will only work with consultancy basis.

a business to make money is run very very differently to the one described above.

Niddry Street, Niddry Street South and Niddry’s Wynd are thought to be named after Robert Niddry (or Nudry) who was an Edinburgh magistrate in 1437.

Both have slightly complicated tiered cashback schemes: Elite starts at 1%, then increases to 2% after you pass £15k in a year then reduces to 1.5% after £50k. Business gradually ramps up to 1.25% from £10k. Downside with elite is a huge £120 annual fee, so the Amex above is generally better, but could work for large spends, especially if MasterCard is a requirement. The Business card has no fee.

However, if you receive a gift or bequest from a patient or their relative, you should consider the potential damage this could cause to your patients’ trust in you and the public’s trust in the profession. You should refuse gifts or bequests where they could be perceived as an abuse of trust.

The reason we're looking for a midfielder is that we're switching from the 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3, so we need midfielders that are multitalented, who can be box to box. Montolivo, who tragically suffered an injury before the World Cup, is set to miss half the season, and with Essien looking like he really can't keep up at this level, we're in need of a centre midfielder who can do a job for us for at least 6 months. Our current targets are Van Ginkel, Rabiot (youngster from PSG) and Dzemaili from Napoli. I'd prefer Rabiot from what I've seen, he's more of a playmaker.

The fact that he is a real douche bag is a relevant point, since what the the guy you're responding to it saying is that he is a bad figurehead for atheism. Dawkins is so rude and says so many dumb things, but cos he wrote a book he is seen as the voice of atheism in the media. I'm an atheist, but I don't want him speaking for me. We're not talking about whether his specific arguments are right or wrong. His arguments are basically old anyway, it is not like he was the first person to think of them or write them.

Not only that, but if you'll allow me to be cynical for a moment, a lot of the intellectuals who respect Dawkins are popular intellectuals who are writing for similar popular audiences. You have surely noticed there is a definite bubble of people like NDT, Lawrence Krauss, Dawkins, Harris, Bill Nye, Dennett (to an extent), AC Grayling, etc who constantly appear together on the same stages, give each other's books favourable reviews, share one another's blog posts etc. Clearly their careers benefit from their friendships, but that crowd isn't necessarily reflective of what people from academic departments in general think, especially when the scientists in that group (NDT, Dawkins, Harris) get on to the subject of philosophy, or social science (eg their claims about the evils of religion).

true,Pixa,null,null,"In the UK, most Computer Science courses will be 3 year courses.  They'll start off with the basics: Programming, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture (processors and operating systems), Maths; then they'll build on that in second year, introducing topics that the departments research is focused; and then the final year you'll typically get a choice from a range of specialised subjects that the professors in your department have some sort of research interest or background in.

For example, I went to the University of Bath, which is big into Human Computer Interaction, so I had a module of that in second year; and they also do some research with Compilers, so I took a module of that in final year.  As far as syllabus goes, the place to look is in the final year, and see if any of the module choices sound particularly interesting to you.

Some places may do Computer Science with &lt;something&gt;, in which case you'll get a 50\50 to 70\30 split of Computer Science and &lt;something&gt; modules, and some places may do other computery courses but with a particular focus - perhaps on game development or web development.

As far as having a computer science background goes, it's not vital, but the people on my course who did better (especially in first year) were those who were interested in the subject, and could program already.  If nothing else, have a glance at the programming languages you'll be taught in first year, so you'll have one less thing to panic about in the first few weeks.

I strongly recommend taking a year in industry.  It gives you a no-strings-attached way to try out a particular job for a year to see if that's the kind of thing you like or not.  It also gives a nice infusion of cash 2/3rds of the way through uni.  If you have a great year, you may get to go back to a job or place on the graduate scheme.  If you have an awful year, you know what kinds of places you don't want to go, but you still get some experience to put on a CV.

Do visit the universities if you can, they'll probably have open days coming up.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I suspect a lot more is known about them from the released French hostages who were held together with James Foley last year. They have previously said on the news that one of the conditions of their release was that they didn't talk publicly about details of the kidnappers. There also seems to be a tacit acknowledgement the hostages are likely held somewhere in Raqqa province in Syria on the Iraqi border. It's effectively the 'capital' of ISIL/ISIS/IS (*or whatever they're calling themselves this week*). 

Anyway, my guess is government intelligence agencies probably know **a lot** more about the kidnappers than they are letting on. They also know about 500 people with UK citizenship have traveled to Syria or Iraq. It's not so many that the chaps over at GCHQ/SiS can't be going through and coming up with a shortlist of likely suspects.

At any rate, it's now about saving face for the government, particularly in front of the USA who I think even at a fairly high level don't quite appreciate that there will be a great many muslims (Pakistani in particular) who speak with a British-asian-mockney accent, many of whom may only ever have spent a summer or two here visiting family or studying. Finding and killing/capturing somebody that they can assign blame to is probably their main objective now, so they can be seen to 'right the wrongs'.

It's a bit heavy/depressing and maybe difficult if you've been learning a more southern dialect, but it's a good novel. 

Also have a look at some of Bethan Gwanas' novels. Again, they're mostly in north Walian dialect, but they're good and she's written a few aimed specifically at adult Welsh learners.

I personally like *Dan Gadarn Goncrit* by Mihangel Morgan, but it's quite  a weird novel so depends a lot on your taste!

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm not actually that surprised. Countries like the USA and Australia have significant political, cultural and economic investment in the UK. The last thing they probably want to see at this stage is a sudden and unknown game changer in the UK, particularly one that might set the precedent for other important trading nations to have their own inflamed separatist campaigns. I don't think they have any principled problem with the Scottish having an independent nation.

Unfortunately, while I suspect he probably did it thinking it would in someway help achieve his own aims of the union remaining together, the Scots can have a pretty unusual response to this sort of thing. On the whole the Scots are proud to a fault, and any hint or perception that they are being *""talked down""* seems to provoke a kind of reverse-psychology effect.

Having said that, the read between the lines message of what he is saying is that internationally and diplomatically nobody is interested in an independent Scotland, and if the Scots are expecting the world to part the tides and help them find a little niche then they are mistaken. They'll need to carve out their own international and diplomatic objectives and then be seen to be valuable if they want anybody to listen to them. The same also goes for their industries and business. 

I know some people might read that and think *""Oh well, whatever, we're only 4 million people, why do we want to tell the world what to do anyway?""* But I actually think that kind of little-scotlander approach is very disappointing. The Scots strict national sense of fairness is actually really important. A lot of important Scottish people have genuinely helped to make the world a safer and fairer place by exporting their views to the world. But unfortunately that only works if people are actually prepared to listen to you, and you have access to forums through which you can express those views (forums like the UN Security Council). It might just end up being a case of *don't know what you've got til it's gone*. ",0,1408808202,null,0,false,0,cjydfyq,t3_2ecua6,t1_cjydfyq,t3_2ecua6,null,1427394803,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

While employment contracts can be varied over the course of employment because the both the relationship and everyone's needs change over time. However, variations must be reasonable and the law recognises that employers have the advantage when bargaining.

At one company, when we were looking to update our employment contracts, we wanted to add a no-compete clause. We were advised that the clause could only apply for new employees because it wouldn't be a reasonable variation for existing employees - which seemed totally fair to me. I would have thought the situation would be the same here, they might be able to impose a requirement like this on new employees (but there are restrictions on docking pay), but I doubt they could on existing ones.

Also, you can't be demoted without cause and I believe it has to be part of either a disciplinary or, more rarely, in a redundancy situation (don't need so many managers, offer to make you redundant or give you a lower level job).

You should document this:

* keep the contract addition
* keep a diary starting with what's already happened and including anything that happens in the future
* be prepared to file a formal grievance if you are demoted

I think you should consider talking to ACAS and/or CAB.

If you actually are demoted or your wages docked, then you should talk to an employment law specialist - many will do this no win, no fee. They'll be able to give you good advice about how to best seek redress. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much you can do until your job is affected (although anything that happens before then could show a pattern of behaviour - hence the diary).

It's a shithole. Let's be completely truthful here. The whole place is a fucking mess. Unstable politics, crazy religion, too many different ethnicities/sects who all hate each other. And total lack of strong, non-corrupt leadership. Plus a generally poor and shitty populace on top of that. There is NOTHING realistic that we can do to fix that. The only possible option is a 50+ year occupation with massive troop deployment to stabilise it and let a whole generation grow up under the new rule. Obviously that is ridiculous.

The sooner we leave the whole area alone, the better. Obviously it's bad that ISIS are massacring people, so we can lend a hand bombing key targets and slowing them down. I have no problem delivering aid (NOT WEAPONS) to people in need either.

What we, the UK, really need to do is focus on energy independence. When we don't need their oil or gas, we don't need to worry about the Middle East.

Now to address certain players.

**Costa**:

Costa looked frustratingly weak in the first half. I was unimpressed with his hold up play, and it just seemed like he couldn't hold off the Leicester City defenders. In the second half, he looked much better and settled into the game.

Words cannot describe my happiness about Costa. Torres would have been at the edge of the box for that. Glad he's off to a great start, and he'll be key for us.

**Oscar**:

Oscar looked average in the first as well. Fabregas wasn't getting much space, so I expected Oscar to step up and take the initiative to be our play maker.

The second half was a different story, as he looked much better. I think today was one of the best passing performances we've seen from Oscar. And my oh my, did you guys see Oscar with that through ball to Iva? That's all we've wanted, and glad to see him deliver. Hoping he keeps improving and proving all the doubters like me wrong.

**Ivanovic**:

I think **Felipe Luis** is going to have a tough time breaking into the team anytime soon. I was one of Iva's critics last season, his offensive end product was below par. He's seemed to work on it, and he's been pivotal. Glad he's doing so well. Keep fighting Luis!

**Courtois**:

MOTM. Easily. Looks so confident. Glad we have him.

**Schurrle**:

Please don't shoot bad shots. You've got a striker now Dre. No more worries.

**Hazard**:

Didn't do too well. Couple moment of brilliance, and I'm happy with that.

I know he played very well today behind the striker, but there were multiple instances where he lost possession by dribbling and being crowded out by Palace defenders. His goal came when he had a lot of space. I think he'd do well as a sort of wide forward/playmaker who cuts inside and plays a very fluid role. Being out wide should give him more space to work with, and he seems to be the type of player who thrives with space.

Plus this would allow Ravel to play behind the striker.

However if we end up playing with two strikers I think Zarate would do well either as a supporting striker or behind the striker because his strike partner or both strikers will draw defenders.

One thing I think he can't do well is play as a lone striker, he'd just be crowded out and wouldn't contribute much to the game.",0,1408809726,null,0,false,0,cjye0rl,t3_2eden2,t1_cjye0rl,t3_2eden2,null,1427394532,3,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,3

Perhaps the ref was simply part of the 80%-ish of Italians who are reportedly ""glad to see Balotelli leave Italy,"" or the larger percentage who blamed him for Italy's failure at the World Cup this summer, despite the fact that he was the only striker to score a goal. 

All I know is that when something wrong happens, it's not trivializing it to put it into perspective and context.

It doesn't mean you can get on a Norwich train from London, and stop for lunch in Colchester and dinner in Stowmarket, because the validity of the ticket does not include those unnecessary intermediate breaks.

You could, however, buy a London-Sheringham ticket and leave the station at Norwich for however long you wanted, still returning to catch the last train to your destination, or ending your journey there.

With Anytime tickets, the fares are fixed for the year, so you won't find any anomalies such as that the OP discovered.

The exception is when they make a mistake: a few years ago, there was an error in the fare manual, and IIRC a single from London to Derby Road was listed cheaper than it should have been, and cheaper than a London-Ipswich single.",0,1408810838,null,0,false,0,cjyeg65,t3_2ecsu1,t1_cjyeg65,t1_cjye2pd,null,1427394333,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* Start at 2005's ""Rose"" and watch the whole revival show up to the present series. It's a lot more suited to modern sensibilities

* Start at 1963. Good luck with that.

My advice would be to start at 2005 and power through. You'll miss a few references here and there but the revival was designed to hook new viewers rather than to provide fan-service to the original fans, so it's probably the best option for a newbie.

He's not an atheist either and rejected the term. He's against pseudo science and I grew up watching the likes of him and James Randi in the 80s on TV desperately battling public opinion against the likes of mediums, astrologists and crystal healers.

Meanwhile Man City will get off to a quick start in the 22nd with Dzeko's first of the night. His second will come in the 49th. Those will both be assisted by Navas. I won't describe how these goals come about in as much detail because I don't want to see it written out. Consistent play from City's standout players in the match.

true,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,"Again, I'm gonna give some grades (1-10). I missed about a 5-10 minute stretch at the beginning of the second half, where (from the highlights) it looks like Tonks put one off the bar and Chamakh scored on what looked to be poor communication between Tonks and O'Brien (O'Brien charged the wing, Tonks didn't rotate over).

Adrian / 6 / Wasn't troubled all that often because most of the time the backline was causing tough angles for Palace. Made a wonderful save on a brilliant effort by Murray. Stood no chance on the Chamakh goal.

Cresswell / 7 / Again, loved him going forward. Playing on the left side with Reid gives him freedom, because Winston is so damn athletic. He still needs to remember to get back defensively sometimes, but otherwise another good game.

Reid / 7 / Looked outstanding out there. Really made Palace work to get positioning for shots. Made some great deflections and some choice passes to win West Ham possession.

Tomkins / 6.5 / The goal was his mistake, from the replays I saw (again, I missed it live). He really needed to be a step quicker rotating over. But other than that he was damn good defensively. He also plunked a header off the post. Unlucky not to score that one.

O'Brien / 6 / He challenged a lot of shots, but miscommunicated with Tonks on Chamakh's goal, first sticking in tight to cover, then charging the winger to try and force a turnover... Looked like a bit of indecision. Not nearly the same presence going forward as Cresswell, but we knew that.

Kouyate / 7 / Again he was dominant in midfield. Bigger, faster and stronger than most everyone across from him on Palace. I love how much touch he puts on his passes. I love that he recovers so quickly if the ball's turned over when he's attacking. Been a brilliant signing so far.

Noble / 7.5 / Set pieces were brilliant. Captained the squad by being absolutely class in just about every decision he made. His positioning was excellent, his effort was excellent. As always, his passing was spectacular.

Zarate / 8 / What a difference Zarate makes. He was winning balls, winning frees, making key passes... essentially, Zarate was doing what a #10 is supposed to do. What Kevin Nolan can no longer do. Also: [THAT VOLLEY](http://www.goalopedia.com/goals/213) ...Man of the match, easily.

Vaz Te / 6.5 / Another good effort out of Vaz. A lot of people didn't think he was up to standard against Spuds. I thought he played well, just struck his chances poorly (everyone did). Made some great runs today, kept getting into the right spots, had some good shots... he did what an attacking winger is supposed to do, including chesting a ball to Cole for an easy goal.

Downing / 7.5 / Another great performance from Downing. He might bag 10 this year if he keeps playing like this. Relentless in attack. So happy to see him get on the scoresheet early, especially after coming so close last week. He looks so hungry for goals right now.

Cole / 7 / Looked out of sorts at times in the first half. I made the comment that he looked like a bull in a china shop in the first half. He was just plowing into everything. Still, when he wasn't getting called for fouls, he was being rather effective. Great awareness on his goal, too. Slotted a chested pass into the corner where the keeper couldn't get to it.

SUBS

Sakho / 6 / Was happy to see him not look out of his depth. He had a great headed chance that was saved by the Palace keeper. Loaned himself well to linking play in the middle third, too. There his passes were quite on point and he knew how to find space.

Poyet / INCOMPLETE / Not much to say.

Diame / INCOMPLETE / Same.

MANAGEMENT

Allardyce / 7 / Glad he brought Poyet in to give some youth a chance. Curious if he put Sakho in because he wants Valencia to start on Tuesday. Either way, Sakho played pretty well in a limited role. We won the possession battle, had more chances, more corners and won the game convincingly. And we did it away from Upton Park. Lot of credit to Sam for how they played. It will be interesting to see if Nolan walks right back into the starting role after Zarate played so brilliantly.",0,1408811517,null,0,1408811903,0,cjyepmm,t3_2eden2,t1_cjyepmm,t3_2eden2,null,1427394210,5,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,5

Edit: Let's play around with your way of doing things for darkly humourous effect.

Jimmy Savile sexually abused up to 589 people, the earliest of which being in 1958. He dies in 2012 so that's 10.90740740740 victims per year.

Lets say there are around 6 billion people in the world, on average, over this time period. That number's not exact, but so what. 

This means that Jimmy savile sexually abused 0.0000000018179012 per person per year. That isn't that much more than the number of people *i've* sexually abused per person per year which is 0.0000000000000000. So what was all the fuss about?

Your failing to address the point . 

The ""selfish desires"", ""saves just one life"" , ""no valid reason"" is *bullshit* and this is demonstrably true by asking somebody if they also wish to ban alcohol. 99% of the time they don't because they like it. 

It's not about logic, it's about people being scared of something. Fear and emotion dictate their views. If you do actually want to ban alcohol as well then I admire your consistency , hopefully we will never live in such a nanny state (getting there though!) .

Also, their way of fighting is to drive down a road a in convoys of pick up trucks (and now captured us military vehicles) to wherever town is and fire at it with anti aircraft guns etc, until the poorly motivated defending troops run away. This is unbelievably vulnerable to ground attack aircraft and I think they know that aswell, the only problem is in suni areas that isis is defending but it would mean that the 'new caliphate' would only ever be shrinking. My guess is that killing that poor guy was partly revenge, partly to act like they are in control and partly a ham-fisted attempt to scare the public into not supporting further escalation. It's basically had the opposite effect. 


Personally I'm doubtful that there will be a return to Iraq, I know that large military action of this type is almost always motivated by cold strategic interests and I don't see many that are favourable to the US here. There seems to be no way of gaining a government favourable to their interests because it's dominated by the Dawa party (aligned with Iran) and probably would be in any election for the next while. Some people seem to be talking about backing the Kurds and favouring a split up of Iraq into some kind of federated state or set of independent ones, where the US could count on Kurdish (and very optimistically Suni) governments as a counter to the shia dominated one and where it has some degree of influence, but even that seems a stretch.

Though this game won't have impressed the neutral, I thought we played rather well. It was teams like Newcastle and Stoke last year that we just couldn't get points again and lead to our relegation troubles. Therefore 4 (though another 3 today was definitely possible) from our first 2 games shows improvements.

We are lacking our target men up front. Most of our chances were crosses from the wings and when we have Weimann and Gabby instead of Benteke and Kozak we come across as rather impotent in attack.

I think you're mixing up design standards like ISO and BN with these sort of energy regulations. They aren't the same thing. Being able to use the same kettle in Spain and Brussels is great. It's a good thing for manufacturers and it prevents some of the proprietary connector wars you used to get in the 90s (though there are still notably ways around it, not least with mobile phone connectors). It also means manufacturers in Germany can't have their products undercut by manufacturers in Portugal because the latter has ""lax"" standards compared to the stringent standards of Germany. Instead everyone has to work to the same standards. Similarly the EU has done an excellent job of regulating the telecoms market, because ultimately why should it cost you more money to make a call in France than it does in Span simply because you are from France. 

But this sort of thing isn't about supporting manufacturers or providing consumers with standards that keep them safe from harm or exploitation. This is about satisfying some imperious desire to enforce their vision of environmentalism on member states, and to be seen to be doing something about the environment. As I said elsewhere, I suspect we only acquiesced to it because it just so happens we are facing a mid-term energy generation shortfall and our government are keen to reduce our energy reliance NOT for the environment, but because if they don't there are going to be black outs in the not so distant future while they piss-arse around building new nuclear plants.

3) If the question is ""can I study Russian as part of my formal degree course?"", the answer is probably no. If the question is ""can I study Russian in my spare time?"", then the answer is yes. The Language Centre [(link)](http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk) is the place you've heard of. They run all sorts of courses, some of which require formal permission (as the spaces are subsidized somewhat). Or else there's plenty of other courses in Cambridge more generally - some are run at Hills Road Sixth Form College. Or you can just go to the Language Centre - there's plenty of resources for self-directed study. Or find a friendly Russian person in your college/department (there will be one, although not necessarily friendly). Or there's the [Cambridge University Russian Society](http://www.russiancambridge.org/), which runs conversational evenings. Or there's the town equivalent, the [Cambridge Russian Speaking Society](http://www.camruss.com/). Or just head down Mill Road - chances are you'll hear Russian being spoken before you hit the bridge. Удачи!

* The poor quality writing (episodes regularly being solved by Deus Ex machinas, large plot holes, Moffat arbitrarily extending the storylines by refusing to answer questions for years at a time if at all!)

* The refusal to use classic monsters (although when they do return they are generally ruined, (ie the power ranger Cybermen from Nightmare in Silver)) and instead use brand new ""scary"", ""villainous"", ""exemplary"" monsters (who in reality are usually completely forgettable, uninspired and generic creations), 

* The cringeworthy and irritating scenes that immediately break the immersion. For example, the tacked on romance and the obsession with mentioning that the Doctor isn't actually his name (Moffat has broken two unwritten rules in A: Marrying the Doctor and B: Regularly trying to reveal the Doctor's name).

The biggest highlight of the 11th Doctors era was when the Valeyard was mentioned, *that's it!*

**EDIT** - the story was [in the independent on the 1st of August](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/family-says-epileptic-son-died-after-being-restrained-by-police-who-mistook-seizure-for-violence-9643577.html). The police deny tasering, but the victims sister claims to have witnessed it (and to have repeatedly told the police that he was just having an epileptic seizure).

Tasers can kill people too, and have been abused quite a bit. Tasers may be considered non-fatal, but when perceived levels of risk are lower people tend to compensate by doing more of the not-so-risky thing so that you get just as much perceived risk in the long run. In short, if an alternative weapon seems less risky, people will likely compensate by abusing it more.

Actually, when the perceived level of risk is lower than the actual risk (as it seems to be with tasers) you could even get more deaths.

 The ""selfish desires"", ""saves just one life"" , ""no valid reason"" is bullshit and this is demonstrably true by asking somebody if they also wish to ban alcohol. 99% of the time they don't because they like it.

&gt;(c) one of the tickets is a Season Ticket (which for this purpose does not include Season Tickets or travel passes issued on behalf of a passenger transport executive or local authority) or a leisure travel pass, and the other ticket(s) is/ are not.

true,offord94,lfc99,,"Maybe I'm overreacting but it seems exceedingly obvious that Arsenal have no chance for the title with Giroud as their only proven striker. Sanogo is not good enough yet to deputise whenever Giroud is injured or tired and no one else (Joel Campbell maybe) is suited in that position. Look at Sanchez in this game, its only his second PL game of course, but he's still half the size of Everton's defenders and can't be expected to lead the line himself and looks exceedingly out of place. I do think Sanchez is a quality player, but is not a false 9/ solo striker and especially not in his first ever premier league away game against a side that blitzed Arsenal last year.

Arsenal are a talented team and should be in the top 4 again, but Everton are destroying them here and I can see that happening against a lot of the top sides, and they don't have the firepower up front to negate their mental fragility.
 
On a sidenote, seeing Everton do well is nice. Not to suggest I'm a closet blue or anything, but its pleasant seeing their amibtion (splashing the cash on Lukaku) being rewarded as well as the fact it does give me a greater sense of schadenfreude to see this highly touted Arsenal team being unravelled once again more than it would to see the rivals getting turned over.

Dier will slot in at RB for Naughton with Kaboul, Vert and Rose. Lamela and Eriksen are undoubtedly starting, and I think we could see Townsend in place of Lennon.

Up front I really think soldado deserves a start, I was really surprised he didn't after a promising pre season, and scored a great goal against Limassol. When he and Lamela are on the same pitch things happen. However I expect Ade to start as Poch left him to rest.

Capoue - Bentaleb

Ladmela - Eriksen - Townsend

Ade

Vargas and Fer might be subs always a possibility.

If we do get Fazio, I wouldn't expect an announcement from the club until Monday or Tuesday, likely won't play.

Also my personal thoughts, Lennon could play over Townsend I don't know why he would but it's always a possibility. Soldado proved himself Thursday but I don't know if he'll start tomorrow, I'd say if he's feeling fine and is okay to play at least 65-70 he might start. Our back line will most likely look like that, I don't see that changing too much. I do see Poch maybe subbing Davies in for Rose in the later stages of the game. Did Holtby play Thursday?

And I don't know what you mean by 'work'. If you're expecting theology to produce results in the same way as science 'works' then that obviously isn't going to happen. If you're looking for a discipline that attempts to analyze the meaning behind religious texts from a religious viewpoint, well, then perhaps theology is what you're looking for. Now, I disagree with the notion that god exists, so theology clearly has little to offer me (though perhaps there are meaningful ways to engage with religious texts as an atheist, in which case I would probably refer to theologians in some way), but for the billions of people who do believe in God, theology does 'work'.

This is in contrast to homeopathy, whose goal is to cure illness, and can be empirically shown to fail in that endeavour.

**Ward-Prowse** - Building on what I said last week, he needs the experience and to bulk up, he was getting pushed off the ball too easy and was being made to look a mug at times.

**Tadic** - Also had a quieter game, but that was mainly due to the service he wasn't getting, made some beautiful passes and touches when he did though.

**Pelle** - As people have already said, he didn't win much in the air until late on in the game, but he needs time to adjust to the physicalness of the PL, I'm not expecting him to win every ball and bang goals in every week ^^^Yet.

**Long** - Can't really criticize him much, we barely went forward in the second half, and when we did he tried to lay up Pelle or others, other then that, he was usually back defending, which for his height he did well for.

All in all, it's only our second game, and against West Brom who we always have trouble against, I'll take the point, I never expected a replica of our performance against Liverpool, the team needs time to gel.

true,SamAllmon,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"In the Audio Drama ""The Doomwood Curse"" (A Sixth Doctor Story where a book's reality is bleeding out into the actual history of England.) It's a really powerful speech about love and loss. Context: In this story, the memories of people are being rewritten to match a book that Charley, the Doctor's companion, had been reading. John's father had been killed recently, but in the book, in a soap-opera twist, his father was still alive. So when the book had power over him, his father was alive.

&gt;The Doctor: ""John, listen to me. This is very very unfair. The fiction has not only taken your father from you, its distortion of time and reality is interfering with the grieving process, making each realization more painful than the last.""

&gt;John: ""The Pain cannot get worse than this.""

&gt;The Doctor: ""I hope that's true. But, for your own sake, as well as for our quest, you mustn't choose to return to ignorance. However hard this is to live through, that world you were in before, it was a world of words. And words on a page, however skillfully written, can never convey the realities of losing a loved one.""

&gt;John: ""You have no need to tell me that.""

&gt;The Doctor: ""I know but listen to me. But neither can mere words fully convey joy, or love, or hope. If you choose to live in a world where your grief is unreal. Then you can never again Experience true happiness.""

&gt;John: ""Happiness? I cannot comprehend that there is such a thing in the world.""

And I agree there is no empirical evidence for God, but there are arguments made in good faith, made by enormously influential Western thinkers and writers like St Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes and others, so perhaps it would be better to engage with the argument in good faith if you're going to write a book about it?

This is the point I wanted to highlight the most... why are people (specifically us; Liverpool supporters) bothered by the fact that Rodgers 'categorically' stated that Balotelli will not be a Liverpool player?

I am genuinely confused by that.

Is it because some people feel as if Rodgers *lied* to supporters? I would understand that feeling in many other circumstances but when discussing transfers in an active transfer window it's all about leverage and politics isn't it? It's about not revealing too much or revealing just enough. It's about realising that an option that once seemed improbable now is completely possible due to shifting circumstances.

But that's really the only reason I can think of when people start to sputter, 'Butbutbut... Rodgers said we *wouldn't* sign Balotelli.'",0,1408818137,null,0,false,0,cjyhfbe,t3_2edr7g,t1_cjyhfbe,t3_2edr7g,null,1427392931,32,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,32

&gt;Astrology also isn't comparable, because the goal there is to predict the future.

Religion also makes claims about the future without any evidence of success.  It also has a lot to say about the universe and is again wrong in every non-trivial claim it makes.

So what?  Presumably many astrologers also make arguments in good faith and they sincerely believe that horoscopes work.

    Asma was 10 years older than Aysha

(Siyar A’lama-nubala, Al-Zahabi, Vol. 2, pg 289, Arabic, Muassasatu-risalah, 1992).

According to Ibn Kathir:

    Asma was older than her sister Aysha by 10 years

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, pg 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).

According to Ibn Kathir:

    Asmaher son killed during that year and died 100 days later.

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933); Ibne Asakir vol 69 Page 18; Alsunnan Alkubra Albehaqi Vol.6 Page 204).

According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani:

    Asma lived a hundred years and died in 73 A.H (693 CE).

(Taqribu-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fi-nisa, al-harfu-alif).

So let's do the calculation

Birth of Asma: 693 -100= 593 C.E

Birth of Aysha , who is 10 years younger than Asma: 593+10= 603 C.E

The marriage occurred after the Battle of Badr - 624 C.E

624-603=19

That's the maths.

Now here's the language Arabic can be very precise when it comes to language ,especially when they denote specific ages.

    “I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)”when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed.""

(Sahih Bukhari, kitabu’l-tafsir, Bab QaulihiBal al-saatu Mawiduhum wa’l-sa`atu adha’ wa amarr).

That Surah of the Quran was revealed eight years before exile from Medina so around 614 C.E. If Ayesha was nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she'd be a newborn infant.

How do we know this - in Arabic Ayesha uses the word ""Jariyah"" which means young girl. A newborn is ""Sibyah"".

That word ""Jariyah"" is important because it clearly defines a stage in girls life. Now bear that in mind when I quote one the most prominent scholars in Islamic history - source for a lot of the Salafism you see in Saudi:

Ahmad ibn Hanbal says that when Khadija , his first wife died in 619CE , the clan came to him and asked :

    “You can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)”. They mentioned Aysha as ""bikr"" or a virgin not as ""jariyah"" young girl. Bikr is used for an unmarried with no sexual experience prior to marriage. (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, pg 210, Arabic Dar Ihya al-turath al-`arabi).

Batons aren't complete overkill because they are suitable for a police officer's job.

And secondly they serve as an officer's basic defence above all else, tasers are not a weapon I think fits into that category.

Stab vests are not applicable because the crux of discussion about tasers centres around it being an attack tactic, plus they can be more lethal than people think, and this potentially lethal weapon can be used in situations not requiring it.

I am impressed with the team this season, the attack, the defense, the organisation, it's all come together well.  We were supremely dominant for the entire first half with what seems half the team taking it in turns nutmegging Fabio.

What I will say is; we need a striker to get on the end of the balls Sako and Van La Parra are putting in.  It's all well and good Dave Edwards getting his head on a couple, but the quality of the balls theyre putting in (most of the time) needs a strikers head on the end.  I saw in the papers after the game that we are apparently after Danny Graham which could be a great addition to the lineup.  Dicko makes great runs but his presence in the box isn't great.

Other than that, we had a couple of shaky moments.  My heart sank when the ball landed at Kenwyn Jones' feet but somehow Ikeme saved it.

Id imagine if they were introduced you would have them over used for a while then it would drop down and hardly be used again.

From the point of view of my job I would see a taser as another part of an officers PPE, same as a baton and stab vest. A Taser also fits in the same as it is only to be used defensively. We aren't allowed to use batons offensively, nor are firearms used by police firearms units used offensively, same as mace so I think tasers would be OK. They just have a bit more reach than a baton.

If I went into work on Monday and battoned someone without a good enough reason I would lose my job and end up in court and possibly jail.


Any baton strike needs looked at by a medic as they can cause blood clots and kill, even wrestling with someone and leaving them face down too long can kill. So use of force is really something that isn't taken lightly these days. And thankfully in work it is something that is relatively rare.

In your job (assuming you're a police officer, unless I got the wrong idea), you'll undoubtedly have a lot of responsibilities and also be under a lot of scrutiny, as you touched on.

So say an officer is having a bad day, hasn't sleep much the day before, maybe having some personal problems or is overwhelmed by a situation suddenly occurring meaning their actions are very reaction based, in other words, problems that can affect everyone. Say for one or more of those reasons, the officer messes up, tasers someone in the heat of the moment who happens to have a heart condition, that person could possibly die. It's a few bad circumstances coming together, but I don't think it's implausible either.

And adding to what you said about criminals welfare, would you not feel that while liking the idea of commonly carried tasers, than purely from a pragmatic point of view that officers are under such scrutiny, that the potential difficulties outweigh the benefits?

All this being said, I don't have the benefit of seeing it through your eyes as an officer, so I'm disadvantaged in that regard. While we might not share this same point of view, I can maybe see why you'd be inclined to wish for it, doing a difficult, often dangerous job which is commonly thankless and you (like teachers) can be affected in the game of politics.

When he starts sawing at his neck with the knife, if it was sharp it should have cut him straight away. Instead we see him slice at least 3 or 4 times but no blood is visible and it doesn't seem to be having any effect. The slicing is accompanied by a blunt rubbing sound that just doesn't seem right. From other videos involving knives that I've seen before, that shouldn't happen at all. Even a relatively knife that wasn't very sharp would at least make a cut.

I think what we see in the video was probably a mock execution staged for the camera. It's a common terrorist tactic to stage mock executions to mentally break down captives.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"The key point here is that Tasers can be abused and can kill - if we're going to focus on particular cases instead of actual statistics (which OP chose to do) then the particular case I chose to highlight is as valid as any. Plus in a comment, OP claimed the British police had ""killed 0 people in the past two years"" which is false - OP is confusing fatal shootings with all fatalities.

On my ""you could even get more deaths"" last point, what you should take from it is a hypothetical possibility - not a prediction. It's even quite weak as a hypothetical given I don't quote any psychology studies to back it up, let alone actual figures. So you're right to a point, but...

1.  Just because I've only described one Taser-related death, doesn't mean it's the only one to occur. This one was just in the news recently.

2.  Most UK police don't carry Tasers - they're presumably not as rare or tightly controlled as guns, but still not routinely carried - so if you're going to count Taser-related deaths, that should be related to the numbers of police that actually carry them and how often they do so.

3.  Tasers are used and abused much more often in the US than in the UK, and the US police have caused deaths using (and abusing) Tasers a few times. Google if you don't believe me. I quoted that particular story because it was a recent fatality in the UK last two years, because Tasers seemed to be presented as automatically the right thing so far here, and because I happened to remember it.

4.  The real point is whether death rates go up when guns are replaced with Tasers, all else kept equal (an empirical study with proper scientific standards). And sure it's entirely possible that such a study would show a reduction in deaths - possibly, or possibly not, with increases in non-fatal abuses. Possible there are existing (non-flawed) studies that show this already. I was just making a hypothetical point - you can't guarantee that replacing a more dangerous thing with a less dangerous thing will result in less danger overall because people tend to change how they behave.

true,kingasia,lfc12,,"As an american who is very familiar with their work here in Major League Baseball I was SO ecstatic that they bought the club.  I remember it was between them and a ""big money"" asian tycoon.  FSG pushed their ability to bring success back to the Boston Red Sox (another storied franchise that had lost their way.. way worse than Liverpool FC) as proof that they were capable of turning LFC around.  I remember some fans felt like they needed the asian money to pump into the squad and compete immediately with the other big spenders of the world.. I just did not feel right about that.  Liverpool is special and it needed someone who would respect the history and not just see it as their side project and another notch for dick measuring.  Henry and co brought such a winning attitude to Boston and they did unconventional things.  Hired Theo Epstein in 2002 who was 28 years old making him the youngest general manager in history at the time.  Their team always had odd characters and were loved by the city of Boston.  David Ortiz is their Steven Gerrard (minus the homegrown thing).  They came back from 3-0 down to win 4 straight games against the mighty yankees (first time this ever happened) to advance to the world series for the first time and win the championship in 86 years... As unbelievable as Istanbul!.. What I'm saying is.. these guys set the tone and made ballsy hires and let those guys do their jobs to the best of their ability.  They've won 3 world series in total including that 2004 win.  In the midst of all this they've done a great job renovating Fenway Park (the oldest and one of the most historic parks in any sport)..  The parallels are really striking and I have nothing but confidence in FSG to continue building.  Sorry for the long drawn out post but I'm so excited that Henry is the owner.

I'm just used to the police here being armed and I feel for the English police sometimes really putting themselves at risk with very little to protect themselves with.

It is a thankless job but its always different, mostly boring and occasionally very, very exciting! (Boring is good!) I do have to remind myself at times that even though it might not seem like it what I do does protect the public and if me putting my neck on the line stops some kid or old woman getting hurt then its worth it. 

Edited to add: yes being tired and unwell and stressed all comes into it, but good officers tend to be able to cope well with this (you do get used to it!) And used to dealing with stressful situations, volatile people and so on. More likely than someone making a bad judgement through something like that or being a dick would be someone just being stupid or reacting before seeing the full picture (it happens and then you get torn apart by hindsight from people who have never been in any danger their whole lives...)

&gt;Now he is on his way to Utrecht. According to sources to fotbollskanalen.se the clubs have agreed the transfer and the Dutch club is now discussing personal terms with the player.

&gt;Peterson was brought to the club's academy from Sävedalen in 2011 and has since impressed in both the U18's and reserve squad before making his first team debut against Shamrock Rovers in May 2014.""

No mentions of a loan deal, seems like a permanent transfer.

If you've read the God Delusion then you will know how he goes on about people being permanently agnostic in principle, or PAP as he called it. I haven't met all that many people who take that position in real life, but those that do usually explain the philosophical arguments that they base their view on. Someone like Dennett would certainly know them and would find the way Dawkins gave the impression of being completely ignorant of the arguments an intellectual approach to the dealing with that topic. That's one example. The book is not aimed at a high intellectual level, although you might not regard that as a bad thing.

There's a summary of for strong agnosticism here if you are not familiar of them:-

Of course, the thing that proved to me beyond question what he thinks of Dawkins was the interview I saw on TV.

We see Vastra and Jenny. They try to think something up. Trex spits Tardis out. They realize what is going on. But they still need to be careful about the trex. They approch the TARDIS. Doctor gets out. They have chit chat.

They get him inside. He starts writing on the walls. He realizes something. Some tention going on. He runs out to look at the Trex. He sees people running around in havoc, destroying buildings and stores, stealing. He wonders what to do. Goes back. NO BURNING OF THE DINO.

He looks at the stuff he wrote. Than he wonders of. Trying to find something ? Maybe. Wink Wink. 

Everybody disturbed where Doctor went. They see the newspaper. But the god damn dino is still there beiing annoying.

Yes, the plot isn't amazing (never mind the Cyberking roaming round, now it's a T-Rex) but this episode was one of the few times I've legitimately laughed while watching Doctor Who. 

It sets up the Doctor's personality well as well as establishes a series long arc which looks interesting going by the ending scene. Whether this could have anything at all to do with Gallifrey, we'll have to see.

Given that 'The Girl in the Fireplace' is one of my favourite episodes, I'm a little disappointed in how the clockwork robots were brought back, but the nod towards the Madame De Pompadour was nice.

[The Eleventh Hour gets around this a bit by having new everything else as well as the Doctor.]

Combine that with it being the first episode of a new series (so needing to get us back into the feel of Doctor Who) and we get an episode without much Doctor, little plot (so we can focus on the characters), lots of one liners (to keep us happy) and a general feeling of ""meh""ness.

Still, the one-liners were pretty fun, a new possible-villain, new music, new titles, new Tardis interior - most of which looks nice. This series could be fun.

Perhaps we didn't need to have everything spelt out quite so much - particularly the The Girl in the Fireplace connection and the Fires of Pompeii stuff (assuming that was what we were meant to get from that scene with the coat).",0,1408826760,null,0,false,0,cjyky4q,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjyky4q,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427391157,322,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,322

Overall: I liked it. Capaldi is brilliant and Clara finally got some personality.

B, C: The Doctor's ""goodness"" has always laid on a spectrum, he's been the good guy for all major iterations, but there's always been this darkness to him, for solid examples, see The War Doctor and The Valeyard. We're being purposefully left in a flux as to what kind of person he is, see all the times where he literally questions this in this very episode. 

D: I'm not too sure why this was hammered home so much this episode. I think they're setting up for the trio to replace Sarah Jane/Torchwood as a spin off, and might be testing the waters as to if it should be an adult for childrens show, hence the mixture between cleavage and silly sound effects. Strax is fucking awesome either way. 

E: I don't understand why call backs are a bad thing. He's a time traveler whose adventures center heavily around 1 planet and 1 species... There's bound to be cross overs which leads to deeper lore. Personally, I love it.

Similiar with Eleven's. If I was sceptical about Ten, I thought Eleven was just a total pretty boy. Looked like a smug git in his press photo, and was expecting to hate him and... was totally endeared and excited by the first episode.

But this... I'm so excited for Capaldi. I was so excited to see what they did with him. And the whole episode felt like it rested on its laurels a bit. I mean, it literally (and explicitly) recycled the Fireplace plot, it went back to these Victorian semi-companions Moffat seems to love (and really over-egged the tropes and catchphrases that he likes to call characterisation), and just didn't seem to care about impressing us.

There was bits I liked - I liked the thing about changing himself over and over, till he's no longer the same person to begin with. It was... a clever line. It hit with no emotional impact though because the whole episode left me so jarred. I didn't know where we were going from one scene to the next - and not in an exciting, ""Anything could happen in the next half hour!"" way but just... it's not that nothing made sense, it was just...

I was just imagining that he would play well in a role similar to what Januzaj has done for United, a sort of wide supporting forward. 

I think another scenario could be to play two up top (Valencia/Sakho + Zarate) and then Ravel behind, with Jarvis and Downing on the wings. Unfortunately this leaves us with only one more central midfielder to use, which means we would have to choose between Kouyate and Noble, which wouldn't be the greatest dilemma to have.

I suppose we can just rotate players around, with the 10 spot occupied by either Zarate or Morrison, with Zarate sometimes playing on the wing, and cycling through Noble/Kouyate/Diame for central midfield. Which reminds me, when is Big Sam finally going to give up on his dream of playing Diame as a winger?

true,Timmeh7,,Swansea,"I'm an academic in a Welsh university, so I know the immigration and visas procedure in more detail than anyone probably should.  Firstly be under no illusion that it's anything but difficult to move here long-term.  It's not the case that you can move here and hope to get a job later - you need to be employed, and that employer [needs to be willing to sponsor you](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general/eligibility).

There are a few paths to this - the most robust is to be a skilled worker in a profession in-demand in the UK (see [this](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/308513/shortageoccupationlistapril14.pdf) list for details of what that entails), or if you work for a company in the US who want you to work in their UK branch.  There are a few additional edge cases like professional sportspeople which probably won't apply here.  I do note on that list that psychiatry is mentioned, though it appears to suggest they're looking for NHS medical doctors.

The more likely path is to get a job with a British organisation [capable of sponsoring visas](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/346957/Tiers_2___5_Register_of_Sponsors_2014-08-22.pdf), and to enter on a [Tier 2 (general) visa](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general).  That job must pay at least £20,500 to be eligible.  In theory, this isn't too difficult; you can apply for a job, be made an offer, and sort the visa that way.  The problem, however, is when you ask the question why an organisation will go through the paperwork hassle; unless you have a specific skill that they need, or you REALLY impress them in some other way, chances are they're going to take an applicant from the EEA who doesn't involve that hassle.  That's not to say you shouldn't try, but be aware that it won't be an easy path to walk.

There are other types of visas, of course; the easiest would be ancestry.  I don't suppose any of your grandparents hold, or held British citizenship?  The [details pertaining to this visa](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa) state that that grandparent needs to have been born in the UK, but in most cases simply holding British citizenship can be sufficient.

Failing that, you're looking at either a student visa (which can be very expensive as you don't get government support with university fees - generally a bursary required to make it viable unless you're obscenely wealthy), or marriage.

I'm definitely not saying it's impossible, indeed it certainly isn't; I've known several people in what I feel were weaker positions than you who successfully made it in.  Just be aware that it's not something that'll happen on a whim; it'll require effort and persistence, and even then there are no absolutes.  Good luck - feel free to direct any questions my way, if you have any.",0,1408827915,null,0,false,0,cjylf9x,t3_2ebjcz,t1_cjylf9x,t3_2ebjcz,null,1427390934,3,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,3

The robot T-Rex was also a capable fighter despite his friendly disposition. He allowed Rory to use him as a mount in combat and carried the Doctor to safety when they were being pursued by the cultists.  [__source__ needed]

true,Mashieboyz,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"Some Clockwork droids from Madame De Pompadour's time have survived to live in Victorian London. The Doctor, crashing after his explosive regeneration, has accidentally brought a dinosaur from the past to the 1800's. Strax, Jenny and Vastra find the Doctor, but it is not who they expect: an old man who is clearly delirious. Clara is extremely confused and distressed: this isn't the man she used to know. 

While they take the Doctor back to their house for safety, the mysterious killer continues to gather body parts for his cause: to survive and get to ""paradise."" He kills the Dinosaur by burning it and takes the eye for himself. The Doctor escapes and sees this for himself, and is visibly distressed. The Clockwork Droid continues to harvest organs for his cause, and the Doctor/Clara are lured into his trap through an add in the paper, ""Impossible Girl"" (a continuing mystery). They talk to each other and realise that they have some deep seeded issues with each other: the Doctor thinks Clara is a control freak, and Clara thinks the Doctor is old and not the same.

This is soon made moot when the Doctor sees that the other people in the room are not eating or drinking: just pretending. When they try to leave, they are stopped by these droids, and captured by the commander. Clara finds out that the droids cannot see her if she takes a deep breath, and tries to escape. The Doctor uses Clara to find out how this commander thinks, and realises that he has more humanity than robot, but comes through for her, showing that the Doctor is still somewhat the same man that she used to know. The trio break in while the Doctor chases the commander.

The Doctor questions the commander as too what he wants: the only thing that he can answer is ""paradise."" He looks out across the city and calls the view beautiful: he has human wants, desires and thoughts. However, the Doctor knows that he will still kill if he is let go. This results in a morally grey area for the Doctor: do I kill a villain who is partially human? do I kill? am I that kind of man? The audience is left to decide, with the shot of the droid impaled on a church. A shot of Capaldi's face suggests that he did it. At this point, the Trio and Clara downstairs are finished with the other droids, disabled when the commander died. The Doctor leaves for a moment to change his clothes and TARDIS, and comes back for Clara. 

He comments on who placed the add, and who gave Clara the phone number back in a Smith episode. He says that she should call Matt Smith, and he assures her that he is still the same man as Capaldi. They go to have chips and coffee, while we see the commander captured by ""Missy"", presumably the villain for this story. The episode ends with her telling the commander that the bright garden that they are in is paradise. 

Not a hard plot: villain wants to survive, Doctor is new and dark, Clara is not perfect as said before. A strong opener for Capaldi.",0,1408827958,null,0,false,0,cjylfw2,t3_2edtzt,t1_cjylfw2,t1_cjykra8,null,1427390926,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
