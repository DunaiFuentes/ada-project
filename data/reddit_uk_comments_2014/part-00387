Bonds been stuck in a time warp for a long time so maybe this move might challenge what being British in the modern day.

I imagine it will include a plot about saving Europe from Russians or American aggression, Bond might put the magic wand down for once and instead save the woman from terrorists and she returns the favor in combat rather then conquering them.

That view may have its flaws but falling oil prices are unlikely to convince yessrs that an independent Scotland was a bad idea since their view of what independence would bring was not resting on economic forecasts or a belief that independence would bring the land of milk and honey. 

Falling oil prices are instead canon fodder for unionists who believe Scotland would be much worse off independently. However, that is a smal part of what independence meant for a lot of people that voted yes (and something the BT campaign never seemed to grasp). I believe the independence movement would be succesfully quashed if decision makers started to address and neuter issues that yes voters associated with the ideas of independence -  reform of the political system, welfare, Trident, federalization...

These statistics are unlikely to even dent the reputation of independence in Scotland since they address eventual consequences of an unknown future and not the core ideas behind  the benefits of independence. If you believe that it is possible to overcome what the future throws at you, the former pales in comparrison to the latter.

&gt;Bond is born in Scotland to Scottish parents, then privately educated in England and joined the Navy.

This became cannon after Connery played him and not every movie has alluded to this. An Irish man played 007 for a decade. Also, Bond is a fictional character. 

&gt;Those three factors have been pretty constant throughout the Bond series as far as I know. Skyfall has bond visiting his abandoned family estate in Scotland.

Not every movie touched on the backstory.

&gt;It just seems like such an incredibly unlikely back story for a Scottish born black man to have. Black Scottish make up something like 0.1% of Scots.

You know what else is unlikely? Every fucking thing Bond does. If the fact a black man plays 007 broke your suspension of disbelief but an invisible car or space battle didn't, you have serious problems. Also, 007 is a fictional character.

&gt;They likely made up even less of the population 45 odd years ago when Bond would have been born if Elba is playing him..

""Black people are an insignificant statistical minority which means a black man cannot play this lead in a fictional movie. Killing a woman by covering her in gold? Won't happen but fuck it, let's do it anyway""

Basing your characters and actions on facts in an action movie is a very quick way of making the worlds most boring movie. 

&gt;I know liberties have been taken with the character, but I think making him black would purely be a gimmick and it'd certainly be betraying the character.

007 doesn't exist, no one is being betrayed. And if you accept liberties have been taken, why care so much about a little thing like race? The only thing being betrayed is your sense of entitlement.

&gt;I love Idris Elba, and I think he'd be a great actor. I just don't think he needs to be a Bond.

Just think about the sentence you wrote and how little sense it makes. This attitude pervades in film industry and is absolutely disgusting. Without breakout actors like Driis playing iconic roles like Bond, nothing will change for actors of colour in Britain.

It's somehow acceptable to always play the drug dealer and the road man, but an iconic British role that has gone through changes before? Nah, he black though.

It's disgusting.

I'm so fed up with always having to look to America for black British actors in great roles because from my position this is what I hear in your last sentence (wether you it or not):

""Driis as Bond? He is great but he's black, no really one of us is he now?""

You have over 50 years of a white Bond. One Driis Bond won't change that

They're doing the same old film again, surely.

However, Bond is a long-running series. The new film will be a new film, and Bond has always changed. I stopped watching when Brosnan left though, because I always pictured Bond as white, dark hair, tall and slender. I just couldn't fathom Daniel Craig as a valid actor to fill the role. Plus they completely changed the character to go with it.

So yeah. I jumped ship with Craig. I don't think I'll be back to see Elba, but I have absolutely no misgivings about it. The Bond series already changed too much for me years ago. I probably wouldn't have minded so much if they'd gone straight to Elba, as long as they kept the character intact, but alas nope. Craig needed a whole new Bond to play, because he just wasn't the established Bond of many decades. I was a fan of established Bond. I doubt I'd care if 'established Bond' became black, but they had to go change the character, so nope.

EDIT:

I have precedence to go on, I just realised. The amount I cared when they changed Nick Fury's race could be measured on an amputee's fingers. Sam Jackson brings Fury to life in so many epic ways, and to be honest, I can't really imagine a white guy playing him quite so well.

false,alien_cyclops,null,null,"&gt;i've no problem with people owning .22 rifles or shotguns, these serve a civilian/sporting need.

You cannot, legally, or humanly hunt deer, or larger game with a .22.  Minimum round that I would use for deer would be a 22-250, but in the North it is a .243, or 6mm centerfire rifle round. You can use a shotgun for deer, but because the North is mostly open country you need to take long range shots, over 200 meters, and a shotgun, even one that uses a rifled barrel with slugs would be inappropriate for this. For shots over 300 to 500 meters you realistically need to use a bigger round, a .308 (7.62 mm) because the smaller rounds just lack the ability to do this, and deliver enough kinetic energy to kill quickly.

Besides, the only thing the .22 lr has going for it is that it is cheap and plentiful. For a bullet it sucks. Bullet drop after 100 meters is substantial, put a bit of wind into the mix, and we do get fairly windy, then you have a round that is going to get blown around a lot.  Other more appropriate choices could be, you have .17 HMR, another rimfire round, or .22 hornet, a centerfire round, or even again, a hand-loaded 22-250 with a smaller bullet that can be used, effectively, over longer ranges than the .22 lr for small game such as rabbit.

I only care about three things when it comes to firearms though. Accuracy, long range shooting, and hunting for meat. .22 lr is great for practice because I can go and shoot 500 rounds off for 3 pence a round. I can practice trigger pull, breathing, and the other fundamentals of marksmanship, without blowing the shit out of my shoulder, if I say went shooting with a .308 and put 500 rounds down range, 50 pence a round, that's expensive. Really, this only broaches the point of rifles, and your remark regarding .22 lr and shotguns.

In short, lots of different calibres for lots of different reasons. Tools to fit a purpose.

&gt;Why do you want more gun ownership? We don't want the US model of an arms race in every home.

I don't want that either. We would never get that either though. Even here in Canada, where I currently live, right on the boarder with the U.S and our gun laws are pretty strict, in many regards a little more stringent than Northern Ireland. We are licensed, and required by law to take a safety course, which when you look at the statistics for accidental deaths in Canada, seems to be working. You are not allowed to own a firearm if you have a conviction for a violent crime or domestic abuse. A criminal record check is run on you every single day. If you so much as get a traffic ticket you are flagged. If you have a run in with the police, you will have to explain yourself, otherwise you will lose your firearm privileges. We even have a ban on suppressors, silencers, which in my opinion is daft, but you can own suppression systems in the North. They are very useful for hunting purposes. When you silence a small calibre, subsonic round, it is very quiet. You have to provide two references, and the names, address, and phone numbers of all the people you have been in a conjugal relationship with in the last 2 years. These people are contacted, and if at any time a red-flag is raised, you don't get to own a gun. This is the kind of system I'm in favour of, not some idiotic American bullshit. They have a right in their constitution as we all know, but it leads to higher homicide rates, higher accidents, and higher suicide with firearms, that most of the rest of the world, because they lack the rigour in investigating people who wish to own firearms. 

This is why I advocate gun ownership. It's fun. Even if you are only target shooting. I have taken people out shooting and every time they have enjoyed it. If you get into long distance shooting, it becomes very complex and challenging and it is great for people who like that kind of technical stuff. Try shooting something 1000 meters away, it's not that easy. As for handguns, handguns are so much fun too. Sure, they can be used to kill people, but lets examine the rate of gun homicide in Northern Ireland, in 2011 it was 0.22 per 100 000 people. In 2010 it was 0.11 per 100 000 people.  This does not take into consideration how many of these deaths were caused by legally held firearms. That translates to 4 people in 2011, and 2 in 2010. in 2008 where the homicide rate with firearms was 0.67 per 100 000 people, the handgun homicide rate was 0.11 per 100 000 people.  This means that in 2008 3 people were killed with handguns, whilsts 9 people were killed with other firearms. More people on average kill themselves with guns than are murdered. [Sources](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/northern-ireland). I also believe that more people should hunt. It is a healthy and inexpensive way to acquire delicious meat. We have so little crime in Northern Ireland that owning a gun solely for the purpose of self-defence, is silly. Even if I do believe that they are good for self-defence.

It is a relatively expensive hobby to get into, so it has a cost barrier that, not to sound like an asshole, keeps a lot of people out of it who would otherwise be idiots. No one is running around murdering people with their $1000  handgun, or $600 quid glock, or $3000 rifle, at least not in the numbers that matter.  One final point, every single handgun and centerfire rifle that is sold in the North is ballistically tested by the PSNI. That information is stored in a database. If you use the gun for a crime, and they recover the bullet, you're caught. 


Serious, if you have any questions ask.  Challenge me. There is so much misinformation and stereotyping that happens with regards to gun owners. I feel that it is my duty as a responsible person who loves firearms to educate people on the reality of us.  Most of us are educated professionals. Our guns go into safes, unloaded, whenever we are not shooting. We follow all the proper safety procedures when handling firearms. We are not a bunch of inbred, redneck country folk who fuck our sisters. We don't all drive pick-up trucks, believe in the baby jesus and listen to country music whilst chewing on some straw. When I was a member of a gun club in the North we shot with doctors, lawyers, engineers, police officers, blue collar trades people, all from different backgrounds.  No one cared, and we all got along great. And I'm a lad from Ballymurphy. It brought a lot of folks together who otherwise would have never have gotten together, it was good for that.",0,1419265625,null,0,false,0,cn2afu4,t3_2pyp11,t1_cn2afu4,t1_cn284bf,null,1425271449,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

Of course they are.

It therefore follows then that a Govt *can* be a terrorist group (at least in part), if one of it's agencies/depts acts in a way that creates terror in another place, they would be de facto terrorists, would they not?

But this aside, I disagree vehemently that arguing that certain groups of people are less than human causes them to be treated as less than human, as you put it. Others first need to be *convinced* of this, they need to agree with the argument that a certain group is inferior, and this narrative needs to become socially acceptable. And in order to prevent this narrative from permeating society, counter arguments are better than laws. 

A law can prevent people from publicly expressing racism, or from publishing their views, but it cannot prevent this opinion from forming, or from being expressed in private.

false,Starlifter141,null,null,"Here is a slightly long-winded post I made a few days ago about the show. It's not a spin off but it does have some DW themes in it. Even the PR for referenced DW themes.

There is a new series called The Librarians that is based on three movies titled The Librarian (Quest for the Spear, Return to King Solomon's Mines, and Curse of the Judas Chalice). In the Librarian movies Noah Wiley was the lead actor, and it dealt with his traveling around the world to retrieve sacred artifacts (magical relics) for the Library of which he was the Librarian in charge of / guardian of artifacts.

The series takes place in present time and has elements of the Warehouse 13 / Friday the 13th series (retrieving supernatural objects) and the Matrix movies (instant doorways) with many similarities to Doctor Who themes. The PR write-up for the follow-on series even said that it was like a lighter version of Doctor Who.

Noah Wiley is in the first two episodes of the series to transition it to the new cast of actors. Then he goes off in search of the now lost main Library and leaves them to carry on his artifact retrieving duties from the Library Annex. They become the primary cast when he leaves. 

Basically you could say that Wiley is comparable to the Doctor, they are the Companions, and the Annex is the TARDIS. He makes an occasional future appearance, but it is a “Companions” oriented show.

So far there is a lot of stuff that could fit into a Doctor Who episode, or a Companions episode.

I'm not convinced. Where is the evidence they are less dangerous than baton strikes? Less dangerous for the police perhaps. As you say, we should look to reduce the amount of force necessary and there has been a wholescale militarisation of the police over the last 30 years with zero public input. 

I understand the situations that a tazer should be used in, but I'm sure you are familiar that these rules are often broken. How about the time police in Leeds used a tazer on a man in a diabetic coma who was unresponsive on a bus?

I do realise that the article was working with figures for 2016 extrapolated from current oil figures. But the problem I'd have with that is the current price of oil isn't low because the oil ""price can fluctuate wildly,"". The current price is not a normal fluctuation in the price of oil. The current price of oil is artificially low because of political reasons. Saudi Arabia want to undermine Russia, Iran, and US shale companies. And it won't take 15 years to do that. I don't think the artificially low price will last until 2016. And when it does bounce back it will be artificially high to make up for it. That's why they were saying ""We wouldn't have been independent until 2016, come back in a year or 2"" not because they didn't read the article.

&gt; .. the point is oil wouldn't have provided the steady income the Scots would have needed for the sort of projects the SNP wanted to spend it on

Some years it would have provided more than enough, other years it would be less than what was needed. The price fluctuates up as well as down. Every one knew that in September, no one said otherwise. The idea that people who supported independence thought we were going to become millionaire oil-barons is a myth. 
&gt; The Scots would have needed to borrow enormous sums of money to plug those gaps 

He does realise we're already borrowing enormous sums of money to plug the gaps? And Scotland's deficit is smaller than the UK's most years.

I think the reality of an independent Scotland would have been somewhere in between an oil rich paradise where the streets are lined with gold, and a failed state who's finances are wrecked by being reliant on one unpredictable industry.

Yes I signed up for it and I signed up for it knowing that I may have to go to war and I have done three times.

I personally hope that this works and that less ex forces people end up in prison and that it is seen as a success that could spread to other groups of offenders who it may benefit too.

Given the choice of being struck by baton, or tasered, I would take the taser every time. A baton strike will inevitably cause at least severe bruising, and if used to incapacitate a threat, i.e a head strike, will fracture the skull easily. Your common or garden variety PC is also less likely to panic and over react if he has control over the situation from 20 feet away rather than  being necessitated into a close quarters fight.

I speak as someone who has worked closely with police officers for 10 years and undergone a lot of the same training. My perspective has been that the culture has actually moved towards increased accountability, with public perception being of the utmost importance. Police officers are refreshed in the national decision making model annually which constantly refers to making your judgement calls based on what a reasonable member of the public would expect you to do. (The NDM is online if you want to have a read yourself)

That being said, of course some officers are arse holes and will use it inappropriately. That's inexcusable, but an unfortunate byproduct of the obsession with public perception is that discipline is usually done internally to prevent police officers from being afraid to act. I don't agree with that but it's hard to strike a workable balance.

The most common use for tasers I have personally encountered is in situations involving knives. The perpetrator maybe threatening others, or often threatening to self harm. In these situations a close approach presents unacceptable risks to all parties, and, barring a pre existing condition (which is un knowable) the taser will be the safest option.

There doesn't need to be any sort of massive conspiracy. Very few people think there is.

The problem is that once things have gone far enough, once the tools exist and are available, then human nature will do the rest. Greed and lust for power exist. There has also been scientific studies demonstrating that in large institutions, amoral ""psychopathic"" people tend to rise to the top. This occurs because they are simply better than average at playing office politics.

I'd also expect this country to come under increasing strain over future years. Personally I believe the causes will be connected to debt, inequality, and environmental degradation. Some UKIP types might see further strain from immigration. However any such strain, if it was accompanied by rioting etc (as often happens in this country) would likely cause some of our normal checks and balances to be bypassed.

So what happens, when an amoral, psychopathic person, gets access on all our records and there are no checks and balances?

&gt;We have learned no such thing.

Yes we have. A great deal of research has gone into this and has determined that in most cases genes due factor into the disorder. If you would like to refute this please do with links to peer reviewed works.



&gt;ADHD has a strong genetic basis in the majority of cases, as a child with ADHD is four times as likely to have had a relative who was also diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. At the moment, researchers are investigating many different genes, particularly ones involved with the brain chemical dopamine. People with ADHD seem to have lower levels of dopamine in the brain.

&gt;Children with ADHD who carry a particular version of a certain gene have thinner brain tissue in the areas of the brain associated with attention. Research into this gene has showed that the difference are not permanent, however. As children with this gene grow up, their brains developed to a normal level of thickness and most ADHD symptoms subsided.

http://psychcentral.com/lib/causes-of-attention-deficit-disorder-adhd/0001202

&gt;Susceptibility gene variants for ADHD and associated antisocial behaviour are being identified with emerging evidence of gene–environment interaction.
***
&gt;There is consistent evidence that genetic factors contribute to the aetiology of ADHD and that susceptibility genes interact with environmental risk factors in complex ways.
***
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder runs in families, with first-degree relatives of affected individuals showing higher rates of the disorder (relative risk 4–5). The familial risk appears to be higher among relatives of those with both ADHD and conduct disorder. Twin and adoption studies have provided consistent evidence that genetic factors contribute to the aetiology of ADHD, with estimates of heritability of 60–91%;

http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/1/1.full

&gt;It is now generally accepted that ADHD has a biological and even primarily genetic basis. 
***
 certain genetic syndromes may lead to an increased risk of ADHD
***
Due to the complexity seen in the inheritance of ADHD in families, it is considered by some to be a complex trait in that several different types of risk factors, both genetic and environmental, combine together
***
This implies that multiple genes and or environmental risk factors work together to cause ADHD,
***
ADHD does follow Mendelian segregation and does have a large genetic component (as we discuss below), with only a few genes of major effect (also discussed below) in addition to many other smaller gene and/or environmental contributions.
***
To date, the causes of ADHD are unknown, but there is strong evidence and it is generally accepted that ADHD has a genetic component. This evidence comes from various types of genetic studies such as adoption, twin, and family studies, which have been conducted over the past 30 years. ADHD shows familiality (it runs in families) as well as heritability (it has a genetic component). In addition, this genetic contribution is seen regardless of whether ADHD is treated as a diagnostic category, a continuum of symptoms, or when using latent class analysis to define the phenotype.

http://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/10/1085.full

&gt;The genetic and environmental risk factors that have been implicated appear to be associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes
***
The evidence to date suggests that both rare and multiple common genetic variants likely contribute to ADHD and modify its phenotype
***
ADHD, like other common medical and psychiatric disorders (eg, asthma, schizophrenia), is influenced by multiple genes, non-inherited factors and their interplay
***
A further complexity is that genetic factors can exert indirect risk effects through interplay with environmental factors
***
Genes can alter sensitivity to environmental risks (gene–environment interaction), for example, environmental toxins or psychosocial adversity
***
This means that environmental and genetic risk effects cannot be considered as entirely distinct
***
There is robust evidence from a wide range of study designs of a strong inherited contribution to ADHD. Family studies have consistently found higher rates of ADHD (twofold to eightfold increased risk)7 in parents and siblings of affected probands compared with relatives of unaffected controls. Twin studies have shown that monozygotic twin pairs have much higher concordance rates for ADHD than dizygotic twin pairs8 and adoption studies have also found increased rates of ADHD in the biological parents of ADHD adoptees compared with both the adoptive parents of the probands and with the parents of controls without ADHD
***
ADHD also appears to share an inherited liability with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric problems, notably ASDs, developmental coordination problems,10 reading ability,11 IQ,12 conduct and mood problems.13 ,14 These findings suggest the same inherited and familial risks can result in the manifestation of different clinical phenotypes.

http://adc.bmj.com/content/97/3/260.full

&gt;There are multiple genetic and environmental risk factors with small individual effect that act in concert to create a spectrum of neurobiological liability
***
Current theories emphasise the central role of attentional and executive dysfunctions in children [7,8], as well as affective components involving emotional control and motivational processes [9]. A growing body of evidence supports a model in which multiple genetic and environmental factors interact during early development to create a neurobiological susceptibility to the disorder; the expression of which is mediated by alterations within different and diverse neural networks and deficits in the neuropsychological functions that these subserve
***
Genetic factors are implicated in ADHD, but the mechanism of action is not completely understood. Twin, family and adoption studies of ADHD have supported a strong genetic contribution to the disorder, with heritability ranging from 60-90%
***
Genes regulating neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in ADHD. Candidate gene studies of ADHD have produced substantial evidence implicating several genes in the etiology of the disorder, with meta-analyses supportive of a role of the genes coding for DRD4, DRD5, SLC6A3, SNAP-25, and HTR1B
***
Genome scan studies on potential alleles for ADHD have demonstrated linkage on chromosomes 5p13, 6q12, 16p13, 17p11 and 11q22-25
***
Although each syndrome may arise from different genetic abnormalities with multiple molecular functions, the effects of these abnormalities may give rise to common effects downstream in the biological pathways or neural circuits, resulting in the presentation of ADHD symptoms
***
Therefore, a plausible genetic hypothesis for ADHD is a mixture of dominant and recessive major genes that act with complex polygenic transmission patterns [18]. An increased rate of large, rare, chromosomal deletions and duplications known as copy number variants have been reported in individuals with ADHD

 ... Didn't you understand?

If you had followed the hyperlink immediately following the above text, you'd have seen the video which explains this, and the unique naiveté and gullibility that [the British nation possesses regarding it's own history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF5y1XzZUPY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=203), and the selective teaching of said; the way the ongoing policy *has* to be portrayed as a series of one off, special events, rather than a long ongoing policy of robber-baron-like behaviour on the part of the UK/US at that time (and arguably to a large degree since), the democratic election in Iran that directly led to Churchill and Eisenhower financing the overthrow of the democratically elected Mossadegh Govt that was elected by a landslide majority on a policy of ejecting the Anglo-Persian oil company (that later became BP) and replacing it with one of the worst human-rights offenders/regimes of recent history, the Shah who in return for control of Iran reinstated the US/UK control of the oil, eventually the Iranians understandably had the  the Iranian revolution, etc, etc, etc.

But you clearly didn't, because you seem unaware that Germany didn't have any colonies with oil reserves, so demonstrably one of the reasons *for* WW1 was clearly control and possession of the rich Middle Eastern oil fields, and the prevention of the Germans breaking the UK/US cartel that existed at the time.

I'll reiterate, please no more non-sequiturs/strawman arguments, or silly word games, if you are interested follow the link, if not don't.

Load of bullshit, yes the services are understaffed but CAMHS and paediatric consultants follow NICE guidelines almost faultlessly for things like ADHD. There is too much risk to go off doing things which are not recommended and the GPs refuse to take on prescribing when they are not within guidelines. Drugs are only started where they are justified and psychological treatment is tried first, and everything is documented.

I am aware of children under the age of 6 being prescribed ADHD medication, however they are all exceptional circumstances, if you were in a room with these children you instantly know there is something not quite right.

You wouldn't make Bart Simpson black in the next episodes of the Simpsons, you wouldn't make inspector clouseau Asian, you wouldn't make Sherlock Holmes black, it just doesn't fit.

The way films work is very discriminatory. Certain characters need certain physical attributes to make them work.

It has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with the identity of the character. The only reason the actors change in the bond films is because they go on for so long. The character is the same.

At www.gameothronestours.com, they have a tour that goes East of Belfast visiting Scrabo tower, Robb's camp, ""Winterfell"", ""King in the North"", Tollymore forest, Dundrum etc. and goes back to Belfast. 

This misses ALL the locations I previously thought a Game of Thrones tour would include. 

In the North Coast of Northern Ireland, the [www.causewaycoastandglens.com](http://www.causewaycoastandglens.com/Game-of-Thrones-Itinerary.T1163.aspx) website has a self-drive itinerary that includes a stop at the ""dark hedges"", Ballintoy harbour, Glenarm, Cairncastle, Antrim plateau, Ballycastle, Larrybarne, Cushendall, Cushendun and East along the Causeway coastal route including the Giant's Causeway, Mussendum Temple, Castlerock and Benone beach. 

It seems to me that some tour operators will go East from Belfast, while others will go North-West along the North Coast, covering GOT filming spots as well as the traditional tourist spots along the North Coast like the Carrick-a-rede rope bridge, Giants Causeway and Dunluce Castle. 

Also something I haven't seen is a drive-by past the main film studio in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast, although in fairness there isn't much to see and HBO don't like people taking photographs around there.

It seems to me that some tour operators are keeping the tour strictly to GOT filming locations only, whilst others seem to be covering other sightseeing spots along the route too (there are plenty of landscapes and castles and whatnot that have never appeared in Game of Thrones but nevertheless are fascinating anyway).

Practically speaking it sounds like a really busy stretch of road where nobody really wins. I've seen this kind of jockying for position before and it always ends up being more of a battle of egos than anything else. 

So you're infront of the Porsche - so what? You're one car ahead. 

So you're behind the Porsche - so what? You're just one or two cars behind. 

If *nobody* is letting you merge then I would be a bit more forthright - don't just stop and sit there waiting for someone to stop way behind you to allow you in - but as a matter of etiquette 'zip merging' works quite well to sort the problem with a minimum of fuss.

Indeed, he's one of the most courteous performers you'll ever come across, in some ways more like a jolly lecturer.

Hollywood is very much stagnating creatively and always tends to take the easy money route. I'd be interested to see what an Elba Bond would be like.

&gt; “Mascherano was back from suspension and he gives us balance in the middle, and Gerrard can be more free going forward.

Some forum posts regarding his future:

&gt; 1. But does anyone actually think we need Alonso? If we could sell him and buy someone like Matias Fernandez or someone in that mould then I would be more than happy.

&gt; 2. I do like Xabi Alonso, but its the team that comes first and I feel that **Alonso has offered us nothing in the last couple of season's**, especially when you see what Mashcherano has offered us and what Lucas is bound to offer us.

&gt; I am happy that Rafa has came out and said this as it has indicated he is no longer putting up with the below par performances from the players this season.

&gt; 3. Surely Xabi knows as well as everyonelse dose that he has been playing poorly this term. I do not believe he can have any complaints.

&gt; 4. I admit it is very strange for Rafa to come out publicly.  But as you said.  He's on a good f**king wage and probably needs a huge kick up the arse.

&gt; 5. Alonso was always going to fall behind masch in the pecking order because of the legth of the injury he had but i dont think anyone was expecting lucas to be doing as well as he has done this season.

&gt; 6. Well if it means we are to get Diego then I hope so. I do like Alonso but I honeslty think with the type of midfielders we've got at the moment.. he's not needed and an attacking midfielder is. We need to balance up our squad more.. yes Alonso offers different to Mascherano &amp; Gerrard but lets face the facts.. all players offer something different to each other but Xabi doesn't offer us what we need right now and that is a creative spark in midfield.

Articles about Arsenal trying to buy him:

&gt; Arsène Wenger wants Xabi Alonso to form a Spanish midfield axis with Cesc Fábregas at Arsenal next season, provided Liverpool dramatically lower their £18m price for the marginalised playmaker.

&gt; Benítez's price tag, however, has deterred Arsenal from returning with a firm offer for **a player they value at closer to the £10.5m** Liverpool paid Real Sociedad for him four years ago.

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/04/arsenal.liverpool

&gt; Arsene Wenger reportedly sent a scout to watch Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso at the weekend as the Frenchman considers making a **£12million** move.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1092890/Arsenal-tabs-12m-rated-Liverpool-midfielder-Xabi-Alonso.html

A bit about the standard of club linked with him:

&gt; The holding midfielder appeared to be on the verge of signing for Juventus, where he held discussions, while **Fenerbache** and Inter Milan were also reportedly keen. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/2496878/Arsenal-target-Liverpools-Xabi-Alonso-to-add-midfield-experience.html

Alonso was crap in 06/07 and 07/08, and after no team was willing to spend more than £12m on him, the penny dropped. He worked harder, grew a beard, played the best season of his career at that point, and fucked off to Real Madrid the very next summer.

The ""Xabi Alonso was consistently excellent and is an automatic legend"" movement is pure revisionism (like ""Agger was a world class CB and would do a great job for us today""). He was retrospectively overrated because he tore it up in Spain for Real and became the player he is today, while the wheels fell off the Benitez train. He had a good first season, an average second, two crap ones, and a brilliant last one. He was a key part of what might well have been our best ever midfield, for one season in 08/09.

It may be referred to as the __Cathedral Church of Christ in Liverpool__ (as recorded in the Document of Consecration) or the __Cathedral Church of the Risen Christ, Liverpool__, being dedicated to [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) 'in especial remembrance of his most glorious Resurrection'. 

&gt;The cathedral is based on a design by [Giles Gilbert Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Gilbert_Scott). The total external length of the building, including the [Lady Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Chapel) (dedicated to the [Blessed Virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus\))), is 207 yards (189 m) making it the longest cathedral in the world ; its internal length is 160 yards (150 m). In terms of overall volume, Liverpool Cathedral ranks as the fifth-largest cathedral in the world  and contests with the incomplete [Cathedral of Saint John the Divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_John_the_Divine) in New York City for the title of largest Anglican church building.  With a height of 331 feet (101 m) it is also one of the world's tallest non-spired church buildings and the [third-tallest structure in the city of Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Liverpool). The cathedral has been designated by [English Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Heritage) as a Grade I [listed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building). 

&gt;The [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism) Cathedral is one of two in the city. The other, the Roman Catholic [Metropolitan Cathedral of Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral), is situated approximately half a mile to the north. The Cathedrals are linked by [Hope Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Street,_Liverpool), which takes its name from William Hope, a local merchant whose house stood on the site now occupied by the [Philharmonic Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philharmonic_Hall,_Liverpool), and was named long before either Cathedral was built.

For me, Rodgers was intentionally asking players to play the ball more slowly forward and even complained a few games back that we were 'playing it forward too quickly'.  The knocking it about the back nonsense is his (in my opinion, poor) interpretation of Barca-style football, but it lacks penetration or even any sort of attacking threat.  He tried it when he first came in, it didn't work.  He reverted to it again beginning of this season, it didn't work.  

I'll leave this with a few Cruyff quotes I find relevant:

""Letting the defense do the build-up leads to endless horizontal passing, and the ball will eventually end up with the goalie. In the meantime the opposition gets all the time needed to organize themselves.""

""A team that passes the ball around in its own defense is doomed. You must pass the ball to midfield, as soon as possible because that's where your best players are, and then the whole defense will be behind the ball.""

""Playing the ball back to the goalie doesn't count as ball possession.""

I don't expect him to have a consistent starting XI, mainly because he seems more of a utility player, useful for many things but not specialised enough to hold down a spot in our starting XI. I expect Bamford to be the first (of hopefully many) to get a starting spot and hold it down. You may wonder why that's the case given Costa and Remy being more experienced and favourable options, however, I don't expect any youth to hold down a place in the next 4 years (Defence - Hopefully Terry, Zouma and Cahill to rotate for the next 2-3 years; Midfield - Matic, Fabregas, Rami, Oscar?

Why did these MP's, who came through the party ranks in the 80's and 90s when homosexuality was a career ender, make it so far with the party? (I've done no research on that btw, it just seems weird on the surface). It doesn't even have to be some kind of Machiavellian scheme either but possible just a series of many interpersonal power struggles creating a disorganised web of abuser and enablers.

That's false, there the likes of the ruger 22 45, for example or the plethora of specially designed pistols for Olympic shooting events. But what it was designed for is irrelevant, its its use which is important, a hatchet is designed to chop blocks of wood, that not of great comfort if someone lops your arm off.

Lee-Enfield rifles were designed for killing people yet has found a welcome home amongst hunters and target shooters.

There are of course different disciplines within pistol shooting, that require different calibres.
 
&gt;they are by their nature less accurate than rifles. 

Which is part of the sport, handguns are more accurate and easier to use than bows yet they haven't completely eclipsed archery.

&gt;Some handguns may be modified for target shooting, but that doesn't escape the fact that a Glock, 1911 or similar has no place in civilian hands.

Well oddly the 1911 has its basic design elements from earlier browning designs for the civilian personal defence market, and the 1911 was the result of natural engineering progression and the addition of a few features requested by the US Army, namely the .45 calibre and the grip safety. However the original glock 17 was developed especially for the Austrian military, but all of the subsequent derivatives were designed with the civilian markets in mind except for the 18, and maybe a few in .40 which may have had law enforcement in mind.

If their designed function is civilian use why do they then have no place amongst us? For the sake of pleasantry we'll ignore the are the police citizens or not.

For instance, you can say it's not racist to criticize Islam (and be correct, given that your points are carefully made), but that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of people making arguments along those lines because of an underlying racist motivation, and as a dog-whistle to other racists. Farage obviously understands the media well, and [his attitudes as a schoolboy perhaps give some indication:](http://www.theweek.co.uk/uk-news/58414/nigel-farage-branded-racist-and-fascist-his-teachers)

&gt; ""Another colleague, who teaches the boy, described his publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views; and he cited a particular incident in which Farage was so offensive to a boy in his set, that he had to be removed from the lesson.""

It's possible that he is simply carefully walking the line, although of course you can't definitively conclude that. You can say he is at least xenophobic, given his comments about not wanting to live next to a group of Romanian men, and the general way in which he discusses the issue.

That also doesn't mean that his party's policies are inherently unreasonable. There's nothing racist about leaving the EU, and having a points based immigration system, I personally just wouldn't think leaving the EU is worth the other drawbacks which would follow. 
And I don't trust that UKIP would stop there - they've already [started talking about repatriation](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/22/nigel-farage-policy-eu-migrants-ukip-mp-mark-reckless), although it was hastily retracted. And it's certainly possible to cut immigration by enough to start doing serious damage - families separated, highly skilled students or workers kept out, and so on.

Yes, the EU is not the only cause of economic growth, come on how did you get that from what I said. But there's no denying the billions being given by the richer countries to the poorer ones are an enormous help.

&gt; As for Spain's very high unemployment rate, it's massively down to the EU - specifically the EMU.

Clearly you don't understand Spain's situation. Spain has always had an enormous ""unemployment rate"" because of its black market, most people don't state their earnings and are therefore classified as ""unemployed"". Interest rates are currently around 0%. What Spain had before was more specifically a real estate bubble because far too many houses were built. There are more houses than people in Spain.

Our [Zuiderzee Works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works) were drained over the last century and are basically a tiny version of this plan for the North Sea. 

How tiny? A total of 637,22mi² was drained, a little over 0,6% compared to the 1930 plan.

Costs? According to [this source](http://www.spanvis.nl/Het%20einde%20van%20de%20Zuiderzeewerken/index.htm), the Zuiderzee Works turned out to cost 2470 million fl. If the price would be approximately stable per mi², 100.000 mi² would've cost 411 billion fl.

*This project took place between 1920 and 1968, I have no idea how to calculate the inflation that took place over time. However, I'm in the mood to calculate a bit further and try to turn it into pounds. I also can't find what the exchange rate fl. To £ was back then, though, so I'm going to be lazy and calculate fl. to € with the exchange rate of when the currency was replaced in 2002 and € to £ with today's rate. Totally useless to do, but maybe it gives an idea, sort of.. You did ask for an estimate, right?* 

This brings me on a total price (of draining the North Sea with 20th century costs) of **£706 billion**.

Would the EU have that kind of money available? Probably not. Besides, the North Sea is a very important piece of nature with unique types of species and ecosystems.

The tax code 1000L gives you 1/12 (monthly paid) or 1/52 (weekly paid) of the tax free personal allowance against your pay. You only get one personal allowance so looking at this simplified and assuming you have no allowable expenses or taxable benefits only one job can have the code 1000L otherwise you may end up underpaying tax. 

When you start a second job your employer should ask you for a P45 from your last job. If you haven't left a job when you tell them you haven't got one they should give you a new starter form to complete to tell them your situation. You'd have to tick the box that states you have another job. Your employer will then use a code of BR (20% of all income). 

Watch for employers that do this wrong and don't ask you to complete the form and / or put you on 1000L when your other job has that code as you will most likly underpay tax and you'll be asked to pay it back.

You need to work out what income you will have gross between 06/04/14 and 05/04/15 from all jobs. You can then decide how to use your 10,000 allowance. Got one job where you'll be there all year and earn 10,000 or more? Then that job ideally gets the 1000L and others BR. Got two jobs that will earn 5,000 each for the year? Ask HMRC to split your 10,000 allowance giving 500L at one job and 500T at the other - that just means 5000 tax free at each. Just work out gross pay at each job, tell HMRC this and ask them to check your codes....

That being said, we carry them here in Canada, if we have an ATC, when doing geological exploration, or working in the wilderness. We have bear, couger, and other large animals that sometimes attack.  Having a larger weapon is great and all, but a small arm, chambered in .45 acp or .50 mag, is awesome for putting a large animal down, quickly, especially when bear mace fails to work, or just makes them angry. bolt actions and shotguns are cumbersome.

One is positive in that Wisdom must feature in Rodgers' future plans. Johnson will definitely be leaving and despite a bright start it seems that Manquillo may not be staying past this season. If the plan is to let Flanagan and Wisdom compete for the RB position then that could be good. 

The second is much more negative in that it seems to me there is some insurmountable problem between Sakho and the coaching staff. His performances have generally been excellent and I thought he did extremely well yesterday. He was proactive, aggressive and clinical in his tackling and neither goal was his fault. If he's being forced out then I cannot for the life of me see what he's done on the pitch to deserve it.

Johnson leaving is virtually guaranteed I'd thought, but Manquillio, Flanno and potentially Wisdom should be enough. Ok there isnt much in the way of experience there but all three are promising. 

I expect Enrique to be around for at least one more season after this one but then I wont care because Moreno is probably the future. 

Sakho isnt leaving, too expensive and too soon since he came in. Also he gets game time when uninjured so...... yeah. 

So fucking what Skrtel's contract is up at the end of next season? He's not earned a new contract and his performances will not get him a move to a club bigger that us so chill. 

Kolo is a stop gap and was brought in to pass on leadership and experience, like Lambert, so while its nice he's doing well when played but we shouldnt be in a position where we have to play him so often.

In some ways I feel that the problem with Farage is the ease with which he dismisses as wrong - ""that's obvious"" or ""it's common sense"" - things that disagree with his pre-existing (and long-established) worldview.

If a call handler can't ascertain a detail or the caller is unable to actually check if the person is breathing, has a pulse etc. then they've just got to guess and I would imagine making it a highest priority red call is the most common. 

Red calls also cover breathing difficulties but right now the majority I'm going to are chest infections, not asthma attack etc. which warrants an 8 minute response.  You're tearing through traffic to find someone sitting, on antibiotics and a bit phlegmy and they've called because they think it should be better by now.

Every mention of chest pain has to be assumed to be cardiac in origin and becomes a red call too, although to be fair I'd say about 50% of chest pains actually are serious enough to warrant it but there's a lot of heartburn, muscular pain etc too.  Can't really take the chance on that one though.

That's not even close to all he does well. I don't completely agree that he's afraid to take on defenders as he does it quite often, at least in the center of the field. He uses bursts of speed to get past the opposition in the midfield, opening up space for others. He can dribble quite well and also has very good ball control, making him great for counters up until the final third. He plays those intricate passes between Chelsea players that help move defenders around and again create chances for others. Lastly, he generally does a great job holding onto the ball and doesn't often give it away cheaply (ignoring his recent performances).

I think you're also slightly downplaying how important his tracking back and work rate are. It allows Ivanovic to make those runs he does so often, as Willian can cover for him. Just look at the Hull game where Ivanovic got caught up and Willian sprinted from the opposing 18 yard box to our half to retrieve the ball and prevent a counter.

&gt; He's had like what less than 5 assists in a season and half at Chelsea? That's not good enough.

If the away side is sold out, it is essentially to say that the game is sold  out for open supporters of the away side. 

Of course, they won't keep you out if you are not overtly supporting the away side outside of the away end, but they ask for respect.  You don't need to act like you're undercover, but you need to go dressed neutrally, remain seated when the away team scores and not openly celebrate, as you're seated among fans of the home side.  You can obviously comment on a truly fantastic play, or take part in conversation around you.  Depending on the game and the part of the park, you may even find that the fans realize you are an away fan and don't particularly care and may just chat with you about the game, especially if you've been polite, neutral, and respectful up to that point.  

For perspective:
The one european football game I have attended was PSG vs. Monpelier.  I was on my honeymoon and we ""supported"" PSG as a result of being in Paris and not really caring either way.  I was chatting with fans who said that everyone around them was a strong  PSG fan-- especially as this was an important game, and it would not be wise for Montpelier fans as a result to sit among the home support.

Now, on the other hand, I have two friends who went to a Newcastle @ Fulham fixture a few years ago.  One of them is a Newcastle fan, one is a fulham fan, over the course of the game, the fans around them realized one of them was a newcastle fan (despite being dressed neutrally), but it wasn't really a big deal because he was being cool, was there with a fulham fan, and was generally a good sport.  If he had openly mocked/cheered at fulham supporters around him after a Newcastle goal, he would have undoubtedly been asked to leave, but he never really made it an issue. 

Chelsea @ Spurs is NOT newcastle @ fulham.  Your friend should go dressed neutrally.  He should keep his mouth shut about his allegiances, and he should enjoy the game.

We don't have many players with that show the same level of commitment as Skrtel. The game this weekend was the perfect example of this. How many players do we have in our team that would continue after having staples in the skull? Not many. He's always willing to put his body on the line and it's something some of our other players are lacking. He's one of the senior players in what is a fairly young squad. We can't really afford lose his experience either. 

Same goes with Gerrard. One of the few players willing to put his body on the line and really the only leader in the dressing room. He is Liverpool Football Club to not just fans but the young lads in the academy. I don't think he should be playing every minute of every game however. He needs to start being used as an impact sub. He showed against Leicester what being rested can do for his form. If Rodgers starts using him similar to how Chelsea used Lampard, we could get a lot more out of him and be able to bring on someone who can actually change the game. 

The main reason I don't think we should get rid of Rodgers and Pascoe in January is because who are we gonna bring in to replace them? There isn't really any world class managers available right now and you can't really get managers to leave clubs until the summer. Our performances have been on the up recently and Rodgers has changed things up as people have been asking him to.

* ""...2 strikers doesn't work!""

* ""...Lambert should play 90 minutes!""

* ""...He needs to pick Borini!""

Now that that's over, let's go through this a FM-circlejerk list:

Out:

1. Jones has been happy to be third choice before. There's no point selling him.

2. Johnson will leave when it makes financial sense for the club to let him go.

3. Skrtel is our best centre back by so far it isn't even funny.

4. You don't think Moreno is good enough, so you'll sell his competition? Enrique and Moreno are very comparable in ability.

5. Coates? Selling him would bring in so little money after fees/taxes/etc that there's no point talking about this at all.

6. A bunch of bollocks speculation about what Gerrard wants. Hmm.

7. See 5.

8. See 5.

9. See 5.

10. Lambert is a completely fine option to bring on as a second striker when we need a goal. It's not his fault we haven't had a *first* striker all season.

11. Agreed about Borini.

12. Assuming it's as simple as that; that'd be nice.

13. You don't know if Pascoe is any good, but you want to fire him?

14. I was leaning towards sacking Brendan a week or two ago, but this news about the transfer committee (if we believe it's not just a ruse to deflect attention from Brendan) and the performance against Arsenal has renewed my belief in him. His 3 big problems this season are bad transfer performance, bad defensive performance and a lack of striker. If the transfers aren't his fault, then it's only really the defence that is entirely his fault at the moment. Keep.

The in list is all FM-jerking, so I'm not even going to touch it.

**My wish list for January:**

In:

* 1 really, really, really, really good striker.

Out:

* Nobody, unless we need to free up funds for the striker.",0,1419294042,null,0,false,0,cn2r4nl,t3_2q4a7q,t1_cn2r4nl,t1_cn2qchv,null,1425263549,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Yeah, except for produce offensively, which is his main job, seeing as how he is a freakin winger. Look at Eden today-he was all over the place defensively, tracking and pressing players and he still gets his in the final third. Same with Oscar, he tracks back and defends/presses nearly as much as willian AND is much much much better than willian offensively.

I did say I would talk to the police if I could prove my alibi, whereas the video focuses on alibis which have no evidence to back them up.

Although it's interesting to watch, I'm not sure it's really applicable to people in England.

Firstly, as you may already be aware, criminal cases have to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. I'm not convinced a jury would be able to say that, beyond reasonable doubt, you were guilty of that murder simply because someone says they saw you in the area - granted, this may be different if there was some kind of evidence that you were in the area. However, assuming that this isn't the case, it's no different to you saying you weren't there. One person's story versus another's does not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Secondly, to get to that stage, the CPS has to agree to charge the suspect, which they will only agree to if they believe there is enough evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. Again, one person saying you were in the area isn't going to sway anybody beyond reasonable doubt.

The video mentions the lawyer and client not being given any evidence that the police have against them. In England, the first stage of a police interview is disclosure. Although police are not under a duty to provide all of the evidence they have against the suspect, it should be ""sufficient to ensure that the Defendant is not advised by his or her solicitor to remain silent in the interview.""^[1](http://insidetime.org/articleview.asp?a=168&amp;c=police_interviews__your_words__for_you_or_against_you)",0,1419294484,null,0,false,0,cn2rd7q,t3_2q1vak,t1_cn2rd7q,t1_cn2q0xf,null,1425263437,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not too fussed but I think we could have a young keeper as the third keeper instead.

Which is either January or the Summer if he doesn't sign a new contract with a reduced wage.

&gt;3. Skrtel is our best centre back by so far it isn't even funny.

Agree to disagree but I believe Sakho and Toure are much better.

&gt;4. You don't think Moreno is good enough, so you'll sell his competition? Enrique and Moreno are very comparable in ability.

I believe Moreno is good enough, but he needs solid competition which can stay fit, I don't think Enrique is good enough to contest his place.

&gt;5. Coates? Selling him would bring in so little money after fees/taxes/etc that there's no point talking about this at all.

We could get a transfer fee and get him off wages, hes out on loan so is not really neccessary to the team.

He could win a league in a foreign league and surely the media and opposing fan pressure must get to him.

&gt;10. Lambert is a completely fine option to bring on as a second striker when we need a goal. It's not his fault we haven't had a *first* striker all season.

Yeah wouldn't have a problem if we wasn't sold.

&gt;13. You don't know if Pascoe is any good, but you want to fire him?

I just think we may benefit more from an experienced, proven at the top level assistant

&gt;14. I was leaning towards sacking Brendan a week or two ago, but this news about the transfer committee (if we believe it's not just a ruse to deflect attention from Brendan) and the performance against Arsenal has renewed my belief in him. His 3 big problems this season are bad transfer performance, bad defensive performance and a lack of striker. If the transfers aren't his fault, then it's only really the defence that is entirely his fault at the moment. Keep.

Yeah wouldn't care if we kept or replaced him, either option is a gamble tbh

His work ethic alone is unmatched across the league. It is not guaranteed an injury prone player like Reus would make our team invincible. He is the vocal point of that Dortmund attack, at Chelsea he won't be having the ball on his feet every time we attack. I won't say no to us signing him, but we should stop this nonsense of picking one player every season as the one holding our team back. Player like Cahill has been way poor compared to Willian and that doesn't mean we need to sing another defender right now.

The ""problem immigrants"" are the uneducated ones who do not integrate, often fail to learn English well, and leech off our social services while not contributing sufficiently to our tax revenue and expecting us to all bend over backwards to match their culture (campaigning for sharia law, for example). 

What the conservatives have done, and May is proposing to take further, is punish and bar from the country the other type of immigrants - the high value ones. We're rejecting the people who will integrate well and work in highly skilled jobs contributing to the economy, while not focusing on the type of immigration which is actually problematic. It's just retarded.

In my opinion if you have a degree from a UK university (especially in a STEM field) that was taught in English, then you should be allowed to remain for up to two years on two conditions. Firstly, you have to show you are actively seeking employment relevant to your degree field. Secondly, you must be able to live self sufficiently without relying on welfare support, either through your own savings, parental/spousal help, or working a part time job.

I don't see how the above system could have any negative effects compared to the current awful one. It would encourage more international students to do their education in the UK, bringing lots of money into our universities and subsidising the education of native British students.

It is a little bit of a myth about credit cards. Yes it does ""build credit"" to have a credit card, but all it really does is build history. And that doesn't mean improve it, it just means you have more of it which, so long as your payments are up to date, more positive history. Which isn't bad.

But, I don't have credit cards. And I can get accepted for almost anything (I'm pretty damned careful). The best credit worthyness you can have is a healthy current account and a healthy savings account both showing a good amount of history.

Therefore, it's certainly possible we see a situation where some clubs above us falter over the course of the season and we rise to the challenge. And then let the chips fall where they may and let's see where we end up.

While I did not expect to struggle this much this season - the injury to Sturridge certainly did not help - I always maintained that this season was going to be a transitional season and there was going to be some growing pains and some frustration especially in relation to last season.

However, I do think that this one step back this season will be crucial to taking two steps forward next season.

1. Wear neutral clothing, do not wear anything Chelsea related.
2. During the game do not show any passion. No celebrating when Chelsea score.
3. Don't mention you support Chelsea to anyone.
4. Have fun and enjoy the day.

Or you don't consider that making fun of someone asking you a serious question might just be a sign of a really shit politician?
