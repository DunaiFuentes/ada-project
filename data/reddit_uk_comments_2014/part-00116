I didn't get into the audios and that till much later so while I kind of liked what I saw of him initially I wasn't as keen on McGann at first as I was on some of the other Doctors. But then I got into those and I was like okay this guy is great and I totally fell in like with his Doctor. When he popped up again with the 50th stuff I was like HOOORAY I was so glad to see his face again. Still would love to see more of him ON SCREEN. 

I liked Eccleston a lot but I have to admit Tennant just stole my heart completely practically from his first line. Smith coming up after him was hard, still is. I have warmed up some to Smith, much more so than I thought I would, but I'm still not a particular fan of his Doctor. I respect him, think he did a very decent job, but I don't absolutely love him the way I do Davison, McGann or Tennant. 

To be fair some of the Classic Doctors do it for me, some just don't, and some of the most popular Doctors they just don't do much for me at all. I'm not a particular Tom Baker fan. I like Colin Baker as a person. He's nice, but to this day I cannot watch the rest of his tenure as The Doctor. The few episodes I watched they turned me totally off watching Who for his entire tenure. Mc Coy, I don't dislike him, but I don't particularly like him either. It took me quite a while to warm up to Hartnell, to Troughton and again, as with Smith, while I respect them I can't say I like them as much as the other Doctors I've named.

My favorites are pretty random as to where they fall in the scheme of things. The Doctors that some people revere are not necessarily the ones I like best. Davison, I have a huge soft spot for him. He, Tennant and McGann they're pretty much my Holy Trinity of Doctors, the ones I hold dearest. I'm very curious about Capaldi.

true,IrritableEnglishman,null,null,"Don't take this as me accusing you of not watching the games, because that isn't what I'm doing, but the people more willing to put up with Sam seem to be those that don't physically go to them (pretty sure you live in the States, right?), while the people who go to the matches every week and spend their hard earned money on £50 tickets or £640+ season tickets seem to be less willing to hang on to him. 

I can't just drop £640 at the start of a season to pay for my season ticket, I have to save up and pay in instalments. It's a big effort and commitment for me to attend matches, and I don't want to turn up week in week out and be disappointed, angry, pissed off and quite frankly, embarrassed by the performances I'm seeing. That's happened all season. I enjoyed the Liverpool game, as it was entertaining despite refereeing and the result, because we actually put some effort in and didn't just sit back and completely roll over. 

Hull, Palace, Stoke, Newcastle, and a load more I've walked away at the end genuinely wondering what the fuck I'm paying all that money for. I've had friends come along and actually ask me why I bother coming to games if that's what I have to watch every week. And to be honest, I really don't know.

I've had a season ticket for 8 years now, since I had my first part time job. I now have to decide if I want to renew this season, and in all honesty, I don't know if I can be arsed. What's the point in me spending all that money on a ticket, travel, in the pub, getting a burger etc if all I see is shit? George McCartney back to Winston, across to Tomkins or Collins, who are told to punt it up towards Andy, who gets a head on it only for Nolan to be busy screaming and shouting in the referees face or blowing out his arsehole because he's too old and unfit to play Premiership football anymore. 

Our subs against Palace for example; bringing on (yet another) big forward to lump the ball in to, only to take off our two wingers? And shove Diame out onto the wing? When has that ever fucking worked? When has Diame performed well on the right wing? Why do we insist on playing Jarvis and Downing on the opposite wings? So they can cut in and shoot? Yeah, fuck off. Not once have I seen that happen. Not once has that worked. Put them on the proper wings and let them use their strong feet to whip balls in. Downing did it once at the weekend when him and Jarvis decided to swap just before half time. Then what happened? They came back out and were back where they started. That's it, cut back inside because you can't use your weak foot like every defender knows is the case, and ping it to the keeper. Quality, cheers Sam. 

Poor old Nocerino. Had his best game in a West Ham shirt against Arsenal, and shock fucking horror, Nolan's back and straight in the team, while Nocerino doesn't get a look in. Playing Nobes and Noc with each other opened up their games so much more than Nolan with Noble. Nobes trusted Nocerino to do his own running, so didn't have to cover for him all the fucking time and could concentrate on his own game. 

My friend has been living and working in Japan for the last 2 years, and came back over for a couple of weeks just recently so I took him to the Palace game as he hasn't been able to keep up with the Premier League since he's been out there. It took him 14 minutes to turn to me and say ""you need someone in that number 10 role where Nolan should be. No ones picking up the balls from Carroll's knock downs, so they're just collecting and recycling the ball to start attacking again"". 14 minutes for him to notice that. It's taken that fat cunt all season and he still hasn't caught on. 

Fuck all the pundits and fans who don't watch us play but think they know exactly what happens at our games. Fuck off. They all say ""oh West Ham fans are spoilt, they don't know what they've got with Allardyce, they'll regret it when he's gone. They don't have a divine right to free flowing football and playing 'the west ham way'"". Fuck off. I used to say the same about Newcastle when they had this useless arrogant prick managing them. I used to think, why are they moaning? He'll steady the ship and sort them out. BECAUSE I DIDNT WATCH THEIR GAMES. Of course I'd like this free flowing, attacking football we all dream of, but that's not going to happen because we don't have the players or the funds for that. What I would like, however, is for a fucking Plan B. 

No, Shearer, you dull, forever balding shitcunt, watching 4 minutes of highlights once a week where it's mainly focused on the opposing team because they're the ones who are actually contributing to the game once a week does not qualify as watching our team. Therefore, shut the fuck up and keep your shit opinions to yourself and return to your ""punditry"" where you describe what is happening on our screens and think you're being insightful. You're not. Fuck off. 

I know Allardyce will almost definitely keep us up until we get to the new ground. I know that. But he has genuinely started to make me fall out of love with football. I don't enjoy going to games anymore. I don't look forward to it, it's a chore. 

Sorry for the rant. I initially wanted to make a minor point, but couldn't stop. 

I think letting all that off my chest has helped me decide about renewing my season ticket. I'm not renewing. There's no way I can deal with another season like this. Might start using the spare time to play football myself again. Maybe I'll actually begin to enjoy the sport again.

And as far as Suarez taking a shitload of shots, it's because he finds himself in positions to score. Look at the games, Suarez is making passes throughout while finding that killer pass and shot. Sturridge on the other hand usually just makes those pacy runs, and when he can't, he usually just tries to beat defenders to no avail. And sometimes it works. A lot of his goals come from his pure pace, but also a lot of them were from set pieces and crosses. His selfishness was particularly noticeable and bad in the United game.

And I don't know why this place has something against Sturridge's selfishness. The rumours of his transfer were chock full of it. He has that stigma for a reason.

Why would you want to be a part of a union that sees you as a terrorist supporter by default? Why would I ever vote to be deemed almost sub-human?

Although this is exactly why I'm quite glad to see NI21, despite the fact that I'll never support them personally. People should be able to come to the decisions they want to, whatever they are, and have that respected. If NI21 gives people a platform to be pro-union without being judged for their background, brilliant.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; I'm a Grade 12 student studying University Politics in Canada, and for my summative assignment I have to research Ireland and Northern Ireland and use this research to conclude what I think should be done about the situation.

Hoo boy, that's a project and a half! There's layers upon layers in N. Ireland, it's very difficult to summarise concisely what's going on.

In terms of the current constitutional state of affairs: As mentioned, the current position of NI is that it remains part of the UK until a referendum indicates majority support for leaving the UK. The power to call and organise this referendum still lies with Westminster, rather than the devolved government at Stormont, but there is a legal provision *requiring* a referendum to be called if it ""appears likely"" that a vote to join a United Ireland would be successful (wonderfully vague!).

There is no widespread support for a United Ireland at present, even among the Catholic population, for a range of reasons (chiefly economic) - the Northern Ireland Life &amp; Times survey chronicles that data regularly. As a result, the current status quo of remaining in the UK with the prospect of a referendum should things change at some point in the future seems like the best solution for now. Independence would probably end up being a worst-of-both-worlds deal - either we set up government structures which allow simple majority rule, in which case you could expect massive abuses of power by whoever got in, or you maintain the cross-community vetos we have presently in Stormont, and the entire country would grind to a halt.

Probably the most pressing issues to keep the peace in Northern Ireland are ones which seem fairly mundane compared to the big constitutional issues - things around identity, which flags are flown and when, what restrictions should or should not be put on parades and other public displays, what to do about outstanding/unsolved crimes. This is all the sort of stuff covered in the recent Haass talks, and is the main source of mainstream contention in N. Ireland at the moment.

Far too much going on there to summarise concisely, alas! A thing to do might be to dig back through /r/northernireland a few months, and check out the comments on political threads.

That is why MEPs within the EU form parties and blocks.

&gt;That means that whatever those nations choose to vote upon will be inflicted on us regardless of whether we voted in favour or against. 

Not really. The EUP is a Parliament of many diverse MEPs. Your situation is applicable only to the Council, really. Sure, the vote of Scotland is small, but it counts. Would you rather not be a member of the EU, because you don't have to be.

&gt;For example Margaret Thatcher and how she gutted Scotland's industries

Not applicable - not an EUP action. And it wasn't just Scotland she did this too. If you want to get mad at Margaret Thatcher for Scotland specifically, a much better target would be the poll tax trial. But this is not relevant to this polling data.

&gt;accession into the EU as a nation independent of the United Kingdom very much isn't a given

All I did was point out the problems with being a minority populace within a larger democracy and that Scotland's future membership within the EU isn't even guaranteed, assuming we ever actually do go independent which seems quite unlikely and I'm not even sure I want that because being a part of the United Kingdom has significant benefits that are not to be lightly discarded; greater military and economic power and a stronger voice on the world stage. 

The Maggie Thatcher incident was a prime example of the first point, since Scotland as a whole didn't want her in power yet had to endure the sweeping changes to Scotland itself she inflicted. I'm too young to care overly much about her but I felt it relevant to the points I made and it's not a sentiment unique to the Scottish. The other British people beyond Scotland's borders are chafing at having laws forced upon them by the EU. Losing power to Brussels as it's commonly seen. That however is nothing new to Scotland, since Westminster already has that kind of power within the United Kingdom.

You've made this rather blasé assumption that I have some overarching grudge against the English and that's quite wrong.

true,salotsalipunan,lfc99,,"Started watching football because high school classmates of mine were watching the World Cup. This being around '98-'99, the biggest names in football in the Philippines were David Beckham and Michael Owen. 

Started watching EPL matches occasionally in '02, alternating between Liverpool and United because all I knew of football was Beckham and Owen. Mind you, at this point, for lack of internet connection and just watching the matches on cable tv, I had no idea at all of the crazy rivalry between the two clubs that I was ""following"" at that point. Following here meaning, whose matches I would watch if I had time. 

After Owen left Liverpool, I stayed with the club because Gerrard, Carragher and Hyppia happened. Three men whose dedication to Liverpool drew me in and wouldn't let me go. Watched until horrible hours of the night the wonder goal by Stevie against Olympiakos. Watched and cemented my hatred of Chelsea the two semi-final matches. By the time Istanbul happened, I was up at 4 or 5 am watching intently despite the fact that I hand't slept and my driver's license test was at 8 that morning. Stevie's flirting with a move to Chelsea happened, H&amp;G happened, falling out of the CL happened, Roy Hodgson happened, Torres left (to which I cried my eyes out for two days), FSG arrived.  At this time, I was already working, and I finally bought my first Liverpool jersey and scarf because I was no longer lining H&amp;G's pockets. I officially got a membership during the 10/11 season as well. 

If all you know of my story is that when I started watching football, I watched specifically for two teams and who those teams were, you will probably think I'm useless. But think about this, when I became a fan in the early 2000s, United was flying high and winning all the trophies left and right. When I had to choose who I will follow, I chose the team that hadn't won the PL for more than a decade. I agree, you don't chose who you fall in love with.

true,sosr,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire in London,"Well first off the guidance was not that equal crimes should not be sentenced equally, that is an oversimplification. Anyway, the difference is in the causes for offending and the effect of imprisonment. The penal system has been (understandably given the split between male and female prisoners) designed around male offenders, the offences they typically commit, and how to punish/rehabilitate them. The stats are that actually more women are in prison now because of longer sentences.

The Equal Treatment Bench Book, which the Telegraph article is based on has been updated again since that article, but regardless, it is an interesting document and more people should read it - it's downloadable on the judiciary.gov.uk website. I also think it is unwise to try and distil the guidance related to gender into a few sentences and that generalisms such as 'women should be sentenced more leniently' are not actually representative at all of what it says, and the background needs to be considered. It does not say anywhere that women should be given gentler treatment than men. Of those women in prison, over 50% of women have been victims of domestic violence, a third of women have been sexually abused. 48% of women committed offences to support someone else's drug habit. Only 8.4% are able to have a positive employment outcome on release compared to 27.3% of men. 

What it says is that the circumstances of women should be considered.

I don't claim to know the solution to the ivory trade, but every supply-reducing law created has almost certainly made the problem worse because it doesn't proportionally reduce demand.

The only thing I can think of as a solution is to either breed elephants for ivory, which is pretty discomfiting; or to make live elephants more valuable than dead elephants.  For that, I can only think of tourism as the answer.  Grant ownership of the elephants to people in a position to profit from the live elephant, and hopefully the problem takes care of itself.

But the second and third are not effective, it is very easy to lift on wheel at a time and get the thing over, the bonus being that accelerating on a motorbike doesn't tire you out like pedalling does. It does not make up for the inconvenience to cyclists who regularly use the route (I remind you, they have these every couple of hundred metres), or to those who simply can't use the route because they can't physically get past the barrier i.e. disabled people.

I've seen police patrolling cycle routes on motorbikes - it obviously doesn't stop them. Why are the barriers there again? I just feel that making cycle routes unusable to disabled people and hugely inconvenient for the majority of users, is too large a cost to pay to stop the odd teenager on a motorbike.

To give you an idea of what a cycle route is like, take a look at this: http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/roger.broughton/reivers/cycletrack.htm The barriers are just one problem among many. They inconvenience you, slow you down, tire you out. It sucks all of fun out of a leaisure ride, and adds a lot of time to your journey if you happen to use them to travel to work. This is why people use roads instead, even though it's more dangerous. Remove the barriers, put down a proper paving surface, and you get a lot less cyclists on roads. It's as simple as that.

In the Netherlands they have strict rules governing what is allowed on cycle paths and what isn't. The mopeds and such can be a problem, but because of the lack of barriers and the proper paving surface, the speed differential is a lot smaller so it's not nearly as dangerous.",0,1398333093,null,0,false,0,ch0p8fx,t3_23rzvd,t1_ch0p8fx,t1_ch0ndnm,null,1433497882,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No, a doctor will give it to the kid, not just 'people'; especially not an unqualified person who isn't their parent and doesn't know if it's the right drug in the inhaler.

The whole point of perscriptions is to make sure that the right people get the right drugs, and to keep potentially dangerous drugs away from people they could harm.

Just because they're self-administered doesn't mean it's completely harmless if the wrong person takes it - otherwise you'd be able to buy it over the counter.

Just imagine what would happen if a kid was alergic to a normal inhaler, or actually needed a different drug for a different condition. It's an unlikely situation, but with thousands of schools it's bound to happen if schools treat all inhalers as interchangable.

&gt;Q1) I think Moyes had a bit of a shocker (by his standards) not playing the same 11 at all in consecutive weeks. It seems like an unnecessary inconsistency. That being said, I don't think anyone could instantly replicate Fergie's success, and expected Moyes to keep the job until the end of the season at least.

&gt;Q2) I like De Gea, Jones, Vidic (put in a good word for us at the end of the season, eh?), Carrick, Mata, Kagawa, and Rooney. The only players I'm not really a fan of are Cleverly and RvP.

&gt;Q3) this might sound like a bit of a cop out, but the distances we have to travel to pretty much every away match don't help the players or fans. After a few away losses on the bounce, a 6 hour trip across the country to dwell on it isn't a great help. Also, Hughtons tactics seemed to be ""start slowly, then play out of your skins in the last 10 minutes if you still have any morale when we're 2 or 3 down""

&gt;Q4) I think even the Norwich faithful like him as a bloke. But his style of play doesn't really benefit us and hasn't progressed at all with the building of our squad. We did finish 11th, but only because of 2 wins that got us out of relegation trouble.

&gt;Q5) Our chances really depend on other teams. As we showed against Liverpool, we can give the performances, but will need a bit of luck to get results against you/arsenal. If Cardiff and Sunderland draw, then it may well be the current bottom 3 to go down (fingers crossed)

&gt;Q6) Absolutely no idea, not really sure who's available/ willing in Europe.

&gt;Q7) Probably Liverpool. Before the season started I said Chelsea.

&gt;Q8) I'm not sure at all, now Giggs has taken over. Hopefully for us, he won't have had enough time to galvanise the team. 1-1 or 2-1 to you

If there is one thing about UKIP, it's that they are against laws being passed because of a constitutional change that there was no referendum on. They don't believe that the European Parliament should be able to have the power to pass all of these bills they vote against. Therefore, no matter how good a bill it is, it is a point of principle that they vote against it. The most they could ever do is abstain.

Can you imagine if they regularly voted in favour of laws in the Parliament and came back to the UK talking about how they shouldn't have been able to pass in the first place? What credibility would they have then? Any interview they had would be focused on that, instead of strange questions about his wife. And rightly so.

It doesn't say much about UKIP at all other than that they're at least vaguely coherent.

It's also worth mentioning,

&gt;The vote that took place in January, saw only 14 of Europe’s 671 MEPs vote ‘no’ to a motion that, according to the creators of the resolution, would “send a clear signal against worldwide wildlife trafficking.”

&gt;Of these 14, six were from UKIP.

So it's not as if this was a crucial vote. It's purely symbolic in nature. There could be some criticism about their priorities if this was going to be a close thing, but it's clearly not. It doesn't even suggest UKIP don't care about wildlife trafficking.

edit:

&gt;Is that their best? Just say ""no"" to everything? What will that accomplish? If the rest of the EU knows that these 6 MEPs have no interest in negotiation or compromise, and that their position and vote is a forgone conclusion, then they won't even bother negotiating with them. Do you think that puts the UK in a better or worse position?

I'm not sure what you think they would be negotiating? They don't represent any government or major parliamentary force. UKIP is a pressure group cum political party. Political parties exist for people to express their political views. 

But they're not like the SNP in Scotland, who are an independentist party within the nation they seek to represent. The SNP is capable of forming a government and so is obliged to negotiate with the senior entity. UKIP isn't going to have a Comissioner any time soon. It's not going to be UKIP negotiating with the EU on Britain's exit. At least not within the forseeable future. UKIP seek to pressure the UK Government into calling a referendum.

true,ArkonOlacar,EN,england,"I think 'B Team' was just mind games. Sure the team against Liverpool will be greatly different to the team he intends to play in the second leg, but it's hardly our reserves.

Predicted team to play Atletico:

Schwarzer
Cole - Cahill - Iva - Azpi
Luiz - Ramires
Hazard - Willian/Oscar - Schurrle/Willian
Eto'o

Therefore positions to play Liverpool we can be reasonably confident on:

Schwarzer
??? - ??? - ??? - ???
Matic - Mikel
Salah - Lampard - ???
Torres

I don't think he will muck around with using a substitute keeper. Fatigue won't be an issue with Schwarzer.

Mourinho already knows who he wants in his midfield on wednesday. Salah can't play, Hazard will play and will be rested against Liverpool. Two of Oscar/Willian/Schurrle will play against Atletico; the one that doesn't play will do 90 mins on the wing against Liverpool. Lampard gets pushed forward, Salah takes the other wing.

Torres/Eto'o are interchangeable, it depends who he thinks would do best against Atletico. Eto'o likes the Bridge and likes big games more than Torres, hence why I've chosen them this way around.

Defense; we know Luiz will be playing in the holding role on wednesday. I don't think Mourinho would play him in the holding role one game, central defense the next, then back to the holding role for a crucial game. Luiz rested.

This leaves us with two options for the back four: We go with the only four first team defenders we have left (Cole - Cahill - Iva - Azpi), or we take the piss and go with four uncapped kids, Ake/Kalas etc. Personally I think Iva is a dead set to play CB against Liverpool, to get him slightly more accustomed to the role before wednesday. I would like to think Mourinho prefers continuity, plays that back four in both games, working on the basis that continuity and sharpness provides a bigger benefit than a weekend off.

tl:dr our defense is the only part of the pitch that might have an actual 'B team'.",0,1398337135,null,0,false,0,ch0pvdr,t3_23u94w,t1_ch0pvdr,t3_23u94w,null,1433498181,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

* 6 votes game from UKIP

* 1 vote came from Nikki Sinclaire, ex-UKIP member who defected to the 'We Want a Referendum Party'

* 1 vote from Philippe de Villiers, French member of the right wing 'Movement for France', who are similar to UKIP, but want to retain a European community based more around business than social issues. He's the only member of his party who is an MEP.  

* 1 vote from Hermann Winkler, German member of the 'Christian Democratic Union', the same party as Angela Merkel. The rest of his party, apart from 2 abstains and 1 no vote, voted overwhelmingly for this resolution. 

* 1 vote from Zbigniew Ziobro, Polish member of 'United Poland', and I believe Eurosceptic party. However, the other 3 United Poland MEPs voted for this resolution. 

* 4 votes from the Dutch 'Party for Freedom', who are also a lot like UKIP.

So, it seems like the majority of the no votes, apart from Winkler, came from Eurosceptic parties similar to UKIP.

* China GDP (google): £4.9 trillion/year or ~£1,225b in 3 months.
* UK exports to China as a % of our GDP: 0.9% of UK GDP

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; The EU commission has the sole right to propose legislation, MEPs have no right to do that at all.

Check out Article 225 TFEU. It contains a process by which the MEPs can direct the Commission to draw up legislative (or other) proposals. It's not binding on the Commission (although they have to give reasons if they don't comply), but it's always worth remembering that the MEPs can fire the Commission.

That said, what's wrong with legislation coming from the Commission? That's part of the Commission's job - like the UK government departments and ministries, they come up with proposals for legislation and draft the basic stuff - with the Parliaments (UK or EU) amending and voting on the proposals. That in the UK Parliament legislation has to be proposed by a member is a quirk of history, not some fundamental democratic right.

Commissioners are - like most civil servants, appointed. However, the Commissioners do have to be approved by the Parliament - collectively, with the President being approved individually - and can be sacked by the Parliament at any time with no consequences to the Parliament (neither of which can be said for the UK Ministers).

Catherine Ashton isn't a Commissioner, and is arguably little more than a spokesperson for the EU, and she wasn't ""simply appointed out of thin air"", as with the Commissioners, she was nominated after a vote by the European Council, then had to go before the Parliament to be approved. So her appointment was ratified by our elected representatives.

Technically the UK PM doesn't have to be elected to a seat in the House of Commons, or even the Lords. But by convention it is usually expected that he or she be in the Commons. That said, the fusion of executive and legislature that the UK has is often criticised - with the more standard separation of powers (as demonstrated by most countries - notably the US and Germany) being preferred; something the EU is set up to achieve.

The equivalent would be for Cameron to nominate someone as Foreign Secretary, and then for the House of Commons to have a chance to question them on matters, before voting whether or not to ratify the appointment (similar to the US system for appointing many cabinet-level positions etc.).",0,1398338390,null,0,false,0,ch0q3jc,t3_23uecf,t1_ch0q3jc,t1_ch0pxq1,null,1433498289,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,jamiejizzle,null,null,"1) Very disappointing season for you, but considering your quality of squad and key injuries throughout the season, is it too far away from where you deserve to be? I would think perhaps not. Moyes should not have been sacked. Fergie was given time at the start of his reign and the board should have shown the same patience with a proven manager to emulate the success of yesteryears.

2) Despite his criticisms I quite rate Chris Smalling (as a CB) and think if he can really develop in that role he will become one of the best CBs in the country in years to come. Also like Kagawa, Mata and Welbeck and it's a shame that the former and latter have not been used more in their time's at the club. 

Not a big fan of Rooney anymore, he's lost his spark but this may be due to Moyes using him in the wrong role (and he also was incorrectly voted for goal of the month when Tettey should have won). Lots of players need to be cleared out this summer but don't like the divers Young and Januzaj (however talented they may be) and how Fellaini doesn't serve more bans I don't know.

3) Away form has been due to negative tactics I feel. We always seemed prepared to go away to nick a point and hope for a miracle to get any more. I think these negative tactics had their effect on the players and we generally struggled to string passes together and make any real chances.

4) Had to go earlier I'm afraid. The writing has been on the wall from the early stages of the season (losing to Villa and Fulham, drawing to Cardiff at home) and change was required over Christmas. Losing to West Brom was the final straw and now we are truly in the s***.

5) I feel we need 4 points at least to be safe. And we're looking at you as the most likely source for these points. But with a new managing set up I'm not sure whether this will help or hinder us but it does help that you don't really have anything else to play for. We are also hoping that Chelsea lose to Liverpool and give up their title hopes as well as Arsenal securing 4th place before the last game of the season. Still, I'd give it around 20% chance of staying up - maximum. Cardiff, Norwich and West Brom to go down?

6) Have no idea really but I'm thinking Giggsy and co. is definitely a temporary situation. Probably Van Gaal but that's just what the bookies are saying.

7) Liverpool, almost no doubt. Mourinho wants to field a weakened team against them this weekend and I think Liverpool are easily going to win that game and then they have Palace away (tough but come on...) and Newcastle (been fodder for the past month and a half). No stopping the Reds (I'm afraid). 

8) Early goal for you and us chasing the game. We have struggled from being behind this season but Adams is a much more dynamic manager and we might actually put up a fight. Realistically?

So you're telling me, an international company based in say, Berwick, would not just hop over the border where the tax rates are significantly lower? Sure.

&gt;An independent Scotland would, he said, be ""an economic counterweight to London and the south east.""

But somehow not the North East? And how would this magic work, precisely? The only way I see this argument working is if the UK Government tries to compete with Scotland by adjusting business rates regionally, as through the old enterprise zones system. But there is no precedent for this at the moment. Even NI, which borders the laxer tax country of Ireland, has no special status.

Even the counterweight to London is a dubious statement. London is the way it is due to network effects. Scotland would have quite the difficulty to compete here. In fact, the rUK probably wouldn't be its main competition. International companies which setup in London do so because it is London, with what that offers. Companies which don't need that, opt to locate in Ireland. It would be Ireland that is the main competition to an independant Scotland. Meanwhile companies located in the North East have very little requirement for said network effects, and would be ultimately, the most affected by the macroeconomic decisions of the Scottish Government.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Wages are the real killer in football, I believe spurs have an unwritten rule that wages cannot exceed 70% of income (to stop us going tits up after a few bad seasons). In regards to signing players, the x-fer fee is normally not the largest issue as spurs are typically smart enough to buy players with sell on value to mitigate costs (Lloris, Vert, Siggy, Eriksen, Lamela etc). Regarding FFP, contracts are amortized over the length of the deal and we don't really throw down huge wads of cash that could threaten FFP.

Spurs operate at a net transfer spending of about £0 and Levy will never let wage costs of the squad balloon. So, each window the club looks to shift deadwood (essentially players that are surplus to requirements, don't look like they have much of a future here and are chewing up wage space) and bring in players to fill the space created. The typical Tottenham target is a young player that is around CL quality, ideally they will improve to CL quality to push our top 4 chances and then can be sold on at a profit to a CL team (preferably not in the same league). Lyon were the perfect example of this and when they went away from what worked from them they fell. This cycle ensures the club generates a profit and can fund further transfers.

On top of this we have a stadium to worry about, this means that we shouldn't really be expecting external cash injections to be allocated to transfers. 

So, for this window, it makes the most sense to identify what players are likely to leave and then work out what kind of wage/x-fer space that leaves for purchases. Cross check that kitty with the value of required targets (LB for example) and you will get a list of possible transfer targets.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Inevitably with this sort of question the replies you get will be coloured by people's own political views. However I'll attempt to give a fairly non-partisan run-down of who the main players are.

**Labour Party**. Formed in the early 20th century by the Trade Unions to give them, and hence working-class people, a political voice. For most of its existence has definitely veered towards policies that are pro-workers and anti-bosses, although it's never been a Socialist party in the true sense of wanting to see Capitalism overthrown (however at times smaller or larger numbers of Labour Party individuals have certainly approved of such policies). Since the mid-1990s the party has morphed into ""New Labour"" which is far more in the Social-Democratic model.

**Conservative Party**. This evolved out of the old 18th-century Tory party (and many people, including Conservatives themselves, still use the nickname ""Tory"" to describe the party and its members). It's essentially a party of the centre-right, espousing policies that are unashamedly pro-business. Traditionally they have also been small-c conservative socially, although in the past decade or so they have been actively trying to shake off their image as a party purely for white, straight, middle-class people.

For most of the 20th Century, either the Labour Party or the Conservative Party have formed the British government.

**Liberal Democratic Party**. This was formed in the 1990s by a merger of the Liberal Party (an old party stretching back to the 18th century Whigs) and the Social Democratic Party (a centre-left breakaway from the Labour Party). Their policies are generally both socially and economically liberal, although there is a strong left-wing among the party's membership which often finds itself at odds with the economically liberal policies the party espouses.

The current British government is a coalition between the Conservatives (major party) and the Lib-Dems (minor party).

These three parties (or their direct ancestors) have been the only ones making up the British government for well over 100 years. There are of course many smaller parties, some of which have had electoral success both at local council level and at Parliament level, but have never had sufficient numbers to form any kind of major power bloc in Parliament, with the exception of the early 1970s when several governments existed with tiny majorities. So, some of the other parties are:

**Green Party**. The UK Green Party is a fairly standard green party, espousing policies that are primarily environmentally friendly, even if that is at the cost of economic output or other potentially-desirable outcomes. They currently have one MP.

**Scottish National Party**. The SNP are, as the name suggests, a party formed to fight for Scottish independence. Besides that their social and economic policies are both generally left of centre. They currently have six MPs in the Westminster Parliament but have a majority control of the Scottish Parliament, and have vowed to take Scotland out of the union if they win a referendum on the subject this coming September.

**Plaid Cymru**. They are the Welsh national party, formed to ensure rights for the Welsh. In general their policies are slightly left-of-centre social democratic. Similarly to the SNP they also have a policy of independence. They currently have three MPs in the Westminster Parliament, however they don't have a majority in the Welsh Assembly so there is to be no referendum on Welsh independence for the time being.

**UKIP** The UK Independence Party. This was formed in the early 1990s as a single-issue party campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union. For much of their history they've had only very slight electoral success but in the last 5 years or so have had huge increases in the opinion polls. Besides their flagship policy, they are generally a pro-business, anti-government policy, somewhat in the mould of the US Tea Party but less extreme and less socially conservative. They currently have no Westminster MPs (although they have quite a few local councillors and European MEPs).

Besides these there are a host of tiny parties covering every part of the political spectrum from the revolutionary socialist left to the fascist right. Some of these (notably in recent years the right-wing British National Party) have had a degree of electoral success, although such parties' appeal tends to be very narrow and short-lived.

It's when people feel disenfranchised and threatened that they turn to violence to make themselves heard. A quick glance down this subreddit shows that 10 of the top 20 current topics are related to politics and national identity. In fairness, there are local elections in a few weeks so party politics are more topical than usual, but the issues around community 'tribalism' are pretty current most of the time. They're seen as questions to be addressed rather than crucial sources of immediate tension. 

News stories this week: a top-ranking NI politician attends a state banquet during the Irish President's state visit, and an Orange march respects its neighbours by keeping the noise down as it passes a nationalist area. In any other country they shouldn't seem that newsworthy. It's remarkable in NI because that politician is a former PIRA commander, filmed toasting the Queen at dinner; it's remarkable because the Orange Order have seen any call for concessions as insulting to a cherished part of their cultural heritage (the marches commemorate of Protestant military victories over Catholics 300 years ago, and many nationalists find them intimidating). 

The current generation is the first one that has grown up in a politically pluralist NI, which is far more socially tolerant and culturally mixed than that of my parents' generation. I don't think I'm out of step with nationalists in saying I'd like to see a united Ireland in my lifetime (and demographic/economic change suggest that may be a real possibility), but only with the consent of the wider population and with sensitive consideration of the needs of unionists.

I'd certainly self-identity as a feminist, and I do think that there are still a lot of ways women are systematically held back - count the number of women in Parliament for example, it's nowhere near 50%, just 22% last year according to HuffPo http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/14/women-in-parliament-poll_n_4273824.html - but I also think there are issues of inequality for men that need addressing. Particularly as you mentioned in terms of childcare, stuff like paternity leave, and also things like mental health issues.

The majority of feminists I know feel the same way. It seems the craziest most vocal ones (e.g. ""all piv sex is rape"" - WTF) are almost entirely on the internet, which is probably true for the MRM too, I expect the majority of them are entirely rational and not women-haters. Stuff like TRP does worry me though, especially because there are some very young users on this site who might quite easily fall into that hateful influence.",0,1398341320,null,0,false,0,ch0qq09,t3_23ruik,t1_ch0qq09,t1_ch0qief,null,1433498583,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If it's a withheld number, you could block all withheld numbers?

If you are sufficiently technical, you could route all calls through a voip system, forcing anonymous callers to go through an IVR which requires them to answer questions such as entering their telephone number or confirming their intent, before the system allows the call to be routed to you.

What you are likely seeing is a robocall system calling more numbers than it has the capacity of humans to answer. Thus most people will be routed to people, others will get silence.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I don't think anyone is claiming we need to be in a political union to trade with Europe. What is true is that being in a single market with common trade rules is by far the best way to trade which makes it easier for small businesses to enter the European market. A business owner was on r/UKIP recently and he was down voted to hell when he said the common market and unification of regulations helps business. There may be a delusion that UKIP is full of racists where that's not true even if some public figures like Geoffrey Bloom or one of the many councillors that has been fought saying something silly, make it hard to deny that some have quite a disordered attitude to Britain's past and to foreigners. Either way there is equally a delusion among UKIP supporters that if you are pro-EU you are also a federalist. 

I presume by political union you mean federalism and in answer to you question I can tell you that no-one I've met thinks that though I am aware of small political groups that think this. Nick Clegg doesn't think this and in all honesty I, as someone who is pro-EU, would have no problem whatsoever (if the EU became a federal state) with the UK voting to get out and leave. But that's not what the EU currently is and I tentatively support David Cameron who is might try and negotiate a new treaty which prevents federalism and ensures the EU will only remain a collection of nations. In other words you would have the vast majority of he country behind you if you wanted to get out of a federal system but people don't see the EU like that. Unless you can scare them into believing it with inflated figures on how much the EU costs or what the EU is going to to to them. That's what initially made me dislike UKIP: their statistics were usually false or exaggerations of grains of truth. They could never be satisfied with telling the truth because presumably people wouldn't be on their side of they knew anything about the EU. The vast majority of UKIP voters are scared people who don't understand the EU - getting a group of confused ignorant people to vote for you is not a mandate from the British people. My mother is your newest recruit and I can guarantee you she does not know what the council of ministers is, she doesn't know the difference between regulations and directives and she reads the Daily Mail so she's never heard one unbiased word about the EU in her life. She is however quite xenophobic and dislikes foreigners. Having never talked about Romanians in her life she suddenly starts talking about them this winter becuase she read it in the paper. She's being led from one boogeyman to the next with no independent thoughts in between and from what I can tell UKIP thrives on these types of people by feeding them statistics everyone else can see are skewed and not quite true which instantly makes me dislike them whoever they are and whatever they stand for.",0,1398341530,null,0,false,0,ch0qruk,t3_23uecf,t1_ch0qruk,t1_ch0q1ho,null,1433498607,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So has Hull. Incidentally the majority of goods coming into the UK do so via Felixstowe and Dover. Very little comes up the Thames including stuff destined for London.

I don't support MRAs hating feminism. It is the most disastrously daft trend I can think of, even if some fringe people are unreasonable. As I've said I believe the only progress on these issues is mutual because there is a stack of counter balancing nonsense that needs to be torn down. A lot of the privileges and restrictions are counter balancing other restrictions and privileges that exist. You can't get rid of one without the other too easily.

&gt; I do think that there are still a lot of ways women are systematically held back - count the number of women in Parliament for example, it's nowhere near 50%, just 22% last year according to HuffPo

The MP one has always been a difficult topic because I've been there talking to local party members who've challenged all woman lists in Labour constituencies. In die hard constituencies the only democracy they have is the right to appoint candidates, something that many local party branches defended zealously during the Blairite NL purges. The all women lists were effectively eroding that democracy. Labour were even resisting local women candidates at one point. It was in part a thinly veiled excuse to continue the ideology purge.

From my perspective I'd ask where the path from normal person to trough feeding politician breaks down on gender balance.

You complain about cyclists breaking the HC. I say its due mostly in part to motorists breaking the HC around cyclists. 
 
You don't want cyclists on the pavement, do something about the motorists who influenced their decision to be there.

But if you like regarding shit rules... the overtaking rule for cars with regard to cyclists is pretty vague. There's a rule right there that needs updating. Maybe specifying a minimum overtaking distance.

And yes, I like the museums, but you need a good museum a couple of times a year. The ability to get from one side of the town to the other without having to change buses in the middle I could do with every day, and yet remains strangely absent. 

It's not that Oxford isn't a nice place to visit, it is, but it massively fails at so many of the practical day-to-day stuff that pointing at an indie cinema, or a cafe and going ""This is fantastic!

The basic reality is that the vast majority of people in the EU, and MEPs by extension, believe in protecting those basic rights. It would be like trying to walk in and have a serious debate about lowering the age of consent to 5. It's just not going to happen. The movement of workers is one of the pillars of the European Union.

Incidentally, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that open borders are non-negotiable. That has nothing to do with the EU. That's a separate agreement called the Schengen Agreement, which the UK hasn't signed, so it doesn't apply. The Schengen countries have the right to tell each other that individual countries shouldn't exit the agreement, and none plan on doing so, but the idea that open borders is an example of non-democratic governance is like being furious at Leicestershire County Council because there are too many potholes in Oxford. It has nothing to do with either the EU, or the UK, which won't implement the agreement. 

People can want to change the EU all they want. I know I do. But the idea that elected MEPs can go in with the express purpose of 'fuck it all, I'm here to make a mess' is counterproductive not only to this country but to all others. Also, I can't think of any examples where MEPs haven't got a say on issues. They can debate everything passed by the Parliament. If they don't like whatever it is they don't like, then they can ally with other European sceptics to change it. There's plenty of support for that.

You tell the manager at that time that you think he should be aiming this season for a top for finish with an outside possibility of a title challenge.

The end of the season rolls around, and we have ended up 5th again. Personally, I would not be of a mind at that time to fire the manager because I think he has achieved what is expected of our club, especially if it is his first season in charge.

I would probably give the manager another season, and I might then expect with a little more stability at the club that they improve their performance..

No team deserves greatness, it has to be earned. There is a massive difference between expecting and aiming. We've not done anything in the past 20 years that gives us any reason to expect anything.

It is normal politics in so far as the major parties want to maintain the status quo. They are used to having to only fight one another, and you see it all the time. 

The attacks on UKIP are not unexpected, but still, three major stories in as many weeks does seem suspicious. When else has it happen so obviously? 

Let me ask you, do you think it is just a coincidence that these stories are coming out now? just before the elections? 

&gt; the press would ask questions about how their foreign secretary wasn't taking a job that could be taken by a British worker, wife or not

Just as I said, your story about low skilled workers being employed by politicians is very different to Farage employing a highly skilled foreign worker (UKIP supports a skills based immigration program by the way) who is also his wife. Anyone can see the benefit of having your wife be your assistant, especially if you have such a high workload as Farage does. If Farage was employing cheap foreign cleaners or people to work in his office, then you might have a point. But being his assistant is a highly skilled job that has special requirements for which she is best qualified.

* Arsenal built the Emirates from scratch but it's too big and spaced out, with the fans too far from the pitch to really give a good atmosphere - even in big games.

* As a result of supply being at or exceeding demand (and also due to it being in London), Arsenal is often full of tourists there to take pictures and say they've visited the stadium rather than because they want to see Arsenal which dilutes the atmosphere further.

* The Anfield season ticket waiting list may be 30,000 or so but how many of them would be bought if they all suddenly because available?  I'd suggest less than half.  There will be a number of people with their kids' names on there in a speculative manner and people who are on there who unfortunately just wouldn't be able to afford to buy it if it was offered.

* Moving from Anfield would leave a desolate hole in L4 at this stage.  At least this brings some regeneration to the area and helps the community get back on track after those 14 years.

Whilst i'd have loved to see us realise our revenue potential and have a glitzy new stadium, I can see why they've made this decision and I believe in the leadership team to have done their due diligence on this.

If you do go into figures: In '07 you could get €1.4-5 euro for your pound, today your pound is worth €1.21 euros. That means is the pound is weaker in comparison to the euro than when the euro crisis started. The pound has lost more value than the euro has.

Yes, all of those. The EU commission has the power to make decisions without the consent of the EU parliament.

That is irrelevant if the issue is non-negotiable. It wouldn't matter if the majority did want to end it. Why make it non-negotiable in the first place?

&gt;That has nothing to do with the EU. That's a separate agreement called the Schengen Agreement, which the UK hasn't signed, so it doesn't apply

The Schengen Agreement relates to the movement of people between countries without boarder checks, which we are thankfully not a part of. 

The free movement of people relates to the ability of any citizen of the EU to settle in any other EU nation. This we have no control over.

But then turnout for a General Election is usually only around 50%.

I never learned about the EU at school. Or certainly not much if I did. The EU isn't thrown at us in ways that you see in other EU countries. For a start we don't fly many British flags anyway, and you rarely see an EU one. Whereas compare that to Italy and whenever you see an Italian flag there's an EU one right beside it, and flags are much more commonplace there. It seems every school flies one. Other EU countries will be similar but Italy is the one I'm most familiar with.

I think in the past people haven't cared so much about the EU. It's there but exists through banal channels mostly. So turnout has been low, and since we don't get taught about it there's even more apathy towards it. We don't even get taught much about UK politics really. The UK is a bit of a reluctant partner in it all and public attitude reflects that. Opting out from the Euro and Schengen are two big ones, then a few other smaller ones relating to labour laws and crime. Most people can't even name their MEP. I can't. I knew one of them back in the north east constituency but when I emailed with a legitimate question once it got ignored so it kind of turns you off European politics. If I wrote to my MP with even a trivial matter I'd at least get an acknowledgement from an assistant. 

Teaching about the EU would take forever anyway. Trying to condense the EU parliament, the ECB, European Court, European Council, EU Commission etc. into some lessons is difficult.  It's an administrative mess.

But the point is still valid and I don't see why you take exception with it. Drastically altering the age of consent isn't going to happen because virtually no one would accept it. Neither is the EU changing its stance on the free movement of workers. I'm not saying that it *shouldn't* be changed, and several heads of government have both expressed concern and proposed ways of getting around it by delaying any benefits to EU migrants. I actually think it's an important topic that should at least be addressed. But it won't and it can't be without completely reopening the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.

On what do you base that? Europe's advantage is its locality, whereas the Commonwealth is spread across the world

Take India for example. Cameron has tried on many occasions to enter major trade deals and promote British business with India, but they don't entertain it. The Commonwealth is great for what it is, but that is not a trading bloc.

[Here's a UK equivalent, albeit from 2011.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/feb/24/uk-trade-exports-imports#) A very clear European focus, because of the EU but also because these are the nations an hour or two away. Not the Commonwealth in subsaharan Africa or ASEAN states on the Pacfic.

Yes, other lines are ""old"", but they have all been modified or upgraded to deal with faster speeds, higher frequency services, electrification, the progress of rail technology and so on. Not so for Cornwall and Plymouth. 

Cornwall (and I think bits of Herefordshire) are the last remaining places on the network where rail signalling is done by entirely mechanical means, with people pulling huge levers to set signals and points. Power signalling is in itself ancient, but most of the Cornish main line doesn't even have that. 

There are still sections of single track, which isn't a huge problem with the low frequency service we have, but it would add to the cost if we wanted to increase it. 

Further afield, it looks like the South West won't be electrified any time soon. But apparently it's crucial that s
South Wales gets fully electrified, with the Welsh government easily obtaining an extension to Swansea which was not part of the initial plan. 

The Dawlish situation would never have been allowed to happen on any other line, and if it somehow had been, there would be a replacement line approved nearly immediately.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;I think this protest is probably from the Unite Against Fascism (UAF) which have somehow managed to make themselves more fascist and violent than the BNP who they were formed to oppose. 

You seriously don't know what you're talking about. The BNP emerged from the National Front, the militant wing of which was Combat18 which called for the hanging of blacks and many of its member committed violent attacks and murders on non-whites. Have you ever heard of anything even slightly comparable from anti-fascists? No. The UAF are anti-violent, which is one of their problems, the radical wing of the anti-fascist movement is in the autonomous networks of ANTIFA, they have proved highly successful in getting fascists of the streets, it was they who destroyed Combat18. The **vital thing you have to remember** is that liberal democracy was **no** barrier to fascism and Nazism, the Nazi’s were elected in an atmosphere of economic and social anger, the state did nothing to stop their rise and even contributed to it. The only way we can be sure to protect our society is by our own anti-fascist self-organisation, autonomous from the state.

There's a massive different between violence against the violent, and violence against the non-violent. If left to their own devices fascists would go around attacking non-whites, only the self-organisation of anti-fascists can stop and defend against those attacks, only the naive can believe that defence doesn't (sometimes) require violence. Surely you would draw a distinction in WW2 between the allies and the axis (Nazi's et al.) even though they were both violent, the question is what was their violent for and directed against. Violence is a neutral tool what matters is how it's used.

&gt;We have to look at the libertarian/authoritarian spectrum, Farage has spoken openly about the need for a liberal society with mutual respect, while the Lab/Con governments have been continually authoritarian.

You obviously don't know what you're talking about. Attacking immigrants and lots of other marginalised groups is hardly 'mutual respect'. There are massive contradictions within Farage's policies that haven't so far been revealed since at present UKIP is seen as a one-policy-party. The contradictions are between a 'libertarian' (that is libertarian in the distorted American sense) economic policy and an authoritarian social policy (in fact this is the same contradiction felt by conservatives). For example the neoliberal free trade planks which advocate the free movement of capital and people, no not at all fit with his conservative authoritarian social agenda which is about 'Britain for British' (i.e. whites) closing the borders and so on.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; Yes, all of those. The EU commission has the power to make decisions without the consent of the EU parliament. 

On most issues, yes, but not on the movement of people. That's one of the four key principles enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. According to the simplified revision procedure, where the Commission can work alone, only the finer details of the right to the freedom of movement of people can be exercised by the Commission. In order to fundamentally change the right itself, found in Section 1 of the TFEU, any EU institution can submit a proposal to the Commission detailing an alteration to that section. The President of the Commission must then call a convention in which the governments of all member states ratify the change to the treaty for it to come into effect. In this way, the Parliament actually could definitely alter the fundamental freedoms. So it's certainly not non-negotiable. The issue is that most European countries don't care enough about the issue to work with British eurosceptics to try and force it through Parliament, so it is effectively 'non-negotiable' for all intents and purposes in the sense that neither the EC or the EP has enough members who want to change it.

&gt; The Schengen Agreement relates to the movement of people between countries without boarder checks, which we are thankfully not a part of.

&gt; The free movement of people relates to the ability of any citizen of the EU to settle in any other EU nation. This we have no control over.

See my previous comments about altering the fundamental freedoms. Also, I'd remind anyone reading that the freedom of movement of persons was established in the TFEU in Rome in 1958. Britain joined the EEC after a referendum in 1973. The UK knew what it was signing up for at the time, so it's not like this is some huge surprise. 

&gt; That isn't UKIPs intention. They see their job as being to limit the power of the EU over the UK in what ever way they can. Their no vote might be the thing that prevents the EU gaining another power over the UK. They are elected on that mandate and they have every right to be there, just as a UK politician elected on the promise to try to reduce government power over local authorities would be within his right to vote against any additional powers for the government in the UK.

I completely accept that and think they have every right to be there. They're not alone, either - there are plenty of outright anti-EU MEPs in the EP who work with them. In fact, I find the entire theme of this thread to be short-sighted. Sinn Fein MPs from NI have done the same thing in Westminster for ages. I personally would love to see *far* more power transferred to the Parliament, making the Commission simply a review board for legislation originating in the Parliament. Therefore, whilst I understand the point they're making, I fundamentally disagree with UKIP's tactics of voting against everything, even that which would be beneficial to the UK such as this ivory trade deal.

Can you show me some EU legislation introduced by the commission which europsceptic MEPs were consulted on?

&gt;That said, what's wrong with legislation coming from the Commission? That's part of the Commission's job - like the UK government departments and ministries, they come up with proposals for legislation and draft the basic stuf

In the UK appointed officials aren't the only people who can propose legislation, it can come from anyone in parliament although it rarely gets made law. Our system should be more democratic though and just because it isn't doesn't justify the lack of democracy in the EU. 

&gt;she was nominated after a vote by the European Council, then had to go before the Parliament to be approved.

As with legislation the parliament is just the rubber stamp. The commission is appointed, the parliament don't choose the candidates they just sign off on them. I'd like to see the day when a Eurosceptic is appointed to the commission.

If they estimate only 20% of calls are picked up then they might put their balls on the line and dial five calls for each free agent. If they lose the bet then two or more pick up with most getting a dead line. Depends how cutthroat they are about wasting time, unfortunately call centres are pretty notorious for that.

As seems to be the norm here, you have misunderstood UKIPs policy for taking part in the EU parliament. They are not being lazy, it would be lazy not to turn up at all. They do turn up and they vote against every piece of legislation that would increase the power of the EU. Why? because that is what they were elected to do. That was what they promised to do, that is what the people who elected them expect them to do. Their no votes could be the reason a piece of legislation fails, and a bit of power remains in the UK, and that is a victory for them, and the people who voted for them.

Why is it weak to be focused on trading with your nearest partners? Consider the added costs of attempting to increase trade with India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand versus France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. It is a ginormous difference.

&gt; Geographically speaking we are nearer to North American than Australia is. (over 8000 miles for them, around 3500 miles for us)… As the crow flies, give more distance for the uncertainty of shipping.

The shipping distance from Dover to Melbourne is longer than New York to Melbourne (and consider how that reduces when ships leave from the US West Coast). Not to mention potential problems in East Africa. 

We reduced our trade with the Commonwealth to refocus towards Europe for precisely the reasons you want us to refocus back to the Commonwealth.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; Can you show me some EU legislation introduced by the commission which europsceptic MEPs were consulted on?

Yep. [Here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1398348190919&amp;uri=OJ:JOL_2014_122_R_0004) is a Regulation from a couple of weeks ago, approved by the Parliament on 11 March. The Parliament, including the 'euro-sceptic' MEPs, would have voted and debated it, probably had the opportunity for amending it.

All EU legislation that goes through the ordinary (or some of the special) legislative procedures goes before the Parliament, and the Parliament can debate and vote on it, and on amendments and so on.

&gt; In the UK appointed officials aren't the only people who can propose legislation, it can come from anyone in parliament although it rarely gets made law.

It is almost never made into law, and usually when it is the results are terrible as individual MPs tend not to have the time or resources to properly draft legislation. Private Members' Bills are usually put before the Houses as a way of starting a debate. Afaik the European Parliament doesn't need to jump through extra hoops to have a debate on something, so they don't need that procedure.

Of course, the democratic deficiencies in the UK don't justify those in the EU; but when the EU is arguably more democratic than the UK, it is hard to argue that we should abandon the EU because of that - rather we should be working on both the EU and UK to improve them.

&gt; As with legislation the parliament is just the rubber stamp.

Do you have evidence for this? Evidence that MEPs are not doing their job? One could make the same claim about the UK Parliament; when was the last time a Government bill failed to pass? In practice, in both cases, the Government/Commission will make sure that their stuff will pass before proposing it, by talking or negotiating with the MPs/MEPs - but the overall effect is the same; the Parliament gets the final say.

Perhaps if there is a problem with MEPs not doing their job properly we need to treat EU elections more seriously, and vote for MEPs who will do something in the EP, not just turn up the minimum times required and vote against every proposal.",0,1398348707,null,0,false,0,ch0t2rw,t3_23uecf,t1_ch0t2rw,t1_ch0sr27,null,1433499760,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; Aren't you essentially admitting that the EU is anti-democratic? 77% of the British people want to limit open door immigration and move to a skills-based immigration policy, you yourself concede that this is IMPOSSIBLE under the EU.

No. It's not impossible. It can be done. I just responded to another person and I'll paste what I said:

According to the simplified revision procedure, where the Commission can work alone, only the finer details of the right to the freedom of movement of people can be exercised by the Commission. In order to fundamentally change the right itself, found in Section 1 of the TFEU, any EU institution can submit a proposal to the Commission detailing an alteration to that section. The President of the Commission must then call a convention in which the governments of all member states ratify the change to the treaty for it to come into effect. In this way, the Parliament actually could definitely alter the fundamental freedoms. So it's certainly not non-negotiable. The issue is that most European countries don't care enough about the issue to work with British eurosceptics to try and force it through Parliament, so it is effectively 'non-negotiable' for all intents and purposes in the sense that neither the EC or the EP has enough members who want to change it.

However, I'd remind you of two things:

* This right was guaranteed by the TFEU written in 1958. Britain agreed to join the EEC in a referendum held in 1973. This right isn't exactly something new that's been foisted onto EU members recently with no debate. This was one of the core principles in signing up to the EEC to begin with.

* It doesn't matter how many people want a change to it. They're free to vote UKIP all they want and send as many UKIP MEPs to Brussels as they desire, but Britain isn't the only country in the EU, and the vast majority of people across the EU regard the freedom of movement of workers as one of the fundamental principles of the EU. Accordingly, the vast majority of MEPs from across the continent support this. So no matter how much UKIP MEPs want to change it, they simply won't find the support to do it. If the UK feels like this necessitates exiting the EU by referendum, then so be it, but no one has the right to be shocked like this is some new policy that was sneaked through the back door.

&gt; In what sense can people claim that the EU is democratic if THEY and not the British people have control of our borders?

They don't. The UK signed up to the freedom of movement of EU workers in 1973. Each country still maintains its own immigration and border patrol services and is free to amend and reform their own non-EU immigration systems as much as they'd like. Some countries have decided to eliminate internal border checks via the Schengen Agreement - others such as the UK and Ireland have declined to participate. That is their right. 

If Britain didn't want free movement of Europeans, it shouldn't have signed up in the first place.

EDIT: I should also say this - I believe that there is a deficit of democracy in the European Commission, and I'd like to see huge reforms (though somewhat ironically, it's not like the UK's got form - the House of Lords is an unelected body of lifetime appointees). However, I do think there's something to be said about unelected people with little party allegiance being able to scrutinise legislation. I'd love to see the ability to propose or amend legislation unilaterally stripped from the EC, with all of that power vested in the Parliament. The EC should function as a review board, like the House of Lords. ",0,1398348709,null,0,false,0,ch0t2t7,t3_23uecf,t1_ch0t2t7,t1_ch0siet,null,1433499760,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

There is so much that goes into this apart from just adding shear quantity of seats and the balance between corporate boxes, more expensive seats, retail space etc. is meant to help update the area around the stadiums as much as inside.  And of course $$$.  I don't have an exact figure but one corporate box equals x number of regular seats and increasing the overall match day revenue is the top priority in my book.

I honestly love the fact that it's a minimal update for now with room to expand in the future.  It's impossible to renovate everything at once and still have the stadium functioning as normal so I'll take this option every single time.  If everything goes to plan we'll see updates on the other parts of the stadium in 4-8 years time and I don't think they'll have a problem reaching the final tally proposed of 60K+ while still maintaining the general look/feel of the stadium.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;The issue is that most European countries don't care enough about the issue to work with British eurosceptics to try and force it through Parliament, so it is effectively 'non-negotiable' for all intents and purposes in the sense that neither the EC or the EP has enough members who want to change it.


At the moment there is not enough interest, but it is growing, all across Europe, and the commission is trying to silence it and pretend it doesn't exist. They will have to deal with it eventually, when the problem is too big to ignore, and by then it will be much harder to deal with.

As you said, there isn't enough interest to change anything yet, the problem is, the negative impacts are not spread out evenly across Europe, they affect some countries more than others, and the fact that those countries cannot do anything to deal with the problems is a sign of how unfair and undemocratic the system is. It is also why there is more support for leaving the EU in some countries than others. A blanket approach to some issues just doesn't work, and the commission is not willing to admit that, hence the issue being non-negotiable, hence why some countries feel it would be better to leave the organisation all together. 


&gt;The UK knew what it was signing up for at the time, so it's not like this is some huge surprise.

Again, the TFEU  relates to the movement of people between boarders, not the issue of settlement, which the 1973 EEC referendum also had nothing to do with. The EU has grown far beyond what was initially proposed then, and what we had a referendum on in 1973. The people who voted then had absolutely no idea what the EU would become or how much sovereignty they would loose. You can argue on whether the EU is a good or bad thing in its current state, but you cannot say we have ever had a direct vote on whether or not we are happy with it.

You can pick (almost) any of the train operating company websites (don't use thetrainline.com), and just specify that you want to make a journey from Cantebury to Bath.  It will then give you a range of ticket options and journey times.  The three main types of ticket are Anytime, Off-Peak and Advance (in descending price order).  If you pick Anytime, this means you can get any trains you like on your day of travel.  Off-Peak restricts you a little bit, and you won't be allowed to travel on the ""commuter"" trains - the website should show you which times you can get an off-peak ticket for.  Advance tickets are the cheapest of the bunch (if they're available) and you must get the exact train(s) that you select when buying the ticket.

If the first train is delayed and you have an Anytime/Off-Peak ticket, you can just hop on the next available service to your destination, and, depending on the length of delay, you can claim compensation from the train company that made you late.

If you have an advance ticket and your train is delayed, you should talk to the conductor or station staff, and they should be able to authorise your ticket to allow you to get the next available train to your destination (same rules fro compensation apply).

If the journey you book is one that allows you to travel via London, then your ticket should allow you to make the journey between the two stations on the tube (but not anywhere else).",0,1398349368,null,0,false,0,ch0tcls,t3_23uyfu,t1_ch0tcls,t3_23uyfu,null,1433499889,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

Assuming that voting ""no"" against any legislation that gives the EU more power is always the best option is stupid and lazy. It suggests to me that the UKIP MEPs are just enjoying the fact that they get a salary for doing fuck all. Meanwhile, the poor people who voted them in back in the UK think they're doing a fantastic job.

What is their problem with the EU, really? Is it that ""they have all the power?"" Or is it the (so-called) issues that come along with being in the EU, like immigration? If it is the latter, then the UKIP MEPs are doing a shitty job by not using this opportunity to pass measures that actually benefit the UK.

I would hazard a guess that most European people struggle with this. The EU is about as unwieldy and arcane as a democratic government could be.

'That constant barrage of undue criticism is what's coming home to roost now.'

There are many wise and sensible individuals, including the recently deceased Bob Crow and Tony Benn, who were and are vehemently opposed to the E.U for reasons that can't just be dismissed as scapegoating. You can see it as a product of a national blame game, sure. You can also see it as a distinctive British political culture that values parliamentary sovereignty. 

People have to stop patronising Eurosceptics, unless they genuinely believe the bulk of this country is populated by morons and bigots (which sadly I reckon some pro-EUers believe.) If people are uninformed about the way the EU works, what does that say about the EU's accountability and processes? I am quite uncomfortable that the lack of understanding from the average person over the EU is somehow a defence of the way it is run. I would argue that the lack of understanding when it comes to the EU is an indictment of its democratic deficit.

Well, no. I'm not really sure how there can be much disagreement over a resolution like this though.

&gt; Good on Farage for leaving his well paying job in the city to start a party from SCRATCH because he truly believed in what he was doing.

Fair enough, not sure how that's relevant though.

&gt; He was right on the euro, he was right on the exchange rate mechanism, even leftists can't deny that, and yet we're supposed to believe that he's just a loser who wants to steal money from the EU.

No, but I do believe he is just like most other politicians, just with a slightly different lick of paint and more press conferences in pubs.

&gt; Never mind the fact that he is campaigning for himself and his MEPs to LOSE THEIR JOBS.

He probably has ambitions to become a MP in the UK parliament, and will always have the money he made from City trading to fall back on. Not really that brave. 

&gt; People will find any reason to criticize UKIP. ""Oh, that guy disagrees with the EU and so uses democracy to make his voice heard within the EU itself? He's wasting taxpayers money!""

And people do exactly the same thing to the other parties. I remember the media hate train on Gordon Brown, with 2 page editorials on his kit kat eating habits. The other parties have had it just the same, and the only reason there has been a massive influx in UKIP criticism is because they are new, and there is loads of stuff to dig up.

&gt; I repeat, you just want an echo chamber, don't you? Sums up the left wing pretty well. You're all champions of ""diversity"" and ""tolerance"", unless someone has right wing views, in which case they shouldn't be in the parliament and they should just fuck right off.

Again, putting words in my mouth. I support UKIPs right to do and think whatever they want, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to criticise them for it. When UKIP or UKIP supporters criticise something it is freedom of speech, or anti-political correctness, or saying what the people are thinking. Apparently, when someone criticising UKIP, it is a smear campaign, or they are running scared, or they're trying to dictate their opinions. That's just as bad as what you're claiming I think and do.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; At the moment there is not enough interest, but it is growing, all across Europe, and the commission is trying to silence it and pretend it doesn't exist. They will have to deal with it eventually, when the problem is too big to ignore, and by then it will be much harder to deal with.
&gt; 
&gt; As you said, there isn't enough interest to change anything yet, the problem is, the negative impacts are not spread out evenly across Europe, they affect some countries more than others, and the fact that those countries cannot do anything to deal with the problems is a sign of how unfair and undemocratic the system is. It is also why there is more support for leaving the EU in some countries than others. A blanket approach to some issues just doesn't work, and the commission is not willing to admit that, hence the issue being non-negotiable, hence why some countries feel it would be better to leave the organisation all together. 

I still maintain that it *is* negotiable. The Parliament can force the Commission's hand on the issue of the four principles if they wanted to. It's true that it disproportionately affects certain countries (ie wealthy ones) more than others. However, don't forget that [the number of Brits living in the EU is almost the same as the number of Europeans living in the UK](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5cd640f6-9025-11e3-a776-00144feab7de.html#axzz2zoWek3xy). Also, I take some issue with you describing EU migration as 'negative impacts'. Could you elaborate the ways in which it is negative?

&gt; Again, the TFEU relates to the movement of people between boarders, not the issue of settlement

But it does. The issue of settlement is under 3(d) of the TFEU relating to workers. Article 21(1) of Title 5 states:

&gt; Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.

In fact, the European Court of Justice had to rule specifically that this right extended to unemployed people, or people employed outside of their state of residence, as far back as the [Baumbast case](http://eucaselaw.blogspot.com/2013/05/baumbast-case.html) of 1968 where a German man living in the UK was unable to find employment and began working from home for a German company based outside the EEC. The UK refused to renew his residence permit due to not having a job, and the ruling was that self-sufficient migrants may reside in any country of the EEC/EU. 

Furthermore, there are mechanisms that national governments may employ to restrict certain migrants without the means for self-subsistence. [This section briefly explains some of these things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Free_movement_rights). The recent changes to benefits for EU migrants in the UK is one being replicated across much of Europe.

Almost all of the rights of free movement were established well before the UK referendum, mainly by the Treaty of Rome 1957 and TFEU 1958, as well as case Baumbast Case of 1968. The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 only introduced the concept of EU citizenship. To wit:

&gt; ""the ECJ has held[8](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61982J0286:EN:NOT) that a recipient of service has free movement rights under the treaty and this criterion is easily fulfilled,[9](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0186:EN:NOT) effectively every national of an EU country within another Member State, whether economically active or not, had a right under Article 12 of the European Community Treaty to non-discrimination even prior to the Maastricht Treaty.[10](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996C0274:EN:NOT)""

&gt; You cannot say we have ever had a direct vote on whether or not we are happy with it.

I don't really understand what you mean by stupid and lazy. And they certainly don't do fuck all, Farage himself co-chairs several committees in the EU so its not like he's doing the bare minimum. But they are doing everything they can  to limit the power of the EU, which is what the people who voted for them wanted them to do.

&gt;What is their problem with the EU, really? Is it that ""they have all the power?""

That's a very simplified way of looking at it that doesn't really help anyone understand the issue, but yes. 

&gt;Or is it the (so-called) issues that come along with being in the EU, like immigration? If it is the latter, then the UKIP MEPs are doing a shitty job by not using this opportunity to pass measures that actually benefit the UK.

What opportunities? The council has made the issue on the free movement of people non-negotiable, and that has been confirmed several times. How do you negotiate over something that is non-negotiable? 

&gt;Not really

There are only 9 UKIP MEPs, so the figures can be skewed easily by one or two. The other issue is that Nigel Farage was in a plane crash last year and has been unable to attend the parliament as much as he would like due to health reasons, but if you think he is lazy, I suggest you look up some of his speeches to the EU parliament.

UKIP would only vote on issues that give the EU more powe anyway, so its not a surprise that they would have a lower voteing record.

 Also, its worth noting that his voting record is better than any of the major party leaders in the house of commons. ",0,1398351116,null,0,false,0,ch0u4au,t3_23uecf,t1_ch0u4au,t1_ch0tj7k,null,1433500251,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Yep. Here is a Regulation from a couple of weeks ago, approved by the Parliament on 11 March. The Parliament, including the 'euro-sceptic' MEPs, would have voted and debated it, probably had the opportunity for amending it.

How do I specifically find out who was consulted on the creation of this legislation and who if any eurosceptics amended it?

&gt;It is almost never made into law, and usually when it is the results are terrible as individual MPs tend not to have the time or resources to properly draft legislation.

The point is that ability exists and most of the legislation come from the elected ministers of the government. As I said our system is far from perfect but it's better than just appointed officials making legislation. 

&gt;rather we should be working on both the EU and UK to improve them.

The British public have more recourse to improve our own system than we do over the EU. Merkel came here and said there would be no fundamental reforms of the EU, the British public can only ever hope for superficial changes whereas we have the power in this country to throw out a government that we don't feel represents us.  

&gt;but the overall effect is the same; the Parliament gets the final say.

The commission candidates apparently can't even be voted out by the parliament individually and are obviously preselected for them. They either approve the whole lot or don't. A democratic process would not have appointed commissioners who the parliament have to sanction as a whole, they would be nominated by the parliament from members of the parliament and voted on individually by the parliament.

Living outside the UK I can tell you this is not the case. People in general do not understand the full complexity of political systems (be it Westminster, EU, Federal, devolved or whatever), but the British understanding of the EU is particularly poor.

Reading the rest of your statement I actually agree. The EU does need reforming (but then so do all political systems - ours isn't filling us with confidence either). The problem is that Britain never position itself to be the one to reform. We sit on the fence and allow the Germans or French to do the work. Then we complain at the result because it doesn't meet our wants.

You're absolutely correct that Eurosceptics are not automatically bigots, morons or racists. But again, this is typical of British European policy. Instead of our domestic politicians engaging in the debate and portraying Europe correctly (including and especially what Britain should be doing in Europe to reform it), we instead declare all sceptics as racists and pretend like that solves anything.

Clegg's problem in the debates was summed up years ago by Jacques Delors, ""you can't fall in love with the single market"".

&gt;Keith Taylor, Green Party told The Huffington Post, that he was sure the vote by UKIP would lead to many of the people that were going to vote for the party were now reconsidering.

When a paper is as partisan as the likes of the Independent, or the Guardian, or even the BBC, one must really think about what's written, properly. This isn't very difficult at all.
Key points being,
&gt;voting against anything that expands EU power

This kind conservative has also told us, well, that doesn't matter, this would be a willing sacrifice even though he's a Euroskeptic! Do I even need to say it? Petty points scoring.

And as for the comment from the Greens, how insignificant. They've been looking for someone, anyone, that can give some opinion that UKIP not agreeing to *this particular resolution* means they will appear as pro illegal poaching and that will... lose them votes.

Huge PR clusterfucks, but relative to the times, that was quite a small response. Don't get me wrong it was still terrible. Insurrection during war-time is/always has been/always will be dealt with through a very heavy hand in all nations.

This was the approximate weight of the ""heavy hand"" in 1916, and was actually nowhere near as bad as what Germany, Britain, France, Russia etc were doing in Africa/Asia at the time.

It was a painful time of learning when Artillery was first *heavily* used against opposing powers who also had artillery. New tactics were developed, and then unfortunately used on other powers who didn't have artillery at their disposal (then you end up with shit like this). 

So many people died in that war, and that era, that saying Britain/German/French/Russian actions were particularly bad in one place is taking away from the horrific nature of the whole of WWI. All war is bad. That one was particularly bad, and every nation involved was just fucking terrible on a number of levels.

&gt; The results are quite astounding. Out of the 30 lamb
takeaways we bought in Birmingham, 16 were adulterated,
one contained less than 5% lamb and four contained no
lamb at all. And of the 30 curries and kebabs we bought in
London, eight were concealing other meats. The meat in
five could not be identified – likely to be because of
overcooking or repeated cooking. 

Look at the part which the Telegraph have omitted out.

Even the bloody Guardian added the suspected reason why in their article.

http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/17/fsa-tests-takeaways-lamb-meals-meat

&gt; The Which? survey tested 60 takeaway lamb curries and minced lamb kebabs and found that 24 of them contained other meats such as beef and chicken.

&gt; Seven of the samples contained no lamb at all, the tests found. The meat in five samples could not be identified because it had been so highly processed.

The Which Group tested for ""lamb, beef, pork, chicken, horse, goat and turkey
DNA."" and as the BBC reported on it:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27047970

&gt; Chicken and turkey were also found, but no samples contained horsemeat.

Which is, in my opinion, a better grade than what our own ""bread-and-butter"" / ""bricks-and-mortar"" supermarkets are doing.

Julio Cesar is a good shout but if we were to sign a veteran GK with proven ability on big wages we may as well bring back Pepe.

Marcelo is a poor call. He is RM's 1st choice. Coentrao will surely be available but I would much prefer Rodriguez. He is right when saying we should try and tie up deals prior to the WC. So many players shine on the big stage and see their values skyrocket.

true,r-cubed,null,null,"I think you are being a bit misleading here. Of course Oxford and Cambridge are competitive. However, it is not as dire as you have stated. The acceptance rate at Cambridge is 21.9%, compared to Oxford (20.5%), Harvard (5.9%), and MIT (8.9%). Beyond these overall numbers, there is substantial variation in acceptance rates from department to department. 

Let's start with Oxford. According to the Oxford 2013 undergraduate admission statistics, there was an approximate 20% acceptance rate overall. However, the course-specific acceptance rates range from an incredibly low 7% in Economics to a high of 42% for Materials Science. These average out to the overall acceptance rate. Now let's look at this overall rate broken down by nationality. Again for the same school year, there was a 22.9% acceptance rate for home residents. This can be compared to 9.2% for EU students and 10.1% for international students. I don't find this surprising, it's natural for a university to give substantial priority--and rightly so--to home students.

At Oxford, the graduate acceptance rate is 37%. However, it should be noted that unlike undergraduates, graduate students can apply for more than one program at once. This inflates the admission statistics. At first I took offense at your statements that it is a comparative cakewalk for graduate American students, but I don't think you meant it that way. As a matter of personal anecdote, my graduate program admitted 11 students my year. Eleven! While the plural of anecdote is not data, I bring it up because admission statistics in graduate levels vary widely by program and by degree--for example, MPhils are far easier to get into than PhDs, as it's a shorter commitment with lower funding expectations. 

Finally, let's talk about international vs home vs EU graduate applications. In 2012, the acceptance rate for international students was 31%. The rate for home students was 49%. Finally, the rate for EU student applicants to graduate school was 41%. So on the contrary, graduate admission for international students is lower than that of home and EU students. It is important to note that these are *offered* admission--far fewer students in graduate school actually accept. I believe (though didn't check the numbers) that a larger majority of undergrad Oxford and Cambridge students accept, which make sense. Graduate students have other issues to consider when accepting an offer of admission.

Given the exceptional comparability and competitiveness between the two Oxbridge schools, I would not expect them to deviate on these statistics by much at all. However, here are some quick calculations from the Cambridge admission statistics documents:

* Overall 2012 admission rate: 22%
* International student undergrad admission rate: 12.7

Here the graduate statistics can be found: http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/postgraduate.html. It would appear they are more favorable than Oxford.

I do not want to downplay the difficulty of getting into Cambridge or Oxford, graduate or undergraduate. However, overall acceptance is no where near as difficult as you have made it out to be. It's going to be tough, universities such as Cambridge and Oxford are world-leading institutions and have the ability to be selective. That said, strictly by the numbers, comparatively your odds are still better than some other leading institutions. Which I think is a good thing, the diversity I experienced at Cambridge was wonderful.

There have been lots and lots and lots of changes to our constitution in the last few decades.  Almost none of them have involved a referendum.

I don't really understand the workings of the Parliament that well, but I just had a look through Farage's voting record, and he has certainly voted in favour of a lot of resolutions and constructive amendments to legislation, and he abstains *a lot* (the European Parliament separates out active abstentions from absences).  The idea that UKIP just oppose everything the Parliament does whether they agree in principle or not is clearly nonsense.  UKIP seem to have lots of naive supporters who project their own views on to the party while ignoring what they actually say and do.

Opposing the existence of the European Parliament, but trying to make sure it does as good a job as possible while it does exist, is a perfectly consistent position to hold, and I doubt anyone would criticise it.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;In fact, the European Court of Justice had to rule specifically that this right extended to unemployed people, or people employed outside of their state of residence, as far back as the Baumbast case of 1968

As far as i can see this was because the man had children in education, and they had a right to continue their education and have a family life regardless of whether he still had a job:

&gt;in the UK in order to continue their education, a corresponding right to reside had to be granted to the primary career of those children, even if the primary career had no other right to reside under Community law.

also:

&gt;even though declared to be directly effective article 18 EC Treaty does not create a generalized right for all EU citizens.

and:

&gt;only in a few case have parents been able to overturn a deportation order on the ground that it constitutes an unjustifiable interference with rights under Article 8 ECHR.


So it seems this was a special case and not a general rule. 


&gt;Almost all of the rights of free movement were established well before the UK referendum, mainly by the Treaty of Rome 1957 and TFEU 1958, as well as case Baumbast Case of 1968.

There have been limits placed on many of the EU states as they joined the union. The truth is the people voting in the UK referendum had no idea how things would turn out. They were voting for a trade union, with some powers regarding movement of people to make trade easier, the powers granted then have grown and grown without the consent of the British people. 

If there was a clear case for the free movement of people, why did the judge in your previous case have to rely on the fact that he had children to allow him to stay in this country. If he was self sufficient it shouldn't have been a problem.

&gt;That's what EP elections are. Are you suggesting rolling referenda on a five-year basis regarding membership? 

No, and i agree that the European elections are a good way to gauge support, and when a large proportion of voters seem on course to vote for an anti EU party, it is probably time to reconsider our place within the EU.

Eh, I think you're kind of dodging the question there. I phrased my questions in such a way that the EU would be giving itself more power. Let me try again: would the UKIP MEPs vote for measures that give the EU power specifically when the legislation is in line with UKIP policies? If the EU decided to implement all of UKIP's policies across the whole EU, would the UKIP MEPs vote against the measures? Essentially, do they oppose the EU for some ideological reason, or do they oppose the policies that the EU has put in place? I think it is the latter, and if it is, the UKIP MEPs need to revise their policy on voting on EU matters. 

&gt; I don't really understand what you mean by stupid and lazy. And they certainly don't do fuck all, Farage himself co-chairs several committees in the EU so its not like he's doing the bare minimum. But they are doing everything they can to limit the power of the EU, which is what the people who voted for them wanted them to do.

&gt; ...

&gt; Also, its worth noting that his voting record is better than any of the major party leaders in the house of commons.

I think Farage is the exception to the general UKIP rule.

Once we are at a respectable level a manager should be free to put some flair into it.

Spurs haven't kept a clean sheet in 2 months (since Cardiff) and scored only twice against top 4 teams in 8 attempts over the entire season. These are basic requirements and must be rectified before we can look forward to attacking football. Rodgers spent last season building a foundation at Liverpool before spicing it up this season, Moyes built a foundation for Everton etc.

Equally, in the hopefully unlikely case the UK does leave the EU, this is not the same as the UK leaving the free movement and trade area, leaving the EU is a very complex topic as the EU is a treaty organisation rather then a constituted process.

Releasing Kolo also doesn't make much sense to me.  We'd probably still owe him money for his signing on bonus, so it'd be a negative financial transaction to the club.  Would rather pay just a bit more and let his contract run out normally.  If nothing else he's a good character to have around and in a pinch he still plays at a reasonable level.

Not because I think Moyes is a bad manager (I don't think he is great though), but because he just brings too much negativity and baggage.  AVB left Chelsea, but his failure was often attributed to prima donna players and an overly critical front office.  Moyes was given plenty of time, he was allowed to buy two superstars in Fellaini and Mata, and he played just awful, uninspired football.  Fans here would be ready to pounce as soon as he arrived.

Also, Sherwood beat Moyes at Old Trafford.  How is that not a step backward?  I'd almost rather hang onto Sherwood.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Expanding the Centenary or Kop would be difficult though.

The Kop has very little room for expansion because it already backs straight onto the A5089, and the fact it's a single-tier stand with a fairly shallow gradient means extending it back just creates loads of seats with really shitty views of the pitch. Probably the only way to really increase the capacity it is to knock it down and rebuild it with a much steeper and larger single-tier stand (which would be awesome). And maybe re-route some of the local main roads behind it. 

Similarly we could probably have a bigger stand instead of the Centenary, but it's already pretty tall and again I'm pretty sure that we'd have to knock down most of the existing structure to put in anything bigger. Probably possible to just add a third tier, but I'm not sure how well it'd work. 

Definitely true that £150m for a 60k stadium is better value than the £600m we were suggested to be paying for a 70-80k ground, but I'd expect that taking the capacity much past 60k would need some pretty major work and investment, and would probably require rebuilding existing stands (with temporary reduced capacity during construction) rather than a straight expansion.

The fact is it's an old ground, it's in a heavily built-up area and it's far from straightforward to just whack more seats in there. Upping the capacity to 60k is still a 30% increase in seats, which is pretty good if there's going to be zero reduction during construction.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;would the UKIP MEPs vote for measures that give the EU power specifically when the legislation is in line with UKIP policies? 

I'm not trying to dodge the question, but there is no policy that increases the power of the EU that UKIP would be in favour of. The EU **IS** the ideology that they oppose. UKIPs policies in the EU all revolve around reducing the power that he EU has over the UK. IT doesn't matter how big or small the issue may seem, UKIP doesn't want the EU to make the decision because it wants the UK to make the decision. 

It isn't like one political party in the UK not liking what the government is doing, so voting again them at every opportunity they get, because they don't like them. Its more like a party who believes the very concept of government we have is flawed, and so trying to change it from the outside, while at the same time voting against it to limit the things it can do while in power, for example preventing it from making new laws which make it more powerful.


&gt;Is every issue non-negotiable? I very much doubt it.

Not right now its not, but immigration is a big issue affecting this country, and the organisation we are a part of just says we are not allowed to be upset about it and have to just get on with it. Why should they be able to dictate to us how we should respond to something? especially if it doesn't affect their country as much as ours. 

And who knows what they will say is non-negotiable next? The EU council can pass laws without the consent of the elected EU parliament, so if they want to make something law, they can do so without any consent from the MEPs, who are voted to make decisions like this by the people of Europe.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; As far as i can see this was because the man had children in education, and they had a right to continue their education and have a family life regardless of whether he still had a job:

That's right. The right to live unrestricted regardless of financial situation is not guaranteed by anyone. The criteria, explicitly mentioned by the Home Office in approving requests for residence permits in the UK, states:

&gt; * **If you are working**, you need to provide us with proof of your employment. This can be by providing pay slips, a letter from your employer or an employment contract. These documents must show that you are currently exercising treaty rights so need to be dated within six weeks of the date of your application

&gt; * **If you are self-employed**, you need to provide us with documents to show that you are self-employed. Documents that would support this include evidence of paying national insurance contributions, bank statements which show income earned or accountants’ letters.

&gt; * **If you are a student**, you need to provide a school, college or university letter confirming enrolment on the course. You will also need to provide a statement confirming that you have sufficient financial resources during your period of study along with supporting evidence such as a bank statement or evidence of a grant or scholarship; and evidence that you have comprehensive sickness insurance.

&gt; * **If you are economically self-sufficient**, you need to supply evidence of comprehensive sickness insurance for yourself and any family members included in your application. You also need to supply evidence of funds sufficient to maintain yourself and any family members included in your application during the time you intend to reside on this basis. These funds can come from the employment or self-employment of any of your family members legally working and residing in the UK with you. Documentary evidence of their employment or funds should be supplied.

[Here is the government page for the EEA guidance rules](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applications-for-residence-documents-for-eea-nationals). These same restrictions typically apply in all EU countries.

The Baumbast case was important because it established a precedent (set out in Article 12 of Regulation 1612/68) for people to reside in another European country independent of being directly employed. However, member states are still free to maintain their own restrictions against unemployed people (for example, you must find a job within the first six months, and are not allowed to claim benefits during that time in the UK).

&gt; the powers granted then have grown and grown without the consent of the British people. 

The movement powers? How? I can find no substantial changes to the movement of people rights since 1968, with the exception of the introduction of the transitional arrangements for new EU members, which actually restricts movement, and the legal housekeeping that was done in 2008 to simply merge all of those rights into a single directive.

Britain can have a referendum all it wants. I don't care. My main concern is that there is widespread misinformation and a remarkably poor (by design) understanding of exactly what the EU is and how it works, and there is no evidence of any actual debate to sway people's opinions either way being held. And if it is, I'm sure it will be an incomplete and ill-conceived one, much like the AV referendum.

I maintain that it matters not what the majority of the public want if they're unaware of the repercussions of their choices. I know you agree, because you just said so:

&gt; The truth is the people voting in the UK referendum had no idea how things would turn out.

No one can predict the future, but Britain's welcome to hold a referendum on the issue and I hope they leave. I think it would be terrible for the country, but I hope it's the case, so that the government no longer has 'those bureaucrats in Brussels' as a scapegoat to fall back on every time they wish to cast aspersions for domestic policy failures away from themselves, and the Murdoch press can pick a new topic to routinely lie about.

Yes - that comes from the idea of them being a collective Government, similar to the UK convention of collective ministerial responsibility. They are a single unit, acting together - so if one is not doing what the Parliament wants, they're all to blame.

&gt;The __Yankees–Red Sox rivalry__ is a [sports rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_rivalries) between the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees) and [Boston Red Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox) [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) teams of [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) (MLB). The two teams have competed in MLB's [American League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League) (AL) for over 100 years and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports.     In 1919, Red Sox owner [Harry Frazee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frazee) sold star player [Babe Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth) to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series).  This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the ""[Curse of the Bambino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino)"", which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"&gt;Free speech isn't there to protect you from the repercussions of being an asshole. It protects you from the government legislating against you being an asshole.

As far as I know, defacing posters is an act of vandalism and *is* against the law.  Free speech *does* protect your right to be an asshole and not have your literature or posters defaced by campaigners.

But, more than that.  Even when it's not a violation of any law, I do find it troubling that many people (like you it seems) think it's OK to shout down speech you don't like, or to engage in acts of vandalism.  It's the idea that because you think you're right, that it gives you the moral right to shut other people up.  

Do you think that people who are against homosexuality have a *moral* right to try to shut down or deny gay speech through legal means?  What about those who object to atheism, or green energy or any number of other controversial issues?

I'm not a fan of UKIP, but I agree - it is worrying that people think they have a right to shut down speech they disagree with.  It's unproductive and what's more - it will come back to bite the left in the ass one day.  One day it's going to be *your* speech which is unpopular.  Perhaps - next time there's a war, and you want to protest it, or even if we elected a UKIP government and you wanted to protest that.

I recommend everyone read this short article which puts it much better than I could:

[The Case for Hate Speech](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-case-for-hate-speech/309524/) by Jon Rauch.  

(Rauch is a Jewish homosexual and is adamant that people should have a right to express unpopular views, even if it's homophobia or anti-semitism.) 

Edit: Corrected link.  It now doesn't take you to a website featuring a porn movie in which Albanian dwarves nakedly frolic against the theme-tune to East Enders.

I was fuming at how un-liverpool we had become in terms of support I thought the club that I loved for years decided to bitch and moan like small kids. I went on a red hiatus.

When kenny came back I was thrilled and finally yes... stability! He made us come together again even if we were not winning regularly the hope came back. When he left I went sad again, not knowing who this new guy was and where he would take us. We got 7th and although it was tough to swallow I had to.... I had to give this guy a chance. I don't know, maybe it was the way he speaks. And maybe the things he said about pool that made me think, this guy coooould be different. I had doubts but... What have we got to lose? 

Never in my wildest dreams could I even imagine how much BR has transformed this club I loved for decades. Everything fell into place. That statement ""we're on top of the league"" during his first match interview this season gave me hope. And then we went top during Xmas. My ManU peers were still giving me stick for having any hope. But fuck we're Liverpool and you're scum so get out. 

This season. This season has made my heart jump with joy. The spirit was alive. And the first time I heard the chants of we're gonna win the league.... I thought: Fuck me. We're back. 

I'm sorry for those years of indifference. I was jaded. But I bleed red and I can't ever feel that I'm ever walking alone in this.

Hopefully, we can figure out a good gk time share like Real Madrid have, but if we had to sacrifice one keeper, strictly for our future security and from a business standpoint I would choose Cech, and i love the guy he is a legend.

I can totally understand why they do this, and I'm not criticising them at all, but in weeks like this, or last week, the stuff they're talking about on Monday is rendered somewhat irrelevant by the time the show is released later in the week. Since they filmed this, Terry has been injured, Cech has been injured, Lampard and Mikel have been suspended from the 2nd leg and Ramires has been suspended from the league....all of which will play a major part of our match on Sunday. We're learning today that Hazard is still going to be out as well.

Obviously I would never expect them to do every video throughout the week on the day it's due to be released online as it would require a hell of a lot more time than they could afford to commit, especially since half of their footage are free videos to non-subscribers.

What we would be doing is getting in amongst the other team and breaking up their rhythm, whether he was the one actually tackling each time or not. And when we got the ball back he'd be either surging forward or making the assist.

Obviously as the legs start to go, there'd be less surging and he'd have to hang back more and more but that's not for a long time yet if he's 22.

The situation remains though that he's not prospering in the current system and that I would be surprised if he prospered as an out and out striker. So what to do? We could potentially push the full backs up a bit and push him in towards the middle I suppose - but that's not a million miles from what I'm suggesting anyway.

Are the audience an average representation of the millions of people that will be voting? You define them as ""intelligent"", which implies there are other voter demographics.

&gt; But, in fact the opposite happens.

Then I'd like to know why UKIP have decided to publish the most simplistic advertisements possible. For example, an intelligent audience would recognise that 26 million unemployed Europeans are not going to come to the UK.

I think 3 points gets us to safety (goal differentials could be huge this year) and I would really rather not need a result vs City or Spurs if they have titles/Europe to play for.Keep PL. He's been handcuffed by finances since he arrived and I think he's just starting to get us where he wants. With FFP regulations ramping up, a cheap young team with a strong youth system is the way of the future.I think we finish 14/15 and Fulham pulls a rabbit out of a hat to survive (barring of course Sunderland doesn't keep playing 2 point a game vs giants level football).The potential owners intrigue me. If they are baseball owners, I think that is a natural fit for a variety of reasons: baseball is an old sport rich in tradition with hundred+ year old clubs, the minor leagues are similar to youth squads, baseball is the only American sport with no salary cap so owners are used to an unbalanced playing field, baseball is an international sport where owners are used to buying international players for transfer fees (see: Tanaka or Dice K) as well as trading for them like other American sports, and baseball is the only sport in the US that has a similar history (there used to be hundreds of pro and semi pro teams, and there are still like 100 minor league teams) to football in England. Plus baseball is doing really well now so the owners will probably be flush with cash.I think a lot of the inconsistency this season can be blamed on a young team lacking leadership (youngest in Prem by average). I'd like to see us sign 2-3 quality veteran players for next season to give us some grit and leadership.I really like this sub, but it can come and go like the tides.

He'll do well at Newcastle/Villa/Bundesliga or wherever he goes next I'm sure. On balance the right decision to sack him I think.

2) I like Welbeck, seems like a nice bloke and underrated I think. Like Kagawa as well. Rooney is probably your best player imo. Jones has potential. Ferdinand is a massive prick. Not the biggest fan of RVP, nor Young. Never been convinced by Cleverly.

3) Hughton. Terribly negative tactics which didn't work. Can't score, and once concede we imploded.

It's also important to note that the 11th place finish was down to winning our last two matches against West Brom and Managerless Man City both with nothing to play for. Before that we were in danger of relegation. He's popular with people who haven't watched us play much imo; the football we've played has been truly awful. Timing is poor - we should have sacked him months ago. Nice bloke, but not the right fit for us.

I mean, we have to assume that Sterling will improve steadily and on a constant upward trajectory but is it insane to think that Sterling could be better than Suarez within a couple seasons or so? Possibly.

I remember when Sterling was first starting to come up the ranks people were saying the 'sky is the limit' and what not but, y'know, a lot of times that just what people say about young and exciting talent.

75% claim is false.  It's more around the 20-50% area.

true,pocketpotato,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"If you get a ticket

If you get a ticket on your windscreen or through the post, and you think that it is unfair, for example, you had a good reason for staying over the time you had paid for, then you should contact the parking operator, giving your reasons and asking them to withdraw the ticket. You could also approach the private company with an interest in the car park, for example, the supermarket whose car park you had parked in, and ask them to withdraw the ticket.

If you get a ticket and you don’t think you should have to pay, you can decide not to pay and not to reply to the parking operator. It is possible that the parking operator will take enforcement action in order to recover the charge although in practice a threat of this nature may not be followed through as the amount of money being demanded is usually quite small. A parking operator has no power to recover a parking charge without first taking court action. The company may continue to send requests to pay and you can continue to ignore these unless they decide to take you to the small claims court. If the parking operator does take you to court, you may be able to defend the action, for example, on the grounds that you did not park in breach of the parking rules and/or that the fee being demanded is unreasonably high.

If the company keeps contacting you, you can ask them to stop harassing you. If the company behaves badly, you can also report to this to the landowner or to the British Parking Association if the company is a member.

If the company is a member of the British Parking Association, their procedures can be followed to complain against the parking ticket. Any member of the BPA should wait 28 days before sending a final demand.

Try [this](http://www.parkingcowboys.co.uk/anpr-parking-tickets/)

First thing is to ignore it, they have to PROVE you were parked for the duration, the ANPR only notes you going in or out, if they claim you stayed they need to PROVE you were parked up, ANPR in not flawless, therefore in a court you could prove it wrong.

Not that it would ever get there, the penalty notice implies you breeched the contract, but how can you enter into a contract if you know nothing about it?

Also when did you pick your wife up?

&gt;Secondly, and more seriously, is the fact that parking tickets are issued by some ANPR systems on a ‘first-in last-out’ basis. So for example, if one was to visit a car park at 9am for 10 minutes, and then at 5pm for 10 minutes, these systems are issuing parking tickets claiming stays of 8 hours! In these cases, parking tickets are clearly being issued incorrectly, since one has not broken whatever ‘contract’ between you and the operator that may have existed.

true,Kitchner,null,null,"&gt;Would this majority of middle class be a possible result in a decline in voting turnout of the general elections? As neither Labour or Conservatives are favoured by the now 'middle class'? (sorry I'm going a bit off topic here from the original question)

This is one theory. Basically that voters in general have become disenfranchised with the two main parties because they have become so similar, yet the reason they became similar in the first place was because of the dwindling working class vote.

I mean the honest answer is if you had the cure to low voter turn out you need to tell one of the two main parties because you'll win the next 5 elections for them. So it's not an easy answer sorry!

&gt;Due to the Lib Dems being more so right wing economically would they have influenced privatisation of companies such as the Royal Mail then?

The Lib Dems haven't ever been in government before the current and prior to this never expected to be. This means that even if the individuals supported it, they would never say they have a policy as controversial as that. On the other hand though they wouldn't rule it out.

I think as a general rule the Lib Dems aren't in favour of privatising any more of Britains ""nationalised assets"" (such as royal mail and the NHS) but I don't think they are in a hurry to risk a lot to defend them either.

&gt;A final question, are UKIP as bad as people portray them as being? Also what are their domestic policies on the political spectrum compared to the Labour/Lib Dem/Conservatives?

This is probably where I'm a bit more bias simply as I dislike UKIP thoroughly. Economically, militarily and historically, Britain has always been stronger when it was united and when it had close allies. Nationalist parties in the UK such as the SNP and UKIP argue for essentially the opposite of that, which means they are fighting an uphill struggle. 

With the idea of such a struggle they often resort to the sort of tactics that ideally wouldnt be seen in a western democracy (scaremongering etc). I think Nigel Farage isn't an idiot at all and understand there is a chance to capitalise on a perfect storm of the British public being ill informed about Europe and immigration while at the same time being disenfranchised with the major political parties.

This means it's very easy to be ""controversial"" because even if you sound like a twit you get comments like ""Well I don't agree but at least he is talking about it"" or ""I don't agree but he seems a straight forward bloke, unlike the oxbridge lot"". Comments from UKIP for example about how many people are able to come to Britain for work are, strictly speaking, true, but there is also 70 million Britons who are eligible to work in France, that doesn't mean we'll all go there. 

UKIP's leader(s) is actually a smart political operator. The members of UKIP tend to be either deceitful or ill informed in my opinion. However I have also said that if Scotland votes for independence and then the UK leaves the EU I'd probably emigrate.

true,18EFC78,crest,,"Before I start, this is a very prem-focused wish list because I mainly watch the prem. I also think prem players, in general, have a much easier transition and fit more seamlessly into the side... Here it goes:

By the sounds of it Delulofeu for another season is looking increasingly likely, so that's one. 

Think Gaz Baz is another requirement although word on the strazz is he might be off to the new NY team in the MLS or Becks' Miami team (although that's not til 2015). 

Other than that, as I have posted on here before, think Lukaku is a MUST for anything up to 25 mil. He's 20 years old, already knows our system, knows Bobby Brown Brogues, and seems to like it/is settled. If that's not a goer saw some chat about making bids for Bony and/or Remy. Definitely a good shout and might be realistic to get both for 25-30 mil. If we can do that then that's even better than signing Lukaku alone.

As rumoured, Cleverley and a loan extension for Traore seem to be on Martinez's radar and in Bobby We Trust. I was skeptical about Jamie Mac and look how fucking brilliant he turned out, so I trust him with Cleverley and Traore. 

If our attackers include the likes of Kone, Naismith, Traore, Bony/Remy/Lukaku then I think we look solid up front. I will make one last pitch for Chicharito, however. I think this guy is the bollocks and is simply being wasted at Utd. He doesn't stop running all match, a bit like Suarez and Aguero, and is an absolute fox in the box. Compared to what we've got now, he offers something very different in that respect. Imagine him running off Lukaku/Bony/Traore.

Although I rate Howard, I think him being #1 until 2018 is a bit of a stretch. For me, I reckon he's worth one more season and then I'd like to see someone like Robles or even Jindrich Stanek step up and take the place. However, Robles has been unconvincing when I've seen him and I know very little about Stanek. It has always baffled me why we never went after Butland. Was on offer for about 6 mil and has ended up at Stoke. Only reason he hasn't played more is because Begovic is a monster.

Defensively, I think we look more than solid at left back with Baines, Oviedo, and Garbutt all more than capable. Even if we put Bainesy in the Phillip Lahm role, as has been mooted, we are rock solid there. Think we can get 1-2 more seasons out of Distin although I'd keep him forever if I could. Jags probably has a good 2-4 more seasons in him and what can you say about John Stones? Future Everton captain and could be one of our center backs for the next 10 years. Alcaraz is obviously a squad player although I like his composure when he does play. In terms of replacements, think Bobby will have to look to the continent and others on here may be better placed to comment in this area. Looking domestically quickly, I really like the look of Curtis Davies at Hull and Steven Caulker at Cardiff. Hull fans absolutely love Davies and as they're staying up for sure, he may be more difficult to get. That being said, Cardiff are my favorites for the drop so I'd make a big effort for Caulker. Think he'd be an England regular if he was at a better club. He's still young (22) and would be great to have an all English partnership at the heart of defence for years to come (Stones and Caulker).

At right back, Coleman obviously has the position locked down for as long as he wants it. Out of our entire squad, I'm most concerned about losing him this summer. Might be an opportunity for Tyias Browning in the rezzies to be given a go although I think he's primarily a center back.

In midfield I think we actually look reasonably strong assuming Mirallas, McGeady, Osman, Pienaar, Barkley, McCarthy, Gibson, and Barry all stay. Again this is an area Bobby will be looking to the continent to bring in one or two more assuming Cleverley is a goer.

In terms of others, I really like the look of Kagawa at Utd - again being wasted by them.

Amuses me that you'd say that about The Sun on here of all places...

And journalists print plenty of shit that is completely wrong. Pretty much any tabloid article around science stuff is usually way off the mark (in particular that X Y and Z give you cancer). Phrase it in a good enough way so that the headline and the article mostly suggest things rather than actually state them, and you can get away with all kinds of crap. Unless they've got cameras set up in this woman's house, they don't have solid proof, and they won't until either party admits to anything - so far the reports have only been denied.

I mean the honest answer is if you had the cure to low voter turn out you need to tell one of the two main parties because you'll win the next 5 elections for them. So it's not an easy answer sorry!

Ahh okay, thank you though.

&gt;The Lib Dems haven't ever been in government before the current and prior to this never expected to be. This means that even if the individuals supported it, they would never say they have a policy as controversial as that. On the other hand though they wouldn't rule it out.
I think as a general rule the Lib Dems aren't in favour of privatising any more of Britains ""nationalised assets"" (such as royal mail and the NHS) but I don't think they are in a hurry to risk a lot to defend them either.

Okay, would you then say the Lib Dems are slightly pragmatic in a sense then, as they haven't been ever fully able to become the party in power? So no assumptions can be made as nobody has ever experienced it before?

&gt;This is probably where I'm a bit more bias simply as I dislike UKIP thoroughly.

Nationalist parties in the UK such as the SNP and UKIP argue for essentially the opposite of that, which means they are fighting an uphill struggle.
With the idea of such a struggle they often resort to the sort of tactics that ideally wouldnt be seen in a western democracy (scaremongering etc). 

Scaremongering would sort of being the whole idea at the moment promoted by UKIP that 'all of our jobs are being taken' and things similar to that?

&gt;I think Nigel Farage isn't an idiot at all and understand there is a chance to capitalise on a perfect storm of the British public being ill informed about Europe and immigration while at the same time being disenfranchised with the major political parties.


So would that be the reason that it seems UKIP recently have become more popular as a party, because the people are simply being advantage of?

&gt;This means it's very easy to be ""controversial"" because even if you sound like a twit you get comments like ""Well I don't agree but at least he is talking about it"" or ""I don't agree but he seems a straight forward bloke, unlike the oxbridge lot"". Comments from UKIP for example about how many people are able to come to Britain for work are, strictly speaking, true, but there is also 70 million Britons who are eligible to work in France, that doesn't mean we'll all go there.

So this again is a sort of scaremongering? And that he just taking the current political naivety (loosely used) and disenfranchised people to UKIP's advantage?

&gt;However I have also said that if Scotland votes for independence and then the UK leaves the EU I'd probably emigrate.

Do you mind if I ask so? What would be the repercussions of this?

Thanks again, this is all really helpful. No wonder it seems a large number of people don't vote as we don't get educated in this at school, we just have to find out by ourselves and all we get is just bias opinions from the newspapers.",0,1398364456,null,0,false,0,ch10rf2,t3_23ugks,t1_ch10rf2,t1_ch0zu0j,null,1433503388,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

The Sun was boycotted in 1989 because everyone assumed they pulled the info out of their arses. It's a repellent paper, but the met police was behind the story, the journalists didn't make up anything. Don't forget that The Sun wasn't the only paper to run those stories. The information about who supplied The Sun with the story only came to light then, two decades after the boycott began. Sure, they should have made more effort to check the facts (difficult when the only available source is the police who are all sticking to the same story) and run it under a less twattish headline (not debatable).

I'm going to give a disclaimer at this point, I'm a journalist and have been for a long time, and you're massively oversimplifying the issue. We don't all sit around in the office, see a random object on the floor and say ""alright lads, lets say the printer paper gives you AIDS"", no, you'll get a press release from a University that says it, and you'll get hammered by the editor if you don't make it interesting. So if for example, a chemical in printer paper has been linked to AIDS, you don't say that this 60-letter behemoth has been linked to it, you say printer paper is. It's not great, but if you don't change it the subs will, and you'll get a hammering from the editor. There's a difference between copywriting and jounalism, that's not journalism, that's copywriting, actually going out and finding a story is journalism. This qualifies because they've investigated it carefully and all the circumstantial evidence points to BR bonking this girl.

&gt;

&gt;Rather than leaving FIFA to determine the validity of the contract signed with Manchester United, Chelsea intervened by volunteering to settle the transfer saga through negotiation with Lyn Oslo and Manchester United. 

&gt;On 2 June 2006, Chelsea, Manchester United and Lyn Oslo reached a settlement to resolve the future of the player. Mikel's registration was to be transferred from Lyn to Chelsea; Manchester United agreed to terminate their option agreement with Mikel. Under the terms of this agreement Chelsea agreed to pay Manchester United £12 million, half paid upon the finalisation of the contract and the other half in June 2007, and Lyn £4 million, half payable immediately and half in June 2007. As a result of this settlement, all claims in this matter were withdrawn.  On 19 July 2006, Chelsea were granted a work permit for the midfielder after they completed the £16 million signing in June 2006. 

&gt;In the aftermath of the transfer, Morgan Andersen, who had a previous conviction for forging official documents,  was convicted of fraud and making false accusations and given a one-year suspended jail sentence by an Oslo court. The court also ordered him to pay 20,000 kroner (£1,944) in costs.  Chelsea made a High Court claim for £16m against FC Lyn Oslo and Andersen following the conviction, claiming that the previously agreed settlement was not binding as ""the transfer was based on a fraudulent misrepresentation, now proven by a court of law"".  This claim was subsequently resolved out of court.

Now we have Willian, Hazard, Salah who all work very hard and are all lighting fast. Add to that that Matic is more mobile than Lamps or Mikel and Ramires speed isn't that much needed anymore to even out our missing pace. 

Ramires is still highly rated by lots of fans, maybe rightfully so, but I think he was more important in the past and him being banned doesn't hurt us as much as we were used to if it still hurts us at all.

But it's still only ever circumstantial and speculative, and I do think that it's always going to be a journalist's nature to put a more scandalous slant on it. Regardless of the facts and specifics, ""LFC employee quits job to have affair with BR that breaks up two marriages and causes ex to attack house with cricket bat"" is always going to be a more saucy article than any alternative scenario. If they can make that story from evidence, then I'm fairly sure that's what they'll run, even if the actual details point to it probably being something else. If half a picture gives a more interesting story than the full picture without lying, I doubt they'd ever actually bother with the full picture.

I don't believe journalists actively make shit up, but there are a lot of papers where the editors and higher ups seem to be more than happy to press their employees for whatever gives a more headline-grabbing and paper-selling news story, rather than basing things around the far more mundane facts of the matter. The DM in particular is bad for this - any study into something potentially causing cancer and they'll run a ""THIS THING IS *LINKED* WITH CANCER BY STUDY"" story even if the actual conclusions of the study are that it probably doesn't. 

Can't say that I'm constantly reading gossip articles in newspapers anyway (I tend to not bother with newspapers besides the Metro because it's free and something to read on the train, even if it does mostly seem to be garbage). But I'll typically take the truth to be a fair bit less exciting than the story the tabloids actually run with, because their job for the most part seems to be to embellish the fairly mundane truth until it's something that's actually interesting.

There are still more then 2 million people unemployed, many more on zero hour contracts, or working less hours than they would like, and many more under paid. The method used to calculate unemployment by the government has been heavenly criticized for these reasons. 

&gt;There's not a finite amount of jobs just like there's no finite amount of sandwiches. Immigrants create jobs, and businesses start up with on understanding of the available labour.

That is an over simplification which shows a lack of understanding of the jobs market. If there is a downturn in the economy there will usually be less construction work. Which means more builders will become unemployed. Increasing the supplier of builders at this time creates more unemployment and suppresses wages. A wave of immigration then creates more jobs in the restaurant and retail sectors. Your solution is for all the unemployed builders to become waiters and shop staff?

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I'm fairly sure that an independent Scotland that is successful will have a catastrophic effect on the North of England.

A couple of cases seem possible:

Case 1.  Scotland keeps a proportion of the assets which exceeds its proportion of the national population.  Mainly this is the oil question.  But on top of that Scotland is pretty well placed for renewable energy.

If this plays out Scotland becomes wealthier on a per person basis than it already is.  The rest of the UK becomes poorer on a per capita basis.  But per capita spending is already lower in the North of England than in the South.

Case 2.  Scotland is able to create a more *business friendly* environment.  [Lower taxes, less regulation, that sort of thing.]  Success in these terms becomes predicated on an overall tax take from a larger pool at a lower rate.

This doesn't seem to create new business; it just attracts business from  other places.  In effect one state poaches businesses from another.  Businesses aren't going to move out of London to relocate in Scotland.  If the advantages are good enough they might move from the North of England though.

What is more likely still is that new businesses given the choice between starting up in the North of England or the South of Scotland might decide to start up a little further North.

Either way, if independence pans out the way Salmond is selling it the effect on the North of England won't be good.  In strictness he doesn't represent anyone in England and his job is to represent as best he can the Scottish.  But to try to sell it as anything other than, *""My job is to look after the Scottish, this might screw you but that's not our problem!""* is disingenuous in the extreme.

I think for me the big difference is that he's showing it in the big games against top clubs. You get loads of young stars where they're touted as ""the next big thing"" based on youth or reserve games, or when maybe they come on for the last twenty minutes and make a bit of an impact because they're young and have pace against a tired defence. Sterling was MotM against Man City, and has been multiple times this season for Liverpool and even England. We've not had a young player make an impact like that in big games in the PL since Michael Owen.

You get all these youth players that might develop into a great talent. I think even if he was to stop improving right now, Sterling would still be a great football player. The fact that he's so young and has an environment where you'd expect him to keep improving just means the sky is the limit really.

Mourinho knows that Anfield can shake a team. He saw it in 2005 and again in 2007. For cup games like that, Anfield whips itself into a fervour that's unmatched in England. I reckon he's trying to take the heat out of the game and out of the atmosphere with all this weakened team talk, hoping the crowd's intensity will be lessened if they think its going to be easier rather than Cup Final-esque atmosphere.

Some shops, and near to shopping in Selly Oak at one end and Cotteridge at the other. Not much in the way of restaurants or pubs. You are unlikely to find anything affordable there though. You may find things that are labelled Bournville on the edge of the area, but that are really Selly Oak, Cotteridge, or Stirchley, and just ramping up the price by calling it Bournville. The Bournville area proper will usually be labelled 'Bournville Village Trust'. (But not South BVT which is very suburban, no shops, long walk to Uni, no public transport). 

Kings Norton is also nice. Tends to be an older (50+) population. Not quite as nice as the BVT but a lot of people's second choice when they can't afford the BVT. Less in the way of shopping/restaurants/pubs, but there is a villagey centre with some near the church. Has a train station. Too far to walk. Houses near the station have some flood risk, and there is an industrial estate that you will want to avoid near the station. Back when I was a student years ago it was not uncommon to find lodgings there (ie living with a family).  

If you are thinking about using the train daily, (presumably you are looking at Bournville and KN as they are on the line), keep in mind that the train is not particularly cheap. It is about 3 or 4 pounds a day, although you can get a 4 week pass for about 60 pounds I think.

From the [press release](http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EUIS_press_release.pdf) :

&gt; Contrary to popular perception, the Transparency International report highlights a range of rules and practices that support high standards of public service and accountability within the EU's bodies. These include channels to investigate suspected fraud or maladministration, the ability of the public to access documents held by EU institutions, or to request judicial review of decisions affecting them.

&gt;Nonetheless, major flaws in the system can still be seen, such as in the absence of mandatory lobbying rules at the EU level, and the growing trend of EU institutions to negotiate laws behind closed doors. When it comes to ensuring senior decision-makers comply with ethics rules, such as ‘cooling-off’ periods when they leave office, self-regulation, rather than independent monitoring, is the norm.


The full report can be found [here](http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EU_Integrity_System_Report.pdf) (warning, 248-page pdf). This is a report by a group that looks into transparency and corruption in governments around the world. In 2011 they did a [similar report on the UK](http://www.transparency.org.uk/our-work/publications/81-corruption-in-the-uk--overview-&amp;-policy-recommendations) , and highlighted quite a few problems. Mainly that corruption was ""a greater problem in the UK than is currently recognised"" - unlike the EU where it appears to be less of a problem than public opinion suggests.
Hopefully this will give the EC something to think about, to work on tightening things up - but the fact that the EU is less corrupt that people thought is something we should remember.

In all fairness I think there's an element of self-selection about it.

In the seventies the Conservative party went through a period where people who looked like potential future party leaders said things that made them unelectable.  Enoch Powell was the most famous of these, with the *rivers of blood* speech.  Similarly Keith Joseph gave a speech in which he spoke about a high proportion of children being born to low quality women and how it damaged, *""our human stock""*!

4. In the next round, the next preference votes for the current lowest voted candidate are added to the appropriate tallies of the remaining candidates
5. Go to step 3 until someone wins an absolute majority.

I honestly don't understand why this system would be so hard to apply on a national scale...  It would remove the concept of a ""wasted"" vote since if you decide to vote for your favourite small party as a first preference, you can simply put other parties as higher preference to the major party you don't want to win, and still have that counted.",0,1398370098,null,0,false,0,ch13p9x,t3_23uecf,t1_ch13p9x,t1_ch0qepi,null,1433504773,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We/I generally use ""fries"" to refer to ""American style"" chips. ""Real"" chips are thick-cut, made from whole potatoes, and are served in ""Fish 'n' Chip shops"" or ""chippies."" Fries are thin, made from reconstituted potato flour/scraps, and generally come frozen in catering size bags. 

However, this depends a lot on who is speaking and where you are. Generally, in an American chain, like McD's or BK, the staff will say ""fries"" as that is part of the corporate brand identity or whatever, whereas in independent or UK-owned fast-food chains, they will say chips (even though they serve American-style fries.) Some menus (e.g., in a pub) might say ""chunky chips"" to make clear the distinction.

As a corollary, you will rarely hear ""French fries"" in the UK, because they are American, not French. However, in my experience, if you order ""frites"" in France, they are most likely to be the American kind, not the British kind (there are many great things about French food, their chips are not one of them.)",0,1398370302,null,0,false,0,ch13t1o,t3_23v20m,t1_ch13t1o,t1_ch0uabl,null,1433504823,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8

He has had only 1 good season and is in our ""best eleven"". Is he good enough? No. He only has pace and even then it's not electric and his finishing and tactical play could all stand to improve. He's only 22 but at this stage you have to accept he's peaked or send him out on loan to prove himself.

Andi doesn't have the guile and power to lead the line so I think he's actually perfect where he is as an inside forward, much like Agbonlahor. In fact, I think he could stand to learn a lot from Gabi as the former has moved away from being a spotty goalscorer who relied on pace to a crafty team player who can provide, score and contribute in many other ways. 

In defense of him, his service this year has been awful. Most of the Villa counter attacking has involved lobbing the ball for him or Gabi to fetch in complete isolation. The team needs to evolve and so does he, a pacey ball fetcher is not good enough.  

If I was in charge, I'd give him another season.

We will probably lose 10-15 million of that to player bonuses and Rodgers getting a bit more than expected.

The bigger thing is that United were England's highest revenue team. We are expected to have Revenue just below 300 million for this year, Utd's will be about 425. Cutting that gap for next year is the 100 million swing in Champions League Revenue.

The thing is that the Champions League has just gotten too fucking lucrative. Giving 4 teams a 50 million pound boost on top of all others in the league completely fucks the league up. You haircut 10 million off of that from each team and give it to the FA to use for prize money for the fa cup and everything is better.The champions league is what's causing ridiclous football inflation. All 5 top teams will have half billion pound revenues by the finish of Anfield's expansion. Mental.

true,BucketsMcGaughey,null,null,"I understand why you might want to lodge a protest vote, but are you really OK with voting with nasty, dangerous idiots like UKIP?

""Ukip is part of the group Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD). The group includes representatives of the Danish People’s Party, the True Finns Party, the Dutch SGP and the infamous Italian Lega Nord – all of them far-right. Nigel Farage is co-President of the group along with Lega Nord’s Francesco Speroni, who described multiple murderer Anders Breivik as someone whose “ideas are in defence of western civilisation.""

Mario Borghezio, another member of the group, declared in a radio interview that Breivik had some ""excellent"" ideas. Farage’s reaction was to write a strongly-worded letter to Borghezio, asking him to withdraw his comments or Ukip would pull out of the EFD. Borghezio not only did not apologise, but responded with an extraordinary speech in which he raged: ""Long live the Whites of Europe, long live our identity, our ethnicity, our race… our blue sky, like the eyes of our women. Blue, in a people who want to stay white.""

Nigel Farage did not withdraw from the EFD. He continues to co-preside over it, along with the leader of the Lega Nord. MEP Nikki Sinclaire, however, was expelled from Ukip for refusing to take part in the EFD because of their “extreme views”.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Yes, it's worth bearing in mind that ""liberal"" has two quite different meanings.

Its older meaning, and the one that the original 19th-century Liberal Party espoused, was that of economic liberalism. That means they believe that Government should have only a light touch when it comes to economic policy. They're not necessarily hardcore libertarian free-market extremists, but certainly stand towards the opposite side of the spectrum from those who believe in a planned economy and heavily-regulated industries.

The other meaning of ""liberal"", and the one that is particularly heavily used in the USA (and hence on the internet in general and Reddit in particular) is social liberalism. This can be summarised as believing that people should be generally free to believe or act in any way they choose, as long as it's not overly harmful to others or to society. So a social liberal would be strongly anti-racist, would believe in sexual equality, gay marriage, and other similar social movements.

The Lib-Dem party's current leadership tend to favour both the social and the economic side of liberalism; this has put them at odds with the sizable minority of their membership who believe that the current government's economic liberal policies are causing hardship amongst the poorest in society and who would indeed prefer a more planned economy and stronger regulation of industries. Whether they'd call thir economic beliefs ""socialist"" or not I couldn't tell you!

The traditional bias of the parties has inded been Labour on the left, Conservatives on the right, Lib-Dems in the middle. However when Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1995 he pulled the party very strongly to the right (he would have said towards the centre) with the result that today's Labour Party has some policies that are more right-wing than for example Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party had. Similarly David Cameron has tried to move the Conservatives towards the centre (i.e. leftwards), especially in terms of social policy. Many people would argue that we now have three broadly centrist parties in the UK, with the differences between them being ones of small detail rather than major ideological differences.",0,1398374701,null,0,false,0,ch162di,t3_23ugks,t1_ch162di,t1_ch0wobf,null,1433505893,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The problem with history (as you most likely will know) is that it is highly subjective and be twisted in varying ways. Also you may think that you may have a good idea of historical facts, unless you try and research/read about the topic your view is narrow and basis (popular history), you don't.

For example I've leant a (very) touching feel history of Ireland and an other perspective view on things (e.g. Sir Drake) by living here for Uni. Indeed I didn't learn of the plantation or that NI had a semi separate parliament before WWII*. The only thing I learnt was the Irish Potato Famine in my English Class (never went into detail about the time). I learnt of the Plantation and the Easter Uprising plus the bombing of Belfast (NI is forgotten in England in general)  by watching the Beeb or though my own will/research.

Indeed through out my life I have learnt that the Iron Duke (of Wellington) was British. Until last year I thought he was born in GB~, I never knew he was born in Dublin. Nor did I know that his army was somewhere 40-60% Irish born during the battle of Waterloo. Indeed I learn that during the WWI some where between 40-60% of the leading Generals (including Kitchener) were Irish.

So while these thugs where educated they thought they were destroying the graves of the ""traitors^"" who fought for the ""oppressors"".

*I might be wrong on this point but from what I have read NI did have have it's own parliament. To me it seemed to be like Canada's before 1931ish. Can any one clear this up for me?

Edit:~I thought GB as most people who are called British are from GB. Oh course some one from Ireland can also be called British due to Geography.

The PDFs are about half way down the page.  Learn these off by heart.  Watch some YouTube videos of the mod1 this will put some of it a bit more in to context rather than just learning them from the PDF completely.

Go out to a car park and make sure you can do all the slow maneuvers on the cg125.  Get as much practice as possible really.  Remember to do head checks before each maneuver.  Even when practicing - this is important as they are easy to forget especially if you are new to riding.

Be smooth and controlled with all inputs - This means everything, clutch, brakes, throttle etc.  Especially when you move up to the 500.  Everything is essentially the same you just have more weight and more power but if you are smooth and controlled you will be fine.  You won't lose control of the bike if you follow this.

They're not necessarily hardcore libertarian free-market extremists, but certainly stand towards the opposite side of the spectrum from those who believe in a planned economy and heavily-regulated industries.

Sorry if I've got this wrong or not but, would an example of a light touch be for example subsiding companies such as gas or internet so it's a less of a cost to the people?

&gt;The Lib-Dem party's current leadership tend to favour both the social and the economic side of liberalism; this has put them at odds with the sizable minority of their membership who believe that the current government's economic liberal policies are causing hardship amongst the poorest in society and who would indeed prefer a more planned economy and stronger regulation of industries

Would you say or know if this 'sizeable minority' would increase into a majority in the future, to possibly gain popularity, as surely this would favour the majority of the population?

&gt;Many people would argue that we now have three broadly centrist parties in the UK, with the differences between them being ones of small detail rather than major ideological differences.

Ahh okay thank you for explaining this all in great detail.

What makes you think it is impartial, as I said we cannot ever trust the state to defend us against fascism since history proves otherwise. The reality is that the processes which cause fascism are a fundamental part of this society, as is the state, thus its interests are in maintaining the same status quo out of which fascisms rise. In those cases where the EDL haven't faced a strong opposition they've done just that. Several times they've run amok in Luton, in Bradford and in Lewisham smashing non-whites shops and so on, see [here their rampage in Leicester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD5rHx9iKPQ). So if say a Nazi party was elected to councils you would be willing to watch them execute policies against minority groups? You would stand and watch. I hate to break it to you but fascism and Nazism are real things that will raise their heads if not stamped on, I guessing you're a white person and thus have nothing to fear, but those who experience the violence live that fear. You're simply reiterating the states line that only it can use violence and fear. The fact is anti-fascist violence is used to defend people from attack; fascist violence is simply attack (against those who look different, act different, sound different, do different etc.)

&gt;It is a barrier to fascism and Nazism, the german state and others did put a great deal of pressure towards stopping the rise of Nazism, saying they did nothing or contributed to it isn't true.

That’s utter rubbish. Ahistory. It was the actions of the German state which brought the Nazi's to power. They used the Freikorps to crush workers movements and uprising, revolutions of liberation and not tyranny. They ignored the crimes of fascists and Nazi's (hence Hitler was given 5 months in prison for an uprising in 1923, those who were involved in the Bavarian Socialist Republic were executed without trial in 1919). Far-right groups were involved in over 500 assassinations, but they were ignored instead left-wing challenges were suppressed. The Freikorps and other Nazi’s and fascist paramilitary groups were given the authority of the state in their suppression of political dissidents and non-conformists - together they stopped the only organisations strong enough to stop fascism, that is the self-organisation of workers and people. This same phenomena has been replicated elsewhere (i.e. South America)

What history in fact shows us is the liberal state, to defend its economic and social power, will ignore fascism to save itself from left-wing movements.

true,Kitchner,null,null,"&gt;Okay, would you then say the Lib Dems are slightly pragmatic in a sense then, as they haven't been ever fully able to become the party in power? So no assumptions can be made as nobody has ever experienced it before?

Definetly. The Lib Dems have been really REALLY weak while in the coalition goverment, so we can't even really see about their other decisions other then they back electoral reform that people in the UK didn't back.

The Lib Dem strategy that was working, and they should have kept doing, was they would win areas slowly bit by bit and work the area really hard on a local level, so people would be ""won over"" to the lib dems. They could afford to do this as basically it made no difference 90% of the time whether or not their MPs were in parliament. 

In the long run, I think the Lib Dems would have been better to stay out of the coalition government and not go back on promises like tutition fees. 

&gt;Scaremongering would sort of being the whole idea at the moment promoted by UKIP that 'all of our jobs are being taken' and things similar to that?

In my opinion yes. Obviously you should go out there and learn for yourself, but I've studied politics and international relations and I honestly believe Britain is better off inside the EU the out. The problem is convincing the average voter.

&gt;So would that be the reason that it seems UKIP recently have become more popular as a party, because the people are simply being advantage of?

Yes. They basically have access to a set of events that they haven't had access to for the last 10 years, which is why they are all of a sudden now popular.

&gt;So this again is a sort of scaremongering? And that he just taking the current political naivety (loosely used) and disenfranchised people to UKIP's advantage?

Again, in my opinion yes but it's best to take on your own opinion. On the other hand while I do think Nigel Farage is more like a used car salesman than a politician, he really isn't like all the current political elite, which is a nice change.

&gt; Do you mind if I ask so? What would be the repercussions of this?

Economically I believe both Scotland and rUK (rest of UK) would be worse off without Scotland. Both economies would take a hit and both would feel it's influence lessen to a greater or lesser extent on the world stage.

Likewise for the EU, if rUK leaves the EU after Scotland leaves, it will be economically worse off.

The other factor to consider is without Scottish Labour MPs rUK will be dominated by the Tory party for decades, possibly even seeing Wales vote for independence too. 

I'm actually Welsh and I have family in Australia, if that scenario ever played out I'd probably go back home to Wales or go to Australia. There's nothing I like about England on it's own that I like enough to keep me here.


Also I totally agree that education is a massive influence on voter turnout. People don't get democracy and what it's about. They don't know who their local MP is or what they actually do. They don't get the system.

If everyone left high school with enough political knowledge of the parties and what they stand for we'd be better off. If they left thinking it was their duty to hold politicians to account and how to judge the actions of a government we'd be even better off.

Tony Blair honestly said the right thing when he was leader of the opposition:

""Ask me my three main priorities for government, and I tell you: education, education, education."" - Tony Blair, 1996

Oscar? really? The kids alright. Ramires maybe... but not Oscar. Let's not be petty and name calling.

Regardless...

I don't think Countinho should go over Oscar. Countinho is a capable player but Oscar has shown so far that he is a step above. He isn't as much a hard worker in midfield but his goal return is better and at the beginning of the season he was assisting left and right. Since then he has tired and isn't as impressive but I still think he deserves to go in front of Countinho. His link-up play with Neymar seems to work and those two are going to be so important for Brazil this year.

Lucas or Ramires is a very different question. In my opinion they are two different players. Lucas is a defensive midfielder Ramires is box-to-box. I think you should be asking about Lucas or Sandro and Ramires or Paulinho, etc. If I could I'd take both Lucas and Ramires.

- Carrick a rede : rope bridge, with a huge drop into the sea below, great experience up near the north coast. (The coast road from Belfast up was voted 3rd best driving experience on Earth not too long ago)

- Castlewellan hedge maze : biggest in the world they say (its called the Peace maze, you'll learn that NI can't have something completely arbitrary from it's past)

- Royal Co. Down golf course : If you like golf, it's a killer. Tiger himself loves it and has played it numerous times.

- Pub : shouldn't be too hard, most are quite homely

- Seaside day : Warrenpoint is really nice on a warm day, stunning views. Reminds me: look up the Flagstaff near O'Meath, technically just over the border (I think, don't crucify me if it isn't), stunning views and if the Seatruck is coming in, it's just tremendous. Highly recommend a trip up there if you're any way close.

- Sub note: our Sunday roasts are incredible, just stop off at about any restaurant on a Sunday and it'll be a cracker, Canal Court in Newry is excellent.

- PROTIP: If you insist on reading about the Troubles and want to take it in, do so - but do not let it consume your trip. Some places are steeped in history, others its very much a present day issue. Shankill/Falls/Derry is your go to places. I'm not a fan of any parade that blocks off a public road so I don't usually support it, but Scarva is a day out on the 14th of July or something, I don't see the appeal personally but hey ho!

Protip for Dublin: Temple bar looks pretty but it's our best tourist trap so buy a drink in just about any pub outside it and you'll get the same great experience and more authentic.

true,JohnPeel,null,null,"I'll make the point that the EU is not even democratic, the EU parliament (the only directly elected body) has no authority to propose legislation, only accept or reject it. The commission, which is not elected, is the only body able to propose legislation.

It's quite nuanced but the idea is that the EU is attempting to build legitimacy. Firstly the parliament was created, and was given no power. It was a joke, but it implanted an idea into people's heads that there exists something called the EU parliament. And then it was given more power. Then they created the EU president. He's a joke. But now they've established an idea that there is such thing as an EU president. Eventually that position will be granted more authority too.

The EU is currently in the stage of trying to legitimise the parliament. The commission carefully crafts bills that obviously seem like a good idea, they're against pollution, against ivory, things that only a psychopath would oppose. But then by agreeing with those votes, you're acknowledging that the parliament and by extension the commission is legitimate. It's very insidious and this is why UKIP reject those votes. Little things are also added to these bills that chip away at the authority of sovereign nations. This bill for example might contain provisions that EU inspectors can now seize goods if they suspect they contain ivory. We simply do not know as the parliament has to vote on these bills by the minute. It only takes for one line in the hundreds of pages of thousands of bills to contain something terrible and that would be that. The parliament couldn't even propose a correction to repeal such a bill.

As to the ultimate end goal I can't be entirely certain, but I cannot see the commission ever doing itself out of a job. The most likely end game is that national parliaments will be legislated into impotence and power be consolidated in the commission. The smaller countries in the EU are very vulnerable to this, as defiance would be punished with the withdrawal of subsidies and loans. A condition for Lithuania joining the EU was that they shut down their nuclear power stations and now they're forced into loans to shift their energy infrastructure over to gas for example.

Mkhitaryan was one of the highest rated midfielders in Europe last season, it is pure folly to assume that Liverpool were the first to 'discover' him. 

Willian was on everyone's radar when he was at Shakhtar, but then Anzhi bought him for 35 million and everyone cooled off instantly. It was only in the winter when Anzhi was going through a restructuring that Willian became available, and then everyone took notice. 

Salah had been linked to Chelsea ever since he first scored against them for Basel, but they were waiting to see how he might develop over time. 

Costa was the 2nd top scorer at Atletico, but not only was everybody's attention on their top scorer Falcao, but they also correctly surmised that Atletico would not sell their top 2 strikers in the same window. 

The reason why it seems like Liverpool targets are 'overlooked' by the big clubs is because that is exactly their policy since they know that they are unlikely to win any sort of bidding war with the big European clubs. They are shrewd not so much by choice, but by circumstance. 

Also, Liverpool's record in players that cost less than 10 million is bad because that's the type of players you get for that price. For every gem that you can name that costs less than 10 million, there are hundreds that fit exactly to that price tag.

true,DrRegularAffection,null,null,"A couple of things I've always wondered about River and her future:

1. The show seems adamant she's still alive as a data ghost, because 'everybody lives!', regardless of not being corporeal, yet the Doctor seems insistent that she's really, really dead. It kinda shocks me he wouldn't try and rescue her in *some* way. If he wouldn't try because he wants to put her to rest, that's all manner of fucked up. She dies to save him, so rather than deal with her, he traps her in a database with like the same 6-7 people for eternity? 
2. Technically speaking, River can always show up and meet a future incarnation of the Doctor. How exactly would the Doctor rationalize this? I mean, his first meeting with her is when she died, so from his perspective, she should have always been dead in his eyes, or never is. Will he forever consider himself married (apparently not, he refers to her as an 'ex' in Name of the Doctor), since she can always show up in his future?
3. While we know when the Doctor gave her his screwdriver, did he just create a brand-new one for her? The one we saw looked pretty beat-up, and on top of that apparently did things that his never could. I guess, he could have just updated the software, but still, it's never suggested to have a 'red setting' or 'dampers'.

Then his first start for the first team against City he absolutely blew me away! I couldn't get over how amazing his first touch was and his ability to pass and move effortlessly. Incredible that he was only 17 then.

He's completely upped his game since then and done what Rodgers has asked of him by getting involved with goals and assists. It was one of his downfalls last year but he's been brilliant this year. I always knew he could have a future in a more central position ever since the Everton game at Goodison last year, but to be able to do it so soon and so effectively is amazing.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; So why do companies like Google and Amazon who do most of their business in England have their HQ in Dublin?

The Republic of Ireland charges corporation tax on trading income at 12 1/2%.  This is significantly lower than UK CT.

For VAT purposes the place of supply is dependent on whether you sell to a business or non business customer.  For business customers the supply is made in the location of the buyer.  For non-business customers it is in the place of the seller.

However, in the case of Google it is acknowledged that they have sales teams in the UK.  So prima facie the sale was made through that office, right?  Google claim that the sale was in Ireland.  They claim that the UK staff don't have take any payments, they don't negotiate or agree any arrangements. The UK sales staff don't according to Google actually **do** anything.

For corporation tax purposes you have to pay CT on all profits from all income derived directly or indirectly from a permanent establishment in the UK.  The base of operations of the UK based sales force would be a permanent establishment excepting that one of the criteria is that an agent of the company must exercise authority to do business of the company there.

As noted before, Google claim that their UK sales force don't actually have any authority and therefore don't exercise that authority.

All in all it's awfully nice of them to employ people who aren't authorised to do anything much apart from drink tea, no?

&gt; Pretty sure because you earned in a particular place doesn't mean it has to be taxable there.

I've laid things out in a fairly rudimentary way.  You're welcome to go check that this really is how the legislation works.

Fundamentally it comes down to whether the UK staff genuinely don't generate any sales. Are they really, as Google claimed, not authorised to do anything?  And if this is the case why does Google employ those staff?",0,1398394965,null,0,false,0,ch1fa5w,t3_23ulb9,t1_ch1fa5w,t1_ch19lq6,null,1433510363,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
