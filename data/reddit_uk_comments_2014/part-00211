Even if a teacher did find some software, there was a good chance that the IT guys would refuse to install it, citing security or similar. I am not saying they are all bone idle, but enough are.

As a result the majority of IWBs are currently being used as very expensive projectors. So, for the next technological miracle, the parents have to pay.

An iPad solves some of those problems, but parents need to check exactly what software the school has to put on them, and whether it is worth it.

That's quite a thing to put on him. It was widely interpreted as a regeneration before he said anything and, frankly, not counting that as a regeneration would have seriously raised questions about how regeneration works - that amount of energy had to be a regeneration.

&gt; I don't know what you're implying by ""war doctor was made because 9 wouldn't return.""  

The War Doctor took the place that Christopher Eccleston would have taken had he agreed to return. There were discussions with him, they didn't pan out, and the War Doctor was created.

&gt;As to the Valeyard, 11 actually says in one ep (I forget which) that he has been called by that name, so I hardly think it's crazy, as in unbelievable that Moffat would have brought it back.  

It is crazy and unbelievable that he would. Yes, it's mentioned in the Name of the Doctor that he was called by the Valeyard (something that's been part of Doctor Who lore for decades so mentioning it among the names he is known to have is hardly surprising); however, that's something that would take at least a season to do any justice to and, as we know, discussions with John Hurt for the War Doctor role didn't even start until they had already filmed most of season seven. Add that to the fact that they knew when Matt Smith was leaving and you tell me where he could've shoed in a Valeyard plot.

It seems to be a major problem in all aspects of Western life. We focus on the surface to one-up each other, instead of actually addressing an issue. I mean, look at what's going on with pictures of teenagers smiling at Auschwitz. They aren't making light of what happened, they are taking pictures of 'here's me in a famous place'. How about we look at WHY they are taking that mindset with them to such places. 

Maybe they actually haven't grasped the scale or depth of what happened there, and that is a failure in education. Instead of questioning why, the media tell them they are bad people for smiling for a photograph. Instead of asking why the country itself fostered such mindsets, the media attack an individual for *projected* intention and solve nothing.

To me, this is all 'moral masturbation'. 'Look at ***me*** reacting to something!'. 'Look how accepting and respectful ***I*** am'.

**Service:**

I put my order in to Zoeva on Saturday and it shipped Monday. For £7 flat rate shipping it is more than worth it. DHL don't fuck around folks. It arrived today - that's right 2 days to get to the UK from Germany via courier.

**First impressions of the palette:**

Incredibly silky smooth. The mattes kick up a bit of powder when I was swatching but not a great deal. The black was the weakest, needing two layers to show up better on the swatches.

The non mattes are smooth and buttery. I'm really looking forward to playing with this!

**Brushes:**

I haven't played with the brushes yet. I have washed them and didn't notice any shedding on any of them as I was washing. IF any do shed when I go gather them up after they are dry I will edit this post.

You can't really steal from people on WoW. If your character dies, it keeps all of its gold, equipment and items. In other games your character might drop some items or money on death which other players can then pick up, but not on WoW. In that sense it's a safe game to play in terms of keeping everything you've earned.

However, it *is* possible to scam players. People can still trade gold and items with one another. Additionally guilds may often sell certain services for large amounts of gold (such as boosting players in difficult raid dungeons). When guilds offer these services they tend to make good on their offers because they want to keep a good reputation. However it would be possible for a guild to scam you out of a large sum of gold if they wanted to.

Guilds also have collective bank vaults which can store gold and items. Usually the bank is controlled by high ranking guild members (officers) and the guild master. There have been many cases of guild masters emptying out their guild bank and stealing off into the night. It's easy to change your name, move to another realm and start over. 

Players can also scam each other or ninja very good equipment in raids - but if they do this their reputation will go down the shitter very quickly, even on big realms.

Doing shitty in the cups is incredibly short sighted. The cups are an excellent way for our younger guys and bench warmers to get in good game time against good opponents. When it comes to February and the push towards the end of the season, we're going to need ALL of the points from the lower league teams, which means we shouldn't be taking risks in starting 4-6 younger players if we don't have to, which is one of the things we had to do last season and it costs us points.

true,legalfictionnyc,newcr-3,,"I've been following Everton since 2011, about the same time I moved to Brooklyn.  But I just started going to Dennehy's for a game every once and a while this past season and I've really enjoyed it.  

It's not a full out tv's-all-over-every-wall type of soccer-only bar like say a Nevada Smith's or a Football Factory.  It's much more like a typical bar/restaurant.  But the set up works just fine, you can see the game from any seat, and the drinks and food are good.  

The only reason I don't go there more often is because I live in Brooklyn, and when I do get up early enough on a weekend to head into the city for a game I'll rotate around a couple different places with some friends who support different clubs and depending on what the big game is that day.  

The people are friendly.  I usually go with friends, but I'll naturally end up having a few conversations with other people around.  And even my LFC friend seems to prefer watching games there now.  

If you or anyone else is new to watching Everton or the EPL in general I wouldn't be intimidated.  I'm an American who never really watched before the 2010 World Cup and it took me a little while to get up to speed, but everyone has been super friendly about it.  Especially fellow Evertonians.  Jumping in with a rooting interest is the best way to learn.  And you don't see a ton of Everton kits wandering around the city, so any time you run into someone else in one it puts a smile on your face.

Good lord why do you feel the need to ram your incapacitated naive and narrow-minded ideas up my ass all the time? I see you responding to almost every post of mine with some sort of an insult.

Now let me explain why Torres is important to the squad:

1. Jose obviously thinks so or else he would be gone.
2. He is the most experienced striker at the club.
3. 5 goals and 5 assists in 17 starts in pretty fucking good. That means he's contributed to 10 goals in 17 starts. That's the same as Schurrle (8 goals + 2 assists) whom everyone seems to adore. You may not be satisfied but my pea brain thinks that's a good enough reason to keep him.

4. He may not be flashy but he scores important goals and pretty much always performs well in big games. Not EVERY big game, but in a lot of them. He may not be consistent but neither am I saying he should be first choice. He may not score game changing goals every time we need him to, but saying that he is useless and we're wasting our money is grasping at straws. All this is just a manifestation of your bitterness because we weren't good enough as a team to win anything last season.

Yes, it's upsetting to religious people to hear their beliefs challenged!  Likewise, it's upsetting to supporters of a political ideology when someone confronts their beliefs.  But, it's done for a reason.  This process of debate and criticism is how we sort out good ideas from bad.

5 goals in 17 games isn't good. I guess your little pea brain means so much more than mine does, how could I forget.

Where are you getting this? If you put a player on through many big games at forward (our only forward) he's going to score some.

He IS useless, and we ARE wasting our money on him. Don't really know why you think he's not useless and why he's worth the money. Put on players who will preform and they will do better than he will. He isn't worth taking up time from youth players who will preform to the same level he does.

1. Cost of living is rather low and because a lot of Swansea businesses have students as their main income source, there are a lot of good deals and discounts around.

2. I would say that the university is very close to both rural and urban. You turn left out of the university and you are a 30-40 minute walk from the town centre, and if you turn right you have beautiful views and beaches.

3. I cannot answer about computer science classes, but I do know that we have a computer related society called SUCS (Swansea University Computing Society) and I think they won best society last year.

4. We do have a Theatre society called Shoreline Theatre. I was Vice President last year and this year I am the Treasurer. We do about 9 shows a year in different theatres around Swansea, and although I may be a tad biased, we are generally a great society. 

5. We have wifi all across the campus, and its very fast and I never have issues getting signal.


Hope this helps :)

true,Freeman999,present,,"&gt;&gt;  Can we afford to lose young strikers who have to play second fiddle to him?

&gt;Why would we lose young strikers?

Why did Sturridge leave? Not enough game time up front, had to play second fiddle to Torres. How many has he scored since leaving?

Do you want to be in this position in 12 months time, after Lukaku leaves in January, having been 3rd choice behind Torres? I certainly don't.
 

   &gt;&gt; Can we afford to lose managers who are let down by Torres' complete inability to hit a barn door?

&gt;Why would we lose managers? In fact Jose has always said he wants to keep Torres despite his poor goalscoring.

So far Torres has seen off Carlo, AVB and Di Matteo, and we were lumped with the FSW for a season to bring out the best in him. Jose also said his [strikers were shite](http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/264777.html) and basically the reason we weren't top of the league last season. 

&gt;&gt;Can we, the fans, afford for ticket prices to increase because we're spending £175k/week on what has without a doubt been the worst and most toxic purchase in footballing history?

&gt;Do you honestly believe Torres' wages are what are affecting ticket prices? Ticket prices are influenced by our income not our expenditure and given the fact that our stadium is pretty small, prices are never going to be low enough.

I think it naive to suggest that the wages of the squad have no impact on ticket prices, and as our second highest earner, he is responsible for a large proportion of the wages.

But ultimately, Torres is never going to come good for us. He's never going to score 25 goals in the league. While this is excusable for players like Ba (never a world class player) or Eto'o (pensioner), for your star striker earning £175k/week, it's completely unacceptable.

Wait, now I have to explain what ""rumours"" mean? Ok then, here's the definition:

&gt; a currently circulating story or **report of uncertain or doubtful truth**.

I highlighted the bit in bold so you don't miss it.

&gt; Experience doesn't mean we should keep him. If we sign Drogba does that mean he should automatically be a big rotational player just because he has the most experience on the team. That's just stupid.

This proves you have zero understanding of man-management skills and zero understanding of what makes a good team tactically.

&gt; 5 goals in 17 games isn't good. I guess your little pea brain means so much more than mine does, how could I forget.

Heh. I guess your super-brain is incapable of scanning large numbers. Or maybe its just selective reading. I'm going to go with option 2. Go read my post again where it says he's contributed to 10 goals in 17 starts.

&gt; Where are you getting this? If you put a player on through many big games at forward (our only forward) he's going to score some.

Where am I getting this? Hmmm... Let me think. Oh yes. I got it from the bloody post you first responded to. Here, I'll spoon feed you this too, kiddo:

&gt;He scored and assisted vs Man City, scored vs Galatasaray away, Atletico, Bayern, assisted Ba's goal vs PSG, had a match winning performance vs Spurs away before being wrongly sent off

---------------

&gt;He IS useless, and we ARE wasting our money on him. Don't really know why you think he's not useless and why he's worth the money. Put on players who will preform and they will do better than he will. He isn't worth taking up time from youth players who will preform to the same level he does.

If you think Bamford is going to perform better than Torres in the semi-final of a Champions League match you're fucking deluded. You might as well start supporting Arsenal.

&gt;Okay. If you're going to get in an argument on the computer you better prepare yourself for some insults especially when you're defending a player who shouldn't be defended. Stop being a bitch (uh-oh, no more responses from you).

There still is a degree of that left in the place (or at least there was when I was there) but now its predominantly cultchie students, gluebags and alcho's that occupy the place. The houses are falling to absolute bits too, I mean my one was a complete cave but it seems half the house on Wolseley St are abandoned now. I remember an abandoned house next to mine was actually used as a squat and my bedroom window backed out onto the alley way where the gluebags and alcho's would all have their carry outs and have what to my ears sounded like huge S&amp;M orgies. There'd be times I'd even hear them climbing over the wall and hoking about our yard while I was in my room trying to sleep which was great craic as a wee 1st year!

The owner had put a lot of work into it, and those bastards stole it a day or two before they recorded that, then hid it somewhere. It's the kind of story that would bring your blood to a boil. If that car was in tip-top shape it'd be worth... what, £10,000+?

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;Why did Sturridge leave? Not enough game time up front, had to play second fiddle to Torres. How many has he scored since leaving?

Tores wasn't even first choice back then. Drogba was first choice. Also everyone talking about Sturridge now are just hypocrites, because when he left everyone had the excuse that ""he's lazy and doesn't contribute defensively"". Also, I personally don't give a shit about Lukaku after his constant hissy fits without having ever contributed anything to this club. 

&gt;So far Torres has seen off Carlo, AVB and Di Matteo, and we were lumped with the FSW for a season to bring out the best in him. Jose also said his strikers were shite and basically the reason we weren't top of the league last season.

Lol. You think 1 player is responsible for the sacking of all those managers? In that case which player are you going to blame for the sackings of Mourinho the first time, Grant, Scolari, Hiddink?

Yeah Jose talks about goals, but he has never said that Torres' performances have been poor.

&gt; I think it naive to suggest that the wages of the squad have no impact on ticket prices, and as our second highest earner, he is responsible for a large proportion of the wages.
But ultimately, Torres is never going to come good for us. He's never going to score 25 goals in the league. While this is excusable for players like Ba (never a world class player) or Eto'o (pensioner), for your star striker earning £175k/week, it's completely unacceptable.

Overall wages, of course they have 'some' impact. Even then that's influenced by the clubs income. But Wages of 1 player influencing all ticket prices? Nope.

People have to realize that Torres is not going to be the 25 goals striker. But not being a 25 goals striker does not mean that he is useless. Drogba scored 11 goals in 2011 and was still important to the club. 5 goals in 2012. There is a lot more to football than goals. That is why Capello picked so many other strikers over Owen who had a great scoring record for Newcastle, for example.

Also please realize that I'm not justifying his wages at all. I've merely said that I would like Torres to stay at the club. Whether that is as 4th choice or 2nd choice, I really don't care because he is still capable of being an important player whenever he's on the pitch.",0,1406140170,null,0,false,0,cj5oryq,t3_2bh9oo,t1_cj5oryq,t1_cj5o1qn,null,1434862662,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I agree with a few, Dawson for me has to go! He cannot play in Poch's system because he's not mobile enough, he's not good enough with the ball at his feet and he has no composure!

I would also love to see another quality player! So Griezmann would be welcomed, even though I highly doubt he will come to us :(

&gt;This proves you have zero understanding of man-management skills and zero understanding of what makes a good team tactically.

And you do? Torres isn't a leader. He isn't a good footballer. He's played in big games because we didn't have different options. That makes his experience on it's own worth keeping him? Hell no. You're deluded by your raging love for a shitty footballer.

&gt;Heh. I guess your super-brain is incapable of scanning large numbers. Or maybe its just selective reading. I'm going to go with option 2. Go read my post again where it says he's contributed to 10 goals in 17 starts.

That's great. He ***scored*** (since you seem to have read right over the point I was making) 5 goals in 17 games. That isn't a good ratio. If he was getting 20 assists in the 17 games and no goals? Sure. He got 5 goals though, and only 5 assists. That isn't worth someone who's keeping when we have players who have scored more double that who should be playing ahead of him.

&gt;If you think Bamford is going to perform better than Torres in the semi-final of a Champions League match you're fucking deluded. You might as well start supporting Arsenal.

Again, you completely mis-understood my point. If we keep Torres, Lukaku's game time will be what suffers. We all know that. Are we not considering Lukaku a youth anymore? Really?

We got Fryers from Man U (pissing off SAF in the process) because he has so much potential as a young talent.

I believe KVB does not provide protection that the requirements required.

Perhaps of note, KVB is used for the CTRL approach to St Pancras, its only application outside of France.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; A few years ago they spent an absolute fortune on putting an interactive whiteboard in every classroom. Unfortunately there isn't that much suitable software to run on them. There wasn't enough teacher training (they aren't difficult to use, but you don't want to mess up in front of a class of tech-savvy teenagers).

One of the major IWB brands is now moving their software suite to an annual subscription licensing model. Without the board and projector the software is of limited use and after paying £thousands for the board/projector/install this is causing a number of schools to look at alternatives. Large interactive 'panels' seem to be the way to go, they're sort of a giant ipad-like touchscreen.

Personally I think IWB's are still something of a novelty. Great for wowing people at open evenings and the like but as you say the range of available software is limited. Older models go out of support quite quickly too I have found.

&gt; Even if a teacher did find some software, there was a good chance that the IT guys would refuse to install it, citing security or similar. I am not saying they are all bone idle, but enough are.

Unfortunately there are still some IT support staff in schools who see the network as their personal fiefdom, which is to be ruled with an iron fist.

The majority of us are happy to accommodate any reasonable request to have software installed. That said I have had staff ask for software installs on the first day of the new school year. Every other department got the software to us during the previous term so that we could install it during the summer holidays.

There are also the usual concerns about licensing but it's down to departments to make sure they purchase the correct software licences. We will happily advise staff what licences they need, but we won't install a program licensed for a single PC on every PC on the network.

&gt; As a result the majority of IWBs are currently being used as very expensive projectors. So, for the next technological miracle, the parents have to pay.

There is also a school of thought that the pupils will take greater care of the devices if they own them. Thereby avoiding low-level damage to things like keyboards/mice/monitors in the computer suites.

&gt; An iPad solves some of those problems, but parents need to check exactly what software the school has to put on them, and whether it is worth it.

Agreed. That said Apple are targeting the Enterprise / Education sector and there is good management capability in recent versions of iOS.

He averages 0.5 dribbles per league game; Andros Townsend averages 5.7 DPLG for Spurs.

Carroll is just too lightweight. I know Modric was, but he had good inner strength. Carroll did okay at QPR, but nothing to warrant any first team chances with us. He should be loaned again or sold.

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"This has been done to death, this is merely another example of someone being fooled by a token gesture designed to distract people from the reality of our season ticket prices.

That 'lowest price' seasoncards are 'Gold Value', they are on an application basis only, the club decide where you sit, and they are very limited in number, likely around a few hundred. That is less than 1% of our overall seasoncards.

It is tokenism from the club, designed to allow them to lay claim to the lowest season ticket prices in the league while disguising the overall trend of yearly increases of 10% across the board.

If you propagate this myth of us being cheap, then you're hurting fans who wish to see the increases cease.

Our season tickets are now double what they were 6 years ago.

Our cheapest goal end ticket in the South Stand level 1 is £585 (£635 if you have to go Platinum), which will cost you £53 more than the equivalent in the Stretford End at Old Trafford at £532. We are now more expensive than United (albeit their max for corporate areas is higher).

United have frozen their season ticket prices for 3 years, 3 years!

We've had 10% rises every year for around 6 years!

And we're the club that has always prided itself on doing things the right way. We used to deride United for being a corporate juggernaut that treated its fans like shit. But now we're no better, in fact we're just as bad if not worse.

Our fanbase is largely working class, I recall a survey in 2009 that showed our fans averaged the second lowest income of any Premier League club's fanbase.

That's what makes the increases all the more offensive.

Our fans didn't become higher earners overnight after we won the title.

Our individual ticket prices are also now among the most expensive in the league. Tickets regularly go for £60 now.

It's a disgrace IMO. It's part of a wider Premier League problem of clubs shitting on the fans and exploiting their loyalty, but I, and many others, never thought I'd see the day City jumped on that bandwagon.

&gt;If there is a battle in Britain nowadays between something explicitly Christian and something secular, the latter usually wins. Look at Sunday shopping, mass abortion, the growing desire to kill old people (sorry, let them “die with dignity”), divorce, surrogate motherhood and so on. For better or worse, religious objections couched as such tend to be disliked and rejected

What a fucking tit snaking wank badger. What's wrong with any of those things? The religious objections are retarded! If those are against your religion, just don't do them yourself.

&gt;Of all the human institutions developed in the light of Christianity, marriage has been the most abiding. It is because of Christianity that marriage became a lifelong and increasingly equal bond between one man and one woman, chiefly in order to bring up children lovingly. Without Christian teaching, it was not much more than a property deal about women (with sex thrown in), made between men. 

Another steaming pile of bullshit, Christianity trying to claim something it didn't invent. 

&gt;Because he wanted to be seen to modernise his party, Mr Cameron decided to introduce single-sex marriage. In rushing forward to do so, he made no attempt to reflect on the Christian heritage which he now extols. He never seems to have thought about why the relationship between a man and a woman might not, in fact, be the same as that between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. 

Hard to believe I'm defending David Cameron, but maybe he did make an attempt to reflect, and decided that actually you can be a Christian and not a total bastard.

£15 for Sunderland?

Try trebling that.

Arsenal will probably be circa £60 also.

This is another point. City are now totally underhand with the pricing for a match by match basis. It isn't transparent anymore. There used to be a clear categorising system on fixtures and the prices were clear and set.

Now the club doesn't announce them, and just decides on a whim how to price games. Usually so they can exploit scenarios like us having key games against average sides during the title run in, so they can charge much more than they would've under the old transparent pricing categories. Which means that over the course of a season now, most of our fixtures at home will be 'category A' under the old system, whereas they used to be a minority under the old transparent system.

Just another snide way of squeezing as much as possible out of the fans, and yet further evidence of a disregard for our supporters in the face of the £/€/$.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; There's been many rumors and even the coach of Atletico have talked so obviously there's been some communication between the clubs.

Again, go back and read the meaning of ""rumour"". And obviously? Well then at this point we should obviously have signed Hulk, Adriano, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Modric, Varane, Sneijder and on and on.

&gt;  If Jose was set on keeping him do you think he would have even talked to them? No. Don't be stupid.

I don't even know what this means. You have zero proof that we spoke about selling Torres.

&gt;And you do? Torres isn't a leader. He isn't a good footballer. He's played in big games because we didn't have different options. That makes his experience on it's own worth keeping him? Hell no. You're deluded by your raging love for a shitty footballer.

Yup. You have no clue what you're talking about. But I suppose I shouldn't be expecting much from a sexually frustrated 15 year old.

By the way, if I loved Torres I'd be yelling for him to start.

&gt; That's great. He scored (since you seem to have read right over the point I was making) 5 goals in 17 games. That isn't a good ratio. If he was getting 20 assists in the 17 games and no goals? Sure. He got 5 goals though, and only 5 assists. That isn't worth someone who's keeping when we have players who have scored more double that who should be playing ahead of him.

How long have you watched football for? Seriously. If you think 5 goals and 5 assists in 17 starts is nothing then I'm sorry you should really pick a different league to watch, perhaps even a different sport. Ironically NHL would suit your needs well. I didn't even mention the fact that he had 4 goals in 5 games in the Champions League.

&gt;Again, you completely mis-understood my point. If we keep Torres, Lukaku's game time will be what suffers. We all know that. Are we not considering Lukaku a youth anymore? Really?

Lol. Firstly, I don't know where you've built up that view. Perhaps you haven't watched Chelsea long enough under Jose Mourinho. Because if you had, you'd know that Mourinho always plays players that deserve to play. 

And you're considering Lukaku as a youth player? A 21 year old man as youth player? In that case Hazard was a youth player when we signed him. De Bruyne was a youth player last year. Lukaku is young, but he is no youth player. Youth players are U21.

&gt;I like how you complain about insluts coming your way, but then turn around and act like you know everything about the sport, and talk down to every person you get into an argument with like they are 5 years old. You're just as much of a ""internet tough guy"" as I am, but come off more like a asshole who thinks he knows everything. I'll admit when I'm wrong. I'm not wrong here.

You know what's actually funny? You just described yourself in that paragraph.

She thinks that in order to redress the balance between Upper-class/London English dominance and the rest of the UK's cultural heritage, everyone should learn Welsh in school to celebrate our days before the stereotype of bowler hats and cricket.

I'm all for redressing the balance of London-centric culture, but there's better ways than teaching children Welsh. For starters it's a very difficult language, with a complex grammatical structure involving nasal mutation, a schizophrenic word order and strange verb inflections. There are two dialects, Northern and Southern, so the already small section who actually speak the language are divided again, though this mostly concerns articles.

There is something to be said for teaching young children a foreign language, but frankly Spanish or German are much better prospects than something that glorifies a past that no-one living in this century can truly associate themselves with. We might admire the likes of Boudicca, but she won't- and shouldn't- replace the Queen on our coinage.

Yes, it's a nice language when you can discern the words, but IMHO it's time to leave it to the Gorsedd and the Eisteddfod. Instead, how about building some actual infrastructure, without us having to wait for European money?

In an earlier post I spoke about our squad depth in detail (http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2bfv8l/squad_depth_analysis/ )

 The way I see it is if kolo and Agger were to leave we'd be left with Sakho, Skrtel and let's assume Lovren for now. Even if Ilori is ready to make the jump into the first team we'd be short by one player. Preferably we'd get another young talent, versatile enough to play either side of the two but alright with sitting on the bench. Counting on getting by with Sakho as the only left sided CB would be crazy. Unless Coates can make the jump, but he hasn't looked up for it, and he's coming off a major injury. 

Selling Lucas would also leave us short. In Gerrard's deep playmaker position we only have Can as cover, maybe Allen at a stretch. 

Lucas hasn't been great lately but his loss would leave a big hole in the squad that would need filling IMO. ",0,1406143421,null,0,false,0,cj5qow2,t3_2bhc78,t1_cj5qow2,t1_cj5cjyn,null,1434863718,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You're in a dream world or merely lying if you're telling people they can get an adult ticket for £15 for ANY league fixture.

When the tickets go on sale I'll get back to you and you can see for yourself.

**Edit, after seeing your edit**: Tickets in the Family Stand are limited, they're the cheapest in the stadium, but they're not cheap per se. If you don't have a child you can't buy a ticket in there anyway. South Stand level 2 is *not* cheap.

The expansion won't see heavily reduced ticket prices. It'll see ticket prices, in the new stand, on the lower end of an already high scale.

Must say I find it offensive to be told to 'quit complaining' about ticket prices by someone who doesn't pay them himself, so needn't worry about them. Arsehole behaviour mate. Would be hilarious if it wasn't so offensive.

Carroll is 21 and has loads of potential.  He needs a loan to a lower table club or some game time in EL in order to develop further.

Fryers is also 21 and can play LB and CB, two positions we need depth at.

Falque and Mason were players developed to make a profit.  Expect them to be gone sooner rather than later.

Lennon and BAE I agree need to go, but not if it's for nothing.  Depth is not a bad thing, even though they are not top four talents.

In regards to Sandro, Paulinho, and Dembele, expect 2 of 3 to go, and maybe all three if we get Schneiderlin.  It's still early in the transfer window.  Levy has brought us to top 4 potential and done it without bankrupting the club.  Without him who knows where Spurs would be.

Spurs will never be Real, Bayern, Barca, United, etc...no matter how much we want it.  We're not gonna spend hundreds of millions of pounds on players.

That's fucking stupid. In EVE Online for example, in-game assets get stolen all the time, when a corp member empties the corp hangar and runs off for example. Stuff like this is left in intentionally as part of the game.

An example:
http://eve.klaki.net/heist/

A freelance mercenary corporation infiltrated another corp, gained their trust, then eventually made off with $16,500 worth of in-game stuff. Should the people who did that be criminally prosecuted as if they'd robbed someone in the real world?

Fortunately this won't pass, because everyone will be able to see how fucking retarded this idea is. 'Fucking retarded' is synonymous with the word 'Tory' these days.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, of course you buy goalkeepers to try to stop conceding goals. It does not follow however that goals conceded are solely the fault of the keeper, far from it. You're oversimplifying everything and ignoring countless factors. Factors like the quality of the defense, the opposition, conditions etc. Expanding that you should see that with a worse defense you will give up more high quality chances and therefore the goalkeeper will have less chance of saving it. Do you honestly believe, all other things being equal, that equivalent goalkeepers would concede the same with a championship defense instead of a EPL defense? Because that effectively is the implication of your statement.  I assume you are aware of this and are either not describing your point well or are just intent on being an ass. 

I don't understand why you feel the need to be so pessimistic. There may be many on the sub who have optimistic views but that's just football fans in general and is part of the fun. If everyone thought like you then the sport would have all the fun sucked out of it.

To be clear, there is a difference both between delusion and optimism, and pessimism and realism. Delusion dressed as optimism can be bad since it sets fans up for a bigger fall than necessary, and pessimism dressed as realism is just as dangerous. You are the latter of these and seem to believe that they are one and the same. They are not. I am a both realist capable of making judgements without emotional attachment whilst still retaining a sense of optimism towards the club I love because what's the point otherwise.

Optimism does not mean unrealistic expectations but instead an expectation that falls within a spectrum of plausible, rational outcomes but on the higher end of the spectrum. You mistake this for delusion with *many* on the sub, although I do admit some may cross the line just as would any demographic, whilst mistaking your own unnecessary pessimism for realism. 

What's worse is that you interact in a condescending manner towards other, more rational fans (more realist fans by extention). Stop acting like your giving the sub a dose of healthy realism when in fact you're swamping it with negativity. Contributors with (actual) realist mindsets are definitely healthy for the sub since they provide perspective for those who need it; you do not fall into this category.

Which, presuming he wasn't deliberately spreading misinformation, would explain his comments about ticket prices.

City have, for a long time, sold tickets at a discount in the student unions here in Manchester.

It's been a serious topic of contention for a number of years among City fans.

City used it as a method of trying to win new fans, but it's traditionally fucked off normal supporters who don't see why they should pay around double what a student with little affinity for the club does.

If that's where the confusion re his understanding of ticket prices emanated, then that makes sense, and is fair enough. That said, it would be pretty daft to presume that ticket prices around that price are normal and not discounted. Still sceptical he wasn't trying to spread misinformation.

&gt;

&gt;Since 1973, units of the Netherlands Marine Corps have formed part of the [British 3 Commando Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_3_Commando_Brigade) during exercises and real conflict situations. Also, the 7th SBS NL troop will be placed under UK operational command as part of C Squadron, UK [Special Boat Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Boat_Service). Together, these form the UK/NL Landing Force. Either the First or the Second Marine Battalion can be assigned as the Dutch contribution to this force.

&gt;The cooperation between the Korps Mariniers and the [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines) has led to extensive integration in the areas of operations, logistics and materials. Within [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) this is seen as a prime example of what can be achieved in military integration.

&gt;The NLMC and [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines) have a long history of cooperation. During combined actions by the British and Dutch navies during the [War of the Spanish Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession) (1702–1713), amphibious operations were carried out, the most notable being the [Capture of Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Gibraltar) in 1704. During this action, a successful attack was carried out against the fortress of [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) by an 1800-strong brigade of Dutch and British Marines under the command of [Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Hesse-Darmstadt). Both corps share this battle honour.

Grading: assignments and exams are not marked to a curve. 70%+ is a ""first-class"" mark. Anything less than 50 is poor. So the range of typical marks is quite tight. 

Difficulty: Sussex will be comparable to other top UK universities.

Where to live: I'd be tempted to get a place on campus. More easy to meet people and make friends? But make sure you hang out in Brighton (a short train/bus ride from campus) as it is a cool place. 

Workload: science degrees involve a lot of scheduled classes (lectures, seminars, labs, tutorials, etc). You are expected to attend everything that's scheduled for you but many students pick and choose the lectures that they attend (esp. when these are taken by a lot of students - don't skip smaller seminars or tutorials though). Make sure you don't miss important stuff that is handed out/explained at lectures, though. Talk with other students on your course to avoid this. 

Don't be afraid to knock on the office of a lecturer/tutor and ask them to help you if you have a problem. Most staff would rather a student let them know about a problem than kept it to themselves until it is too late to fix. In general I've found that uk uni staff at quite informal and approachable. They want you to do as well as you can. 

When I was there a lot of people studied in the library or in their room or met up with friends to study or took books out and sat on the grass or worked in computer labs or ... Etc etc.

 - Barristers operate something known as the ""cab rank"" rule. If you happen to be the next suitably qualified barrister free when the job comes up, you take it. This is probably to ensure that everyone gets a fair chance at being represented, no matter how depraved their crime. This curiosity of professional ethics trumps everything else, even the nature of the case.
 - This does make a crazy sort of sense. Okay, Watkins is as guilty as sin. But what if he wasn't? What if, by some terrible cruel twist of fate, he was genuinely innocent and for whatever reason (mental illness combined with corrupt police?) he was facing a very long time in prison over a crime he didn't commit? Shouldn't a man in that position be entitled to justice? The ""cab rank"" rule is there for that reason. Today it's Ian Watkins, filthy pervert that nobody really wants to defend but someone's got to. Tomorrow it might be samsaBEAR, unjustly accused innocent that nobody really wants to defend.

If HMRC enquires into your returns *(or your failure to make them)* you will **have** to provide them.  If you don't wan't to fork over your personal records, you need to keep them separate.  Also, separation will make your record keeping simpler.

Assuming you started to trade after April this year your first set of accounts *(these don't have to be elaborate)* will run to April next year.  You'll have to pay the tax by January 31st 2016.  Don't forget to set aside some cash for this!  *(Normally you would make two payments on account during the year and a balancing payment the January after the end of the tax year.  That probably won't trigger for your first year.)*

If you incurred any capital expenditure for this work *(bought a PC, bought a van)* look up Annual Investment Allowance.  Up to a point *(which you'll almost certainly be under)* you can claim 100% of the cost in the year you incurred it.  

Go read about **[Cash Basis accounting](https://www.gov.uk/simpler-income-tax-cash-basis/overview)**.  Normally you account for tax on an accruals basis.  This means you pay tax on what you *earned* rather than what you got *paid*.  This means if you do a job for me and you bill me for £10,000, but I haven't paid you yet you might already incur the tax on it.  Cash basis lets you more or less do things on a receipts basis.

Ninja edit:

Register to submit your returns online **way** in advance.  You have to register for this and in the past HMRC have had issues getting this done quickly.  Calling in the middle of January next year could be a mistake.",0,1406149291,null,0,false,0,cj5u3ok,t3_2bhahs,t1_cj5u3ok,t3_2bhahs,null,1434865341,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

I still think The Empty child is a great introduction.
It's got a scary monster, romance, fights, hi-tech spock stuff, shows that, as opposed to Jack's arsenal, the Doctor only carries a screwdriver, you're introduces to the psychic paper in a funny way, the cliffhanger is really funny, the CGI are awesome (that Dr.Constantine transformation!!!), you learn that family is important, and it is implied that it's very rare for the Doctor to have a day where everybody lives.


If you like this two-parter, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the show.
Granted, it might not be the perfect episode for a very young child. But, let's face it, I find *Rose* just... too cheesy.

true,p_rooney,null,null,"Hi, I am doing a PhD at Sussex at the moment in astrophysics. Before that I did an MSc in Cosmology at Sussex. I currently help as a tutor in a couple of physics courses each year. 

I would recommend you look at the course information and e-mail a couple of the lecturers teaching the courses you are going to take. Find out what the pre-requisites are, what the recommended texts are and what the courses will cover. They might even be able to give you the e-mail address of a student in the year above you to help answer your questions. Then just have a little flick through what the syllabus will cover. It isn't uncommon for courses to have their own webpages somewhere that you might find previous assessments or lecture notes.

In the UK we grade a course with either a first (best), 2i (read two-one), 2ii (two-two) or a third (worst), it is sometimes possible for people who don't pass enough to finish with a degree with honours to get just a 'pass' with an ordinary degree. These grades usually sit somewhere around 70%, 60%, 50% and 40 % respectively. 

I think Sussex 'expects' 40 hours a week of work. I imagine how much students actually work varies around that number wildly. If you do study that much there is a every chance you will succeed. 

I have heard that sometimes American students at the same stage of a degree say second year can find it initially a bit difficult. We don't often have requirements to do courses outside of our main discipline, a physics student for instance will essentially study nothing but physics or something physics related from day 1. That being said plenty of American students spend time in UK institutions and as far as I can tell they are just as successful as their peers. 

Sussex University campus is on the outskirts of Brighton but the place is small enough that you can get to the city centre within 25 minutes by bus, train or bike. Brighton might be small but it punches well above it's weight in terms of things to do. It is also close enough to London that you can easily get there for a weekend. 

All of the other questions you have are subject to variation and you should speak to somebody in the school you are joining. ",0,1406149566,null,0,false,0,cj5u93w,t3_2bizem,t1_cj5u93w,t3_2bizem,null,1434865455,2,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,2

Driving new vehicles, you burn less fuel and the maintenance is a LOT lower. Also, maintenance is often included (bar wear-and-tear, such as brakes) which can save you from unexpected garage bills.

The downside is that it requires credit. If you lose your job, you can hand back the vehicle but that would dent your credit rating (and you won't have anything to sell).

You could go down the route of buying a banger, just be careful that the car doesn't cost you more in the long run in fuel and maintenance.

It all depends what you're after. Are you only interested in how expensive it is to run? Are you willing to compromise on size? (Maybe a Fiat 500 or similar would suit you then).

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;&gt;There already is a better way of allocating council bedrooms

&gt;What is it?

Councils and social landlords run their own allocation processes based on the local housing need, and the temporary and permanent stock they have available. They are more able to make a judgement then a one-size-fits all national policy. Typically they use a points system for the waiting list, and the [VOA size criteria](http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/publications/Manuals/RentOfficerHandbook/HousingBenefitReferral/Determination/s-roh-size-criteria.html) to match a suitably-sized property.

The bedroom tax affects established tenants, who might have been at the property all their lives, not just new tenants. The Lib-Dem amendment might change this. 

By comparison, private tenancies have had a working system for award weighting based on need for many years. - the Local Housing Allowance applies to new tenancies only. (and actually tends to be more generous than the 'old style' HB.). It is possible to get your private rent fully paid for a larger property, as long as its as cheap as one suitably sized. But, I digress.

&gt; indirectly market forces come into play. No one wants to pay the excess room penalty and so people look for ways to avoid it, whether downsizing, taking in a lodger or other means that haven't been considered.

That was the idea. [The report just released](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-the-spare-room-subsidy-interim-evaluation-report) shows clearly that this isn't actually happening as hoped though.

&gt;&gt;the bedroom tax just encourages movement between properties.

&gt;Which optimises use of available bedrooms.

Not really. There is now a situation in which -for example- a single person in need might previously be placed in a 2-bed property when it became available, thus housing that person, with one room left vacant.
Now the tendency is not to match them to the 2-bed, with the effect that 2 bedrooms are left vacant. 

Of course they have always tried to match the households with properties of the right sizes. There is nothing about the Bedroom Tax which makes that any easier.

&gt;Well, it potentially does reduce waiting lists if bedroom occupancy rates are optimised.

Maybe it would be so if the available stock perfectly matched the waiting list's needs. This is not the case though. You can't house two single strangers into one two-bed flat. One area of London, that i know, is getting a glut of 3-bedroom places which are hard to fill if children are not just the right ages for full benefit. 

As well as number of rooms, there are other factors like disabled needs, closeness to schools, stairs to climb, location.
Allocating to varied stock required flexibility. The bedroom tax adds rigidity, and does almost nothing good.

&gt;

&gt;In virtually all domestic and international club cup competitions, any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is ""tied"" to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition. This prevents a wealthy team still in the competition from gaining an unfair advantage by signing talented players from clubs that may have lost out in earlier rounds, in an attempt to increase their cup chances.

&gt;The rule applies to individual cup competitions, such that a player who plays in the English [FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup), but not the [Football League Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup), for example, is cup-tied only in the former competition. If the player signs for a new club in the same season, he or she is thus eligible for the [Football League Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Cup), but not the [FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup). [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) club football regulations state that, with very few exceptions, players who play in a European club competition are subsequently cup-tied with respect to all European football for the remainder of the season. 

&gt;The main current exception is the [UEFA Super Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup), contested by the winners of the previous seasons [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) and [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League). Representing a club in this fixture does not affect a player's eligibility. Similarly, cup-tying did not apply in any matches in the now-defunct [UEFA Intertoto Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Intertoto_Cup) before the semi-final round. Further, as per Champions League regulation 17.18, one player per club who would normally be cup-tied can be registered and eligible to play, so long as his previous club did not field him in the same competition, meaning that this player can represent two different clubs in the Europa League and Champions League. However, if the first club fielded him in the Champions League, but would later play in the Europa League through finishing third in the group stage, the transferred player is ineligible to play in the Europa League. This was the case with [Alan Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hutton), who could not play in Europe for [Tottenham Hotspur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.) following his former club [Rangers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.) entry into the cup.  However, if Rangers had come 1st, 2nd or 4th in their group, Hutton would have been able to play for Tottenham.  Another interesting case came in 2009, when [Real Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.) purchased [Klaas-Jan Huntelaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas-Jan_Huntelaar) and [Lassana Diarra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassana_Diarra) – both of whom had already played European football during the season for [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax) and [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.), respectively – during the winter transfer window. Because of UEFA rules, Madrid could only pick one player via regulation 17.18, and ended up selecting Diarra for their European roster.  Despite the rule, Real Madrid attempted to circumvent the restriction, to no avail.

Brendan Rodgers says he will continue to snub stellar names unless they fit the ‘right profile’ for Liverpool as he continues the £100 million reshaping of his side in the wake of Luis Suárez’s exit.
While some of the world’s biggest clubs pursue their obsession with marquee purchases, Rodgers says he would rather save funds than waste his money on vanity products.
Liverpool are flush with the largest transfer kitty in their history and are likely to have a minimum of eight new recruits by August, the next of which Rodgers hopes will be the Southampton centre-half Dejan Lovren and Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand. The London club are resisting an £8 million bid for Bertrand, which Liverpool believe demonstrates how much more of a title threat they are now perceived as being.
Loïc Rémy is with the Liverpool squad in Boston to become the fifth summer signing, following Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can.
Liverpool have been conspicuous by their absence in auctions for some of the stars of the World Cup, but Rodgers says his recruits were long-term targets, subject to diligent scouting and referencing rather than being assessed for their ‘name’.

“They are all big signings for us because they will all make a big contribution,” Rodgers said. “Maybe for the media there is guessing how we spend the money but you only spend the money if the players are there. What we can’t do is spend for the sake of it. The players we’ve brought in are players we wanted anyway.
“Our signings are strategic. They are not just names. They all fit into the purpose of the team, but of course we want them to make a contribution. If that means we do not spend all the money or the net spend is the same, then so be it.
“There is a responsibility [to spend well]. I have always said at every club I’ve been at, the club’s money is my money. I work for the club. I’m there to serve the club and run it the best I can on the field and work with the owners off it. They know I push for the best players to come in and they trust how we work. I would not pay more than a value. If clubs sense there is an opportunity to get more out of us it won’t happen. We are very unified in how we work in that way.
“There is money available but we know spending money does not guarantee success. Last January everyone was crying out that we needed more signings. We never signed anyone. OK, we might have done one or two but it was not a major factor in us not winning [the title].”
Lallana is the most expensive deal so far at £25 million, but Rodgers rejects the idea Liverpool paid too much for the midfielder.
“We paid what we thought he was worth,” he said. “I spoke to enough people about him and have seen enough of him, and know enough people who had seen him and played with him to know he would be a great signing for us. I have no qualms about it. The value of British players is always pushed up. We would not go higher than we thought he was worth.
“He is a great boy. The types of players we bring in have the profile we want so the transition should be smooth. Of course it is strange for them coming into a new team, but you see it with Adam straight away, he presses for the ball when he does not have it and he has beautiful balance. He can score goals and create goals. He is a wonderful footballer. I have been impressed by his mentality and character.
“The character is important. It is not just about the player, but the right type of person. I want players that are committed to the cause to make Liverpool the best we can be. I want players resting when they should be resting, training hard and working hard and focusing on their life as footballers. We have brought in those types. It is footballing qualities and human qualities we want.”
It remains to be seen if he can add long-term target Bertrand. Rodgers thought he had an £8 million deal in January, only for Chelsea to block the sale. The London club were unhappy at how little game time Victor Moses received at Anfield while on loan last season and that has made negotiations problematic.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Brendan Rodgers says he will continue to snub stellar names unless they fit the ‘right profile’ for Liverpool as he continues the £100 million reshaping of his side in the wake of Luis Suárez’s exit.

While some of the world’s biggest clubs pursue their obsession with marquee purchases, Rodgers says he would rather save funds than waste his money on vanity products.

Liverpool are flush with the largest transfer kitty in their history and are likely to have a minimum of eight new recruits by August, the next of which Rodgers hopes will be the Southampton centre-half Dejan Lovren and Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand. The London club are resisting an £8 million bid for Bertrand, which Liverpool believe demonstrates how much more of a title threat they are now perceived as being.

Loïc Rémy is with the Liverpool squad in Boston to become the fifth summer signing, following Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can.

Liverpool have been conspicuous by their absence in auctions for some of the stars of the World Cup, but Rodgers says his recruits were long-term targets, subject to diligent scouting and referencing rather than being assessed for their ‘name’.

“They are all big signings for us because they will all make a big contribution,” Rodgers said. “Maybe for the media there is guessing how we spend the money but you only spend the money if the players are there. What we can’t do is spend for the sake of it. The players we’ve brought in are players we wanted anyway.

“Our signings are strategic. They are not just names. They all fit into the purpose of the team, but of course we want them to make a contribution. If that means we do not spend all the money or the net spend is the same, then so be it.

“There is a responsibility [to spend well]. I have always said at every club I’ve been at, the club’s money is my money. I work for the club. I’m there to serve the club and run it the best I can on the field and work with the owners off it. They know I push for the best players to come in and they trust how we work. I would not pay more than a value. If clubs sense there is an opportunity to get more out of us it won’t happen. We are very unified in how we work in that way.

“There is money available but we know spending money does not guarantee success. Last January everyone was crying out that we needed more signings. We never signed anyone. OK, we might have done one or two but it was not a major factor in us not winning [the title].”

Lallana is the most expensive deal so far at £25 million, but Rodgers rejects the idea Liverpool paid too much for the midfielder.

“We paid what we thought he was worth,” he said. “I spoke to enough people about him and have seen enough of him, and know enough people who had seen him and played with him to know he would be a great signing for us. I have no qualms about it. The value of British players is always pushed up. We would not go higher than we thought he was worth.

“He is a great boy. The types of players we bring in have the profile we want so the transition should be smooth. Of course it is strange for them coming into a new team, but you see it with Adam straight away, he presses for the ball when he does not have it and he has beautiful balance. He can score goals and create goals. He is a wonderful footballer. I have been impressed by his mentality and character.

Are you saying that long serving fans who have attended the most games and thus demonstrated the most loyalty, shouldn't get priority for tickets to the big games?

It's club policy to prioritise the most long serving fans for the big games, that's how you get tickets direct from the club for big games.

When someone who stands no chance of meeting that criteria gets a ticket through other shadier avenues, while someone who tries to get their ticket legitimately via the club but marginally misses out on their points total and doesn't get a ticket, that's unfair.

The only people who can't grasp this are people who wish to boil all supporters down to being generic clones, due to them not meeting said criteria or holding an inherent insecurity about their status as a supporter.

No two fans are alike. There was a stage where I was less deserving of a high profile ticket than another blue.

If an accident occurs around an ambulance, whether or not the ambulance is involved we have to stop and give insurance details to everyone involved. This is more time consuming than stopping for 1 minute to say 'please stop driving like this.' 

Someone who is following an ambulance has next to no regard for anyone, and will be unlikely to check mirrors and be anticipating whats ahead of an emergency vehicle.

It's so interesting to me that a 70 is an ""A"" translation.

But since those will be so different from what I'll be taking, I didn't know how to take his info. I think three of my courses will be ""Level 4"" and one ""Level 5"" btw, if that makes any difference. 

Alright good so this sounds very similar to my college experience so far in terms of studying/office hours/etc. I am hoping I can make fast friends with people in my courses. Are Americans generally well-accepted by British students? 

I will be living on campus yes! I am hoping to live in Lewes Court (the ensuite one) or Northfield, which is where the other guy lived and highly recommended. I'll find out soon. Living on campus was a must, for sure, I definitely would prefer to live with other British students so I can get a better experience versus living with other Americans or on my own.

true,fauxkaren,rose,Rose,"Ok. So let's start at the beginning. Classic Who. I don't think Classic Who is especially sexist. But as a television program as a whole, it's very much of its time. Sarah Jane had some great moments, and don't get me wrong, I love Jo, Ace and Romana. But I was kind of old fashioned in its storytelling so none of them got especially fleshed out and as a whole the show was a lot more episodic.

Flashforward to the resurrection of Doctor Who in 2005.

Rose Tyler. OH ROSE TYLER. HOW DO I LOVE HER. She's a wonderful character. And on a meta level, we get to see her in her family context which fleshes her out a LOT. Rose's story intersects with the Doctor, of course. But it's not necessarily ABOUT the Doctor. Her story is about being a young woman who is working a dead end job and feels like her life has no direction or purpose. Through traveling with the Doctor she discovers that purpose. I fail to see anything sexist about that. (Also in case anyone is interested, [one time I got super word-vomity about why Rose is so important to me.](http://fauxkaren.tumblr.com/post/92657189074/c-d-q))

Martha Jones had another great story. Martha consistently devalued her own worth, even though she was pretty fucking fantastic. It took traveling the world on her own for a year to realize, but once she did, she stood up for herself and got out of a situation that she knew wasn't healthy for her.

And then Donna, wonderful Donna. She was an older woman, which I appreciated,  but she still was kind of just... going through life. People around her told her that she didn't have worth and she believed it, but once someone believed in her, she really blossomed.

All three of the RTD era companions are fully formed people who have family lives and stories that are about themselves as individuals though of course they are influenced by the Doctor.

Things are a bit more up and down with the Moffat era companions. I think there was a lot of potential with Amy as a character and series 5 was pretty decent for her, but then in series 6 and 7, Amy herself was kind of forgotten about and the story seemed to be more about Amy as a mother to River and Amy as a wife to Rory. Meh.

River's story is one giant mess. We only see her life as it revolves around the Doctor. NOPE.

true,Morris_Night,k9,K-9,"&gt;Then it makes no sense at all delving into the letter of the line to make up your theories, as if that line supports it even a little.

I'm not sure what that means. I'm not making up theories, I'm just saying that the line is canon and has to be interpreted in a way that makes sense with what we know. Until the Valeyard is confirmed, then the traditional, original meaning, or the more liberal meaning are both possibilities.

&gt;What I'm saying is, only one character in the new show comes close to fulfilling that line, however that line only has meaning if the writer of whatever episode that might include the Valeyard decides it does. 

Yup

&gt; It's a 30 year old line written by someone who would have thought the show might not last one more year, let alone 30.  And it doesn't even reflect the original concept of the Valeyard which was changed during production.

Ok. None of that changes anything.

&gt;But if you are going to base your idea off the exact letter of a 30 year old line, you might as well get the line right.

I don't see how that's in dispute. I didn't present an idea, and I agree that the line should be quoted correctly. However, the word ""final"", in light of the direction the show has gone, is open to interpretation.

In all, I don't really understand what you're arguing.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Councils and social landlords run their own allocation processes based on the local housing need

This would be fine if we were starting from scratch, but we aren't. Many people have had rooms they haven't needed for extended period with no incentive to do anything about it. 

&gt; The bedroom tax affects established tenants, who might have been at the property all their lives, not just new tenants. 

This is a good thing. No one should be entitled to more than they need when other people have needs and are going without so that others can have more.

&gt; That was the idea. The report just released shows clearly that this isn't actually happening as hoped though.

It was always going to take time and there were always going to be problems administering the change, but that doesn't mean the change is wrong or shouldn't be done. These are arguments against how it has been done not that it should be done.

&gt; There is now a situation in which -for example- a single person in need might previously be placed in a 2-bed property when it became available, thus housing that person, with one room left vacant. Now the tendency is not to match them to the 2-bed, with the effect that 2 bedrooms are left vacant. 

I see your point, but on the other hand the single person now has the option of sharing the two bed place with other tenants either as a lodger or by taking one in. Failing that, they have the option of taking the two bed place and paying the bedroom tax. Any perverse incentives to keep the place empty if there isn't a demand for that size of property are exactly the sort of thing that the roll out is supposed to find and address.

&gt; Of course they have always tried to match the households with properties of the right sizes. There is nothing about the Bedroom Tax which makes that any easier.

The bedroom tax isn't supposed to influence council workers allocations, it's supposed to influence council tenants behaviour to do what they can to avoid the bedroom tax.

&gt; You can't house two single strangers into one two-bed flat. 

Yes you can and yes you should. You just need to ensure the arrangement is voluntary, whether by one tenant taking in a lodger or by providing a matching service along the lines of those that exist privately. 

&gt; As well as number of rooms, there are other factors like disabled needs, closeness to schools, stairs to climb, location.

Closeness to schools should not be an issue as children can and do travel. Disabled needs are already taken account of in allocating housing, the bedroom tax doesn't affect that any differently to how it would non-disabled people. 

&gt; The bedroom tax adds rigidity, and does almost nothing good.

The one good thing that the bedroom tax does is it discourages the spare room subsidy. If people are living in council property larger than their needs it incentivises them to move to a property more suited to their needs. If nothing is available at the smaller size then it is an inconvenience but one it is possible to do something about independently by taking in a lodger. For those that chose not to do that, the reduced benefit payment is the price they have to pay.",0,1406153044,null,0,false,0,cj5w4ug,t3_2bi1xk,t1_cj5w4ug,t1_cj5uc5n,null,1434866200,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm more disputatious than callous, in my opinion, but what really grates against me is people who  make comments like;

&gt;I don't give a shit what you think is acceptable; I think you were out of order and I don't want to discuss it further.

If you personally say something I disagree with, I wouldn't say ""Stop being a dick /u/Bethursz and I am ending this conversation here."" Hoping you'd stop what you were saying, or whatever.

Nobody's perfect and I'm far from it. But I'm not a terrible human being, I'm just opinionated and dislike being told I'm not allowed to share my opinions. Especially in open forum.

I'd rather everyone hate me than me have to not say how I feel for fear of offending someone (unless I feel what I was going to say was out of line) because the day that happens, I'll simply just stop posting here.

1. Celtic are perennial underdogs in Europe just due to the financial gap between them and most other Champions Leage teams. This is due to lack of Scottish TV money mostly. It means that a). we're a complete longshot to ever get close to being champions of Europe and b) when we do beat a massive club (like beating Barcelona 2-1 two years ago), it is absolutely completely magic. The thing to remember is that Celtic is still a massive club and one that is always greater than the sum of it's parts. In the days of the big clubs just spending stupid money on the best players, this is something that is refreshing, commendable and true to the spirit of the game. Also, Celtic is a rebel club through and through. It's also hard to find big clubs that don't have serious far right, racist factions of support, while Celtic support is all about anti-racism, the underdogs, rebellion, etc. Instead of focusing on hatred, we focus on equality and having a good time. Our goal song is an 80's dance tune. Also, Celtic are the only British club with proper ultras (Green Brigade). While they are not everyone's cup of tea, they have to be commended for having the balls to stand up for the little guy with political statements. They are also loud as fuck and provide great atmosphere at games. 

2. The fact that Celtic support are ""pseudo-Irish"". Rangers fans are generally proud British who support the crown and think everyone living in Scotland should do the same. 

3. The spirit of the club is more potent than any other club. We do more with less money than any club in the world and that's what makes Celtic magic.

I'd say Americans get on fine at UK Unis. There can be tensions around politics. Sussex has a reputation as a left-wing uni and many students can be anti US foreign policy. But if you are open to listen to different points of view and don't take yourself (or the US) too seriously you'll be fine. Plus you have that special sparkle that comes from being a bit different. One of my best friends was a guy from LA who visited for a year. We're still very good friends now. 

Watch out for the drinking. In my experience a lot of Brits your age will have had a lot of experience drinking to excess (many have been drinking since 14/15 years old). Unlike many US Unis there are many cheap bars on campus and a lot of socialising involves drinking. Don't feel you have to keep up - have fun but sail your own course. Esp. while you are still finding your feet. On the other hand, if things get messy it's not the end of the world - no-one should be massively judging you.

The sort of bonding that occurs between groups when you all embark on a tough challenge. The traditional aspect that you mention. That all sounds fairly interesting to me.

Rather than straight forward haha-funny moments, it was dark and black and twisted humour, that gave you time to find your feet in it.

To be honest I think if you saw it chronologically, the third season doesn't fit with the scene-by-scene canned laughter comedy of the first two seasons.

The roads are somewhat narrow but every major road has a cycle path painted to the side of the road and sections for cyclists to wait ahead of the cars at traffic lights.
Cycling two abreast is a pretty good way to get clipped by an errant wing mirror from a van or bus so overtake quickly and pull back in.

You should pass only one roundabout on your commute, stay on the outside as you go around it, the junction you are joining from and the one you are leaving from are two of the busiest and there will be lots of other cyclists so follow their lead.

You shouldn't have too many problems if you have cycled on the road before, just remember that the bigger vehicle always has right of way, you can argue but 20kg of bike loses to 1500kg of car every time. If you want to learn the signage pick up a highway code book, check amazon or blackwells/any larger bookstore in the city.

One last thing, the cycle paths tend to be closer to the pavement but be careful when going past busses, they can and will pull into a stop right infront of you, lots of accidents have happened with cyclists this way. Keep an eye on where the stops are and watch for indicators, the drivers are usually very good at indicating in but not so good at looking in the mirrors before pulling in.

I'd say we should give the guy a chance if he signs, cos the added pressure of fans on his back straightaway won't do his progress any good.

I can, but I'm fairly certain Daedaelouswhatever being a bloke in his 20s and a ""bit of a lad"" himself, wouldn't. We've got a decent rapport going over several months.

&gt;I also understand your frustration at the way nouser engaged you and then basically told you to shut up, but she has already explained her reasoning.

She did and I do feel bad for distressing her, however that's not my fault. I posted a comment to an individual, a third party then got involved and turned it into a shitfest.

&gt;Of course you shouldn't stop speaking just in case someone is offended, but perhaps you could be a little more understanding when what you say could very easily be seen as offensive

Again, see my first point. Also people make lots of jokes here and depending on a persons virtual social status standings in /r/theredlion they're either accepted or rejected. I know of two individuals who, if they said the same thing would be adored and admonished respectively.

&gt;rather than just shrugging and saying you don't care.

It isn't my duty to censor myself on behalf of what may or may not upset a person who isn't involved in the conversation. This is meant to be a ""pub"" afterall,  not bloody mumsnet.

&gt;I like you, Pete, I do, I just think you need to realise that it is possible to care too little about what people think of you.

I find it hard to relate to people who I don't know, especially online, which in turn makes it hard for me to care about what people think about me. Probably from growing up (from being 10-now) using 4chan and other anonymous sites or websites that allowed 100% freedom of speech including fairly vicious character assassination and any weakness was exploited and abused.

I like /u/girlwithnousername I really do, but if she gets upset because I make an innocuous dickish joke towards someone else, that's her problem and not mine.

You are severely underrating our midfielders due to their mismanagement in the past 2 years. Dembele for me can be the best central midfielder in the league, he has all the attributes for it and the right manager I am certain will bring it out. In Sandro we have one of the best tacklers in the league and he has improved his passing in the past couple of seasons as well. We have Lamela who has the potential to be one of the best. I didn't even mention Christian fucking Eriksen (had to come back to add him in). We've also got great strength in depth.

Again I see our defence as just as good as theirs, it's just been mismanaged. Kaboul has just the same concentration lapses as Koscielny, and has a lot of attributes where he is stronger than Koscielny. Vertonghen has shown glimpses and periods of form of an excellent defender and as long as he finds the right partner and system for him (certainly not AVB's high line) he could be one of the best in the league.",0,1406157303,null,0,false,0,cj5y8qs,t3_2birlk,t1_cj5y8qs,t1_cj5wmqp,null,1434867339,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

&gt;__Mafia__ ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Ма́фия, also known as __Werewolf__) is a [party game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_game) created in the [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR) by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986,  modelling a conflict between an informed minority (the [mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(disambiguation\))) and an [uninformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) majority (the innocents). At the start of the game each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: ""night"", during which the mafia may covertly ""murder"" an innocent, and ""day"", in which surviving players debate the identities of the mafiosi and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the mafia has been eliminated, or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.

And that's your answer. Look at the UK music industry in the 90s - thriving with Britpop, indie, dance &amp; trance. Some truly amazing acts that worked to get where there were.

2000s - Cowell's overblown karaoke competition comes along and the charts are infested with ballad-covering cretins and spunk trumpets like One Direction, Gareth Gates, JLS, James Arthur etc. Just awful bland crap. We still have the amazing talent that dominated the 90s but its buried among all these pub &amp; cruise ship singers that have been given a platform. Yes there has always been mass-marketed &amp; manufactured pop but pre-Cowell even that had more personality. The sooner he fucks off the better.

There'd also be the question of what would happen to the remaining non-UK bits of the team. Would they all have to form their own teams? Would they compete for England?

Defense isn't looking bad.  Naughton has been pretty solid, Kaboul and Milos have paired well.  Davies is good so far.  Very smart in when he gets forward.

Capoue is a fucking wall.  He basically stiff-armed Bekker to the ground at one point with what appeared to be no effort.  Mason has looked tidy.  Passing pretty well.

Front three behind Soldado has been good.  Lennon has been better than I expected.  Pressing a drbbling well, but he's passed decent enough too.  Would still rather see half a dozen other guys out there, but that's just because I'm stubborn.  Soldado has been good.  Still making runs, though they're getting ignored.  Hold up play has been good, two assists were great.  Enough can't be said of Lamela.  &lt;3

I certainly agree that ridiculing is often healthy but we need to look a bit more closely. My point was not that ridicule was bad; my point is that if you think the CofE is *only* good for a joke then you haven't quite grasped it.

A lot of young people today are very happy with the idea of ridiculing religion--not in itself a bad thing, there's a lot that's amusing--but they are unable to see the other side. They cannot actually make sense of Anglicanism. 

I think there is always danger afoot if people are prepared to dismiss out of hand something they do not understand (whether religion or something else).

true,TheBatPencil,null,null,"The Celtic Football Club was the brainchild of a Marist brother by the name of Walfrid, who envisioned the club as a means of raising money for the (predominantly Irish) poor of Glasgow's East End (who lived in conditions of outrageous poverty even by Victorian standards) and as a way of bringing unity, pride and celebration to a community that faced widespread discrimination through representing them with passion and success in football; then a sport quickly growing in popularity among the working class.

These core principles - social justice, community, passion and celebration - have been passed down through generations of Celtic supporters for the last 126 years, have been taken by those supporters around the world and have taken root in every corner of the globe. The Celtic family is one built on those ideas, and in the belief that Celtic is the medium through we choose to express them.

Celtic has it's roots firmly planted in Ireland, and our Irish heritage is something that celebrate we freely and proudly. But Celtic was also built on the idea that we would be a club open to all; in the words of Willie Maley (Celtic manager of 43 years), ""it is not the creed nor his nationality that counts, but the man himself"". From Glasgow to [South Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloemfontein_Celtic_F.C.), from [New York](http://www.jackdemseys.com/) to [Tonga](http://www.scotsman.com/sport/more-sport/other/glasgow-2014-tonga-boxer-is-die-hard-celtic-fan-1-3486393), the Celtic family encompasses those of all faiths, nationalities, colours and creeds. Celtic is a means through which supporters express who they are, and what their fundamental beliefs are; Celtic's story and support inspires such passions.

The Celtic support is the heart of this club; without them, there is no club. To quote the late, great Tommy Burns, Celtic is not just a football club, ""it is a people, and a cause"". Their commitment to Celtic - and their belief in excellence on and off the pitch - is what drives Celtic.

This includes their commitment to attacking, entertaining football, and an expectation that Celtic have the courage, pride and passion to stand toe-to-toe with anyone who enters the pitch at Celtic Park, whether it be Rangers or Real Madrid, Brechin City or Barcelona. This has driven Celtic to the heights of sporting excellence for the last 126 years, whether it be Willie Maley's 6 consecutive championships from 1904 to 1910, or [Barcelona](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20150451) or [Seville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bhoys_from_Seville), and all the way to the [greatest day of them all](http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1967-05-25%3A+Celtic+2-1+Inter+Milan%2C+European+Cup).

Celtic's rich, celebrated and almost mythological history is laced with such magical moments. Celtic's uniqueness is in the details of its history, whether it be glory or tragedy and adversity. Celtic's football history is legendary, but the history of the people and community that bares its name is where its magic truly lies.

The passion, commitment and camaraderie of the Celtic support is world renowned, and are responsible for making Celtic Park one of the most famous and celebrated locations in World Football. Tonight, a **billion** people worldwide got to see our stadium at its most glorious, and got an insight into why we call this place ""Paradise"".

&gt;Blind dismissal is as bad as blind acceptance because it is blind. It is not thinking. It does not seek understanding.

And what evidence are atheists blindly dismissing?  I mean, it would be one thing if God dropped in for tea and lemon cake every day and atheists decided that they were simply going to ignore his presence.  But, the reality is that there's not even a tiny shred of evidence to support the God hypothesis. There's nothing *to* understand because God doesn't actually exist.  You might as well accuse people of 'blindly dismissing' astrology or tarot cards.

I personally wouldn't want a Doctor played by anyone without a UK passport - beyond that, any gender/sex or ethnicity is fine by me. I'd also be happy to have more companions from outside the UK - hopefully from a Commonwealth country, rather than the USA though. 

Will it happen? I'll rate these in order of likelihood:

1. A British Irish or Welsh actor - could easily happen, no-one would really bat an eyelid. I remember [James Nesbitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nesbitt) being speculated about as a possible 11. 

2. A non-white British actor - I would be surprised if we get to 16 and we haven't had a non-white Doctor. You'd have problems with [no equal opportunity time travel though](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEqualOpportunityTimeTravel) and without a good show runner who knows a) history and b) race and ethnicity issues, I could see things getting *problematic* in a bad way.

3. A female Doctor - I would be happy with it, I could see it happening, but I expect for it to happen this side of 20. If we get a non-white Doctor in the next 2-3
regenerations I think we'll probably have to have a couple of straight White guys afterwards just to cool things down again. 

I see the Doctor in the same category as Shakespearian roles. If Paterson Joseph can play the [Duke of York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_%28TV_film%29), he could certainly be the Doctor. If Harriet Walter can be [Julius Caesar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Walter) she can be the Doctor. 

From an in universe perspective: I have a head canon that all Timelords have the [gender identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) ""Timelord."" The sex of any body they might get in a given regeneration is secondary, an not a core part of their identity. Male, female, black, white, ginger, not ginger - these are all things that a Timelord might hope to be (or not) based on their own aesthetic reasons, but are incidental to their identity as ""The Doctor"" ""The Master"" ect. 
If the psychology doesn't work that way, I don't see how they wouldn't get some kind of [Body dysmorphic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder) even just regenerating from one white male form to another.

Hardly surprising - if he rated Agger, we wouldn't have thrown 17m at Sakho, we'd have brought in a younger left-footed CB to cover for Agger. If he rated Skrtel, he wouldn't have dropped Skrtel for Carragher after Oldham in 2012-13.

I maintain that if we'd brought in Sakho earlier last summer, Skrtel may have left. As it turns out, we didn't, he didn't, and he played well enough that Rodgers kept him in the team. But that doesn't mean he's the ideal CB Rodgers wants.

""British Women at War.  A British woman officer or non-commissioned officer can and often does give orders to a man private. The men obey smartly and know it is no shame.

They have stuck to their posts near burning ammunition dumps, delivered messages afoot after their motorcycles have been blasted from under them.  They have pulled aviators from burning planes.  They have died at the gun posts and as they fell another girl  has  stepped  directly into the position and ""carried on.""  There is not a single record in this war of any British woman in uniformed service quitting her post or failing in her duty under fire.

Now you understand why British soldiers respect the women in uniform.  They have won the right to the utmost respect.

Here in Aus we had very little exposure to epl or football in general (still called soccer here) when I was growing up. And it is still the case really. It wasn't until I started playing football manager that I really got into it. I still have soft spots for other teams because of this. 
Im not sure if it is the same in the states but our major football codes (rugby league, aussie rules) dont really have the rivalry that english football has imo. There are teams that are universally hated but other than that, most people have a second favourite team like you're talking about. (But not arsenal, never arsenal).
I'll probably get shutdown for not being a ""true supporter"" but im ok with that. 
On a related note, anthropologist Desmond Morris suggests that passionate sporting rivalries are a throw back to days when tribes would battle one another and that sporting teams provide an outlet for some primative desire for battle. He makes this argument as a bit of a joke but there are times when I can see value in it.

First half we looked fantastic.

Capoue looked incredible - man mountain in midfield with fantastic distrubtion. If he can have a season like his Toulouse days he'll be like a new signing. Davies was very solid considering - and he was up against the fastest guy in the MLS I heard) Thinking of Lloris, Vertonghen, Chiriches and so on being in the side is EXCITING. Reallly excited by our side.

Second half - Dawson needs to go. Fryers is medicore, yeah he was our 5th choice CB after Vert, Chiriches, Dawson and Kaboul. But it was painful. Cebellos looked very energetic, keen to impress. Holtby was decent, Rose actually crossed the ball. Kane was just a...6. Carroll showing his mediocrity, he's good but he'll be a low EPL/Top Championship player at best.

The MPS (who you refer to as the MET) is a vast organisation, employing tens of thousands of people,  with good parts, and bad parts.

To support them blindly, as you appear to be doing, is to fail to understand the reach, impact and overstep of the MPS, and the reach politics has into their actions. 

Be proud of the difficult, important and hard work the front liners do. In the main, they deserve it. 

But be critical of the bizarre and wasteful work that goes on around the edges of the organisation. 

Its your money that gets spent spying on these families, and to say the families deserve being spyed on because the MPS killed or otherwise harmed their family is just madness. And by the way, it costs *a lot* of money to mount a survillence operation. Money thats not being spent going after metal theives or whatever ""low impact"" crime is en vogue at the moment. Money that at the time was in short supply (and probably still is) as the MPS's budget was stripped by around ~22% over five years, five years ago. 

&gt;These protesters who continually attack our brave police have little to no respect for law and order. The dirt in their lives deserves to be dug up just as they do their best to find the tiniest piece of dirt in the police force.

This is simply assinine. The ""dirt"" in the individual lives of someone whos brother, or mother, was killed by an organisation whos sole purpose is to uphold the law simply does not compare to the taking of that entirely innocent life. (I'm specifically thinking of the de Menezes family here.) 
  
I worked for the MPS when the inquiry into the de Menezes killing came out. I read every word of report, and was thorougly disgusted (but not suprised) by the lack of culpability taken on by the MPS for Charles's death. Specifically by Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, who was the Gold Commander in that operation. Pages of the report cover the specifics of how even though she was informed the suspect ID was faulty (as Charles left his home) she was not at fault for not acting on that information.  

If it had been your brother that was killed in those circumstances, I expect that you would be keen to see the MPS held to account, and would do everything in your power to do so. I also expect that you would not anticipant being surveilled by the MPS, one can only presume to attempt to discredit your protest.",0,1406164051,null,0,1406164527,0,cj61dv2,t3_2bj7mi,t1_cj61dv2,t1_cj5x04q,null,1434868874,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

With Carroll, I think it's all about who he's paired with.  Having Capoue next to him would've made a big difference.  He needs a destroyer who can let him focus more on his passing from deep.

He's like Pirlo in that way (obviously an overstated comparison, but still).  He can be easily shut out of a game and overwhelmed, so he needs an energetic tackler (Gattuso, Vidal, Pogba) around him to do the dirty work.

Plus, you can't really compare the talent he had around and in front of him to the guys who were on the pitch in the first half.

The rest of the road is a derelict factory that got burned down a couple of years ago (arson), a skate park, a church and a basketball court. It's also a dead-end road that leads to a park. It's the best spot in town to buy or sell drugs. They practically come along the road like ice cream trucks except they're blaring rap music and lots of kids huddle around them asking for their drugs. 

Since police can't chase people in cars off the end of the road it's a good get-away spot for drug dealers who have been stung or caught in the act.

There's also some gang violence. Nothing too serious usually but there have been stabbings. One time we had 4 cars explode in the space of 5 minutes... luckily nobody got hurt. My neighbour's apartment was raided a few years back because he was involved in a notorious drug gang. He killed himself recently and I assume it was because he was afraid of them.

Graffiti flourishes like flowers, every day I can wake up and look for something new! Then there's the Jeremy Kyle-esque arguments and the ""YOU SLEPT WITH MY DAD!"" drama. One time I phoned the police because a girl was being assaulted by her boyfriend in front of my house. I was called up as a witness in court and at the last minute she decided to drop the charges. Great.

The most fun is when Air Ambulance lands in Mill Road Park (right next to us) because somebody's been jumped and gravely injured.

Miraculously our shit has never been messed with, except once when my mum's sat nav got nicked. Nobody's tried to break into our house, our cars have been untouched. I'm grateful for that. It's the only good thing we have to say about living there!

If you're ever in Kettering at night, stay the fuck away from Carey Street and Mill Road Park.

Yeah... I miss Corby. It was so much more peaceful to live there! I lived in places like Roulette Road and Occupation Road though, which wasn't so bad. At one point I lived in Angus House in the town centre, that was a bit grim. But it was also near a police station if shit went down.

Lambert struggled to get in to the game, mostly because of delivery I guess, not sure what to think of him, as I never really saw much of him at Southampton either, so time will tell. 

Feel bad for Borini though, was probably his one chance to prove himself, if he even had that chance, and he ended up injured.

Not convinced, sadly. We're obviously looking their somewhat with the Griezmann, Depay &amp; the funny Draxler link. I don't think Konoplyanka is the answer either, I'm not sure why.  

&gt;What do you guys think about the offense this game?

First half I loved it. Lamela/Soldado and Eriksen seem to be turning into a formidable front 3. We just need that final piece of the jigsaw and Lennon/Townsend and Chadli just isn't it.

&gt;What do you guys think the lineup will be next season?

Not sure. Lamela/Eriksen/Soldado for sure. Kaboul actually looked fit as hell like he gained a yard of pace - if he can sort his injuries out I would love to see a Kaboul/New signing (not Dawson) Verts/Chiriches back 4. 2 pure brutes, 2 ball playing defenders would be perfect. 

Capoue looked great. I mean, he was fantastic with Toulouse so maybe the Schniderlin move might not even be needed. Dare I say it, I love Sandro - but I feel his injury haunts him and he's said himself the 50/50's might be risky or words to that effect - maybe sell him and get Schiderlin. Rose played well, and is decent backup to Davies. Either one of Paulinho/Dembele has too go (they didn't play, but that's just my gut feeling). Nabil I think will have another great season too.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"Like RifleEyez said, Chadli and Lennon won't cut it. Chadli's a great option off the bench, but he's not starting XI material. 

Looking at our front three, the two out of the three that played today-mainly Eriksen and Lamela-have bags of pure technical talent. Griezmann would complete the trifecta nicely, but if that's not possible, maybe give Ceballos occasional chances and try for Depay. If none of those work out, we can always look in La Liga for the kind of winger we need. 

I've got to say, I've been very impressed with how Poch have set out the teams. The second goal is a preview of what we'll get next season, I think-Eriksen passing to Soldado, while Lamela times his run perfectly into the box to take a shot and grasb the goal. Obviously, there are other ways to score a goal, but the link up those three had is going to be crucial next season. 


&gt;What do you guys think about the offense this game?

It's going to involve those three and one other technical winger. Someone who's played in a team with a heavy emphasis on one touch play and is comfortable across the front three. Griezmann sounds so ideal for this role, the hype...

&gt;What do you guys think the lineup will be next season?

The obvious Vertonghen, Lloris, Eriksen, Lamela, Walker and Davies aside, I think all other spots are up for grabs. We'll have to see how Paulinho plays against Celtic and Shalke, and then Dembele too. I don't have much hope for fitting into Poch's system, but they at least deserve a shot.

true,HedgeProg,null,null,"Ace at least had her own costume, like the Doctor, &amp; didn't have to change her outfit every episode, unlike Rose. Rose, Martha, Donna aren't well-fleshed out characters. Just because their families get too much screen time doesn't mean that's character development. Ace's character was well fleshed out especially in the last season (literally every story is about her). They did it back then without all the kitchen-sink drama crap you'd expect to see on Coronation Street during the uneventful summer months, unlike during the RTurD ""era"". Muppet thinks character development is seeing the companion as a little girl.
The companion's of the original series were individuals. They didn't have to be plagued with a bf of sub-intellect, or a love interest. Even Donna starts out at a wedding &amp; isn't ""whole"" again until she has a man in her life (a romantic interest). All the women of the new series have to have some kind of romantic attachment to some man at one point or another, otherwise it's always talked about how they are single. They can't just be individuals, unlike passed companions.
Amy's episodes were Eleventh Hour (very Girl in the Fireplace, except without the reciprocation) &amp; Beast Below. After that, she was just a 5th wheel for the rest of series 5, or not even on screen for most of it (The Codger). Amy could have had potential, if she had stayed a little girl. But Muppet made her from the promising 'Amelia the police officer' turning her into 'Amy the kissogramm'. Also Muppet made it clear in an interview that he hired her because she was ""gorgeous"" (i personally fail to see it) (first he was unsure when he saw a pic of her face, which looked too chunky for him).
As an example of synecdoche, 'legs' becomes Amy's epithet. Something which would never ever happen in 20th century Who, not even in the very early 60s.
Martha Jones - the only woman in the universe that Casanova didn't fancy. Who does she end up with at the end? That's right, Mickey. She's got a PhD, &amp; he's even too dumb for that simpleton, Rose. They've got NOTHING in common, oh wait, apparently they belong to the same ethnic group &amp; that's all you need. RTurD isn't just sexist, but racist too. Oh dear. Also, who could forget that remark about Vietnamese children in Torchwood: Children of Earth? Oh, that's right - everyone.

I pay just over $2,000 for my Jacksonville Jaguars season ticket.  Its a club section but its certainly not the best or most expensive ticket.  And the Jaguars have been one of the worst teams in the league for the last 5+ years.

Also consider, the Jaguar season ticket is for only 7 home games (not 8 b/c of one home game in London), plus 2 mandatory preseason games.  That's about $285/game.  At WHL a season ticket gets you 19 home matches.  That means even the most expensive season ticket at WHL is only $170/match.

true,apinkknee,null,null,"Got to see some beautiful sun at BMO today and thoughts on player performances:

First half:

- The Kaboul-Milos pairing did well, but when they were caught out,  Capoue really did well to step in and deal with the situation. Milos wasn't amazing, but with Capoue's effort in front, he looked good. 
- Davies first 45 minutes for us looked good. I thought he looked smart in position. He noticied opportunities to push up the left flank and spread out the back four. TFC had to pay attention to him and compensate; he also dropped back when he was suspicious possession would be turned over. Not bad for his first 45 mins in Poch's system. 
- Rose was more attentive to his defensive duties today then we've seen in a long time. Not crazy from him and compared to Daws and Zeki, represented well. 
- Holtby, as much as I love him, was pressing like a mad man and I couldn't decide whether Poch has him running like a steam train out of control or that he and Carrol weren't communicating who to press properly. His workrate was impressive and did lead to some dispossessions, so there's that. 
- Carroll: Distribution was solid. He took over Capoue's role (as far as I could tell) and looked like he did fine. I don't think he looked comfortable enough to play PL yet, but cup games maybe give him 30 mins to see how he develops. Not bad showing, besides the ghastly interceptions he allowed. 
- Soldado: He, Lamela and Eriksen linked up together and if we're going to be awarding him for holding up to let Eriksen/Lamela run on, then he did a fantastic job. If not, I sort of forgot he was there. 
- Lamela: CONFIDENCE. My god, the man has confidence. You could see it in his runs and in the quick flicks, he was comfortable. Poch has given him freedom to be creative in possession and get back to RW when defending. Good showing. 
- Falque: Eh. Workrate was fine, I suppose, but couldn't get anywhere of use. 
- Ceballos: Took too long with his decision making. Wasn't overly happy with him.
- Townsend: Greedy a few times, tried to out-pace the fullbacks and rarely did anything I cared for. Appeared to make poor decisions. Poch may have him limited in his tricks, so for all I know he may have had a good showing. 
-  Mason: Barely noticied the kid. Made a few successful passes. 
- Kane: Didn't think Kane played great, but he was definitely instructed to hold the ball up and let Townsy/Holtby/Carroll touch on. Never worked great. He has the size though and he looks promising.

He's so good he gets poached by someone ""bigger"" or offering a better chance of winning trophies/being paid and he's not good enough so he goes to a lesser club (or takes on a reduced role at a club of similar stature).

While you can never predict the ebb and flow of someone's career, I think the likelihood of either of them leaving for another ""big"" English club are incredibly unlikely. 

English players rarely leave but both are so dynamic I can definitely imagine other top clubs around the world throwing offers their way every few years. If we stagnate or if they win enough trophies with us maybe they'll want a new challenge.

Perhaps one of them loses form and loses their place. Well then they might go. 


It's really hard to say. I think it will mostly depend on what they're willing to do. Both play in positions that it can be hard to age out of. Ryan Giggs is one of the few top attackers who adjusted his game to remain at his club. Often times you see guys lose their pace and then end up going to a lesser side to finish out their career.

But I agree - we should be aiming to pick up those talented players &amp; kids from teams just below us if you like. Not quite there, but very close too. Like the Stuttgarts, Udinese, PSV/Ajax, Zagrebs of the world. Players like Maxim (Stuttgart), Bruma (Gala) - maybe not Quintero as I think Porto want to keep hold till they get a 40m bid no doubt - like you said. Plus I bet it's some crazy Third party thing too. I would actually consider Griezmann (Sociedad) as one of those players, same as Depay, but their stock has risen so high I can see Bayern/Chelsea or whatever coming in for them even if they won't be first teamers.

We *kinda* did that with players like Chiriches, arguably Steauas best player. Lloris from Lyon. Chadli came from good stock in the Eredivsie. Eriksen/Jan from Ajax. Modric from Zagreb. Berba from Bayer Leverkusen. A bit more of that please Levy! No doubt we'll end up selling them in the future - and while it's nice to keep hold of our players at least when they do go we usually end up with a MASSIVE profit and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

true,lostbeyondbelief,logo,,"The Good:

Kelechi is going to be something special in a few years. He should be a strong performer on the EDS squad this year.

Zuculini has shown a lot of skill and potential in his appearances with City.

Scott Sinclair has been surprising in the last few friendlies. Hopefully he's earned himself another chance.


The Bad:

I'm not sure how many more chances we can give Boyata. His goal was nice, but he's been poor defensively against such powerhouses as Dundee and Sporting KC B Team. He's nowhere near Premier League level right now. If City intend to keep him for the future we need to find him a good loan where he can work on reading the game and using his physical abilities to impose himself defensively. Given the potential of Rekik, Nastasic, and Mangala (hopefully), I think it may be best to part ways with Boyata.


As much as I love him, Micah Richards needs to go. With Zabaleta, Sagna, and even Clichy (on his weak side) being better choices at RB, Richards won't be seeing the pitch often, if at all.

Good as usual: Delph, Westwood, agblonlahor. Loved seeing these guys in person for first time.

Surprisingly looked really good: Richardson, Bennett, N'zogbia. Richardson played from the midfield as well as bacuna and really looked decent. Richardson more so than bacuna.

Still not sure if they can make it: Bent and Senderos were outplayed. Just looked a gear behind everyone else. Enda Stevens made a few really poor stabs leaving the back wide open. Good teams would have capitalized.

Grealish really made the attempt to go forward on the pitch and looked amazing at times. He did however make the most turnovers probably.

Yes, I agree, this argument probably does apply to any example of culture which has stood the test of time. And it does so legitimately. Things which endure generally have reasons for doing so. That doesn't make them right nor does it mean they should be preserved; but it does suggest that there is enough going on to merit examination.

I'd move Gylfi to the left simply because in the first lineup, I don't trust Shelvey's defensive capabilities as much as I trust his attacking abilities.  Then in the second lineup, I moved him over so Bony and Gomis could pair in a one striker formation.  I really like the possibility of having Shelvey, Sigurdsson, Gomis, and Bony working together through the left side.   The only complication is that if we do sign Montero, he'd have to play on the left, which would shift things around.

What is weird and exciting to us may be boring and run-of-the-mill to him. What is scary in the frightening sense might be thrill-inducing to him. He picks and chooses bizarre opposites very carefully, and then plays them completely straight. It makes him look nuts sometimes to us, but his consistency (and the batshit crazy Tom Baker expressions and delivery) sells it as stability; it reinforces that it's just who he really is.

I love the idea that nobody can ever get truly close to him. Not necessarily because he'll always keep a distance, but because the gap itself can never truly be closed because he and his race and his experiences are, at their root level, so foreign to us. 

Therefore, there's no ""reading"" him and being 100% sure of your safety while he's around.

true,YoungFoxyandFree,present,null,"That is partially true, but, again, the Confederate flag means much, much more than that to those that display it. Like I said, those people are in no way suggesting that slavery should be revived. The Confederacy's main grievance going into the war was that the abolishment of slavery would destroy their way of life (agriculture-based economy). Its a technicality, but the point here is that the war was fought over slavery as an economic issue rather than a moral one. So, yes, the flag once represented an autonomy that rebelled to keep slavery alive, but the flag has long outlived the Confederacy as a symbol of southern culture. The Reconstruction period laid waste to life in the south, obliterating them socially and economically. They believed they were being robbed of their dignity and that the punishment did not fit the crime; it was natural that southerners sought to hang onto their cultural identity. Obviously they were on the wrong side of history in an astonishing way, but at the time not only was the institution of slavery believed to be ordained by God (and it should only end when dictated by Providence), but the ""science"" of the day also said that black people were genetically inferior to, and thus depended on, the white race. Furthermore, there were some southerners (including Robert E. Lee) who disagreed with slavery, but felt it was not the federal government's place to intervene. So to some it was indeed about state's rights. Today this sounds utterly ridiculous, but that's the way it was.
&gt;I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone. --Abraham Lincoln, 1858

Even Abraham Lincoln held similar views; he just didn't go so far as to believe black people should be enslaved. Northerners were no saints when it came to race relations, their economic livelihoods just didn't depend on them.

You could also argue that the American flag has just as many, if not more, racist connotations than the Confederate flag. Several of the founding fathers who signed the Constitution (which included a clause that said a slave was only 3/5 of a person) owned slaves, the American flag flew above ships carrying black people from Africa to the US, Native Americans were herded onto reservations, the US government rounded up the vast majority of Asian-Americans during WWII and put them in concentration camps, etc. Yet the American flag is flown proudly as a symbol of freedom? England supported and participated in slave trade as an economic mainstay, yet the English flag is flown at every Chelsea match. There are countless more examples around the world of cultures acting immorally throughout history and in the present day, but for the most part those cultures have other redeeming qualities associated with them as well. The South is no different. Racism is despicable, but it certainly isn't inherently southern or American; its everywhere. Its a human condition of extreme cognitive bias that we have yet to evolve past. 

Unfortunately organizations like the KKK do still hold a lot of these dated views and their use of the Confederate flag as a symbol of those beliefs sullies its reputation, but its not fair to say that everyone who displays the flag supports racism. Are there people who still believe themselves to be racially superior? Of course, way too many in fact, but that is not all (or even the most important thing) the flag symbolizes to them and to many it has no racial connotations and minimal, if any, political connotations (although some do use it as a symbol of rebellion against a strong federal government, similar to the way the Tea Party uses the Gadsden flag). To them it represents the way they live: the food they eat, what they do for fun, the music they listen to, the art they like, their literature, the sports they play and the teams they support, their education, the way they talk, their religion, and any other customs or traditions specific to or originating from the region. 150 years ago slavery was also part of that culture (as it has been in many cultures), but it is not part of the modern-day southern ethos that the Confederate flag symbolizes to those who display it.",0,1406177384,null,0,false,0,cj67aa6,t3_2biuks,t1_cj67aa6,t1_cj5xuky,null,1434871795,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Half the people we ""pinned hopes on"" were going to shit teams into their early 20s. That was all you needed to know about if they'd come good.

Ilori and Suso are going to have top flight careers. Will they reach their potential as many have deemed it? That's down both to their mentality, their work ethic, and the opportunities afforded them. Jack Rodwell could've been a top CM for England. I genuinely believe that. He chose Man City. Adam Johnson could've been a top winger. He chose Man City. 


I don't think you can argue that right now we have an incredible crop of kids coming through, but it's not that hard to differentiate between the ones who will make top flight careers and the ones who won't. I'd say there are very few players who exist in between those.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"First off, Coutinho is only 22-years-old and he still has *a lot* of room to grow and progress and he's certainly a player has the talent and intelligence to do that.

Coutinho certainly dazzled when he first came to Liverpool. But that summer, I was always wary about how many just assumed he'd slot right into the starting XI and would continue to dazzle. My general feeling was that Premier League defences would adjust to him, Coutinho would have to adjust to the rigors of the Premier League, etc. and he wasn't necessarily a lock in the starting XI and there would certainly be some growing pains.

Last season - judging from the comments in this sub, etc. - I feel as if the attitude regarding Coutinho were a bit mixed.

However, I think *this* season is the season where Coutinho will truly shine. He has a better knowledge of the rigors of the league, a better understanding of the different clubs, an understanding with his teammates and with Rodgers and what he desires on the pitch and in training, a comfort with the Liverpool culture, etc.

And now I feel as if this season is where it all comes together for Coutinho. Not necessarily in a POTY sort of way but still in a tangible sort of way.

true,Tyrannosuarez,null,null,"Game starts amid thunderous United chants in Old Trafford, with defiant Liverpool supporters singing You'll Never Walk Alone. A bogus/fluke United goal gives them the early lead. United try to play cocky attacking football to pile on the lead, but frequently lose possession easily to a disciplined Liverpool midfield. Liverpool fight on, controlling the game for most of the match with some close chances, but can't seem to find the equalizer. Gerrard comes on in the 65th minute (having been rested for a crucial CL match) to replace the hardworking Joe Allen. Henderson jogs over to give Gerrard the armband; Stevie gives him a wink in return, and the search for the equalizer is on. On the 75th minute, a Sturridge effort from close range is blocked, and the rebound ends up at Stevie's feet. Utd players lunge to block his shot, anticipating a right-footed cannon. Stevie fakes the shot to his left, and half-volleys the ball with his left and it's a wondergoal off the post! 1-1 and the game is on.

United try to counter but their attacking efforts are feeble and extinguished quickly. Brendan goes for the jugular, bringing on Rickie Lambert off the bench for a tired Coutinho, with Sterling moving to the no. 10 role and Sturridge drifting out wide. Just past the 80th minute, a fantastic dribble by Lazar ""the beam"" Markovic results in a Liverpool corner. Stevie's inswinging corner is met by Skrtel who flicks on, and who else but Rickie Lambert at the far post to nod in the potential winner!! United fans go silent while ecstatic Liverpool chanting can be heard miles away. 2-1.

The players calm themselves as there are still ten minutes to play on. United's paltry attempt at a comeback is laughable; they'd played defensively for so long in the game that they forgot how to attack, leaving gaping holes for counter attacks.

Fellaini tries to play it up from the back but is quickly dispossessed by the lightning-quick Sterling in true David-vs-Goliath fashion, who deftly gets past the defenders and cuts it back to Emre Can, who scores his first away goal for Liverpool. 3-1.

The ensuing United kick-off is true comedy as a miscued back pass is intercepted by the all-out sprinting Sturridge. The score is 4-1 after a simple one-two with Sterling and a cool curling finish.

The camera lingers on distraught United fans in the foreground, with jubilant Liverpool supporters seen in the background. The clock shows 86:30 when the camera quickly switches back to the sudden action on the field. After intercepting a long ball forward, Flanno finds Gerrard not twenty yards in front of him. He sees De Gea off his line, and in one smooth motion, turns and fires a sixty yarder towards goal. De Gea is caught in no man's land, 5-1.

United players look broken and beaten. Their touches get heavier by the second and Liverpool are feeding on this. A superb Henderson through ball to an unmarked Sturridge, who drags two defenders and the goalkeeper away and eventually finds Markovic for a tap-in. 6-1, United have completely lost the plot.

The fourth official is merciful and signals injury time of only 2 minutes, but Liverpool aren't done yet; Enrique bombs down the left flank and delivers a cross to Lambert. The cross is behind him as all he can do is head it back to an oncoming yellow shirt... It's none other than the captain Steven Gerrard, whose thunderous right footed shot from 25 yards out hits the top of the net! Stevie gets his hat trick at Old Trafford and it was a top, top goal to make it so. 7-1, the ref ends the game at the following kick off.

true,Bazzatron,null,null,"My £0.02.

&gt;Cost of living. 
Rent can vary depending on where you stay. I did my first year in South towers (cheapest accommodation) where £65/wk got me shelter, warmth, water, Internet. I moved to Greenstead with my fiancé in second year, where we pay £495/month rent, £40/month electric, £25/month Internet, £10/month council tax, £20(?)/month water (so we'll say that averages £75/week if we each pay half and there are 4weeks in a month) 

Food can be anywhere from £20-35/week per person. But this depends on how extravagant you are, how well you plan and how much booze you buy. If you shop online, make a meal plan, and stick to it - you'll likely stay under budget. I always buy things impulsively when I go to shop in store.

Something to consider - watching live television (on a TV or your computer) requires that you buy a TV licence. This is something like £100-£200/year. I honestly don't know, as I don't watch TV. But you'll need to buy one if you want to watch *live* television. If you just plan on watching downloaded shows and streaming services like Netflix and BBC iPlayer (the latter is mandatory, especially with the new Dr. Who on the horizon.) you won't need one. 

&gt;Rural/urban 
I grew up in the countryside, and Colchester is definitely *not* like that. The town centre has a wide variety of shops and things to do, and it's fairly easy to walk there, I got a bicycle from the re-cycle (charity, used cheap bikes) and it takes me about 15mins to get from campus to town. Bit of a hill-climb, but it's not too bad. Campus is a bit of both. If you sit in the squares, you'd have no idea that you were surrounded by acres or fields woodland. UoE is very much, perpetually, under construction. So the amount of visible Park seems to be shrinking. There's still plenty of green about - but it's more on the Wivenhoe side of campus. You'd need to be almost leaving to really see it. 

&gt;CompSci 
Uni is very much self taught. You'll be hitting the books and staring at code in your dorm a lot. That's the bulk of your learning. Lectures are supposed to fill in the gaps from the textbook and classes are supposed to help you turn that book knowledge into a feel for practical application. A buddy of mine made a tetris game for his first project, and his 3rd year project was an augmented reality mapping app for android. You will get out what you put in. So as to whether classes are good? You tell me. 

&gt;theatre club
Yes there is, and it's very alive and well. We have a live theatre on campus called ""the lakeside theatre"" and the society puts on performances there. I'm not a member myself so I've no idea on the actual workings, but if you PM me I can put you in touch with someone who is. Your best way to find out is to just really get stuck in to fresher's fair.

&gt;WiFi
Our campus is pretty saturated now with a network called ""eduroam"". I work fairly closely to the networking team in IT and those guys have installed so SO many wireless access points in the last year. Pretty much anywhere on campus has a good level of WiFi coverage. Thanks to some internal politics (the library seemed to be overseen by a technophobe who told us that he didn't want WiFi in the library at all, as libraries are for books.) the library is just starting out. It's perfectly serviceable, but it's an old building with lots of signal grey spots - give us time, it'll be good probably next year ;-) 

&gt;Other great stuff. 
The student's union, for all of their shortcomings, run a scheme called ""frontrunners"" (which they may have completely fucked up just recently -  *sigh*, I fucking hate the SU, some new textured wallpaper in your office and insisting that we're all family, like some sort of creepy cult, does not a new SU make.) where you can apply for a job on campus, the SU will pay your wage and the university will give you the opportunity to gain work experience. All looks good on your resume. I did this in my first year, and it actually turned into a nice little part time job that I've been working at ever since. Pays more than tesco and I get to write nifty stuff on my CV. ^yeah ^I ^said ^nifty, ^what ^of ^it... 

There's something for everyone on campus, and there are plenty of events. Just check the calendar on the SU website, get involved with societies - you'll have a great time. 

If you make a friend in the right place. I've just seen our CompSci department had a giant fucking robot delivered to the networks building. I'll upload a video of it and edit this later, but it won't be a high quality video ;)

true,verygneiss,null,null,"OP, your question has (at least) two answers: other posters have already addressed what a 'college' is in the English education system, i.e. an institution for secondary education for 16-18 year olds. This difference does not apply in Scotland, where secondary school runs from age 12 to 18 (you can leave at 16 - 18). Undergraduate degrees typically last 3 years in England, with the exception of medicine (5-6 years) and undergraduate masters (4 years) degrees (I'm not sure about law).

A 'college' in Scotland is an institution which is part of the FE (further education) system, whereas a university is part of the HE (higher education system). A Scottish college is therefore somewhat equivalent to a US community college: they teach a mixture of vocational (plumbing, building, joinery etc.) and academic (HNC, HND etc.) courses. Universities in Scotland can be divided into 'ancient' (founded in the Middle Ages or Early Modern period) and 'modern' types, and this reflects differences in governance and subjects offered - the ancients tend to be more comprehensive.

I really don't understand this desire that so many people here seem to have to make the Doctor suffer.  He has had so much of it since the Time War.  During the early years of NuWho he was burdened by the loss of his people and world, then by the loss of Rose, then his daughter, and Donna.  His time with the Ponds was better, but still rather bittersweet.  He became a part of a real family, but it still had a great deal of hardship: Rory died, then Amy was kidnapped, Melody was taken from them, he married River knowing that he had already failed to save her life.  All of those events took an emotional toll on the Doctor.  The Doctor reached his limit in ""The Snowmen.""  We saw it when he was telling Strax that the lesson he had learned was that the universe didn't care.  It's time for him to understand just how wrong he was about that. There is more to life than pain, guilt, and suffering.  It is time for the show to shift it's focus towards the joys of life (but not ignoring the bad things).

You'll hear the same tone comes from Joe Allen, Sturridge here, Sterling (go back to a few MOM post-game interviews with him), even Luis last season; Brendan is making our players lose their identity as an individual and gain the identity of 'the team' or 'the club'. This takes the pressure off a little.

I didn't really pick up on this team tone from the players until the start of last season. Sturridge is the posterboy for it though, he is the ideal player under Rodgers system. He's dynamic, he's arrogant on the ball, he loves to win, and say what you want (if you still allow yourself to love players in the modern game), but he really has taken this opportunity and ran with it. 

Look how many young talents we have - that have gotten the taste of being in a side that have barely missed the title - and are now competing in Europe. Sturridge and Co., will only get better from here.

I'm so impressed by his mental toughness more than anything. It is that toughness that will allow him to improve and fight to improve and assert himself on games.

If he can sort out his shooting (Will the lad ever miss to the right? He should start aiming for the right corner flag and maybe he'd hit the target!) and attempt to add some killer balls when he drops deep into midfield he's going to be a real player for us.

As I've maintained on this sub all summer, the only difference in our front 6 this year for our first 11 should be the substitution of Lallana for Suarez. With the depth of our bench we should always be able to get a goal after the 60th minute or tinker depending on how the other team lines up.

I kind of think digitising everything for education is a real inconvenience, I tried doing notes on my laptop at uni but got annoyed when I didn't have my charger with me or was not near a socket and so my notes are worthless, yes paper may take more space but it is much more convenient and I have to be no more careful not to damage my notes than I would my laptop, recently my rulebook for a tabletop game was on my tablet and only on my tablet, now i have lost the chargers its bloody useless (I should have spent £15 more and got the hardback).

New car a good route if you get a bomb proof main dealer warranty i.e kia just expect it to devalue as soon as you drive it off the forecourt.

However if its your first car you've got to go down the classic mini route you will learn how to fix everything yourself and find a huge social network of mini owners willing to help you out.

If you run a wee banger then you can do something more useful with your cash while you build a no-claims bonus.  If anything goes wrong with it then it's cheaper to replace the car than most partson it. You don't need to worry too much about keeping it in better condition than your shed.

true,hotcod,null,null,"The US doing it by state basically lets local administrations run the risk of the change which shields the national level politics from any damage or fall out. The result is that at the national federal level and especially in the executive, they can choose to play both sides by basicly remaining neutral until there's enough consensus in state law for them to justify change federal policy. If questioned by conservatives a liberal executive can still claim to be waging a war on drugs but also acting to respect state rights, basically exploiting that conservative hypocrisy of often legislating morality while claiming to be libertarian. 

To put it another way it would be political suicide for a US president to trying an attempt a top down legalisation of Marijuana but they can dance around a bottom up legalisation done state by state (instead of clamping down on it) by passing it off as an issue of state rights until a critical mass is reached and a national level decision needs to be made. It's basicly how they are getting close to universally mandating same sex marriage in an over all very religiously conservative country.   

In the UK however we don't have the same level of local power to which the national level politicians can devolve the responsibility to so for a change like this we need a will from the ruling party, or Prime Minister, to push for the change. For all the other shit to be said about Cameron we can not take away the fact he was a driving force between same sex marriage being legalised during a *conversation parlement*... while the will of the people was clearly in over all favour at this point I don't think anyone could have expected to see that happening without a more liberal party in power. 

Strangely I think that sanily dealing with drugs, which has to start with the legalisation of weed, is going to be a harder fight and I don't think a Prime Minister or leading party (or senior coalition partner) is going to risk making a move on this any time soon.

&gt; C# &amp; MS-SQL

C# is a fine language and MS-SQL an excellent database, but ultimately it's a closed platform and therefore more of a niche skillset as far as web developers go.  If you were looking for PHP + MySQL skills then you'd have ten times (at a guess) the pool of candidates to chose from. 

Obviously that doesn't help you if you're tied to C#/MS-SQL, but it might explain why you're not getting many candidates.  Maybe try broadening the criteria to look for people with HTML/JS and *any* kind of back end programming language/DB experience?  A reasonably smart PHP/MySQL developer won't have any problem picking up C#/MS-SQL with some training and guidance from colleagues, books, web sites, etc.

£35k doesn't seem unreasonable for a web developer in Lincoln (I don't know what the cost of living in Lincoln is like, but I assume it's got to be cheaper than the South East).  A similar job in my part of the world (Surrey) is offering £45k - £55k which sounds about right for these parts:

http://www.jobsite.co.uk/job/csharp-developer-surrey-gu19-951042213?src=search&amp;tmpl=lin&amp;sctr=FI

So perhaps £35k is on the lower end of what you might have to pay to attract someone, but I don't think it's too far off the mark.

Then after a few minutes the traffic clears and then they accelerate back up to 80mph and again hit the rear of the bunch and have to slow down again.

true,p4rus,,CO5,"Honestly, I don't think there is going to be a cheap option, and not just because you'll be making 3/4 return trips across the Atlantic. Romford's not exactly a tourist area so it's a little short on hotel/BnB options. 

Unless you're able to find a short term house/room/etc rental that you're confident of (other replies have recommended places to check for those) you might be better opting for a chain hotel where you can be assured of the standard you're getting. Sure, there may well be some independant hotel/BnB in the area that's a fantastic cheap hidden gem, but I really doubt it. Ideally you'd be able to stay with your GF, wherever she's staying...

Off the top of my head, in Romford town centre there's a Travelodge on Market Link/St Edward's Way and a Premier Inn attached to The Liberty Bell on Mercury Gardens. Both of these are national chains, probably aiming for the business market, and of the two I'd recommend the Premier Inn based on my experiences elsewhere in Britain. I wouldn't think there are any similar accommodation options in Harold Wood. It's a suburb of a suburb. 

In terms of Travel, the whole area is part of the London Borough of Havering, so you'll make savings with an Oystercard. Can't really help you there - don't have an Oyc and don't live in the London area - but the TFL website should be a good start. It's easy to get from Harold Wood to Romford on train or bus.

You could also look at a hotel in Brentwood. It's the next town out along the same line, and a bit nicer than Romford. You'll probably pay more for accommodation though, and you'll pay more for travel as you're outside the London zones.

If you end up in Romford town centre of a Fri/Sat night, I'm sorry. That said, the Golden Lion on the Market/South Street crossroads was a decent pub last time I was there a year or so back, in what is pretty much Romford's sole remaining old building.

Agreed. The other thing that fucks me off, especially with the M1, is that they open the hard shoulder up to traffic when there's congestion, yet I see one or two cars using it. I see people rushing to get out of it when it's clear by the big flashing sign that says ""CONGESTION USE HARD SHOULDER"" with the speed limit also sitting above it that you can use it.

Then there's the ongoing cost of converting documents - despite what some assume, you *don't* get to dictate to users what systems they create their documents on outside of the council, which means you have to either run copies of Office specifically for docs that don't convert, or pay someone to fix the issues on a permanent basis (and even then, they're not going to be able to rewrite certain macros that were embedded in an Excel doc, or adapt docs that were specifically created with code for 3rd-party apps). And ultimately, apart from the warm-fuzzy-feeling achieved from using open source, there is no *tangible* benefit from using a document format that nobody else uses. There just isn't. And if your council told you there was going to be a council tax rise, would you rather the money go on social services, or something similarly vital, or the above? It's not something any council is going to be able to justify.

Support - this is a major cost too - no Corp or Council is going to deploy under the assumption that some coder somewhere 'might' be able to fix their problem - and the yearly support costs from the likes of RedHat aren't cheap.

Then there's the issue of using the actual software itself - when a new user starts work, you have the advantage of not having to train them in Windows or Office (because everyone uses them).

true,Keskekun,null,null,"One interesting thing I notice in this game is how Poch seems to want to play, it's alot more prominent here than it was at the sounders game.
The DMFs and FBs are connected. If the DMF goes forward the FB stays back and vice versa. Capoue has been used as a playmake for most of the game meaning that he has been forward alot more than naughton. While on the other side it's the opposite. Mason has barely moved forward in the slightest meaning Davies has had plenty of space going forward.
So one thing he has done is moved the playmaking down to the DMFs and I think the reason for that is that the three attacking midfielders are completly fluid in this system. Lamela - Lennon - Eriksen have been moving from side to side all game. Lamela seemingly being the pivot point going wherever he pleases and Eriksen and Lennon moving to fit that. It has required a ridiculous workrate from Lamela but also for Soldado that has had a really thankless job this game of patching the holes from the three fluids behind him. I think that this game they have been told to just let the creativity flow and that in the end Tottenham will be slightly more rigid because as it is now our striker has a completly thankless task ahead of him and thankfully Soldado is a team player and even when he gets the ball in the few situations he gets he does the play that is the best for the team. In this case grabbing the assist. I am worried if Adebayor has the attitude to work that hard for others.
It seems like an approch that is very much focused on hardwork and tagging off the hardwork to someone else when you recuperate. Mason tags of Davies, Erisken tags of Lennon. Soldado obviously doesn't have to work hard on the opposite side of the pitch. Except Lamela that is just constantly working like a dynamo. Since Lennon is sadly past his prime going for Griezmann seems a very natural thing indeed.

You're not _necessarily_ offering the wrong amount for the job, but it does seem a little low.   The guys I know who would be suited to what you describe - competent full stack developers with 5 yrs experience -  (living up north too) were all on variations of 40-45k.

Bear in mind too that _crap_ candidates literally do nothing except apply for jobs they're not qualified for.   So even if you're doing things right, expect a poor-to-good ratio of at least 100:1.

You may well be doing this in the ad already, but it's why many postings would likely list ""30-45k"" rather than ""circa 35k"".   Put the number in there that you'd actually pay for your ideal all-star developer, because you might just attract them.    It will hopefully give you more quality people through your door and then you can use your discretion on their skill/performance to make a suitable offer within the range you've advertised.

But honestly, I think the person you've got your mind on is currently at their desk working hard earning 40k+.   Ask yourself why would they look at your ad?",0,1406196447,null,0,1406200404,0,cj6c32v,t3_2bkqkq,t1_cj6c32v,t3_2bkqkq,null,1434874022,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"It's more to with the pre-2010 environment and post 2010 environment for all the parties. It's also do with there not only being 100 or so seats changing hands (between parties) but a large amount of mps from all parties chose to retire around that time. 

Leading up to Cameron's election to the leadership of the party (and also subsequently) there was a feeling that something had to change. Theresa May quite famously noted that voters had seen it as 'the nasty party' and Lord Ashcroft commissioned a major study into voters attitudes and beliefs. When asked about whether they supported a policy (whether it be on immigration, death penalty or whatever) a lot of respondents tended to have a similar response to what was official conservative policy. Now here is the interesting bit, when voters were told ""the conservative have the policy... (insert same policy as before)"" the response was resoundingly negative. It was clear proof that the conservative brand was the thing that was most damaged and trying to get as close to the public mood on issues was not the answer, their biggest problem was changing how the public viewed the party. This paved the way for the Cameronites, a moderate force (within the Conservative party) with a friendly face. To this day Cameron is still much more popular with the public than his party is (the reverse is true of Labour). Cameron took the approach that New Labour did by proposing similar spending plans to the government and a more sharper focus on what they had dubbed ""broken britain"", tackling major social issues instead of any radical departure on economic ones. 

Now there are a number of reasons why the conservative party has drifted to the right since then which I will now try to explore. The credit crises and the growing public deficit and debt (economic issues were now on the forefront of everyone's minds and couldn't be ignored), the 2010 intake of Conservatives (a large number of mps either retired because of age or the expenses scandal and about a 100 new mps joined the party as a result of the swing in vote), backbencher satisfaction and the rise of UKIP. Now what is particularly interesting about the new intake is that they are more anti EU, more eurosceptic, more thatcherite and more willing to throw their weight around. It's worth noting that this is one of the most rebellious parliaments in some time (backbenchers more likely to defy the government line). Now there are many reasons that backbenchers in the conservative party are dissatisfied, the lack of promotion and prospect of promotion is certainly a major one. Not only is Cameron less willing to shuffle ministers out of departments every year unlike his predecessors (and to his credit I might add) but the fact that they were unable to win a majority meant that the LibDem had a significant portion of government posts. Many backbenchers who thought they would have posts of responsibility after the election found themselves empty handed and with very little opportunity to change that. Now explaining the rise of UKIP and its effect on backbencher and conservative party attitude is a bit more theory crafting and which I might explore a bit later. I need to eat some food before I try to tackle this and I haven't touched the other two parties yet.

Dembele is easily our best CM, it's not even close. I don't know how that places him as our third best.

Ramsey is an equal passer, better finisher, worse tackler and less creative and just as hard working as Dembele.

So the site had been hacked and then people were using it to provide references to all this stuff.

Eventually the legit website ends up on a blacklist because of this.

Sometimes the entire website gets hijacked to host porn, and then ends up on a blacklist.

Sadly, it's the smaller websites run by less technical people which end up being hacked and blacklisted.

He is the only truly creative mid we have, everyone else is a bag of different abilities, but he is 9/10 on creativity level.
  
The funny thing is if he focused on his composure he could have had tons of goals he missed from the box rather than all the shots from outside he misses. If he goes back to taking some chances, but mainly focusing on creating chances for others, I doubt anyone would be able to bench him.

But now, I thought that anything you can do through lightning, you can do through USB, including video etc, with the appropriate adapters. Is that not correct?

As for robustness, I have not have issues with any of my micro USB devices so far, but that's purely anecdotal. Is the lightning really more robust? In that case, they really need to update the USB connector standard to something better, and everyone can make the switch.

I don't dislike the lightning connector. If it is superior to micro USB in every way, then let's all adopt it! I suspect Apple would not allow others to use the format though.

To me, making a switch is not a big issue. Every new phone will come with the new cable anyway right? Once a change happens, it'll filter through very quickly.

Yeah, because no one under 18 EVER drinks alcohol... tbh I think if it were legalised it would make it be far far more easily available and so more under 18s would probably take it.

The Premiership has been won by one of three teams for the last decade: United, Chelsea, City.

The Bundesliga either Bayern or Dortmund, with the odd exception like Wolfsburg.

France was Lyon for years, with the odd interloper, until the Arabs bought PSG. So that will be the team, along with possibly Monaco to win that league.

And Spain is an obvious Real/ Barca duopoly, as it has always been, unless an exceptional manager like Benitez or Simeone has some short-lived success with Valencia or AM.

true,theartofrolling,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"&gt;Yeah, because no one under 18 EVER drinks alcohol... 

That's not what I said. I'm not delusional, there will always be under-age drug users and to think you'll ever stop that completely *is* delusional. But the fact remains that it is quite a bit harder to get alcohol than it cannabis when you're a teenager. For example, The Netherlands has far less teenage weed smokers than us, for a few reason, but one being that you have to be 18 to buy the stuff. In fact, their entire population consume less of it than we do.

&gt;I just think LSD in general shouldn't be taken by everyone as it can bring up mental problems, and so I think it shouldn't be widely available in shops etc, however the government should turn a blind eye if people take it as it's just silly to punish people for it.

I think the dangers of psychedelics on mental health, while very real, are exaggerated quite a bit by the media and people's ignorance. That said, I agree psychs should not ever be easily obtainable on the high street, not just because of risks to mental health, but because of the unpredictable behaviour they can cause.

&gt;Mental health problems

&gt;There is growing evidence that people with serious mental illness, including depression and psychosis, are more likely to use cannabis or have used it for long periods of time in the past.  Regular use of the drug has appeared to double the risk of developing a psychotic episode or long-term schizophrenia. However, does cannabis cause depression and schizophrenia or do people with these disorders use it as a medication?

&gt;Over the past few years, research has strongly suggested that there is a clear link between early cannabis use and later mental health problems in those with a genetic vulnerability - and that there is a particular issue with the use of cannabis by adolescents.

&gt;Depression
&gt;A study following 1600 Australian school-children, aged 14 to 15 for seven years, found that while children who use cannabis regularly have a significantly higher risk of depression, the opposite was not the case - children who already suffered from depression were not more likely than anyone else to use cannabis. However, adolescents who used cannabis daily were five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety in later life.
 
&gt;Psychoses - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
&gt;There is now sufficient evidence to show that those who use cannabis particularly at a younger age, such as around the age of 15, have a higher than average risk of developing a psychotic illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
These studies also show that the risk is dose-related. In other words, the more cannabis someone used, the more likely they were to develop a psychotic illness. Furthermore, a study in Australia recently showed that those who used cannabis could develop the illness about 2.70 years earlier than those who did not.

&gt;Why should teenagers be particularly vulnerable to the use of cannabis? It is thought that this has something to do with brain development. The brain is still developing in the teenage years – up to the age of around 20, in fact. A massive process of ‘neural pruning’ is going on. This is rather like streamlining a tangled jumble of circuits so they can work more effectively. Any experience, or substance, that affects this process has the potential to produce long-term psychological effects.
 
&gt;It is also known that not everyone who uses cannabis, even at a young age, develops a psychotic illness. The available research shows that those who have a family history of a psychotic illness, or those who have certain characteristics such as schizotypal personality, or possibly have certain types of genes, may increase the risk of developing a psychotic illness following the regular use of strong cannabis.

Just be prepared for all weather,  we rarely get snow, but yes it will rain! I'm not sure what part of the US you're from but it can be quite cold during the autumn and winter. And as you can tell from this post, us Brits do live discussing the weather so I'm sure you'll work it out quickly!

Gloucester Road area was the best though, anywhere from right down in Stokes Croft up to the top near Muller Road or Ashley Down Rd. Montpelier also. St Pauls is alright, it gets a bad reputation but it is fine as long as you aren't right in the depths. I would avoid Easton though, it is a bit rougher and it is not easy to get places using public transport I find. Gloucester Rd has loads of pubs, independent shops, bars, cafes, St Andrews Park and stuff going on, plenty of students around. Just a short walk or bus down into the centre.

People put all their money into trusts etc to avoid it anyway. 

The logic of ""some kids are born with nothing, therefore no one can be born with anything"" is terrible too. Wealth inequality may not be fair but just taxing everyone of everything when they die is stupid and unworkable. Being born into poverty is obviously a bad thing and a real social issue but it is completely irrelevant to inheritance tax.

Liverpool have not really been a great team these last few years and the game needs to rate Liverpoolplayers as to not make the overall of the team to high. Everyone knows Suarez deserved at least 90 before last season, but if he got 90 Liverpools attack would've gotten a much higher overall than what our placement in the table the previous season suggests. We have had a lot of good players these last few seasons, but our club haven't been stable, and it's hard to transfer tactics to and squad depth to an overall in a videogame. 

At least I think that's their reasoning.",0,1406203149,null,0,false,0,cj6dhq1,t3_2bl4or,t1_cj6dhq1,t1_cj6dags,null,1434874757,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5
