true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; Why is agriculture in scotland meaning higher prices for the UK?

This is *their* argument, that supplying ""farther flung"" stores will cost more and without UK-standardised prices there would be disparities. However, in many cases it's the English consumers that are farthest from the source. 

&gt; How do you think exotic fruit doesn't cost the earth.

""Exotic fruit"" is not a stable used to produce bread, beer &amp; sugar, most of which is sourced from the UK. 

&gt; why would a UK household chose more expensive scottish produce over cheaper french produce

Well, if that's the case in the future it's certainly the case now so what exactly is your point? Which goods produced by both Scotland and France are cheaper from France?

No, they haven't. I dare you to find me an actual direct quote to back that up. Deliberate misquotes by pro-union media outlets don't count.

I think the show serves a purpose as an introduction to issues, but can fall back on the idea of it being in a certain comedy format to mean it doesn't have to be covering all bases.

Perhaps in this case we have more of a vested interest and naturally know a lot more than on other issues in different episodes, where I have actually been taught things.

Rolando Maran could be a decent shout. He seems low-key enough to be the sort of coach Cellino would go for, although he at least has Serie A experience (albeit with relegation candidates Catania - who we bought Doukara and Bellusci from). I also remember reading that he's happy to work with Cellino and has been trying to get Massimo to consider him.

Sabella seems like a much too audacious move for Cellino to make: he's high profile, unlikely to accept listening to Cellino's demands, and simply unlikely considering that Cellino thought Steve Clarke would be too difficult to attract to Elland Road. I can't really see Trapattoni happening either.

Quite frankly, I'm just glad that Cellino has seen the light and understood that taking Redfearn away from the academy would do more harm than good. The academy is where his heart really is and, to be honest, I think that's where his talent lies too. We need a proper first team manager or head coach, who can really get good results out of senior players.

The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution.

No. Read the list of reserved matters, a broad spectrum of labour and social policy is there.

&gt; Devolved powers give Holyrood wide powers to alter taxation - but it chooses not to use them.

A single very limited lever on income tax only is a very weak power over taxation. Look at the powers of a U.S. state or Canadian province. The can create or destroy taxes, have their own VAT, corp tax, income taxes etc. The Scottish Parliament is funded by a block grant.

&gt; Not in currency union you don't

Funny how U.S. states and Canadian provinces issue their own bonds being in currency unions. And EU countries.

&gt; You have this anyway - you can vote on issues in Holyrood AND westminster.

Westminster is sovereign. The Scottish Parliament is a limited devolved body without sovereignty. It cannot claim any new powers - it must be granted them. If Scotland wants to change something (as it does) it needs to ask permission.

Maybe later in the season we'll be be a little bit stronger as all the new signings fully integrate, but at this point in time we are worse than we were last season and we still dont have anyone in the team who can quite flip a game over the way Suarez can, and did for us with alarming consistency.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"The changes I'd apply are:

* No more than 20 hours per week. The jobseeker still needs time to actually seek jobs too.

* Only charities should be allowed to apply for the scheme. They will be asked to offer roles in a variety of types, like retail, sorting donations at warehouses, and administration (of course with some geographical restrictions, just because of where stuff is).

* The government pays the workfare person their full jobseeker's allowance, in addition to the apprentice minimum wage (£2.90?) for hours worked for the charity up to 20 hours per week.

Why these changes? Well, limiting it to charities removes one of the core criticisms of the scheme at the moment: that it replaces paid workers at profit-making organisations, thus reducing available work and saving big business money at the government's expense. If people are working for charities instead, they're helping organisations that aren't profit-making, with a net benefit to other people around the country and around the world. Also, working for a charity has a feel-good factor which will help boost the claimant's mental state.

I've opted for the government to pay extra money to participants, because it would be unfair for the charities to do so when they are reliant on donations and volunteers. However, since this will increase government spending, I've picked the apprentice rate as a compromise between paying minimum wage and not paying at all. It means that for the claimant, it's still worthwhile financially to participate, but it limits the extra cost to the taxpayer of doing it. It also means that getting an actual job is financially worthwhile for the claimant, because a full time job paid at adult minimum wage is an increase in income.

I'd also propose that anyone on JSA more than 2 months is encouraged to work up to a maximum of 8 hours under the above scheme (including the £2.90/hour rate), but it's not mandatory. Anyone who has been on JSA for 6 months+ has a mandatory 8 hours, maximum 16 hours on this scheme (and when I say maximum, they can work more if they want to, but won't get paid for extra hours). Those on JSA for 12 months+ have mandatory 16 hours, maximum 20 hours a week.

The way I see it, this would be a win-win-win situation:

* charities get more people helping them

* the government doesn't subsidise profit-making organisations, but rather charities that help people

* the overall spending on JSA might increase a little compared to now, but not as much as paying claimants NMW would, and in the long-term, since claimants will be less likely to suffer mental health problems, it could result in reduced healthcare spending and claimants finding work more quickly, thus a net budget benefit (or at worst, no net change).

* the claimant gets some recompense for their work which increases their weekly income.

* the claimant is financially motivated to get a proper job, and thus cease being suppoted by the taxpayer, without being treated like a slave

* the claimant gets feel-goods from working for a charity, giving their mental state a boost and making it easier to feel positive about prospects.",0,1410794845,null,0,false,0,ckixm5w,t3_2ggcb2,t1_ckixm5w,t1_ckiuses,null,1427001945,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Every one of the top four squads last year gave up points to a lower-table team last year at some point. We just need to minimize that tendency, and we definitely brought in the personnel to do that for this season.

And I just meant shallow from the standpoint of having enough quality up front that we can rotate in players and really not lose much. Luis is the only depth option we have in the back 4 that most would agree wouldn't reduce the overall quality of the squad.

A 3 will be one of the worst games the player has had. 2 means they will be sold as soon as possible. 1 reflects a career threatening performance--it questions the player's ability to play at a professional level.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Here's the problem we all face. Currency union *is* dangerous, there is nobody really disputing that *but* the alternatives are far worse for all concerned.

Most of the press on this issue seems to take a very Scotland focused view of it. Scotland gets *x* then *y* will happen. They are written on the assumption that Scotland will go off an have its own little personal disaster while the rest of the UK just plods along laughing at it unaffected.

This isn't true. 

The UK is skint. Absolutely pratted. We are over £1.4 *trillion* in debt but we're continuing to borrow at a rate of roughly £60bn/year to prop up a currency value that doesn't reflect the economy of this country *purely* because we have a colossal financial industry that relies on a strong pound to not come crashing down itself.

We run a trade deficit of 4.4% (one of the worst in the industrial world), that is we sell 4.4% less value to the world than we buy from it, we spend more than we make essentially. The proper way to deal with such a thing is to devalue the currency, your products become cheaper on the world market, exports go up, equilibrium is established and you work on building the currency value back up.

Not in the UK. We can't devalue our currency because companies like RBS sell money itself, devaluing the money devalues their business. That shouldn't be a problem, fuck their business right? **Wrong**. These banks are so huge, so in debt, so global, so on the line and so intwined in our society that the slightest movement could quickly lead us to a situation where the taxpayer has to write another £65bn cheque to bail them out. 

So ignoring Scottish independence completely the UK is stuck. Huge trade deficit, too reliant on banks that are too reliant on our artificially inflated pound. Our credit rating has slipped, we are on the verge of dropping down across many agencies which means that £60bn we borrow every year would cost even more. We're currently creeping back toward a sensible position at the pathetic rate of 0.1%/year, we're not *really* building a stronger economy that'll make this position easier we're just saving a penny here or there to stop it getting worse.

Now you have to ask yourself, what happens to a country in that position when something like North Sea Oil exports, some £~30bn/year, is removed from the balance of trade? Where does that 4.4% deficit move to? 7%. Scotland is a net *exporter*, we're one of the only parts of the country in that situation pushing that 4.4% back towards 0 instead of dragging it the other way.

A country cannot operate on a 7% trade deficit. rUK would have to borrow something in the region of £90bn/year to cover the difference and it would have to do it at higher rates (because trade deficit impacts credit rating). 

If the UK is on the fiscal cliff *now*, dropping to 7% gives it swift boot in the arse and off it goes. Currency devalues, banks collapse. These repercussions wouldn't just stay within rUK though. As I said, these banks are global stinking heaps of shite and they are looped back on themselves. RBS owes JP Morgan who owes HSBC who owe RBS. They're all just buying *nothing* off each other 50 times over. Independent Scotland is the first to get smacked by it, we're the most connected to it.

*This* is why money was sucked out the system on that 51% poll. The markets aren't ""*retreating to the UK*"", they are retreating *from the UK* on the basis that Scotland becoming independent will hurt the whole thing. The money went back in NOT because the banks revealed they'd move to the safety of the UK but because the markets think that announcement increases the likelihood of a no vote. 

I **guarantee** you that on Friday morning, after a yes vote, money gets sucked from every single corner of these islands. Money men don't like *change*, they especially don't like change to already fragile entities. They'll put their billions in America or China or wherever until this blows over.

Currency Union stops all that happening.

----

So what are our choices? 

* Create our own currency, get in to a huge amount of debt in the process and shrink our economy. Get dragged into the financial hole alongside rUK the new trade imbalance causes. Likely recover faster but it would still be a huge setback.

* Sterlingisation, where the above happens and we just ride it out with no ability to accrue debt and no inflation control.

* Euro, where the above happens, we have no control *and* we get tied to a ECB that's an even more fragile currency union

* Or Currency Union. Where there's a wee wobble from the separation but not the trade deficit black hole so no crash. Yes we'd have very minor to no control over fiscal policy but at least it would be with a UK that has a vested interest in keeping both ships floating.


It's 4 shit choices but three of them come with economic crashes, so we're only left with currency union. I personally still think independence is worth it but let's not kid ourselves that the UK is some bastion of financial stability that Scotland would be leaping out of. We're fucked and we're a hair away from being *completely* fucked. 

*This* is why number 10 has been rounding up the big business, the oil companies, the phone companies etc to regurgitate news that was already reported **6 months ago**.

Mine is colour coded between Sainsburys and aldi, which are my two closest supermarkets, not everything worked out cheaper in Aldi when product sizes were taken into account, and other things Aldi didn't do, for example milk free products as I'm allergic.

But to be fair I'm a greedy fuck and there are a lot of things on there that I really don't need, for example the crisps. Eventually I cut things like that out though. But every single night time meal had meat/fish in, so I could have cut out a fair bit of money there by not eating so much meat.

But I'll tell you what, the single biggest factor in cutting down how much I spent on food every week was getting it all sorted online. It worked out about the same by shopping  with Asda online, but because I didn't actually go into the shop I never got the chance to make insane impulse purchases.

Impossible to enforce with an open border to the UK and practically nonsense if you join the EU- immigration control that's identical to the UK's immigration control is ridiculous.


&gt; Foreign Affairs

A country the size of Scotland is going to have a tiny voice on the international stage, meanwhile it has identical goals to that of the UK. When negotiating with foreign powers Scotland would either try and form an alliance with the UK or lose out. 


&gt; Military

Again, a military that Scotland can't man and can't afford. Aircraft carriers? Nope, too small. Nuclear deterrent? Nope too nasty. Standing army? Nope, too expensive. Military industry? Nope, all the military companies are going to countries that'll actually buy their weapons.


&gt; Welfare


Here we are, something they can actually control. But it's something they already do to a huge extent, and have already promised more powers. Bedroom tax? In Scotland? I don't think so.
 
&gt; Taxation


This is maybe the most important one, but again, could be negotiated and in an indi scotland, suddenly the UK would set a competitive tax rate to usurp Scottish business.

For a start this was nowhere near our worst performance under Rodgers, the two previous anfield games against Villa were a lot worse, as was Swansea away and Hull away last season, even Newcastle at home was pretty poor even though we won. In most of those games we got opened up in open play and through midfield, while at the same time struggled to create anything of note. I realise its not saying much but on saturday we were at least solid in open play, although we were creatively poor. (A closer comparison, rather than previous villa games would be the southampton game we lost at anfield last season, a messy scrappy game of few chances decided by a set piece). The writer's claim we got overrun in midfield is nonsense, Villa effectively surrendered midfield and dropped their ""3"" in front of their defence, stifling our attacking play.

There's also other inaccuracies, for example we did not play 4-2-3-1 in the previous meeting, it was effectively a 4-2-4. He claims there was no plan B but also complains Coutinho dropped deeper late in the game, failing to see the tactical shift of pulling Coutinho into central midfield, where he was more effective.

For me Rodgers made 2 mistakes: not selecting Sterling and trying to use Coutinho as a number 10 again, rather than as a CM (he changed this at about 60 minutes after which we started to improve).

Once they are in different countries can have different rules on who stays permanently. 

Yes, Scotland will have a tiny voice on the world stage. I don't see the problem with this, it's what at-will defence unions and so on are for.

Why the hell would we want aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons? We spend £3.5bn as part of the UK on military, we could have a reasonable defence force for that. One that doesn't spunk money on 'force projection'. 

Holyrood doesn't control welfare in anyway. The bedroom tax actually still applies to Scotland but the government puts money aside to pay it on behalf of people instead. The money it takes to do that has to come from Health/Education/etc. Independent Scotland would just not have a bedroom tax in the first place.

No, Holyrood won't get any decent taxation powers. There's been many indications that it's 'unconstitutional', the House of Lords wouldn't pass it even if the Tory Backbenchers did.

EU, yes it does. I'll give you an example. The UK fisheries minister recently went into Russian trade embargo discussions and agreed to stop UK sales of Mackarel. The *Scottish* fisheries minister wasn't allowed in. Yet, almost all of the mackarel in Europe comes from Scottish waters. That decisions has hurt our industries. Not that Russian sanctions aren't needed but *we* should decide how they impact us, not Westminster.

I can answer that yes this is the case, although only certain stores had this and we're referred to as 'pepperami' stores. 

These were mainly aimed at pushing phones 4u out of business, depending on the banding of the store they got a rough budget of supplementary cash they could use to knock off upfront costs or subsidise cases and accessories to get the sale. 

This was introduced as a dry run last year shortly before I left.

Over the last year Carphone focused primarily on destroying phones 4u (which the dixons move was motivated by)

Carphone could also offer various undercut contract prices due to a complex arrangement of contracts where the networks would pay Carphone for the business they brought in (this depended on other metrics such as never pays and stuff). 

Carphone also acts as somewhat of a middleman that the networks could deflect various customer issues onto even if it was a network issue - it's Carphones problem,  go see them was quite a frequent thing.

Yes, there's just simply no actual ability to enforce the borders.


&gt;Yes, Scotland will have a tiny voice on the world stage. I don't see the problem with this, it's what at-will defence unions and so on are for.


Tell that to all the international businesses, all the contracts that Scotland needs to survive. 

&gt; and nuclear weapons? 

Well for a start because it's propping up the Scottish economy. You think those Billions disappear? A huge chunk of that is going straight to the Scottish workers. 

&gt;One that doesn't spunk money on 'force projection'. 

Haha, it may be unfashionable right now to admit we have a duty to protect ourselves and others, but it's simply naive to say we're never going to get back into situations we saw break out exactly 100 years ago.


&gt;The money it takes to do that has to come from Health/Education/etc. Independent Scotland would just not have a bedroom tax in the first place.

Which is exactly what it would have to do if it were in charge anyway, that's how balancing a budget works. If you aren't implementing that tax, you need to find the money somewhere. Oh, and Indi Scotland can't finance it with debt.

&gt;No, Holyrood won't get any decent taxation powers. There's been many indications that it's 'unconstitutional', the House of Lords wouldn't pass it even if the Tory Backbenchers did.

Speculation that's simply not backed up by what any politician has said. Let's get real, the UK knows that 0 changes means independence in 5 years. 

&gt;The UK fisheries minister recently went into Russian trade embargo discussions and agreed to stop UK sales of Mackarel. The Scottish fisheries minister wasn't allowed in.

You've gotten confused there, the person representing Scottish fisheries was in that meeting, he's called the UK fisheries minister. Maybe you want to bow to Putin, but your democratically elected representative didn't. You seem to think that the UK fisheries minister doesn't realise that Scotland exists, which is ridiculous, if you look around many countries made genuinely tough choices. Just because it doesn't go your personal way doesn't mean it's wrong. Is Aberdeen going to secede from Hollyrood when it doesn't get what it wants?

It might seem bizarre to someone who has grown up in a country that plays football, but if you come from the USA/Australia/etc, the only material you're ever exposed to about football crowds outside the stadiums is violent (or at least, tense). Even if you specifically try to look up some sort of 'walking to the game' video, there's no way to tell if that's a typical experience, whether that person avoided trouble a non-local wouldn't have, etc. That's not to say you'd be afraid, but it's not a terrible thing to do some due diligence before blindly believing something. 

And that's not even getting started on what usually pops up with a quick google on the safety of Liverpool. To an American/Australian/etc, we'd see things like derros in tracksuits walking around causing trouble, boarded up houses in certain areas, etc, which would set off alarm bells. It's not ""Liverpool looks like a bad place""; it's more like ""there's probably some sort of social dynamic at work here that would make it perfectly safe for a local but potentially dangerous for a non-local."" Maybe something like how to avoid trouble with Scallies or when it is/isn't safe to go into rough neighbourhoods.

true,BrianBoyko,null,null,"I actually think that's it's weird to say this, but that ultimately, when Ecclestone made the switch to Tennant, and Tennant to Smith, that the show remained fundamentally the same. 

I think we are seeing, however, a completely different Doctor Who because of the way Capaldi has chosen to interpret the character. 

Smith, Tennant, and to a lesser extent, Ecclestone, built upon previous Doctors. They played a doctor who was forever different, but who had acclimated to his adopted home, and while they didn't always get human emotions or subtleties, they at least acknowledged that *they* were the ones that were odd. And after 12 lifetimes, the Doctor was *very* confident that he *WAS* the ""Good Man"" as he called himself. 

Capaldi's Doctor is a true ""reset"" of the character, and now the ""it's going to be a whopper"" idea makes more sense.  This doctor isn't just the 13th regeneration, but also a complete rebirth of the character. This Doctor isn't sure of himself at all. He *remembers* the events that happened to him, but he doesn't retain the *perspectives* of his previous incarnations, and he's lost the ability to understand these silly little humans.  As such, he's *reverted* back, in many ways, to the aloof Timelord he was raised to be. 

Smith and Tennant (and many of the other Doctors) were confident enough in themselves to put their ideas into practice.  But Capaldi's doctor surrounds himself with the tools of an academic - the one who chooses to reasearch first, THEN act.  Smith adventured constantly (even while his companions were sleeping), Tennant was always looking for interesting *people*.  But this Doctor doesn't know what he wants, or how to get it.  For the first time, you see the ""Doctor Who?"" question being asked by the doctor himself, not in the ""What's his real name"" sense or the ""What role do I play"" sense, but in the ""Who am I, and what shall I become?""  

People talk about how Smith's character was a grandfatherly type in a young man's body; I think that Capaldi's doctor has all the insecurity and uncertainty of a boy growing through adolescence.  He has not yet matured, in a very real way, and as such is prone to immature actions that he doesn't quite understand how wrong they are.  Most of the companions have been more or less romantic (Rose, Amy) or friendship figures (Martha, Donna, Rory), but Clara's companionship has gone from a platonic/fraternal relationship into a maternal one. In a very real sense, Clara is now in the role of mother figure to a little boy in a grandfather's body, and coming to grips with that.

Federalisation done right requires more civic engagement (i.e. effort) otherwise it can end in a clusterfuck whereby the few interested enough in certain issues hijack power for their own ends (reference: Student Unions).

Immediate issues would be setting up parliaments, going through the process of deciding what levels of local, state, and federal taxation we wanted to be allowable and also specific implementation at each level in each region. There would be a million questions to be answered to actually convert the UK into a federation, but none insurmountable. Objections to federalisation include that some areas of the country may decide to implement policies other areas didn't like, it *could* potentially have a weakening effect on the NHS were that regionalised as part of the power the NHS has is in being hoooge. It would inevitably cost more money in direct administration costs although of course being pro-fed I'd suggest that long term economic rejuvenation would counter these costs.

I can't see really any properly long term issues with it. The US faces the eternal struggle of states trying to keep their own rights and the federal government taking more and more powers into its own hands, but that doesn't seem to be an issue elsewhere and I think largely stems from the fact that originally the federal US government was extremely limited and fairly weak.

Honestly, and I could well be blinded by my enthusiasm for it, besides the initial problem of selection of competent politicians, and the requirement for increased civil engagement, I can't really think of any reasons *not* to federalise. Of course Westminster is unlikely to support it because essentially they'd be handing away about half of their day to day power, but I don't really see a problem with that from my perspective.",0,1410798898,null,0,false,0,ckizoke,t3_2gdeud,t1_ckizoke,t1_ckitaq4,null,1427000980,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

However, there are many people that do not appreciate these kinds of things. Not that they are wrong to feel that way as it's all subjective, but I feel that the people that wouldn't like midnight probably wouldn't like ""deeper"" shows or movies or whatever.

It's like you don't know other small countries exist. 

&gt; Well for a start because it's propping up the Scottish economy. You think those Billions disappear? A huge chunk of that is going straight to the Scottish workers.

Haha come on now. 6,000 people work at Faslane/Coulport. Do you know how many are nuclear weapons related jobs? It's in the region of 500. So yes, they'll go. The plan however is to make Faslane the central base for our navy and make it larger than it is now.

There's also the small matter of the oil under the clyde we're not allowed to touch because of Trident's presence. 

&gt; Haha, it may been unfashionable right now to admit we have a duty to protect ourselves and others, but it's simply naive to say we're never going to get back into situations we saw break out exactly 100 years ago.

Great defence policy, always be prepared for what happened 100 years ago. The UK is building two aircraft carriers it can't afford, lacking systems we didn't want to spend money on which results in us needing to buy planes we can't afford that we won't actually get until after the carrier is finished.

Meanwhile there's not a single surface ship in Scotland defending its waters. There's a term for that kind of policy, skew whiff. 

&gt; Which is exactly what it would have to do if it were in charge anyway, that's how balancing a budget works. If you aren't implementing that tax, you need to find the money somewhere. Oh, and Indi Scotland can't finance it with debt.

No you misunderstand. Holyrood takes money it was sent for healthcare/education/police and gives it *back* to Westminster to pay the bedroom tax of the population. The money that comes up in the block grant in the first place doesn't include money raised from bedroom tax in England (because it's not a devolved matter). 

&gt; Speculation that's simply not backed up by what any politician has said. Let's get real, the UK knows that 0 changes means independence in 5 years.

It's not speculation. At the very same time Cameron was up here giving us a hug William Hague was in parliament reassuring politicians that what Cameron was saying *""was not Government policy, it's party political promises""*. 

We're getting fuck all if we vote no.

You can try websites like Zoopla and RightMove for more accurate rent prices.

I mean it's where the War Doctor went to access the Moment, after stealing it from the Timelords (on Galifrey).  Since he needed somewhere he could not be disturbed, and probably didn't want to get killed in the process before it was completed, he needed a ""safe"" place. So he probably went back there long after the place had become an inhospitable desert wasteland. Realistically this could have been any point in time, likely many many years after his child hood, all the way into the future (as long as the barn still stood).

Put simply, at no point are we told that is Galifrey. Only that it was the Doctors home when he was a child, before he became a Timelord. 

Is it so hard to believe that Galifrey did not have colonies at some point? I mean there are references of non-Timelord Gallifreyans in the franchise. For a species with the their level of tech there is no reason they couldn't colonize any number of worlds using even traditional forms of space travel. (Before the Time War occurred and the Daleks set out to obliterate all traces of them)

I agree with your sentiment entirely but there are examples of non-violent revolutions. The Prague Spring and subsequent Velvet Revolution is a very well studied one. Also the the German reunification (fall of the Berlin Wall) is described historically as the 'Friedliche Revolution' (Peaceful Revolution) this was despite the Stasi sending agent provocateurs into the crowds in an attempt to spark violence to justify a reaction of extreme force. The 'Salt March' orchestrated by Ghandi in 1930 also led directly to the Purna Swaraj declaration of independence from Britain later on in the year.

So yeah, not disagreeing with you at all, just thought I would highlight some non-violent revolutions.

For example, did you know that about 75% of all goods that Scotland trades to the continent or overseas actually exit the UK via England... 50% alone at Southampton and Felixstowe I believe. It just works out that basically container ships from Asia and Africa travel through the English channel on their way to the major European hubs at Hamburg and Amersterdam. On their way they stop off at English ports like Southampton to sell goods to us, and pick up our wares to take to Europe and back to Asia. It's cheaper to freight goods by rail or road to ports than it is for the ships to divert up to Scottish ports.

It doesn't just stop with physical goods. Two of the three gas interconnectors (pipes that connect the UK grid with those of Europe) and both of the main electrical interconnectors also travel via England.

If the rUK wants to choke Scottish industry it can do it in any number of ways. It's not that Scotland is ""weak"" or some rubbish, it's just geography and scale. It's the same geography and scale that landed Scotland in a union with England in early 1700s. You might be sat there thinking *""I can't believe the rUK would actually do any of that""*... but you might be surprised. In 10 years time the rUK might have a shale gas industry that is competing with ""Scottish"" north sea produce... we'll be able to use our control over the currency and your trade connections to ensure that our economic interests are satisfied before yours are. In real terms it will mean job losses, lower wages and stagnation in Scotland because they are not able to levy their industry against the sheer force of British interests - precisely the same problems they were having 300 years ago. 

Then you have issues like currency and EU membership over which the UK can levy pressure on the Scots to acquiesce to whatever the UK wants from a diplomatic perspective. 

**The English can be total cunts. I say that as one. I'd rather be on their side that in open competition with them**. If Scotland leaves the UK then its gone. The UK owes it nothing. The UK only serves its own people and owes nothing to a group of people who, though sentimental about it, decided they wanted out. That's not even to speak of the incredibly negative public mood towards Scotland that there is likely to be in the UK.

He started off well, talking about our shared achievements and connections (an emotional appeal, which is actually what the BT campaign needs). However he then went into the usual veiled threats and appeal to fear, about how difficult it will be economically, etc (we have reached saturation on these points, it just becomes white noise). Finally he ended with a promise of more power and some more platitudes (fine, personally I don't believe there will be more power; I think it will be like 1979 all over again but fine, I can't slate him for what his forebears did).

In management jargon we call that a 'shit sandwich'. You have two slices of nice bread on either side and then a turd in the middle. It's designed to give you something to think about without pissing you off too much, but it's really over played.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just too hard to please but I wasn't that impressed. Appreciate the effort though as he has been absent from things for too long into the campaign.

12 is such a good Doctor. I definitely know I'll like him more than 10 or 11 by the end. I much prefer his grounded take, and I think in this episode he did a good job of being grouchy without being a real asshole to Clara.

And I agree, seeing the Doctor's past didn't ruin it for me. And I also didn't realize Steven Moffat wrote this one. It *did* cross my mind however when two lines were uttered: ""Shut up! Shut up"" and ""...corner of your eye"" both gave me a Moffat-vibe. The ""Shut up!"" line is a pet peeve of mine.

For those who don't know, Fenway Park, like Goodison Park, is a very old building (built in 1912) with obstructed views because of poles. It's a small ballpark compared to most other places (your average ballpark capacity is between 41,000 and 48,000), fits seamlessly into the little swath of Boston it's in. For all of Fenway's warts and problems, we love that damn dump. It's sacred ground. Baseball, for those who don't know, is a religion in Boston. 

Since I'm a recent fan and an American, I've never seen Goodison Park or been to a match there, so I can't say what the atmosphere's like. But I do know that even with my Red Sox floundering in last, those games I got to go to this season were so much fun. The fans are fantastic.

I would guess the rent at the old Vudu club is greater than their current one, but it definitely still has the ""Grotto"" feel that I think snobs made their own so I do hope it works but it's a huge risk and if they need to mitigate it then it makes good business sense - Can only suck it and see I suppose!

The average BTLer will hardly be raking it in. Most (myself included) make about £50 pcm from there property as the mortgages they hold are only slightly lower than the overall rental value (which is in part dictated by the mortgage value....so the banks probably have it more sorted better than I do ;).

And it would only take one new kitchen (which my property will need on a couple of years), or a new boiler etc of the value of say £1500 to mean it would take me over 2 years in rental to pay off.

Of course, Ill (hopefully) reap the rewards in 20 odd years when the mortgage is paid off (and in that regard I might be a hell of a lot richer, and could probably afford a load of holidays), but right now....No. Holidays of the back of it might keep in in a caravan for a day or two, but thats about it.

The better term to use would be sovereignty. In a sovereign nation, the ultimate authority in that nation is the head of state - in our case the queen. The UK reserves the right to remove itself from any political union it is part of, even ones that exercise control over our government, because the UK is a sovereign nation. Scotland is not, which is why it cannot leave the UK without the government agreeing to it, and why all the power Scotland has can be removed by the government at will (if we were a federation then Scotland would have some powers written into law that the government could not revoke). A yes vote in the referendum would make Scotland sovereign such that, though it could lose independence by entering into political unions, it would have the right to leave these because the ultimate authority in Scotland would be the scottish head of state - in this case also the queen, it seems.

As an example of what sovereignty means, in the later stages of the British empire, the UK granted sovereignty to its dominions (eg Canada, Australia, Ireland).

I've only heard this second hand from before this season/series started.  But I thought Capaldi signed on to play the doctor, then refused to let them create a romantic interest between him and Clara.  That Moffat had planned on doing so, but Capaldi refused to play that kind of character.  

I hope this is true, because it makes me like this doctor even more.  I don't need for there to be this subtle, yet in-your-face, love interest between the doctor and his companion.  At the very least, that type of storyline has been played out.  I'm interested in this fresh take on things.

If Cameron, or English politicians in general, went full force behind the No campaign, it would make it a lot easier for the Yes campaign to turn it into Scotland v Tory, and would make it easier for them to say non-Scots (as in people who can vote in the referendum) are trying to impose themselves on Scotland, and bully them into voting a certain way. 

If Cameron, or English politicians in general, took a more back seat approach, saying they support the No campaign but not taking an active role, it would be easier for Yes to say that the Westminster government don't care about Scotland, and that they are not taking the views of Scottish people seriously. 

However, I think what has happened now, starting off in the back seat, and quickly running up to Scotland when the vote got close, is perhaps the worst decision possible, because it allowed Yes to use both of those arguments.

But it can get ambiguous though. I mean sure, if the person is practically comatose and they are having their clothes removed for them then yes, the rape argument stands. 

If the person is wasted, has lost their inhibitions and makes the decision to have sex with somebody, it shouldn't count as rape just because it's a decision they regretted in the morning, and the difficulty lies in determining at what point somebody crosses from the ""loose morals"" stage of drunkenness to the ""unable to give consent"" stage. Especially so when both people are drunk and seemingly up for it (which is the case in most of the circumstances I've known about on campus). Whilst people have a responsibility to not pressure people into situations where one party is unwillingly engaging in sex, so should people be responsible about how they behave and conduct themselves when drinking.

At the moment getting into the Surrey Research Park area is problematic during peak times due to Guildford being a major bottleneck on the way to London for car traffic. Busses run regularly and have bus lanes to assist with keeping their times; they are generally good with the major stops in Guildford having times for when the next bus will arrive.

For a 1 bed flat in and around the middle of Guildford I think you should be budgeting for about £800-£1100. You may find some deals and there aren't any areas I wouldn't live in Guildford so there isn't anything to look out for with regards to ""bad area's"". Speaking of bad areas the broadband coverage is good, FTTC is in the exchange and I get 20-30Mb/s at the far north end (Gosden Hill Farm in Burpham).

Electricity is around 15-20p per unit depending on what supplier you go for, there are loads to choose from. Gas is considerably cheaper at around 5p per unit, again loads to choose from because all suppliers seem to offer both. Can't remember what we currently pay but you can work out how much you can expect to pay with your current usage and add 10% for the difference in flat size and consumption here based on the change in daylight from Summer to Winter.

[G-Live](https://glive.co.uk/Online/) has some good gigs on ranging from theatre, to musical and stand up comedy. Worth checking out. The Percy Arms in Chilworth (nearby) is my favourite pub with its South African owner and traditional dishes. The area is extremely beautiful with loads of paths to walk should you enjoy getting out into the countryside. Guildford also has a castle, good old british history.

Those are all the things I could think to let you know about having lived here for 7 years. It is a really lovely place, I'm sure you will enjoy it here.

Staying and ""fighting for his spot"" didn't do anything for Sturridge, who was repeatedly played out of position in favor for the completely inept Fernando Torres.

The UK's credit rating is rated as Stable by every company other than 1 Chinese company. The three big companies all rate it as [stable] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating).

The 7% figure is complete bullshit, all they did was take the UK current deficit, subtract £35 billion that is stated to come from petroleum and then say that would add 2.5% to the deficit. This is not the correct way to do the calculation. There are contributions to the petroleum sector from the rUK, from refineries as well as from oil trading in London. It also ignores the fact that the rUk would then also not have to count Scotland's imbalance of trade with the rest of the world in it's figure. This calculation has so many flaws it is completely meaningless.

Yes the UK has a current account deficit, and yes it is probably larger than what we would like, but it is not the end of the world. Counting it against GDP is misleading. The UK total assets are [£7.3 trillion] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cap-stock/the-national-balance-sheet/2013-estimates/stb-national-balance-sheet--2013.html). This means that we are losing less than 1% of our net assets every year, this is not an ideal situation but it's not the end of the world for it to even remain at this level for 5-10 years.

Match Facts 

Head-to-head

West Ham have won five of the last seven meetings (W5, D1, L1).

Hull are unbeaten in the three previous Premier League encounters at the KC Stadium (W2, D1).

The Tigers have had a player sent off in three of their last four matches against the Hammers in the Premier League.

Hull

Hull have equalled their best-ever start to a Premier League season, emulating their inaugural campaign of 2008-09 with four points from their opening three games.

The Tigers have won only one of eight league games dating back to last season (D2, L5), and conceded 16 goals in the process.

Hull have hit the woodwork a league-high three times.

Nikica Jelavic has scored two of Hull's three league goals this season - his only shots on target.

West Ham

West Ham, with three points from their opening three games, have made their worst start to a Premier League season since the 2010-11 campaign, when they lost their opening four matches.

The Hammers kept 14 clean sheets last season but are yet to keep one so far this term.

They have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last seven away league matches since a 2-0 win over Aston Villa in February.

James Collins could make his 200th Premier League appearance.

Not once did he say the word ""rise"". Ctrl-f for it **and look for it within a quote**.

Andy Clarke, the guy you are quoting, has already gone on record saying prices will **drop** if Scotland has a lower corporation tax.

The delusion is yours, brought about via a media that heard ""prices may change"" and printed it as ""prices will rise"". Look into each of the examples in the UK press, find the original quotes. 

Your link says:

&gt; Clarke had previously declared that food costs would be likely to rise in the event of Scottish independence, in a letter to the Herald in December 2013.

This is not a quote. Learn the difference. 

If you [find the original coverage](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/supermarket-boss-claims-food-prices-could-rise-in-independent-scotland.1386601947) you'll find it says no such thing. What he's actually doing is hinting to the Scottish government that he would [concessions in the reduction of a specific tax](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/asda-will-not-take-sides-in-yes-or-no-debate.22931725) as well as a threat to the Scottish parliment that:

&gt; ""If the regulatory environment was to increase the burden of the cost structure on business, that would potentially have to be passed through to consumer pricing, because why should the English and Welsh consumer subsidise this increased cost of doing business in Scotland?"" 

Nothing to do with transport costs, just the plainly obvious statement that if Scotland were to bring in regulations different from rUK then the costs would diverge. Well, duh.

Yet people conveniently forget that Liverpool, Arsenal and United always had money, not to mention City literally did the exact same thing a couple of years later, and yet no one said a damn thing.

It's the same situation with the media and commentators taking today as an example, I saw the back of a few newspapers at work, every single one covered by United's win against QPR, with titles like ""four-tress"" and cringeworthy praise of finally winning against a team who are lucky to have been promoted after a huge expenditure, and record breaking fee in the league. Meanwhile there was no mention of our win against the only other team to have had a 100% record so far, or Costas hat-trick or Fabregas' record assists. 

People over at /r/soccer and in general will spew rubbish about ""confirmation bias"" and other non-sensical ideas that they can't comprehend but merely repeat just to feel superior in an argument, but all it comes down to really is that there is a blatant hatred for the club.

No. Simply that the costs of delivering UK staple crops grown in Scotland to Scotland is cheaper than delivering those same crops to England. And you call me ""stupid""?

You are a muppet if you think that doing so with the inclusion of a sea passage or Channel Tunnel transit from France or wider Europe could be *cheaper* than the transit costs from Scotland.

On the other hand if Scotland flounder on their own it may put off Sinn Fein calling for a Border Poll for a few more years and strengthen the case for staying in the Union.

true,fatfook,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Labour, like any other major political party need big bucks to run such a thing. They get these big bucks from donors and other less open deals. The donors are easy to find and it's no surprise to find big brands etc in there. OK, almost 50% of their funds are from the trade unions and HoC money but plenty, probably in excess of 40% is through other sources and said backhanders. That 40% will easily make or break them in an election campaign.

So anyone giving money in the huge amounts required will want things to remain the same with various legislation, for example the banks. We don't want the banks to clean up their act because they are doing well from their legalised fraud system. In addition donors may want to change a few things. Drop some backhanders to some MPs to rustle up some favourable bills through parliament.

And this is why a fair and just UK political party will ever take off because they won't get anything near the amount of money required to buy what they need. They will simply be buried by the corporate owned media - including the BBC, rubbished and called out on the slightest of faux pas. The same corporations who pay the corrupt parties to keep things as they want. It's all about money and power and sad in a way that we will most likely never see anything remotely fair or common sense based because the super rich control the whole show. What we see play out at election time is some silly illusion and democracy in it's thinnest guise.

Ask yourself why the same old things plague society in an age where we can control and manipulate pretty much anything. Things are broken because they are better broken. It's good for business. It's better that people are in fear because that's god business too. These guys jumped in when religion lost it's hold several centuries ago and have replaced the mind control system of old with a money based slavery today.

Is your education/skills or geography or both prevent you from getting a higher earning job? Perhaps selling house plus using cash to buy a place closer to where jobs are better might be worth looking at if geography is the cause of minimum wage. 

I'm not sure I'd bother with uni, especially if late 20s, unless doing a degree that leads to a vocation, perhaps look at doing the non uni route for accountancy? 

Or learning some building trades, use new skills and existing cash to buy some dumpy properties and fix up and sell on or rent out. 

Doing something that maximises your ability to earn a higher salary is probably one of the better investments is probably a very smart use for the cash.

Welcome to the world of fiat currency. Where the money has no value and you can print as much as you like!

Joking aside, you're correct. Those individuals buying on 5% deposit are taking a risk that interest rates won't rise significantly in the reasonably near future and that their earning power will increase to cover any rises in mortgage costs if things do go badly. 

On one hand I agree you should never buy things you can't afford, but given the nature of housing and land things have been rocketing upwards since social housing stopped being built in any significant number. Spotting the trend at the time is hard and acting appropriately is even harder.

&gt;The thing is, if I buy a nice house I want at the moment, then the value of that house is gonna plummet once those financially overstretched idiots get fucked by higher interest rates, leaving me to make payments for the next 25-30 years on a house I overpaid for.

So don't buy a house as an investment. Buy it as somewhere to live in. I doubt there are any people around these days in negative equity from the early 90's house price crash.

There will be a pinch in the near future where a lack of jobs and a lack of well paid jobs will put a cap on house prices even in places like London.",0,1410805598,null,0,false,0,ckj38n5,t3_2ggao2,t1_ckj38n5,t1_ckj2ja3,null,1426999287,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

My opinion- when we play one up top, BR deliberately instructs the team to slow down the pace a bit and play possession football rather than the 'pass-move-press' we get with the diamond.  The thought is perhaps that with one up top we won't be able to outscore the opposition, so we'll play a slower game which (theoretically) should also reduce opposition chances on our goal and prevent them from counter-attacking successfully.

The problem with that is it takes away our biggest advantage- pace.  Sterling, Sturridge, Markovic, Moreno, even Balotelli are all very quick players, so slowing them down by passing backwards and sideways takes away the element of their game at which they're most dangerous.

Shorter version would be I don't personally think it's the formation so much as it is the tactics that seem to accompany it.",0,1410805774,null,0,false,0,ckj3c4m,t3_2ghc9c,t1_ckj3c4m,t3_2ghc9c,null,1426999243,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

Indirectly. Take the ""bedroom tax"" for example, Scotland absorbed this but as a UK wide initiative the overall Scottish budget was still cut accordingly. Money had to come from other areas. This is the crux of the issue with the NHS, as PFI funds more and more expenditure less and less becomes available to Scotland. 

&gt; Devolved powers give Holyrood wide powers to alter taxation - but it chooses not to use them.

Because they would only result in Scotland losing more. Any tax increases would not have occurred locally, they would have been added into the UK budget then be delivered to Scotland via the Barnet formula. The granting of this power was a PR move, it wasn't a useful instrument.

Look at EIRE, a former part of the UK which chose independence. Irish citizens are NOT British citizens and anyone who was eligible (please correct me if wrong on the technicalities here) they had to register at the time that they became independent to retain their status as British citizens.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law_and_the_Republic_of_Ireland#British_Nationality_Act_1948

Again ... Britain will be a separate country to Scotland, that is what independence is about and there are MANY good reasons why any government would choose to revoke British citizenship in a similar manner.

To quote *""The UK Home Secretary, Theresa May, said future policies of an independent Scottish government would affect whether Scottish citizens would be allowed to retain British citizenship.""*

We're fantastic on the turn over, but we're not brilliant in possession. I don't want Gerrard anywhere near the final third either. I think his negatives are starting to outweigh his positives. He's so slow. He's lost his cutting edge. 

I think we need to remember that the front three had never played with each other before. Balotelli had been sick all week, it was Lallana's first competitive match back from injury, and along with Markovic, it was all their Anfield debuts. And speaking of Anfield, the atmosphere was fucking dire. You could cut the tension with a knife, and that cascades down on to the players. There's a weight of expectation now after last season, and it's not doing anyone any good.   

That being said, it all counts for nothing if we can't defend worth a fuck during set pieces. It's ridiculous.

true,thefoolwhofollowshim,present,,"BEGIN RANT/

What really amuses me are the English supporters of other clubs who spew hate about money is that they bitch endlessly about history and then ignore their own.

English history is littered with the corpses of shit like this.  I mean for fuck's sake half of London was built off the blood of the Empire.

Do they go around saying tear down the National Gallery or Whitehall because fuck King George and his money grubbing empire building?  Not to mention the fucking corporate shithole Wembley that replaced the Imperial shithole Wembley.

I'm an American and our history is messy as shit.  FOR FUCK'S SAKE SLAVES BUILT THE GODDAMNED CAPITOL BUILDING AND THE FUCKING WHITE HOUSE.  Our sports leagues here are seemingly teeming with child abusers, rapists, murderers, and Liverpool fans but we aren't going around slagging off people because we have some sort of vendetta. 

I know I may be preaching to the choir here, but there is such a distinct lack of rationality in the English Media because of their little penis culture that makes them sad that Abramovich doesn't speak to them or that Mourihno uses them like a cheap whore to tweak Wenger or whatever poor slob accidentally stumbled in front of him that week.

And it leaks into the culture of the supporters.  Liverpool fans with self-inflicted persecution complex that makes anti-Israeli/Palestinian nutjobs look fucking rational. Or the fact that they fucking spent 55 million on Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing.  Or that they were also owned and are currently owned by rich American Douchebags.  They almost had to fucking sell Anfield at one point.  

Or the fact that Arsenal is named after a fucking gun factory?  Or that they they're owned by FUCKING WAL MART.  They fucking play football like Wal Mart too:  Built on the cheap, ran on the cheap, and shit starts breaking down after six weeks.

And yeah, City is fucked too, but who gave the fucking Mansour family all that oil drilling training and support?  OH YEAH THE FUCKING BRITISH GOVERNMENT.

And United.  FUCK ME.  They're the goddamned worst.  Rio shitbag Ferdinand, this fucking french fries nonsense, whoring,  Rooney fucking shelling out 200 pounds for a smoke and getting popped with a fucking ugly hooker after he and Fiona got married at Shrek Palace. I fucking hate Ferdinand.  He would sell his grandma to Serbian Sex Traffickers for a sponsorship deal, but won't stick a leg out to make a game saving tackle. Poor Juan Mata, he's walked into the most vain and shallow fan base on the planet.  I once had a United fan tell me that Munich was worse than Hillsborough.  WHY ARE YOU FUCKING COMPARING DEATHS.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.  Now they're being run by a bunch of Swamp Germans and the people who thought given Gruden a coaching job was a fucking brilliant idea.  The best part is that they've been buying like Perez on a LSD fueled bender and now their side is like David Beckham's fucking career: flashy but with no fucking spine.

And poor little Spurs.  I like them. They try so hard.  But fuck them anyways.

Maybe it's just me, but I think it's more than just Wenger who's a voyeur.

Why are you talking about white goods? We are talking about day to day shopping bills! We ship in garlic from China, not things like potatoes and tomatoes. Perishable goods have limitations. 

I can't believe that you would so completely change the subject then call me an idiot for not being on the same page as your schizophrenia. 

You're argument doesn't even apply to white goods because Scotland has a disproportional share of the ports, so more of them are coming in here. We have 8.3% of the UK population yet [16.2% of UK presently comes in via Scottish ports](http://www.ukportsandlogistics.com/). So maybe your prices in John Lewis will be the ones increasing if white goods are your concern! 

I love this idea you have that England is a ""hub"" for Scotland; HGVs on ferries represent a fraction of our daily shipping. Have you ever even seen a major shipping port? Did you just come up with this yourself or did you read it in some newspaper?

This happened constantly and I don't think it's simply formation that causes it but a tactical decision to try and control possession, eliminate opposition counter-attacks, and (in theory) prevent the other side from having goal scoring opportunities themselves.

Based on his post game comments, I think BR's strategy when we play this way is simply that we should never lose, but at least get a draw and still have a very good chance to win versus the more open, attacking game where we win if we score more than you (and in particular manage to score first).",0,1410807931,null,0,false,0,ckj4jst,t3_2ghc9c,t1_ckj4jst,t1_ckj48ze,null,1426998463,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

My thinking is thus: moving almost all freight onto the railways will free up the motorways for cars and the current rail network for passengers. This will buy us time to build a comprehensive high speed railway system.

We have significant problems fitting 9'6"" containers into our loading gauge, particularly through tunnels such as Standedge (sp?) in the Pennines. This results in kludgy solutions such as wagons with tiny wheels so that the cargo decks can be as low to the rail as possible, thus reducing the maximum permitted speed of intermodal freight on UK railways. A new system, built to a much more generous loading gauge, would allow express freight (upward of 120mph).

Each region would have a nearby transhipment yard, such that lorry journeys are just the last few miles, or freight travels a few miles over the current network to its final destination (power stations, for example).

We'd also need some flat wagons for non-containerised freight.

There's three ways to sort wagons by destination: fixed rakes that go directly from A to B; fixed rakes where the containers are swapped around in huge container sorting terminals; or hump yards. I think that hump yards are the best solution, but that is yet to be determined.

Bear in mind, however, that modern techniques could far outstrip the efficiency of the days of old, even the old hump yards. RFID tags in the wagons along with automatic couplers could make sorting a train as simple as dropping the train engine off the rake and pushing it over the hump: no shunters tapping away at addo transmitters that relay the messages onto punched tape on the hump inspector's ivory tower, nor the manual coupling and uncoupling. All of it could be sorted automatically in real time.

That's my view of what should happen, perhaps not to everybody's tastes, but I think it could revolutionise transport in the UK and throughout Europe.",0,1410808550,null,0,false,0,ckj4w8m,t3_268j3b,t1_ckj4w8m,t1_choonw5,null,1426998137,3,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,3

The main problem is central - coutinho does not do a good job of getting on the ball in the number 10 role, he struggles to find space and when he receives the ball under pressure his touch has been poor. Secondly, Gerrard's lack of recovery pace means that both central mids end up sitting deep. Both of these combine to cut off any forward movement through the centre.

When we.use the diamond with allen amd henderson shuttling forward and back and sterling at the tip, we have both mobility from our centre midfield postions and a passing option through the centre who can hold and carry the ball under pressure.

I don't think we'd see the same problem in a 4-2-3-1 with sterling at number 10 and Allen and Henderson at centre mid for example.

Nobody is telling the Scots what they can do with their own country. The matter at hand is whether or not, in the event of a Yes vote, they will be able to enter into a currency union with what will be a foreign country whose central bank is independent of them. It's only right that that foreign country has some say in the course of events.

&gt;""No! It's my pound! Mine!"" 

No one has told them they can't keep the pound. The pound belongs to Scotland just as much as it does the rest of the UK, so it's only right that the rest of the UK gets a say in whether they share it in the form of a currency union, as you ought to know by now.

Very few people are *fearful* of Scottish success post-independence. Most of us, come independence, will wish them the best, but the reality is that the dissolution of a 300-year old union will bring with it an awful lot of negotiation, and rUK will have every right to vie for its best interests.

I'm not saying we have an obligation to start Soldado, just that he deserves a start. When he's at his best he's a better striker than Kane and Adebayor.

Check this map:

https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/lionhead+studios/@51.2422524,-0.5946275,15z

The big yellow line is the A3 (a dual carriageway - not quite, but almost a motorway).  As a general rule, south of the A3 is a better place to live than north (and as such, is more expensive).

The area immediately north of the research park (where Lionhead is based) is Park Barn.  It's one of the *least* desirable parts of Guildford so it's cheap.  Going slightly further north is Stoughton which is a bit nicer.  To the east of that is Bellfields.  That's another ""less nice"" part of Guildford as it's getting closer to Slyfield Industrial Estate with a large (smelly) waste disposal centre.  But bear in mind that ""less nice"" parts of Guildford are still pretty nice.  It's no inner city.

The Onslow Village area, to the south east of Lionhead is probably ideal for you.  It's close to work (walk/cycle or a few stops on the bus).  There's also an excellent sports centre next to the research park, a large Tesco supermarket, a hospital, and you're also close to the town centre.  Guildford train station is close by and well connected (fast train to London in 35 minutes).  Getting by without a car should be no problem.  Public transport is good and taxis are plentiful.

Moving further east you have Guildford town centre (fewer residential properties and more expensive).  To the east of the town centre you start heading towards Burpham (nice) and Merrow (nicer).   Merrow is probably the nicest (and most expensive) area around Guildford (although I'm slightly biased because I live there myself). 

South of Guildford is Pewley Hill.  Also very nice, but very expensive.

A 1 bedroom apartment in Onslow Village will cost you around £900 - £1000 per month.

Soldado's had flashes of resurgent quality during preseason, but he hasn't had a single PL start this season so far (yes, he's been injured the past few weeks, but a start against West Brom would be nice) and the club is going to want to keep developing Kane with occasional PL matches as well.

I'm not just frustrated by what this says about the amount we invested in him - Soldado seems like a talented guy who can do well and was railroaded last season by terrible management and a crisis of confidence brought on by poor results and personal tragedy, who was showing renewed promise during preseason and hasn't been given a fair chance to live up to that promise. He has a real chemistry with Lamela that isn't being cultivated if he isn't getting games.

When he's healthy, he should be starting. If he performs, he should be starting regularly. If he turns out to be a true flop, well, fine - leave things to Ade then.

-----

EDIT: additionally, let's look at our CB roster: Kaboul (c), Vert, Fazio, Vlad, Dier.  Vert will be playing regularly.  If Kaboul is captain, he'll be playing regularly as well.  When will Fazio get playing time to develop rapport with Vertonghen?  When will Vlad see playing time?  When will we be putting in the time to develop Dier into a talented regular started at CB?

Honestly - and I will get behind out captains, no doubt, but honestly - I think this was a pretty poor decision.  If I had my way Lloris would be captain, Vertonghen would be VC.

If you cant understand how white goods are just as applicable as produce wrt to efficiencies and mass ""production"" shared transport costs you are a complete idiot.

The white goods is to point out that same essential principle.

Scotland is a smaller market than the uk, its the fucking entire driving factor and is inescapable.

You are genuinely a moron if you cant understand having a 10th of the population versus another group means you don't have  the same buying power or efficiencies 

Here is an example to help your small brain! If you buy 1 foreign car and you send it via ship the cost of the car is the total cost of transporting the car and the car.

If you buy 10 cars the cost of the car is 1/10 of the cost of shipping and the cost of the car. Giving a unit price Cheaper for each car by 9/10ths the shipping price.

Isn't maths magical.

Under the current union we have collective buying power for all of us, the market is treated as one,  come split there are two groups one ten times bigger than the other, and both wanting the lowest prices possible.

And you cant understand why that means that scottish prices will be higher and the cost of goods will be more.

I give up, you are just to stupid to understand this, what makes me laugh is that several friends who live and works in scotland told  me that generally the intelligent professional people vote no, and the idiots are voting yes.

Can't say I'm surprised.

If Scotland is ~£130bn of UK GDP then £88bn deficit becomes **6.42%** trade deficit as percentage of rUK GDP. 

If we further roughly assume that Scotland accounts for 8% of total UK assets then without Scotland we're at £6.7tn. That makes 1.3% net asset loss year on year.

I understand it very well. I simply don't believe that it would be politically possible for rUK negotiators to agree to a settlement that amounts to everyone in the rUK paying £3000 in order to give every Scot a free gift of £30,000. It's just never going to happen. If the Scots insist on it, then the ""pre-independence"" negotiations will simply never conclude.

The fact that you, and people like you, seem to think otherwise really worries me. If you feel that you are being shafted, then it's going to cause a lot of ill-will.

&gt; The credit squeeze would primarily happen as a direct result of the refusal of a currency union, for which the only reason I can see causing this is spite as it would clearly be an arrangement that would benefit both nations, at least in the short term.

Can you explain why you think it would be bad for the rUK to reject a currency union?

From our perspective it looks like a terrible deal...

1. UK taxpayers would be on the line for bailing out any Scottish banks that get themselves into trouble. (C.f. Iceland)

2. UK taxpayers would be on the line for bailing out the Scottish state, if it got itself into trouble. (C.f. Greece)

3. The UK government would have to coordinate its monetary and tax policy with Scotland - a foreign country. We've opted out of the Euro, precisely to avoid that kind of loss of sovereignty.

Going to use the chart here for reference: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/UK_taxes.svg/500px-UK_taxes.svg.png , it predicted income for the 2008/2009 year.

In order to keep the effective rate rise as low as possible (and so avoid alienating too much of the population), you would want to pick one of the ones that is close to adjacent, but in all of them except upper bracket income tax and corporation tax are really sensitive subjects and are likely to just inflame people (even upper bracket income tax is pushing it a bit due to wealthier people having greater political participation). And corporation tax could be a potentially major issue due to increased corporate mobility now, a headline increase could easily lead to a reduction in actual take (it could also go the other way, I don't have the maths at hand to prove or disprove it, but that's the argument that will be used). A wealth tax would be one of the more progressive options, but think about how much people hate inheritance tax, even though its probably one of the fairest we have. 

The whole thing is a bit of a mess to be honest. The whole taxation system needs reform on a global scale, but vested interests/the media/the general public who don't run the numbers themselves ensures that its highly unlikely to happen outside of some sort of crisis situation, and even then you can't say that the outcome will be any better then the current.",0,1410812523,null,0,false,0,ckj75fa,t3_2ghabf,t1_ckj75fa,t3_2ghabf,null,1426997022,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

When we play 4-2-3-1 with Gerrard involved then we end up forced to hang an extra man back. This really disrupts the way we link in transition and slows us down. It also forces the CAM to drop deeper to receive the ball, which ends up isolating the striker (which we saw clear as day with Sturridge against Soton, and then again with Balotelli against Villa) and further breaking the links between our players. 

I also don't think we necessarily have a CAM who really excels in the 4-2-3-1. Coutinho likes to come too deep and has trouble when there isn't a lot of good movement in front of him. Lallana maybe fits, but that remains to be seen.

Not sure where you got the figures for the Scottish imports and exports, the source I [found](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/Pages/default.aspx) says that for 2013 (the last full year) imports were £15bn and Exports were 20bn, although I think those are low. If it is those figures then it only gets to 5.1% of GDP, accounting for everything. Also I have no idea how the assets are split between Scotland and rUK. I can see arguments for both sides having a larger part of the pie. 

Although I'd also like to say, I see no logic in how you got from any of these figures to somehow a currency union being a magic solution to any of these problems. Even if all the figures you are stated are correct (which they aren't) a currency union doesn't solve a single problem.

The first thing that happens on Friday morning if Scotland votes for independence is that everyone moves their money out of Scotland as no one knows what currency they will be using. All companies stop investing/postpone their investments into Scotland, as they don't know what the final negotiations will look like or what kind of government the Scottish will have in the end.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"-----------------|------------------


Left is Hendos space, right is Gerrards space. The ball comes to their respective areas and they have to get the ball moving forward on their own (unless they make side way pass and allow the other to do so), when the opposition attacks their areas they have to defend it on their own. When they move out of their area to attack, the other has to now defend both of these areas. 
  
Now for 3 man midfield:  
-----------Gerrard-----------  
-----------------|-----------------  
Hendo has the left and whoever he is playing next to has right side.  
Gerrard always stays behind, now if the opposition somehow get past Hendo, Gerrard moves to the left a bit and covers him, if they move past the second CM then Gerrard does so too.   


If they are moving through the middle with their attacking midfield then Hendo can press them or alternatively the other CM in our midfield.   
This gives Hendo the option to run up without leaving half a pitch open behind him, this accepts Gerrards lack of mobility and uses him as last man and also the player who brings the ball forward and chooses which midfielder carries it forward or diagonal pass towards the forwards.
  
  
But this isn't the strength of the formation. The strength also comes for how our forwards are aligned, if they are in diamond then we have a 10 who can't be marked by more than 1 player (and if that happens one of our other midfielders is free assuming opposition are 3 man midfield).    
We have forwards who hold both the CB and allow this 10 to move inbetween or pass it to them. We can also have Hendo or other CM move up and run through the lines to create 3v2 situation.  
Such options would in 4231 be limited. For one the 10 would have a clear marker, the CB would have 1 striker to mark so there would be even less space. Neither of the midfielders can move up without opening up our midfield for attack.


What about 433 then? That would also allow us better options, we would still have 1 CM who could make forward runs while the other and Gerrard stay behind to cover, the wide forwards could stay out wide for Gerrard to pass to them or cut in for through balls or overloading the CB. 


This is still our attack, defensively having 2 players sitting rather than 1 (and most teams who play 4231 have one pure DM and one CM) forces us to take a more defensive approach even when transitioning from defense to attack.  
We would have Hendo who is generally covering for fullbacks, and profiting from this when we attack by taking wingers runs, staying central.  
  
If you have watched Liverpool for the past year, would you fear crosses from wide more than attacks from central area? What about our counters, would our wide runs be as effective as central runs?   
Think of all the runs with the balls from deep and count how many were from the wide areas cutting in and how many were from central areas. Nearly all retrievals from the center were attempted pass forward directly versus the wide retrievals  were runs who later turned into passes or player deciding to cut in.


It doesn't work for the same reason Sahin-Gerrard could not work, both of them have ranged passing and however many tackles they pull off they are still CM who need a real DM to cover for them. The only teams who would profit from Sahin or Gerrard as CM are teams who have quick forwards who counter, they themselves can't join in on most attacks. Gerrard was put in DM as a compromise, as a way to use his qualities, somewhere along the way BR forgot that Gerrard is DM only in name. He isn't very sound defensively and although he can put in a tackle he doesn't do much anticipation and interceptions. Gerrard and Sahin as he found out are players who in their current state would be horrible for most teams that don't have other players covering for them defensively. When you go from a DM and 3 players covering for Sahin, to CM and 3 players covering for Gerrard (one of whom is a marked out Coutinho in 10) you will have horrible result.


Everyone can see the difference is reaction when other deeplying playermakers and Gerrard receive the ball, they release it as quickly as possible as if they were just waiting for the ball to arrive, Gerrard will often take another touch to get a picture before making the pass. An attacking midfielder turned DM. If you are going to limit his options from 2 midfielders in front of him to one you will create further problems.


When Gerrard isn't playing Allen-Hendo with Lallana in front might work, permitting that Lallana can drop deeper at times and fill Hendos role or Allen being decent enough at DM that Lallana/Hendo can flank him.",0,1410813243,null,0,false,0,ckj7jzg,t3_2ghc9c,t1_ckj7jzg,t3_2ghc9c,null,1426996833,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"I think a part of the issue is the step before this too. People think that punishment will make them feel better. In reality, though, the person or people most affected by a crime rarely get a sense of closure even if the criminal is sentenced to death.

If people dealt with their feelings in another way rather than thinking all they need is to see the criminal punished and ""justice done"" then the issue of what happens in prisons could shift easily.

As it is, so many people simply ignore any issues with prisons because it's too easy to write off the people in there as deserving of punishment.

It's hard to change someone's opinion on this, too.

However in my opinion one of the best arguments against this is a similar one often used against the death sentence...

Our justice systems are not perfect, and is it statistically *very* unlikely that everyone in prison even committed the crime that they are in there for.

In the US it's estimated that 4% of death row inmates are innocent. This equates, I think, to a couple of people per year actually being killed by the state when they are completely innocent. We *know* this is happening, but we don't know *which* of them are innocent so we can do nothing about it as long as the death sentence is in force.

So even without death sentences - in consideration of people sentenced for crimes they didn't commit, do you really think it's acceptable that we have a system that regularly punishes innocent people in an extremely brutal way? Is it acceptable that every year the justice system punishes a certain percentage of people who actually never even committed the crime that they are sentenced for?

There's no way we're going to suddenly perfect our justice system to ensure that only the guilty are convicted. That is pretty much an impossibility at this point. So the only way to stop innocent people being punished is to stop punishment entirely.

Of course these people would still be incarcerated, but unfortunately we can't reasonably let everyone back out onto the streets after being convicted of a serious crime! As long as you do the absolute minimum of removing convicts from doing harm in society, it's pretty hard to justify any sort of punishment beyond that.

And remember - one day you may be the innocent person in prison suffering endlessly for a crime you never committed. It happens to innocent people every day.",0,1410815585,null,0,false,0,ckj8uop,t3_2gge0q,t1_ckj8uop,t1_ckiuthn,null,1426996228,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Now, you can say that's all fine and dandy but I expected Coutinho to come roaring in this year.

I think benching him this game would be good for him. Show him he's not an automatic starter. I doubt that happens seeing that Allen and Markovic are out, but I think it would be the right decision.

No it can't. Scotland isn't an independent country - that's the whole point. If there is a ""yes"" vote, Scotland won't magically become an independent country on Friday morning. Independence only happens after the successful conclusion of the pre-independence negotiations. Scots don't just draw up a Christmas list and get us to sign it.

If Scots demand something that rUK politicians simply cannot deliver, then the negotiations will never conclude, and the *status quo* will endure.

It reduces a lot of the risk as they should handle loads of things that would probably never occur to you.   I've never even spoken to my tenants.

Landlord insurance is yet more fees but can also reduce risk further.  I really need to get this but haven't yet.  That could bite me on the arse if I'm not careful.

More controversially, you can even pay somebody to find you the properties in the first place.  I also did this using something called a property club. In theory they offer the promise of discounted prices by bulk buying (we've got 20 people who want to buy some of the flat's you are building so give us some money off).  In theory you see some benefit from this in a reduced price but a chunk of this will be taken in commission. These rightly have a mixed press.  And by mixed I mean mostly negative.  Some are literally scams (people have gone to jail), I suspect all are super salesmen and marketeers.  If you use one you must question everything and independently verify everything they say yourself and look them up on the internet.  That said, as a novice, I am pretty happy with the one I used and they seemed pretty above board and all the numbers have proven more or less correct.  They also sorted out the furnishings and all sorts of things that I would not have thought of or spent time doing (for a fee of course).  I could have saved a lot of cash doing it myself but I saved a shed load of time and effort.  Massive buyer beware on this though.  Think of it as a bit like timeshare salesmen.  Some are genuine, some are thieves, some are wide boys, but they're all after their commission.    If I buy another property I may do more myself but for dipping my toes in, it was worthwhile for me.  I don't feel ripped off and I'm glad I used them.  i might have been lucky though.  Around the same time I was reading a ""how to"" book on property by a guy who had his own property investment company and was considering his company.  I did a quick Google and found that he had been unfavourably featured on BBC's Inside out and Sky News. It was a good book though.

Property is not 100% risk free.  Nothing ever is.  My income will go down when interest rates go up, there is still a risk of loss if the property gets trashed, rents could crash in an area, and so on.   But it is pretty widely accepted that it is usually a good investment if you think long term (think 10 years +).  It's a get rich slowly type of strategy.

&gt;The problem was not with the rig itself. The problem was with the lack of preparedness for a problem.

I kind of disagree here, I mean the problem quite definitely was with the rig, but I guess I see what you're saying. The preparedness wasn't so much the problem as the industry culture in the GoM caused in large part by the lack of regulation. That's a local regulatory issue.

&gt; it should not take three to six months to get them back under control.

Except, that when things do go very wrong where half of the safety systems aren't working because no-one is forcing anyone to make sure they're working that *is* how long things are going to take. The technology exists to stop fuck ups like this (which seemed to be against the thrust of your initial one sentence argument) - it just wasn't maintained because the company weren't forced to do so.

&gt;We do not yet have the technology to deal with the inevitable occasional problems, which turns them from minor blips to major environmental impacts.

Except, we kind of do. Ensuring functioning cement jobs is a matter of proper pressure testing and functioning BOPs is just a matter of testing the sods regularly enough and fixing them when they don't work. That's all fixed by proper regulatory controls. Even in the GoM where I'd argue that regulation was at the time severely lacking you're looking at 3500 offshore wells in existence of those a single one has gone wrong in any sort of notable fashion. There are tens of thousands of these wells across the planet and in most regions they don't go wrong because with a well like deepwater simply shutting the BOP rams should have been enough to stop the well after minutes to days, but those didn't work because the guys hadn't bothered to ensure they worked (bad on their part) but that was allowed for by a regulatory system which didn't legally force these guys to make sure they worked (bad on the US Fed gov's part). That does not mean the technology is lacking, that means that the government was lacking.

&gt;This is not to say that we shouldn't try such things, but perhaps a little more thought and care might be justified.

Agreed 100% but how do we get from ""deepwater horizon hurr durr"" to ""perhaps we should have better regulatory controls to ensure that operators are making rig contractors carry out regular maintenance more frequently?""

&gt;How you didn't get that from my comment, I shall never know.

Let's say he didn't, let's say Osborne came up said *""No currency union""* and so the next day the YES campaign said *""Oh well, sack that idea.. how about something else?""*

Do you think that's a good way to run a campaign? Do you think that perhaps we'd be having a conversation right now about how Salmond is a flip flopping wet blanket of a man with no ideas, direction or backbone?

There seems to be this widespread assumption that yes voters think they can *dictate* currency union. It's bullshit. We know it's a two way negotiation, we know rUK can continue saying no, can demand other things.. whatever. Doesn't mean we should give up until it **actually** happens. No pre-negotiations was Westminster's idea remember.

You'd never win any kind of campaign if you immediately react to any negative thing your opposition says. Every politician holds the line until they can't hold it any longer. I don't know why when Alex Salmond does it he gets this excessive, visceral response and claims that he's trying to dictate England.

They were cookie cutter archtypes: the rebellious teen, the arrogant professor, the timid but smarter-than-her-boss assistant, the under-appreciated worker hero, the bossy wife and her subservient husband.

Whilst looking at housing auctions there are people with ridiculously large portfolios and it's inflating the market. Students and the poor seem to get a very poor deal from private landlords, whilst the rates are lower it is reflected in the area/quality of property/interior etc.

Unfortunately most of the social housing I know of is being sold by the local councils (30,000 tennants) to private companies to make a fast buck,  which now puts the burden of the companies profits for the tenants to make up for-be it by rent increase or the company decreasing costs by cutting services/quality.One of the buildings has been completely gutted and refurbed to a higher standard with the hope of attracting private renters for more money. The market is going to end up over saturated at the top end and under supplied at the bottom end purely through greed.

Surely it would make sense for the councils to supply homes for students/welfare/those on lower incomes as they are the people they subsidise the most- no need for their money to go into somebodies' supplementary pension pot.

Your right I do have a massive chip on my shoulder about unionism but not with any individual unionist. In all fairness can you blame me for having this chip given the past ? 

When do nationalists ever celebrate any murders ?

Propaganda is a twisting of the truth whereas this post is blatantly factual. 

If it is just a minority celebrating historical genocide and the majority are disgusted by it then why doesn't the majority condemn those in their community who do. Why do you continually elect those who do celebrate passed crime. 

The plantation makes those land claims surrounding the period illegitimate.
The British veto establishing partition makes the current jurisdiction illegitimate.   
Our country is divided and is suffering economically for this very reason.
Unionists politicians are offended by the native culture and in order to retaliate to their own created situation they resort to territorial pissing with flags.

There's a great quote from Donald Trump (I know, I know) in which he walks down the street with his daughter (this was when he lost everything in the 80s real estate crash) and points out that he has less money than the homeless beggar on the pavement- because he was in so much debt at the time.   It's the same thing here.  There are tens, if not hundreds of millions of people in the West who technically have 'negative' money, but in practice have comfortable middle class lives because their income allows them to do so.    Conversely, there are poorer people who are technically 'wealthy', simply because they own land or property, even if that property is losing money or their income is very low.  

That's what makes these statistics extremely flawed- they aren't put into any kind of context.   If you earn a decent, middle class salary of £120 a day (so let's say around £40k per year), then you are literally earning almost **200 times** as much as the more than A BILLION people who live off less than $1.25 per day.

I have wondered what will happen to the SNP if they achieve their goal of independence.

What will be their new policy slant?  Obviously it'll be titled 'What is best for Scotland' or something vague, but faced with having to decide on all aspects of their countrys policy and not just whatever is handed to them by the UK government to shape/alter,  will they be left wing, centre, right wing?  

Will people vote for them into an actual sovereign government as opposed to a devolved parliament? Or will they prefer to stick with their old MPs and it comes down to Labour &amp; Tory?

IF that happened and it was the same two major party's governing both Westminster and Holyrood,  how does that even work?  Do the existing UK wide political party's in Scotland have to dissolve?


I just have this weird scenario of Milliband as Prime Minister of the UK, and Gordon Brown as PM/President/Chancellor of Scotland, and it'll be like nothing has really changed.  (both are pretty unlikely I think, but just entertain the possibility, it is a strange thought)

Playing one style of football would makes a one trick pony. Some of our fans have come to believe these oversimplified image of us being a defensive team. How you define a defensive team? How do you define an attacking team? Why are some fans ashamed of defending these days? Defending is what made Italy a household name in world football. Would you rather win major titles or just attack and risk everything in every match? Why would we only concentrate on ball possession? Also wouldn't it matter what part of the field a given team is holding the ball most of their time when they are in possession? Teams like Barcelona and Bayern, their ball possession is concentrated in the middle of the field(look at their heat map and see it for yourself). I would never want Chelsea to play like that. Those aimless boring one two touches don't result in goals against big teams unless you have the best players in the world. I rather have our team rely on counters and spend most of their time in the attacking third when they are in possession. It shouldn't be about who has the most possession, but who is more dangerous with the ball when they are in possession. Real Madrid destroyed Bayern last season and no one dared to mention ball possession. Bayern also destroyed Barcelona few years ago with very less ball possession. Teams that shy away from other teams 18 yard box don't deserved to be praised for playing a beautiful football. Football would have been a boring sport, if passing around short passes was the best thing in it . How many games did we play defensive last season? Liverpool away and Atletico away are the only matches we played defensively.

The UK, as it stands, is one of Europe's great powers. Its economy's strong, its prospects for growth are solid, and political/constitutional reform (devolution or otherwise) can be achieved from within the union, if the two-party monopoly can be overcome. A good chunk of the pro-independence people seem to be of the mind that independence is desirable, *whatever the cost*- even if that means risking severe damage to the Scottish economy in the short term. 

Had Scotland been independent in 2007, it'd stand a horribly high chance of looking like Ireland right about now. With scale comes a degree of security- that's a hard thing to give up.

I live in England, so I don't have a vote to cast. But if I did, it'd probably be a no. However it turns out, I hope the Scots come out of it fine- but I do think an exit would be a terrible, unnecessary gamble- *particularly* if further devolution can be secured.

...*That said*- I can understand why people might want to get away. The Westminster establishment is an elitist, detached mess that's not changing anywhere near fast enough.

There are clans in Tyrone who know exactly where there lands were before the plantation and in many cases the descendants of those planted on the land stolen by Cromwell still reside on those farms. 
 

You can claim to be Irish as soon as you claim citizenship ya dont have to wait two generations but your still not native in the historical sense. 


Genetics has only proved so far that we are very similar and due to trade connections in prehistory it is very likely that we share some ancestors. 
However there is some major difficulties with regards Irish origins (Mesolithic populations) Lithic tollkits dont match any of our neighbors. 
Neolithic populations are an even bigger question but what we do know is that Ireland had farming communities before Briton. 
After that we have evidence for some immigration but not invasion, therefor some dilution but not a replacement.

My point is not that Scottish + rUK foreign policy would be different from UK foreign policy. My point is that it would be the same, rUK would probably shoulder a slightly larger percentage of the buren though because scotland would have a smaller military. 

As such it does not make sense to argue as the person I was replying to did that Scotland needs to worry that it will be unable to avenge executed scottish journalists. The UK does not do this unless there is an ulteria motive and rUk + Scotland would likely get involved anywhere that the UK currently does.

They will be part of the union on name only.

&gt;My stance has always been they won't be fully independent and will just have a devolved government under another name and flag.

But I've demonstrated that EU countries fail the criteria you put forward for independence, whilst being obviously independent.

Currency unions and open borders are no means by which to test a countries independence.

So either:

All of Europe is one state, and no European country is ""independent"".

Or an independent Scotland would be as independent as any other EU country

There is no in between there, it must be one or the other, according to your criteria of

Assuming you want to maximise yield but have some instantly accessible savings, see below:

**Zero risk**
For ""basically zero"" risk, you can get 3% interest in a Santander 123 account, for balances up to 20K. You can get 2 of these, although one may need to be joint (although this isn't enforced for everyone, it seems). That's a nice neat 'tranche' of 20% your 200K cash savings. I would max out your ISA allowance too - that's another 15K.
If you can be bothered, there are some accounts that offer 4% to 6% in current accounts, but they need direct debits and/or £300-1000 to go in each month - this can be immediately withdrawn again, and you can set up standing orders to automate this.
UK current accounts are guaranteed for up to £85K per person per banking group.

**low risk**
Index funds track the whole stock market, so your only risk is if all companies go bust - in which case we have bigger problems to deal with such as armmageddon. Over the *long* term (20+yrs), you should see over 7% interest on your investments on average.

**higher potential gains, but more legwork**
This is the fun bit: Personally I would invest in rental property. This is a whole different kettle of fish so you might want to see /r/realestate and similar to get started.

I've ignored the picking shares route, as it's basically gambling on companies, and everyone pretty much knows how it works. Buy low, sell high, play against the City traders who have every advantage possible, including inside info (illegal but it happens) and probably lose as much as you would in a casino.

Given that he would seem to know his way around commercial real estate development pretty well and Cain Hoy/Guggenheim can virtually guarantee financing they may be able to get things rolling faster....at a minimum i would hope that the Archway situation would be completely wrapped up.

Did you even read what I wrote? It's not pathetica because it's NAtionalist  (which for the record i'm not totally against, i'm all for a united Ireland when they can provide the benefits we get as part of the UK) it's pathetic because you can't see you're as bad as the people who come in this sub and make sectarian comments about taigs and fenians.

&gt; The IRA were freedom fighters fighting for the oppressed. They were liberating. The historical crimes of the empire are exactly what the IRA were revolting against. You cannot simply compare them as one happened as a direct result of the other. Mentioning your Granda's street being bombed is just whataboutary.

When I was 13 they put a bomb outside my school. Who were we oppressing? I'm not saying they didn't have a just cause when they were formed but in the 70's they were terrorists.

&gt; I'm not familiar with murals in Belfast and I've seen none in Derry commemorating murder and I really cannot image the nationalist community celebrating the death of anyone the way the loyalist community do.

Really? Cause the article you posted had a picture of one in it and you got awfully mad about it. There's plenty. You seem to view Nationalists through rose tinted glasses and until you can face up to the atrocities committed in the name of Nationalism you're just as bad as anyone on the other side who can't hear a word against the army or the UVF.

&gt; Propaganda is always false to a certain degree an involves presenting things in a bias way, where as my post was simply an article about history. Are all posts on history propaganda. I didn't try to twist it I just posted it.

No it isn't. As I said before Propaganda is information, true or flase, that is used to promote a political cause. Which is what you did here, you didn't post that to have a discussion on History, you posted it to promote your political ideals, so it is propaganda. 

&gt; Paint over it if you dont support it. I dont want to hear excuses on this issue.

You're a fool. You paint over it they come back the next day, give you a kicking and repaint it.

&gt; Marty was a freedom fighter, forced into violence, who turned his back on violence in favor of politics. He is a shining example of the republican community.

He was a terrorist who turned his back on violence in favour of politics and I have an immense amount of respect for him for doing so. I still think he should apologise for the murders and I refuse to call anyone who kills innocent people a shining example of anything.

&gt; Bitching about Cromwell wont help just like common discourse with unionism about it's forceful colonial domination over a native population wont help. Again it is ""bitching"" if you look at it through the eyes of unionism.

Do you really think the majority of Unionists today actually want to subjugate Nationalists? Also it's bitching if all you do it post links to snapshots of history and whine about it without offering any solutions.

&gt; Try understanding what it is like to know that your ancestors suffered repeatedly, generation after generation at the hands of an invader. Now imagine that invader is still here celebrating that oppression.

I'm pretty well convinced that endgame of this is to dissolve the NHS as a single entity due to it's massive buying power, the NHS is one of of the largest single buyers of medical equipment, drugs and medical expendables in the entire world and as such has an incredibly strong negotiating position; ""64 million customer base, can you say no? no. lets talk prices.""

I have a hard time working out who benefits from the piecemeal bit-by-bit privatisation of the NHS, because from my own families experience (my mothers kidney dialysis provided by Fresenius) the quality of care has gone down, the staff numbers have been continuously reduced to bare-bones levels to the point where they can't deal with emergencies without threatening care or safety of other patents, and even the food -- kidney dialysis patients are highly restricted in what they can eat, and Fresenius tried switching out quality locally-sourced meals and sandwiches, and serving the patients of my mothers local clinic with shitty inedible petrol station quality sandwiches for a month until there was a mass walkout of patents refusing to be treated due to weight and nutrient loss caused by their shitty meals.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I personally think access to cash assets/actual income is far more important than wealth, which is malleable and changes in definition all the time depending on where you are and how it is measured, and has minimal impact on political power or whatever.  (Who has more monetary power, the guy living in a £1m house making £250k per year, or the farmer living on a '£6m' farm making £50k a year?).

We clearly look at the world differently, which is perfectly fine and a valid part of debate.  My only point is that the statistics actually neither confirm nor deny the implicit assumption made, which is that this is a horrible and recent development that confirms some evil truth about the bogeyman that is 'neoliberalism'.   

Some things to consider:

* Debt has existed since the invention of money (and indeed before it too in barter economies).  

* Negative wealth does not imply poverty or lack of socioeconomic power- it merely means that at a certain time, the debtors total assets are less than the sum of money owed, something that can happen to any class of people at any wealth level. 

* A significant chunk of the developing world experiences high inflation (often close to or higher than 10-15% per year), making saving a bad decision.  Land values also remain low in many developing countries, and money is often immediately reinjected into the economy in the form of salaries, services and goods that do not factor into generic calculations of 'wealth'. 

* The vast majority of the developing world's population, including those rich and poor, save comparatively little money to the West, which has been chalked up to a number of factors such as political instability, high inflation, and so on.  

* The vast majority of wealth exist only on paper, in the sense that it is not even remotely close to being liquid, and thus could not easily be converted into actual money, making its actual definition and indeed value vague and malleable. 

There are people who, in many cases through the quirks of globalisation or the political transitions seen around the world over the past 20 years (or indeed through their own hard work) have amassed vast fortunes.   There is a valid case to be made against extreme inequality.  But articles like these are clearly slanted, and do not discuss rational counterpoints.  Shouting statements like ""X people own 50% of the world's wealth"" is much like those radical American conservatives who go on about ""Black people commit X% [disproportionate] percentage of crime"" or whatever.  *Factually true*, but under the microscope, more than a little bit misleading, or at least implying something that is not actually in the study.

Scotland has 2,174 miles of trunk road while England has 6,500 miles.
Scotland's population of 5.295 is dwarfed by England's 53.1 million

So 6.5mil mi/53.1mil people = 0.1224 miles per person in England

while 2.174mil. mi/6.5mil people = 0.3345 miles per person in Scotland

Suggesting that out of the tax paid by a Scot, they have nearly 2 3/4 more road length to pay for than an English person.

The difficulty comes when the width and wear&amp;tear of each road isn't taken into account... 1m of the M25 is going to cost more to build, maintain and run than 3m of a lesser used mountain road. Proving that statistics are interesting but ultimately useless and so I would question where the latter details come into play in your estimation too.

When Adebayor is at his best he is one of the top strikers in the world, in my opinion. He has it all. Shooting, heading, finishing, link up play, dribbling, pace, and not to mention he drags defenders around everywhere he goes which creates TONS of space. I will admit that he is not always at his best but if we are going to compare him with Soldado at his best then it is only fair to compare him to Ade at his best.

Soldado, while fantastic in Spain, has been poor in England. Kane and Adebayor have both out performed him in the league. He has not shown that he deserves to start. Just because he's great on social media and friends with Lamela doesn't mean he deserves to start. It was the same with Holtby.

Although the EU would like to have a single consistent VAT system, the reality is that most members have specific derogations from VAT for local cultural or political reasons. You can seem [some examples here](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/key_documents/table_derogations/vat_index_derogations_en.pdf):

* Belgium, precious stones and pearls
* Denmark, supplies of catalogues for libraries and museums
* Finland, maintenance of ships more than 10m in length
* Ireland, fertilisers, animal feed, and seeds
* Italy, supplies of gold bullion

&gt; The rebate isn't half bad either.

The UK's rebate is currently worth about £5bn (so say £500m to Scotland, on a roughly per-capita basis).

However the rebate is based on the amount that the UK pays in to the EU relative to the amount it receives (if it pays in £100, and receives £70, it gets 2/3 the difference - or £20).

They saw them as an instrument to gain independence, but they would have been horrified at them managing a piss-up in a brewery, let alone running the fucking country.

They were just not trusted at all. Jesus Christ, the SNP were Republicans until about 3 weeks last Sunday when they suddenly and miraculously decided that Scotland should remain a democratic monarchy. And I'm not so sure about the democratic part, to be honest.

They also had a miraculous change of heart regarding NATO membership a couple of years ago, just in time for the referendum.

The truth is that Salmond is a shrewd political opportunist. And that was okay when he was leader of a fringe regional party with little prospect of significant political power. But the Scottish electorate gave him that power, but Salmond has developed no more stature or credibility now than he had in the past. He's still a manipulative, lying opportunist.

3. Coutinho struggles in an advanced 10 position.


We have the attackers but there are core positions. We have no out and out holder, like Matic or Fernando, which means getting exposed to shit against any good team in out current setup.

The number 10 is critical. They're the main creative outlet, and Coutinho should be that player, yet he struggles there. Silva is the most magnificent example. He drifts, finds space, and dominates games.

It's a combo of factors. I can't understand Rodgers reasoning for even setting the team up like it. The team plays well as a diamond, or a 4-3-3, so why keep trying and failing to adjust to  a 4-2-3-1?

As to the comments about Gerrard, he honestly, and i mean this, contributes almost nothing that another player can't. Playing deep in our Diamond or 4-3-3, he's supposed to sit and launch long balls. That's all he does, and they're starting to come off less and less. He's also not a capable defensive midfielder..

I don't think we need long balls, because i don't think it compliments how we want to play, and set pieces can be taken by other players. What i will say though, is that if we are going to stick with Gerrard(and he isn't useless, he can still offer us something, albeit as a sub i feel), at least play a Diamond or a 4-3-3 where his faults are mitigated somewhat.
 
Don't stick him in a fucking two. We hounded Hodgson for that, now Rodgers keeps doing it. Hope it stops.

Edit: Oh, and Allen is a very important player for us. I think if we stick Allen and Henderson in the two, with Allen mostly sitting and patiently distributing, and Hendo bursting forward, i think that's the best chance of it working out.  Two very fit and mobile midfielders in front of our back four, i'd love to see it. The sad thing is though,is i just don't see Gerrard being dropped, when i genuinely believe he should not start any more. He's way behind what other players can give us now, and that's the harsh reality.

&gt; The zero rate is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some member states, most notably the UK and Ireland, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These member states have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services. An EU Member State may uplift their domestic zero rate to a higher rate, for example to 5% or 20%, however, EU VAT rules do not allow a reversal back to the Zero rate once it has been given up. Interestingly, Member States may institute a reduced rate on a previously zero rated item even where EU law does not provide for a reduced rate, however if a Member State makes an increase from a zero rate to the prevalent standard rate, they may not then decrease down to a reduced rate unless specifically provided for in EU VAT Law (Annexe III of EU Dir 2006/112 list sets out where a reduced rate is permissible).

Reread my first few comments again and i'll think you'll find the thing I found offensive wasn't the subject but rather you're declaration that it's a celebrated thing.

&gt; I can hardly condone all the tactics of the Irish Republican Army but what I can say is that they were ordinary men forced into extra ordinary circumstances. Marty being one of them.

I agree, but the actions they took were disgusting. They didn't wage a war with Loyalist paramilitaries or the Army initially and at the end of the troubles the most people killed were civilians. In my mind there's no reason for leaving bombs where innocent people, particularly children can be harmed.

&gt; Again my post is only propagandist in your point of view.

It's propagandist by the definition of the word.

&gt; What I would like to see is an apology from unionists regarding the past as (as already stated) the past is an issue in modern politics. An apology would be a good solution.

I'd love this to happen and I think it's necessary for progress to be made, although i'm not sure who you'd like to make it? Paisley would have been good but that ships sailed. I also think an apology needs to be made from the other side too.

&gt; Unionism didn't even exist during Cromwell's genocide are you confused?

You said ""common discourse with unionism about it's forceful colonial domination over a native population wont help"" in comparison to what Cromwell did. Sorry if I wasn't clear but I meant that Unionists *today* aren't forcefully colonising anyone and don't want to.

&gt; But seriously thanks for the discussion.

You too. I always enjoy discussing/arguing about Irish politics with people, particularly if they have a very different view than mine, always nice to get a fresh perspective on things. :)

Also, nothing suggests Vert is off come January or beyond. Maybe next summer if we can't get into CL, I can see it.

Likely nothing as the ship was not made to end up where it was and couldn't really handle the environment hence banging while cooling and the door not being able to stay closed when unlocked. This one is almost definitely not a monster as everything was dead except Orson and the pipe thing is a real phenomenon, no need for an alien.

This is definitely the Doctor. We are getting his perception at the beginning but likely he absent-mindedly wrote it while talking to himself and thinking.

4. The Doctor Dances. Where we really get to look into Jack' personality. Him and the Doctor have got to be the best friends I've seen in a television show. Where he swaps his sonic blaster with a banana I lost it. Also, Rose and the Doctor get a lot closer.


5. Last of the Time Lords. Whatever the Doctor goes through, he hates the part where his enemy dies. And though the Master was quite his enemy, when he mourns over his dead body and rocks back and forth you know that he loves people's lives, maybe a bit too much.


6. The Waters of Mars. When the Doctor saves her, you know he's gone too far. When he first starts going on about he makes the rules of time, you know he is doing wrong. But when you take a stop back, you realize that Doctor Who has changed the way you look at things like saving people. The Doctor is doing the right thing really.

true,serialist,canada,East Midlands Canuck,"Right, okay.

There is no flat fee in Canada, to be sure, but drugs are covered and controlled by the Provincial Health plans, whatever they may be (it varies from province to province). Furthermore, the elderly, the military and vets, prisoners, native and inuit groups and those with certain chronic conditions all qualify for drug coverage by the federal government. Further coverage is provided by the provinces based on their own legislation (various other chronic conditions not otherwise covered, low income, children, etc.). Furthermore drugs are a claimable expense on your tax return, for tax credits.

From what I understand, drug costs work similarly in Canada as to here: the provinces negotiate to buy drugs, and then disseminate them at a cost. Canadian provinces don't really have the buying power that the NHS would. Canada as a whole wouldn't have the buying power of the NHS. Thus, higher costs. Not to mention patent issues, and so on and so forth. I don't really know how the math works for the tax credits, but adding up the costs for the prescriptions I claimed on my last tax return, and comparing them to how much they would have costed on the UK flat fee system, the British way didn't come out much ahead. Add in the tax credit and the gap narrows even further. This of course doesn't include any drugs dispensed in a hospital setting, whether an inpatient or outpatient. 

If you're only taking in to consideration prescription costs, then I kind of feel like your argument that the Canadian outpatient care system being awful is a bit weak.  ",0,1410834247,null,0,false,0,ckji9b5,t3_2ghdqi,t1_ckji9b5,t1_ckjhf55,null,1426991769,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

2005 rolls in, and with it Christopher Eccleston as the first reboot doctor. Everyone hails him as their favorite Doctor.

Later that year, Tennant takes over. Everyone forgets Eccleston ever existed and calls David their favorite Doctor.

Even after 5 years of having Tennant as the Doctor, within months of Matt Smith taking over the role everyone swore up and down that he was the all time best Doctor because bowties are indeed very cool.

Now Capaldi has come in and once again everyone hails the newest Doctor as their favorite and the best.

Why?

I'll tell you: you're all being tricked. BBC has planted a bit of code to interact with and modify your senses into each and every episode so that whoever the new Doctor is becomes your new favorite without you ever noticing it one bit.

In short....they're using a perception filter on you. ;)

Still, no great harm done I suppose - it's not like they need an army of Whovians to take over the universe with.

&gt; Schengen cooperation enhances this freedom by enabling citizens to cross internal borders without being subjected to border checks. **The border-free Schengen Area** guarantees free movement to more than 400 million EU citizens

http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm

Ireland and the UK aren't in Schengen but they have their own border-free arrangement instead, the Common Travel Area. Driving between Ireland and the UK the border isn't any more noticeable than between two internal counties, at most if you keep your eyes peeled you might notice a ""welcome to county X"" sign.

The CTA is in fact the only reason Ireland *isn't* in Schengen, the UK doesn't want to join that and if Ireland were to join it would have to start border checks on the border with Northern Ireland, which would become an external Schengen border. 

If Scotland became independent it is proposed that there would be no ""border"" between Scotland and England in exactly the same way as there is currently no border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

EDIT: to give you an idea, here's an image of [the border between NI and the Republic] (http://www.islandvulnerability.org/borderirlukswanlinbar.jpg) You see the tarmac change on the road? That's the border, that is it, two independent countries but you wouldn't know it was there unless you *really* looked for it.

So, we are saying that its wrong for Scotland to want to keep the currency they were handed 170 years ago (and have relied on for that time) after their own was taken? 

I personally think that if you dismantle a nation's currency and replace it with your own, you don't withdraw it when the nation wants the right to determine its future, and thus leave it hanging out to dry. That's not what the referendum is about. For all we can talk about what will happen with currency unions, trident, etc, we forget what the vote is for: Should the nation of Scotland be able to democratically determine its future with a government it elected? That is all.

Currently, with a Tory govt that received, what 25%, of the overall UK vote, and 1 MSP(Dumfries, the most southern constituency) out of 129 in Scotland, Scotland does not have a government that it voted for.

true,Callduron,null,null,"At the heart of this is our macro economic policy. High unemployment keeps labour submissive and wages low. I think the government, like the Labour governments before it and the Thatcher government that started it all sees a high benefits bill as a reasonable price to pay for a docile labour force. It's an ideological choice born out of the brutal battles in the 70s between workers and the government including the Winter Of Discontent. It may also be that global economic conditions make it incredibly hard to get anywhere close to full employment anyway but we don't know because they're not trying.

For people wanting a more equal society we should back a push for greater employment, ideally through a clever combination of private sector growth and public enterprise. When I say private sector growth I don't mean by cannibalising our public infrastructure (which is invariably inefficient) but by growing (subsidising) new internationally competitive businesses and reducing our balance of trade deficit by making the country money as well as private concerns that offer services inland. Public enterprise is a rather forgotten element of British life but once we had great nationally owned organisations like the Girobank, the Post Office, BT which made us money while still being publicly owned simply because they were run really well. Iirc BT had the highest profits of any organisation in Europe when it was sold off, we pissed that income away.

I'd like to see new public for-profit ventures start with a view to providing jobs while making money for the country. We've been loath to assess the profitability of a public enterprise including how much money it saves us from not paying benefit bills. The thing with a public enterprise is that it doesn't need to be as profitable as a private enterprise - tax is a non issue and reducing the benefit bills is of value.

One obvious place to start is with housing. There seems to be a terror of jeopardising the housing bubble lest the house of cards so thinly reconstructed after 2008 comes tumbling back down again. I think we need a government with the conviction to build housing without being scared of the supply/demand effect on our over-valued housing market. Now this doesn't have to be a black hole in the budget of building houses and giving them to people on the council lists. It could be a for-profit low cost housing building business, like a state owned Barrett.

Another good place would be more work targeted at disabled people of whom we have rather a lot. I don't usually support affirmative action but I do like Remploy. A few years back they closed all the Remploy factories under the view that it was patronising but a friend who worked there loved it and was very sorry to lose his job. He was making kettles in Brixton. Seems to me it was a lot more patronising for officials to make up their minds it was demeaning rather than ask the people who chose to work there. It would be great to see those factories started up again. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remploy

Coming back to the Work Programme I do know a few people it's really helped including me once. I got a job after being coached fairly intensively by an adviser that I wouldn't have got without him. But there are isolated jewels in a system that is more about claiming credit than helping people. If a provider has 1000 people on its books if it did nothing for a month some, say, 5% would find jobs anyway. That ""counts"" as 50 people ""helped back to work."" Even if they did nothing.

Another point is that the letter is defending the Work Programme. Most of that programme is actually advice and cv/interview training not workfare.

As for workfare we need to exterminate the idea that asking people to work and not paying them is anything other than disgusting. There's an argument that because it's so hard to get paid work it's good to work unpaid so you've got something on your cv. That's a circular argument. Inexperienced young workers can't get paid work because it's so easy to hire them without paying them. If they do the work unpaid employers don't need to pay them. So of course they can't find jobs because it's actually irrational to offer a job when you can offer ""work experience"" instead. People need to not settle for being exploited and challenge authorities that try to force them like the wonderful Cait Reilly.

For expediency purposes, the Yes campaign cannot divulge this because the response to their answer would be an effective 'Sounds like you're all set. You obviously don't need the pound then, so we wont give you it.' Its petty, but thats the game. 

On the other hand, the No campaign will not divulge what additional powers would be transferred to an independent Scotland. Why? Probably because these powers depend on what % votes yes. I would guarantee that the powers after a 20% yes vote would be far more minor than those given after a 49% yes vote, simply because there are different amounts of people who need to be kept happy.

I've seen a lot of people saying this but I've not gained a good understanding as to why, so I'm curious. As someone who had the exact opposite reaction, I'm trying to puzzle out why so many were disappointed by this.

I thought the episode was brilliant because the monster wasn't a monster. My take was that the ""monster"" being all in our heads makes it all the creepier. I personally always have been a little afraid of the dark, even now as an adult, and I think the episode makes an interesting statement that even in the absence of an *actual* monster, our own fear either can have the power to terrify us just as much as a real monster, if not more, OR it can it can have the power to propel us to be something greater, inspiring bravery and action in the face of our fears. 

Beyond that, I think the episode took on a whole new meaning — bigger than any monster itself — when Clara's words to the (assumed) Doctor in his youth first planted that lesson in his head. Besides being a shocking twist, that the monster wasn't real and that Clara had seen, inspired &amp; comforted the Doctor as a child, it isn't much of a leap to see how that moment shaped his life. He's used her words in past episodes and spoken about fear and how we handle it many times, and he regularly faces fear with great bravery, power and success, saving the world(s) and making a difference. His whole speech about fear being a super power really defines a key part of the doctor and means more than any one monster because it's how he faces all of them. We've seen numerous times (Blink &amp; Midnight included) where a big part of why and how the Doctor is able to save the day is his ability to use fear as a super power, instead of giving up or running away, or panicking like many humans do. Not that Midnight worked how he wanted it to, but in that one actually we see more the opposite — how all of the humans let their fears get to them so much that it pushed most of them to behave horribly and make the situation worse. 

To me, the character development and the deeper look at how fear plays a role in the series as a whole and the Doctor as a person and entity — and the lesson all of that teaches us — WAS the payoff.",0,1410840016,null,0,false,0,ckjl1z3,t3_2gb92v,t1_ckjl1z3,t1_ckj75o9,null,1426990326,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Yet they are still separate countries. They're still independent with their own foreign policies, laws and governments. What we'd like may be another type of union, but it would be one between two independent states rather than two linked together into one single state. That is the difference.

That is because they don't share 300 years of history. A language. Large swathes of culture. Scotland, I would argue, has a huge degree of self determination as it is - with separate Laws, Parliament, Social policies.

&gt; Yes we wouldn't mind sharing the pound, but plenty of countries share currencies, and yes we would like to keep an open border policy, but the UK already has one with Ireland. The prescidents are there, and we are more than willing to negotiate, 

You have these things now. Why jeopardise them?

&gt; But here's the one thing I don't think people down south realise: Despite us wanting independence, we still want to be allies and friends. We want to work together, trade together and have agreements. We don't want to take a chisel and carve a new tectonic plate to drag ourselves over nearer the Scandinavians, nor do we want to build a wall between Berwick and the Solway. We still want to be friends.
&gt; 

This is the part that really saddens me, because unwittingly you have polarised the argument into one of identity. *'We'* I *am* you! I'm half Scottish, I have lived in Scotland for 5 years, I got married there and gained a degree there. I identify as Scottish, then Welsh, with a bit of Suffolk thrown in - but above all I am BRITISH. And yet the country of my Grandfather and Mother is on the brink of tearing itself out of a union that has served both it and the whole UK spectacularly well - and the best that can be said is 'We'll still be friends and you can come and visit'....

If we're going down the lines of empty platitudes, right now I feel like I'm watching a brother, who is also my business partner, make the most terrible decision possible. He is, in effect, taking his share or the businesses savings and going to buy a timeshare, or herbalife, or some othr vacuous product sold by silver tongued snake oil merchants. And despite pointing out the glaring flaws in his plans, he has already mapped out his new life on the promised returns and cannot be dissuaded. All that is left is to remove him from the joint account and try and protect the remaining family assets as best possible.

&gt; Seriously, we love you guys, even if poll results recently show you don't feel the same. We just want to be another country. That's all.

'Just want to be another country'.... is a juxtaposition of words so gapingly a odds with one another, I don't know where to begin. What you are invoking is to become a separate NATION. Scotland already IS another country.

And as I've already pointed out, discounting the frothing mouths on both sides, no one feels ill wil lto any individuals on either side of that arbitary line across the UK. I just feel desparately SAD, and worried - for my remaining family in Scotland. For my own 'home land'. For the Highlands and Islands which are closer to my soul than any other patch of land I've yet found on Earth. For the poor of Scotland who rely on the solvency of the state for their survival... for all the Yes voters who are going to have their fleeting dream of a Perfect Scotland rudely shattered over the coming years.

We are one and the same. We are a Union together. Our families, our businesses, our hopes and dreams for a better future for everyone together are all gloriously unaware of the 'line on the map' - because they've been afforded the luxury of that for 3 centuries and prospered because of it.

That expert would be [Debretts](http://www.debretts.com). It's not really that complicated because we don't have much history of women receiving titles in their own right, so the question doesn't really arise for most titles.

As a general rule, as an extension of the tradition that a woman takes her husband's name on marriage, women receive a courtesy title from their husband, but men don't receive a courtesy title from their wife. In the same way as the wife of Mr John Smith may be addressed as Mrs John Smith, the wife of the Duke of Cambridge is the Duchess of Cambridge and the wife of Prince Michael of Kent is Princess Michael of Kent (not Princess Marie).

The equivalent title isn't always used as the courtesy title, so the wife of Sir John Smith is Lady Smith, not Dame Jane Smith. The wife of a Baron is also Lady Smith, with Baroness Smith reserved for a woman who is a peer in her own right.

The husband remains Mr John Smith if his wife receives any if these titles.

On the Queen and Prince Philip, he gained no title directly from his marriage. The wife of the King is a Queen, but the husband of the Queen is just Mr Philip Mountbatten unless given a title in his own right. He was made a Duke on their wedding day, making them the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh. When the Queen succeeded to the throne, she made him a Prince in his own right.

The logic of deterrent is that you need to be able to make a devastating response even in the case of a nuclear assault. Because you cannot destroy a missile safely once it is in the air, it is all about being close to the potential targets, and being the first one who strikes back.

Clearly, the US is able to do such, because it has weapons all over the world and close to Russia, and this makes life safer for the US. However, in the case of a nuclear standoff, it would be safer for an enemy of the US to nuke their weapons sites first. Which includes the Scottish Trident site. And Scotland would not be able to do anything about it.

Clearly, there is the metaphor of a ""nuclear shield"" which protects the US and their allies all the same. Something like a umbrella against missiles, I think. But I am not convinced that this would work. It would require the US to take an attack to a Scottish arms site so serious that it accepts the warranted destruction of all the US. II doubt any US government would do that.

So, essentially, the US has the advantage, and Scotland has the risk.

&gt; Part of which is Scottish.

I must admit I'm not an expert, but from my reading on the Union of the two Crowns and the subsequent legal situation, I suspect that the answer to the question ""how much UK debt is legally Scottish in the event of independence"" is *zero*. (Obviously this excludes debt actually taken out by the Scottish Parliament itself, if any.)

The Scots have not threatened to unilaterally secede. But if they did, it would likely be illegal under UK law but legal under Scottish law, which opens the question of which takes priority, and it may very well be Scottish. On the other hand, [Quebec's ability to secede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_re_Secession_of_Quebec) is probably relevant (but not identical) to Scotland's. However you look at it, a Yes vote would put great moral and political pressure on Whitehall, it would effectively state that the UK has lost the consent of the Scots to govern them.

Personally, I expect that the Scots will vote Yes by a small minority, and then over the next couple of years the negotiations will whittle that down from full independence to increased powers of devolution, exactly what the Scots wanted on the referendum in the first place but Whitehall refused to allow. That refusal shows exactly why so many Scots are planning to vote Yes: the UK government doesn't give a shit for their wishes. (On the other hand, Whitehall doesn't give a shit for anyone else either, except the money markets and the banks, so why should Scotland be treated any differently?)

But in the event that Scotland did *legally* and unilaterally secede (unlikely, I grant), the debt taken on by the UK is the UK's debt, even if some benefit goes to Scotland, and Scotland has no legal or moral requirement to take on that debt. Not to put too fine a point on it, the Scots will be doing you a favour by agreeing to accept some of your debt.


&gt; In your analogy, the friend who's been renting your house, would be demanding to own the house while refusing to pay the mortgage unless you also handed over some control of your other finances.

That's not my analogy. My analogy was that I made a gift of the house to my friend, or child, out of my own free will. (A free gift is not necessarily made graciously, and by the nasty attitudes I see here on this subreddit, the English will not be even the tiniest bit gracious if the Yes vote wins.)

Let's call my imaginary friend Alex. If I take out a loan in *my* name, then use that money to buy a house which I put in *Alex's* name, the debt is mine even if Alex tells me to bugger off, he's keeping the house. He has no legal requirement to accept a share of the debt, and I have no legal way to compel him to take it on.

This is *especially* the case if the money borrowed went into a single joint bank account with my income and Alex's income, and there is no way of accounting for whether the money I spent on the house came from my income, Alex's income, or the borrowed funds. Alex can reasonably argue that I actually used that borrowed money to buy the Trident missiles I'm keeping, and that his oil income paid for the house. But even if Alex's oil income is insufficient to pay for the house, it's my name on the loan contract, not his. I can no more unilaterally make him a co-borrower than I could unilaterally declare that Vladimir or Obama owe half the debt.

All this is, of course, arguing by analogy which is a dubious thing to do. Neither you nor I are experts in the constitutional law of the United Kingdom, and no doubt the lawyers will have lots of fun debating who has to do what. All I'm doing is giving an analogy that demonstrates it is at least *plausible* that Scotland could walk out of this debt-free, and the only way for the UK to stop them is to become a criminal state that holds a gun to their head. Judging by some of the attitudes here, I think there is a small minority who actually hope the Scots vote Yes just so that there will be an excuse to do exactly that. **England prevails!**

I don't think the UK's prospects are quite as healthy as you say. As more of our services get sold off to satisfy the desires of the wealthy we lose more and more of our potential and our resources. It's entirely possible that with the right leader in place in Scotland they could actually do much better than rUK in the long term. A large scale investment into industry, for example, would see short term difficulties but an excellent return in the long run.

A single economic shock would be enough to give the right a chance to grab some influence back- the Tories aren't exactly out of the picture up there, by any stretch. 

&gt;A large scale investment into industry,

With what money? Scotland stands a fair chance of starting out with a deficit. You'd be talking Government investment in industry over a non-trivial, long term basis- and none of the Scottish parties are ideologically inclined to go for that kind of thing. 

&gt;Plus Cameron fucked up the prospect of further devolution when he poo-poohed the devo max thing last year (or whenever it was).

If Cameron screwed up then, he's certainly back-pedalling now. 

This scare has given devolution the greatest shot in the arm it's had for decades. [This could lead to something extremely promising, in the event of the union sticking about](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29213418)

Spot a time when labour didnt have a majority.

1992	Lab; 49 Seats 34.4%	Cons; 11 Seats 25.7%	
1997	56 Seats Lab; 41.0%	Cons; 0 Seats 17.5%

I wonder what the cons did after 1992 that lost them so many seats

LIBOR fixing was variously reported as one of the most significant frauds of the last century. It manipulated the interest rates on trillions of loans and derivatives. Please tell me which bank board members went to jail for it. 

The crash wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bubble encouraged by the lack of government regulation and oversight, the exponential expansion of derivatives and securitization etc. The senior bankers at Goldman Sachs knew exactly what was going on - they were betting against their own derivative products - nobody from Goldman Sachs went to jail. Nobody else went to jail for the numerous and egregarious banking and mortgage frauds perpetrated prior, during and after the property bubble crash.

People do not go to jail if they have previously bought the politicians with millions of dollars worth of bribes, no matter what white collar crime they commit.

I would rather read a stats breakdown of goals scored and times, rather than wade through whole sentences describing them. Try and give your own opinions on what happened and how the team is going, this is what readers want, we can all look up result sheets quicker than reading an article. 

For example, while Hazard didn't score, anyone watching the game would have to admit he played magnificently in this game, but you don't mention it anywhere. An opinion of whether or not Costa's arrival means Hazard is now more free to play more of a provider role rather than having to always shoulder the burden and pressure of scoring would be interesting.

It would be the equivalent of a couple divorcing, giving one partner the house, but letting the other one remortgage it as many times as they like - while the new owner remains jointly liable for the new loans. How much do you trust your ex, and their good judgement? 

What the Scots can do is create their own currency and peg it to the pound - so that 1SP = 1GBP. Then, as long as they take a reasonable view on finance, it'll stay that way.

But the value of your currency depends on you being sensible. In Zimbabwe, the government was not sensible, and we saw the craziness there: nobody wanted Zim Dollars because the government were busy printing them faster than people could spend them - so a loaf of bread cost over a trillion, and went up in price for every second you took to get to the counter.

Scotland would never go that crazy, but it illustrates the point. Of course Scotland want to retain a respected and strong currency which would allow them to borrow money at very low interest rates. And of course, the British government could never allow such a thing, because if the inexperienced Scots find themselves unable to pay back the loans, Britain would have to in order to prevent the pound from losing value. And the Scots would be under no obligation to pay back the British - if they even could.",0,1410854621,null,0,false,0,ckjp9d6,t3_2gh8dm,t1_ckjp9d6,t1_ckj7g4v,null,1426988364,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

But yeah, for all those who indulge in a bit of ""casual"" racism the recent events have given them a great excuse to point the finger of whatever* at anyone who looks a bit funny.

It saddens me that all the faults of modern society are now apparently the fault of multiculturalism. Living in Sweden I see the same thing: the recent elections have given the neo-nazi idiots 13% of the vote. *13%!!!* Twenty bloody seats in the Riksdag! And their platform? ""Multiculturalism is wrong."" These sodding wankers have got enough ordinary wankers believing that society is collapsing because a few people have got darker skin. And it's got very little to do with religion, I think. Religion is just an excuse for people to blame johnny foreigner for all today's ills.

Twenty years ago it was the blacks. Today it's the muslims. And people don't need to have a beard or robe to get shot as they run to a tube station. The west needs to acknowledge the fact: whle we have generally improved as a society we are still inherently racist.
