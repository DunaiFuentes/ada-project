* Scope of the war (Much bigger, more advanced country vs smaller, more basic country) only involves 2 nations. We could start talking about Afghanistan and Iraq but that's been done to death (And I didn't agree with them either). 

* Willingness to ignore/accept civilian deaths by Israel - Although Hamas is far from innocent, I believe the current death toll of non combatants is around 600 to 1 despite the fact there are ~8million people in Israel and 1.8million in Gaza

* Slowness in responding to threat in a more targeted, less collateral way (sending in the troops)

* Logical fallacy in justification on the side of Israel (We will not suffer this again, etc) while Gaza has a very real reason to be angry, although it should realistically be directed towards Britain and not Israel in a lot of ways.

* World War II, for example, involved outright declaration of war between developed nations with standing armies. Hamas is a terrorist organisation but it's the only thing approaching a military they have, wheras Israel have one of the most advanced and highly trained armies on the planet. I would honestly think if Israel and the UK got into a war, Israel would come out on top.

* Pick-pockets and other thieves are warned that they are being watched and of the potential punishment they face if caught. 

* I'm not sure about the last one, but I would assume that any sensible pub would make it clear that it will not tolerate violent conduct from it patrons.

Personally I think that the potential victims should absolutely be warned of the possible dangers and advised as to what they themselves can do to minimise the risk. Posters such as the one in question certainly do have their place. But there needs to be equal, if not heavier, targeting of the other side. 

Men and women in general both need to be educated about sexual consent to avoid any confusion; men in particular need to be educated about how to treat women; and the full on rapists (the ones who know very well that what they are doing is rape and simply don't care) need to be warned that they will be severely punished for their actions.

You just used a tldr on an article and posited a statement of definition that is totally false compared to the article. You're a hypocrite if you think its okay to give your opinion of someone elses' opinion without people first reading said opinion. 

""Israelis are the victims"" - she doesn't say that and I don't think she infers it either. She says they're defending themselves, and what would your government do in the same situation.

""The troubles over there"" - she says its an extremely complex situation.

""The media makes them the bad guy"" - the media isn't mentioned once in the whole fucking piece.

""Because everyone hates Jews"" - more bullshit - the survey showed 8% of UK and 20% of Ireland. That's not everyone; that's a vocal minority as she points out.   

You just talked a lot of shite yerself. I fucking hate INM for my own personal reasons. But even I can't bring myself to not call bullshit on your bullshit opinion of an opinion piece. 

She was talking about how the Israel/Hamas clusterfuck's sphere came to NI because some fucktard decided to hit a synogogue.

And she makes a good point when she says what about the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq, the Sudan, and many other countries. Pick out one post on R/NI that talks about the Ukraine plane crash, or any of those conflicts. Where's the march through Lurgan for those dead innocents? Or the petition to the British Government about embargoing them?

Even when the post appeared about the synogogue being attack some cunt put up rhetoric stating: ""Attacking Jews and Synagogues is only endorsing the Zionist ideal that Israel should exist."" That's clear anti-zionism/ anti-semitism, right here on reddit. 

So the person writing the article at least has the right to debate the subject.

It's maybe not the best idea to just define what is passed on to the next generation through money listed on a computer; it's more effective to measure their whole economic status relative to the economy they live in.

&gt;The logic of ""some kids are born with nothing, therefore no one can be born with anything"" is terrible too. Wealth inequality may not be fair but just taxing everyone of everything when they die is stupid and unworkable. Being born into poverty is obviously a bad thing and a real social issue but it is completely irrelevant to inheritance tax.

Wealth inequality is necessary in manageable forms, I've not argued otherwise. My point was mainly that 0% inheritance tax does not make this problem better and it does carry relevance as it does help to determine starting economic status.

It says that one in three reported rapes occur when the victim has been drinking, but doesn't really explain why that is necessarily relevant. It relies far too heavily on implication and hence comes across as suggesting that the fact that the victim drinking is the sole cause of the rapes (which, of course, it isn't. It is a limitation in the prevention of rape). It could equally say that [percentage] of rapes occur when the victim has brown hair. 

Of course, I'm not suggesting that the state of intoxication of the victim is entirely unrelated, nor am I suggesting that hair colour is in any way related, but just that this poster contributes nothing of value. 

At best it is merely stating a fact that has no bearing on anything whatsoever and at worst it is implying a causal link (hence the accusations of victim blaming).

To give the benefit of the doubt to the NHS, I assume that they were going for something along the lines of ""try not to get too drunk, there are dangerous people out there and you need to have your wits about you"". Fine. There are and you should. But this is not what they have produced.

NO ONE appears keener on the struggle for women's rights than Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, chair of the Law Society's equality and diversity committee. Shocked that fewer women than men were taking home seven-figure pay pots as partners in wealthy law firms, she marked International Women's Day with a ""speed networking"" get-together in the City for women lawyers whose talents were being ""woefully underused"" by the prejudiced male establishment.

Her concern for equality vanishes, however, when she is confronted by Muslim women, who are unlikely to see as much money in a lifetime as a partner in a City law firm makes in a year. Scott-Moncrieff is an energetic supporter of the Law Society's advice on Sharia-compliant wills (Eyes passim). Solicitors, the Law Society says, should tell Muslim clients that ""male heirs [should] in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir"" and ""non-Muslims may not inherit at all"".

The Law Society's attempt to treat women as second-class citizens is now losing it what few friends it had. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) had originally backed the Law Society's decision to go beyond the simple statement that Muslim clients were as free as everyone else to leave their money as they pleased, and endorse a conservative theology. But after pressure from secular and feminist groups and coverage in the Eye, the SRA said last week that ""given the concerns that have been raised"" it was withdrawing its endorsement.

The SRA is the Law Society's independent regulatory arm, responsible for monitoring the conduct of the 125,000 solicitors in England and Wales. The Law Society looks lonely and exposed now that even its sister organisation has dumped it, not least because the SRA's U-turn may not have been driven solely by an outbreak of feminist principle. Lawyers for the Southall Black Sisters women's rights group and the anti-Sharia One Law for All campaign, run by liberal Muslims and ex-Muslims, had threatened to take both the SRA and the Law Society to court for breaking the Equality Act of 2010. The act states that public bodies must ""pay due regard"" to the need to eliminate discrimination. Neither the Law Society nor the SRA consulted about the effects on women from ethnic minorities of recommending that they be valued at half the price of men.

It ""beggars belief,"" thundered Pragna Patel of Southall Black Sisters, ""that the Law Society had shown a racist and callous disregard for minority women's struggles for equality in the face of illiberal religious power.""

The SRA had to back down because it clearly is a public regulator subject to equality law. Feminist lawyers told the Eye that, if they could prove that the Law Society was more than a solicitors' private club, then they would say it, too, was a public body and take it to court in the SRA's place. Ms Scott-Moncrieff would then be asked whether her concern for women's equality included all women regardless of income, colour or creed or it was confined to white women from the upper middle class, yearning for the right to ""speed network"" in the City.

I mean Rose was caring and kind hearted, but she went back in time to save her father, which resulted in major chaos. Donna did great things too, but there were also episodes where she did not really do much, like Silence in the Library or Midnight or when we were introduced to her she told the doctor, ""he deserved it"" reffering to her finace who had been killed. Later on, she changed her mind and said, ""no, he did not."" This shows that she is flawed.

Turns out the RAC provided recovery is only within 6-8miles of home (iirc) - which screwed me up when my engine died in the Lake District, home being near Cambridge. The thing that got me was when I rang up to increase the mileage on my policy, as I was going to double it in a year. The response I got was they could only cover me upto 10,000 with that provider, so I asked what if I go over that the lady said ""you can't"". Great.

But when I asked about fully comp insurance if it covered me for riding other bikes, as I could borrow a friend's 125 whilst mine was fixed, they said sure. So dilligently paid the extra blahblahblah... paperwork finally comes through and it says I'm covered fully comprehensively but NOT for riding other motorbikes.

true,Bearmodule,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt;Dear Mr Bearmodule

&gt;Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill

&gt;Thank you for your email on the Data Retention and Investigatory Bill (DRIP). I regret that I was unable to be in Parliament on 15 July to participate in both the debate and vote against the Bill. The 'whirlwind' short notice given to MPs meant that I was unable to reschedule a scrutiny committee visit to Birmingham planned some time ago. 

&gt;I have serious concerns about DRIP, which I believe could potentially bring about massive and disproportionate invasion of privacy. I appreciate that new and clearer legislation on how our intelligence agencies carry out surveillance is required. I also appreciate that those laws must put at their core the right to freely receive and impart information without interference.

&gt;Unfortunately, DRIP fails to address the reasons the European Court of Justice struck down the previous EU Data Retention Directive law in the first place. The Government claims that a 'sudden emergency' has arisen, justifying fast track legislation. This is not the case. The CJEU judgement was handed down over three months ago, and well before the Queen's Speech in May this year. The Government has had ample time to bring forward legislation in the usual way if it so wished. The Government's justification for pushing through DRIP as ""emergency legislation"" takes away the opportunity for proper and effective parliamentary scrutiny. Without such meaningful scrutiny it is impossible to assess the full implications of the Bill nor does it allow us to come to an informed decision.

&gt;It is my understanding that the Bill will expire on 31 December 2016 - two and a half years away. Therefore, I added my name and supported the sunset clause amendment tabled by Tom Watson MP, which proposed to amend the sunset expiry date to six months - to 31st December 2014. 

&gt;The amendment was aimed at reflecting the supposed temporary nature of the Bill, to provide the opportunity to debate the appalling lack of democractic accountability during this process and to ensure a prompt review of the proposed extensions to the RIPA interception regime. It is disappointing that this amendment did not pass. The role of Parliament is to scrutinise legislation, to prevent unintended consequences and for MPs to defend the freedom and liberty of their constituents. I feel strongly that this Bill could undermine all three of these principles.

&gt;Thank you again for writing to me and I can assure you I will continue to follow this issue closely.

&gt;Yours sincerely,

&gt;Yasmin Qureshi

But wanted to put in a glowing word about Brighton. It's such an amazing place! Maybe stay on Campus if you can. You will meet many more friends. I lived off campus and found it difficult to meet people this way. (I lived with my partner) Personally I loved being so close to everything, but I did envy the friendships that my friends living on campus made! But the place itself is amazing. Like mentioned its easy enough to get into the centre of town (just know it's about an hour walk, but 10 mins on the train, 20/30 on the bus) And being so close to London is a blessing. You can go out partying there and be back sleeping in your own bed! But the ""student life"" is great, whether you prefer clubbing, pubs or fancy bars there will so many perfect places to go out to. Not to mention the people. Brighton locals are so happy and relaxed and I assure you you will see many a cray people about town cos thats how the place rolls! Also the surrounding county like Devils Dyke, Seven Sisters ect. are some of the most picturesque placees in the UK! So make time to see the area also! Walk lots too, Lewes that is right down the road from you is a wonderfully typical old british village, as well as so so many more in the area! But no matter how difficult you course may be, enjoy the town, people and surrounds. I hope you had the best time and make some  great new friends! Though I am sure that in a place as welcoming as Brighton you will!

true,bzva74,null,null,"I think it is still too early to say anything about anyone cutting it or not cutting it. Chadli is still on WC break, right? I think his footwork is good enough for Poch's needs. He can put a shot on goal and be a target in the middle- the Jay Rodriguez role. I'm not saying it'll happen, I'm just wondering if it may be too early to talk about Chadli. 

I think Chiriches and Bentaleb deserve an honest chance in the next month. I remember seeing Kaboul down the wings a few times and Dawson struggling to mark opposing wingers who crept in behind the attacking fullbacks- these auxiliary demands are perfect for a skilled, athletic defender like Chiriches. His passing is usually pretty crisp (I already forgot that Lee Cattermole scored on us- it never happened nanananana) and he has played RB for us in Europa and the Romanian NT. He knows how to defend across the backline. 

Bentaleb looks like he can be a more mobile Capoue/Wanyama player. I recall the announcer praising how well Capoue asserted himself in front of his defense and drifted across the back line, pitching in behind the fullbacks and in between the center backs. Bentaleb has a work rate and defensive quality that will put even Capoue and Sandro to shame. Plus he has a little more ambitious vertical passing and can score a screamer once in a while. His skill set would complement our B2B CM (be it Holtby, Paulinho, Mason, Dembele, Carroll, Schneiderlin, etc) and give them maximum flexibility to work their games. I agree that we may see Dembele and Paulinho failing to break into Poche's team. Paulinho suffers from ""right place right time"" syndrome, which is awesome for a striker (guys ranging from Defoe to Inzaghi played successful careers with little technical ability) but Poche will demand more from his CMs. Yesterday most of the attacks started with Eriksen dropping deep from an AM position. That's well and good, because Eriksen is a smart player who can start attacks from deep, but to maximize our numbers on the break we should probably have a CM or attacking fullback moving the ball forward aggressively, and I don't see Dembele or Paulinho fitting in.",0,1406207143,null,0,false,0,cj6ep42,t3_2bjyh5,t1_cj6ep42,t1_cj62pky,null,1434875317,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

But taking ITK without context will more often than not result in a disappointment.

The Griezmann story is particularly interesting in this standpoint, the major papers are all reporting it.....but none of the noted writers (Stobart, Collomose, Hytner, Burt, Dimarzio for example) who get fairly accurate information about Spurs seem to be publishing anything about the story and we know that every one of them would want to have that story out their if they had the confirmation. Lyall Thomas of SSN has gone as far as stating that we have made no offer for Griezmann....yet the national papers continue to push the story.  The ITKs amazingly have almost all said they have heard nothing or flat out said that we are not looking at Griezmann......So if you look at the full shape of the story we have none of the generally accurate writers commenting on the story and we have the less accurate ITKs actually denying the story completely.  But the story is getting pushed through by less accurate sources in the media....sounds a bit like an agency trying to get their player in the press to put pressure on people to make a move.

As to how people get the information....that is easy, but also the reason that ITK is prone to inaccuracy.  Human nature...lots of people like to brag, if you work for or regularly with a football club, at some point you will be told some information....at the clubs the transfer rumours are almost water cooler talk.  Instead of Lydia from accounting screwing the guy from marketing you hear about John from accounting doing work with a bank in Spain and Greg in operations mentioned that one of the physios was talking about Sociedad. 

Some of the past ITKs that were accurate have admitted how they got their information in the past and why they no longer get it...one was a guy who worked with an estate agency that Spurs used for the players, he was freinds with people at the club from interacting with them professionally and would get pieces of information when they would meet up for a pint after work....another one used to get information because he was dating a girl who was someone's assistant at the club.

And by ""copious amounts"", I mean how much more would be consumed than is currently consumed. And how many new people would try it.

hm, no, but i'll read on.

&gt;she doesn't say that and I don't think she infers it either. She says they're defending themselves, and what would your government do in the same situation.

When you talk about an extremely complex situation like theirs, and only explain that Israel must defend itself, while ignoring Israel's offensive which has been much, much worse than what Palestinians have done --considering both casualties of the war and disruption of daily life via bombings and repairs -- you are deliberately not telling the whole truth. In fact, you're barely telling a half-truth. 

If you truly believe, and by you this time I mean /u/hi-Bob, that Israel is being somewhat passive in a bid to defend itself, and not extremely aggressive, then your head is up your hole. Just take a look at the number of casualties, seven times (over 7,000) more casualties on the Palestinian side than in Israel ([source](http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stat/deaths.html)). Furthermore, Palestinians are suffering a blockade ([source](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-demand-end-gaza-blockade-1938822013)) and are, effectively, prisoners within their own country ([source](http://rt.com/op-edge/174980-warsaw-ghetto-prisoners-palestinians/)). Therefore, when someone tries to argue that Israel is only defending themselves, it's not only sickening but painfully ignorant at the expense of innocent people.

For God's sake, they're bombing Palestinian towns, bulldozing the lot and creating houses for Jewish settlers in their place.

&gt;You just talked a lot of shite yerself.

This isn't bullshit, it's real life.

&gt;Where's the march through Lurgan for those dead innocents? Or the petition to the British Government about embargoing them?

People can have sympathy for more than one case. The Palestine-Israel conflict has sympathizers here, many of whom sympathise for reasons we already know and this is a silly question. As for the petition, er, [here's one of about 100 I found within 10 seconds of a Google search](http://www.change.org/petitions/don-t-let-syria-down).

I have to be honest, you come across as someone who is unfamiliar with the trouble there. Your response to mine was less like someone who knows what's going on in the world and more of someone with an English degree trying to antagonise, and doing a very poor job.

American here and I must say, your description of how this is playing out in the States is extremely well stated. You've nailed the political nuances and strategy perfectly. I'd like to expand a bit if I may. 

[Colorado and Washington, the green states in this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._state) are the vanguard of the legalization effort in the U.S. They are open for business, so to speak, and have licensed vendors to sell cannabis for public consumption. They are both closely analyzing how their implementation of legalization is affecting taxable revenue, business development, crime statistics and public health, among other things. The rest of the states are either considering or actively pursuing similar local legalization efforts but are likely waiting for at least one tax year of information from Colorado and Washington before implementing their own set of regulations. Basically, it's a 'wait and see' maneuver while Colorado and Washington gather their lessons learned for the rest of the states. 

Additionally, there is very little vocal opposition at the national level on this. It is really surprising that our 'moral majority' types have fallen silent and I think that is because of the potential benefits of the Marijuana Economy. If the implementation of legalized cannabis goes well, this will reduce the significant costs associated with enforcing criminalization and will prove to be a bounty of taxable revenue at both the state and national levels. This would also help to alleviate some of the border issues with Mexico and the drug cartel violence that affects people living on both sides of the U.S./Mexico border (i.e., puts the Mexican marijuana cartels out of business).

So, if the U.S. can quickly and effectively implement legalized marijuana and realize significant economic gains as a result of such a desirable cash crop, I think other nations, yours included, might follow suit quicker than you think.

After loosing 2 - 0 to Southampton away in the first half of the season, welcoming a strong Southampton side to the Liberty was always going to be difficult. Let's not forget that it was also crunch time towards the end of the season where every point mattered. The boys put in a strong performance and while both teams had chances, we were looking at a 0-0 draw and an important point up to the 90th minute.

A chip through ball is played forward towards Lambert and Amat can't quite get to it. Lambert runs through behind, and after seeing an on rushing Vorm he tries a high lob.

The ball is up in the air for an eternity. 

Vorm and Lambert wait for it to land, but instead of concentrating on the ball, Vorm decides to concentrate on pushing Lambert out of the way. He can't. He doesn't get near to it. It lands in the goal.

Southampton 1 - 0 Swansea.

This is even more true in places such as Scotland where even though there has long been a significant number of Conservatives, the party brand is absolutely shot there. So much that one of the leading candidates in the Scottish Conservative party ran on a platform of dissolving the local party and setting up a new sister party (like the co-op party has with Labour). 

People generally don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about policies, doing the research or assessing the impact of them. I don't think probability plays much of a part in this.

true,whombatfrog,null,null,"Recent Biology graduate who went to Sussex for a semester abroad in Fall 2011 here. I mainly took courses that would transfer back as general education courses when I went due to my school not really liking the idea of me getting a lab science credit abroad. I was the first and only student from my school who had gone, so in many ways I had to be really judicious with what risks I was willing to take as far as credits that may or may not transfer back and count for what I actually needed. The only science related course that I was able to take and both successfully transfer back was a biochemistry course.

The biochemistry course I took their was designed for both students who had and had not taken A-levels for science/biology. Now, my understanding is by no means the best in what that actually means, but I took it to mean that it was very much an introductory course and designed for people who maybe wanted to be a 'biology major'. So, it was very broad and easy. Our lecture consisted of two hour sessions once a week for about ten weeks. Our grade consisted of two multiple choice tests that each had about twenty five questions on them that covered everything from what is another name for trisomy-21 to what amino acids are polar/non-polar; general biochemistry stuff. The first test was twenty-five percent of our final grade and the second was seventy-five percent of our grade. Both were at the same difficulty level.

I learned that you need to be very good at policing yourself to study, and that the lecture was at times too detailed for what we needed to know. I had three different lecturers who specialized in whatever field they were lecturing on, while another PhD would make up and grade the tests (maybe graduate student...? Wasn't too clear...). I just kept up with some light reading in the assigned text books that I got from the library. You shouldn't have to buy any textbooks because they usually have several copies of the ones you need that you can check out and constantly renew pending they haven't been requested by another student.

As far as a course with an accompanying lab session. I have no idea how it works at US. I didn't really look into them all that much because I knew that I would have a very slim chance of them transferring back and counting towards my degree after speaking with my dean and professors. Try to find syllabi and anything else from US for the classes you are taking and get the transfers approved before you leave. It will make your life much easier in the long run. Also, US didn't have a very good system in place that let students know what courses clashed when it came to your schedule, so when I got there my pre-approved schedule that I had already filled out credit transfer paperwork for nearly all got scrapped because it had classes that were scheduled at the same lecture times as others I had intended to take. You may be able to speak with someone in their international/study abroad office on campus before leaving to get that sorted out, but the separate colleges are the ones that have the scheduling info for courses and not them; hence why I had the issue in the firs place because there seemed to be a inter-college communication error when it came to what the course schedules were because I was taking courses from different colleges at the university (uncommon because most people just take courses in their majors their, no faffing about with general education requirements like American college students have to).

As far as difficulty for my courses I didn't have too much trouble, but I was only taking year one and year two equivalent courses. For the courses you stated, they will most likely be a bit different because I think they are mostly year two (maybe year three as well..?). Also, I stayed in Swanborough and I felt that it was the best because you could have your own room and bathroom while sharing a kitchen/common area with five other students. They housed all the Americans together when I was there. I really never saw my flatmates all that much and mainly hung out with German study abroad students and went and did things in Brighton/in country. While studying and working hard is important, exploring Brighton is equally important, too! Go out and do something and least every other week. I usually got a weekly saver bus pass from the student union shop at the front of the campus past the library because it didn't expire until seven days after you first used it and I could use it for any bus in the Brighton/Hove system. They do have a student semester type pass that you can get, but mostly students who were placed in off campus housing go those since they would be using them everyday. Some weeks I didn't need a bus pass at all so I didn't need to spend that extra money. You can get your groceries delivered if you do not feel like going into town every time you need groceries. Most students would find it best to pull their orders together so they could split the delivery fee. Sussex does have a Co-op (grocery chain in the UK) on campus right across from Swanborough if you need anything in an emergency (not a full store by any means and it was slightly more expensive than going to a Sainbury's.

There is an ASDA in Brighton, which is basically as close as you can get to a Walmart over their if you need house-hold/kitchen items. sussex does offer you a kitchen and bed set you can buy from them. The kitchen set was ok for what it was, but by no means a complete 'everything you need' set. The bedding set was not really worth it to me. If you have and extra-long twin sheets I would pack them and take them with you and some type of really warm blanket/comforter. Just use one of those vacuum luggage bags from Bed Bath and Beyond for the winter clothes/bulky items you'll pack so you can shrink it down and save room in your luggage. I wouldn't take more than a large suitcase and carryon-sized suitcase with you. It will be a pain to handle more than that getting there and returning. Also, when getting there POUND LAND AND ARGOS ARE YOUR FRIEND!!! Go to those stores for very cheap household items and/or necessities. Everything I bough I knew I most likely was not going to be bringing back with me, so keep that in mind. You only need whatever it is for 4-5 months.

Things to do in Brighton: Definitely do a pub crawl of some kind. Participate in a trivia night/karaoke at some pubs. The karaoke at the King and Queen was quite good. Go to a tea house or two; the Mock Turtle was my favorite. And for god sakes go to the pier and beach at least once. Their were some study abroad students who never even went and it baffles me...Go see the palace for a day, if you like that sort of thing (not for everyone due to some people feeling a bit 'meh' about it). I ended up buying a student rail card when I was there, but in all honesty it wasn't really worth it unless you are traveling a lot on the rail system. You could easily take a weekend trip to Paris via the Eurostar if you left on a Friday and came back Sunday night. You are about an hour away from London, so please go more than once.

That's all I can think of right now as far as advice, but if I think of anything else I'll put it as a reply to this response. If you have any questions about anything there or about Brighton in general, pleas do not hesitate to ask. Feel free to PM me anytime, even when over there if anything comes up and you need some questions answered. I know what it feels like to be there (seemingly) alone and sometimes I would have killed for just some general advice from someone who knew what needed to be done etc. I hope you have a fun, safe, and successful semester abroad! 8v]

true,vacuum_tuber,null,null,"I've been cycling in Oxford for 7 years and lived near the Cowley/Iffly road for 2 years - commuting very similar route to what you describe.

First some practical advice

1) Get some good bike lights, make sure you always have some charged batteries for them. In the winter it gets dark as early as 4pm and is extremely dangerous to be cycling without being visible.

2) Spend £20-40 on a D-lock, don't spend much more than £200 on your bike unless you want it stolen. Don't *ever* buy a bike from cycle king, they are the worst. Cyclo-analysts are good for mid range bikes, beeline cycles for higher end. If you get an expensive bike (£400-£1200) keep it in your house, don't leave it outside or it will get stolen.

3) Always lock your bike, preferably to a bike rack.

4) Get a backpack/messenger bag/panniers.

5) Get some mudguards, chances are you'll end up cycling during/after rain and you don't want a shitstain up your back or all over your clean shirt.

6) Service your bike every 6-12 months. Brake pads wear out, gears get clogged with filth, cables stretch. If you're not confident fixing these things yourself there are plenty of bike shops that can help you (except cycle-king, they are the devil).

Most students in Oxford cycle or walk, there are ~20,000 students in the University of Oxford alone (excluding Brookes). Cars are accustomed to cyclists, but there's still a few things you should be aware of. I'll try to cover a few of those here.

 * Act like a car when appropriate, take the lane and obey traffic signals.

 * It is legal and often best practice to ride in the middle of the lane. Do so at your discretion.

 * Don't run red lights, even if it's a pedestrian crossing where nobody is actually there.

 * Pedestrians _always_ have right of way at a zebra crossing.

 * Give buses plenty of space. They pull into and out of stops without much warning. If they signal right (to pull out of a stop) chances are they will pull out before you can pass them, so just slow down and wave them on.

 * Never pass a large vehicle on the left unless you are absolutely sure it is safe. This is the number one causing of cycling fatalities.

 * If you are going straight on at a crossroads position yourself in the middle of the lane. If you are going right position yourself on the right side of the lane. 

 * Don't try to scoot down the left side of a cement mixer that's signaling left, because when the light changes they will turn into you and make a rather unpleasant mess. Just wait behind it until it's out of the way.

 * Watch out for tourists, there are billions of them, they don't know which way to look before crossing the road and are on cloud 9 most of the time. Be patient with them ;)

 * Have your bike lights on and working at night time. The fuzz can and do stop people and issue them with a ticket for not having lights. Also it's like super dangerous.

 * Be careful around parked cars, someone could open a door into your face and it might hurt a bit.

 * If in doubt remember that if you can see a drivers' mirrors, they can see you.

 * Be patient, don't try to thread yourself between two slow moving buses. Sometimes traffic moves slow (especially on Cowley road) just because some other twat is weaving in and out of traffic doesn't mean it's a good idea.

And specifially for your route:

 * There is no cycle lane on the Cowley road, take the whole lane. Traffic moves slow enough for this to be safe most of the time.

 * Take the whole lane as you approach Magdalen roundabout, signal right and go all the way around it. Follow a car if you're confused. Always give way to the right on roundabouts (that is, traffic that is already on the roundabout) Once on the roundabout you have right of way. Merge with the lane of cars and go as if you were a car. Trust me, it's safer because other road users won't have to second guess what you are trying to do.

Crystal Palace looked rejuvenated in the second half of the 13/14 season. Under their new manager, Tony Pulis, they had started to take points away from a lot of the top teams in the Premier League. 

Swansea dominated the game, and after some slick play from Bony and Britton, DeGuzman put them ahead in the first half. They had a few more chances, but Palace never seriously endangered the scoreline.

With 8 minutes to go, a long ball is played over the top. Palace's Murray is chasing it down against Chico and Amat, and Amat looks to have it before he hears a loud call from the goalkeeper. Out of nowhere Vorm sprints out of his penalty area to try and clear the ball. He misses as Murray pokes it past him. Chico runs back to cover but facing an open goal he pulls down the attacker for a penalty. 

They scored said penalty.

Swansea 1 - 1 Crystal Palace

You could be of the ""Robin Hood"" opinion that taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor through taxes will alleviate a lot of poverty problems and through various government run services and funds can be a net benefit for everyone.

You could also have ""is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?"" opinion, that you generated that wealth, and it is an incentive towards those without wealth to try and build it. The competition thereof being valuable and a net benefit for everyone.

It really depends on where you fall on that spectrum, although to assert that one opinion is fundamentally correct and the other one wrong is a very naive way to see the world. All western countries sit somewhere between those two extremes. (Including America, who absolutely hate taxes and think social programs are evil).

I'd also like to point out that there is an inherent hypocrisy to your argument. You don't want the government to take your money after death and distribute it where they see benefit.

You are suggesting the same thing, give the money you earned to someone who hasn't earned it (your children). The difference being you share their genes.

And what studies would need to be done? There have been many studies done already and numerous top scientists advise the government that they think it should be legal. There are numerous places around the world where lots of people smoke it and are fine and lots of people here smoke it anyway. More than enough research has been done for it already to show it's not nearly as harmful as other substances that are currently legal, heck it is even a PRESCRIPTION drug in the US.  Or are they prescribing a drug that is evil and will be very harmful for you?

And if more people smoke weed with legalisation, so what? My point is  addicts are addicts. If more people get addicted to weed when it's legal then they would have just been addicted to alcohol or something else anyway, which is worse for them and will usually have a more severe affect on their life. How many people have actually died from weed per person that has taken it? I don't know for sure but I'd guess it is far far below tobacco and even alcohol.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; It does make it obvious as do I in my other comment. The claim is that disparity in speeds is proportionate to danger. By increasing speeds to 60mph you have widened the gap between slower forms of transport like cycling, walking, horse riding, milk floats, low powered electric vehicles, tractors, some trailers, road cleaners, and others that just don't want to go that fast.

Yes. And you also narrow the gap between the lorries and the faster forms of transport. Why is it obvious that you wish to narrow the gap with the slower vehicles rather than with the faster vehicles?

&gt; The only way to get the safe aligned speeds which they purport to aim for and want is decreasing them with rigorous enforcement.

Well, yes. But the only way to get absolute safety is to remove the ability for anything to move, which is patently ridiculous. Reducing speed limits always sounds like a great way to increase safety, but I'm not convinced it necessarily has that effect.

&gt; I also go into detail regards stopping distances which will be greatly increased and this is all made worse by some HGV drivers who are personally incentivised to meet brittle travel times.

Where do you do this? I think those incentives are a different problem; it's akin to campaigning to reduce speed limits in an effort to prevent dangerous driving.

&gt; Life as a slow road user is barely tolerable as it is and this will be a tipping point for many.

If the pitcher throws it over the plate and not to the side it is a strike. The batter (enrique in this video) tries to hit the baseball with his bat before the pitcher can accumulate three strikes. The strike zone, refers to the imaginary 3 dimensional box that sits over the plate that the umpire (baseball referee) uses to call strikes and balls (non-strikes). 

So we already said that a strike had to be over the plate and not to either side. It also has to be (and this is where it gets super subjective) not to high, nor to low above home plate. The generic rule of thumb for high and low is usually from right around the batters knees to the name on his shirt. So if you were wearing an LFC kit your strikezone would be over the plate, and above your knees but below the liverbird patch. About knees the chest.

So if im standing really close to the plate while batting, an announcer would say im crowding the plate. To an umpire, who's strike zone is going to seem ~~bigger~~ smaller, the guy giving the plate lots of space? or the guy crowding the plate? The second guy every time. It gives the batter a pseudo advantage over the pitcher.

Hopefully that cleared up just a little bit about how to bat and what the strikezone is.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Like I say, I don't doubt that it was their intention to advise people to take precautions and nor do I disagree that people ought to be advised to take precautions. 

But that is not what has happened. Instead they have made a statement that is wide open to interpretation. Sure you can read it as ""don't get so drunk you can't protect yourself"", but you can also read it as ""if you drink you'll be raped"" or ""if you are raped when you are drunk it is because you are drunk"". All it really does, though, is highlight a correlation. Any causation is entirely in the mind of the reader.

Many people in this thread have commented to the effect of ""it just means that people should be careful"", which may very well be the case, but they have had to attach that meaning to it themselves. There is nowhere on the poster that it explicitly gives any advice at all and given the sensitive nature of the subject they really ought to have made their point as clear as possible, rather than assume that the meaning is clear.   

I don't think that changing rape to robbery makes any difference whatsoever. You can still interpret it in a number of ways, some of which will suggest that you are to blame for being robbed. 

Again, I stress that I don't think that it is part of some patriarchal conspiracy to blame women for the crimes of men. But it's such a blank slate that some people will think that and therefore it's a bad poster. A well thought out campaign would be much clearer about it's meaning.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"The argument is that the reason you spent your whole life earning money was because of the protections, benefits and freedoms 'society' gave to you. You pay for that through direct (income) taxes and indirect (spending) taxes through your life, but all the services and protections that society provides for you and your kin are not paid for completely, so we have to borrow money. When you die, inheritance tax is to pay back your dues - recognition that without society you would not have had that all that wealth. That's the moral / rational argument.

The economic argument is more simple. Tax is bad. You are withdrawing money from the economy. However, services are good. So if you pay for the absolute best services (say, that converts £1 of spend into £50 of value), and tax the absolute least bad taxes (that only withdraws say £0.02 per £1 taxed) you have created value. Ergo the least bad tax is worth it if pays for the most value-generating service.

So sometimes tax is *okay* if it pays for something good. In terms of the economic damage done, inheritance tax is far less damaging than income tax. It's a simple calculation, we need to raise taxation revenue and through wealth taxes we do less damage than via direct taxes.

An analogy, if you will: war is bad, but sometimes war is necessary to prevent worse things. If we must go to war, we would surely want to strategise to lose the least soldiers no?

The problem with tax is everyone gets bent out of shape and thinks its immoral, so would happily do more damage to the economy than is necessary and lose more value out of the economy than is necessary, to satiate their needs for unpalatable taxes. People don't mind income tax too much because of prospect theory - when you get paid your wealth goes up, you don't care that it goes up by 20% less because of tax. A 0.5% wealth tax on your property would really upset you though, even though it's a small amount of your overall wealth, because your net wealth goes down.

People care more about the direction of wealth changes than the amount, which is why we have so many taxes on income and spending (useful stuff for an economy!) and so few taxes on wealth (fairly useless stuff for an economy). This is not just plebs but even wealthy people - they frequently underprice IPOs significantly because they're becoming multimillionaires overnight, they don't care if they're worth £11.2m or £11.3m. Though they WILL care if the government tries to levy a tax on them at the end of the year.",0,1406211339,null,0,1406211638,0,cj6gddv,t3_2bl1lz,t1_cj6gddv,t1_cj6d3p8,null,1434876104,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Sage_CFC,null,null,"The Dixie Flag, doesn't have any meaning for southern pride, and anyone who claims it does is just revising history so that they can get away with a hateful display.
The flag we normally associate as the confederate flag wasn't the one that was flown as the official flag of the CSA. That one had a few incarnations, ending in a predominately white design. What we see as the ""Confederate Flag"" was the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia. It was a flag flown in war, not a flag meant to represent a country.
Taking slavery and racism out of the equation, it's still an offensive flag. It represents a group of people about to go into battle, war, and death to destroy the unity of a nation. Early on, it was used by a number of organizations whose intended purpose was to have ""the south rise again"", and in propaganda designed to incite violence against the north. In any other context, it would be a symbol of terrorism.
The flag though, didn't really come into play again until the Civil Rights movement. For instance the famous display at the South Carolina capitol wasn't a flag flown for significance of heritage. It was hung there in 1961 as a sign of backlash against the northern influence pushing them to stop segregation.
Since then, the huge use of it among hate groups like the KKK, Aryan Nation, etc alongside symbols like the nazi flag has pretty much solidified it as a symbol of prejudice.
Even if someone felt the need to fly the dixie flag as a sign of southern pride, at this point it will come across as being a tongue in cheek defense of racism and hate symbols. Anyone doing so has to, on some level, realize this.

The defence needs help but people seem to think Vidic, Evra and Rio were still world class or something. All three of them directly cost united points last season and Evra and Rio have declined pretty sharply.

true,panachetag,lfcflame,,"&gt;1) Chelsea - Mourinho has finally started attracting ""his sort of player"" in Luis, Costa and Fabregas is just good anyway,

Mourinho's sort of player is any players he has when he's winning. If he's losing, he has ""no strikers"" or some other rubbish along those lines. Costa will be a good addition, but Mourinho is still Mourinho and will lose/draw a bunch of games trying to hold 1-0 leads. They'll probably end up much the same as this year, so somewhere between 1st and 3rd.

&gt;2) Manchester United - Like I say, much fewer scheduled games than the other top teams, Van Gaal is a very versatile manager but will narrowly miss out to Chelsea, won't be surprised in the slightest if they win the league or at the very least a cup, and convincingly.

Herrera is decent, but not a game-changer. Shaw has a lot of potential, but isn't a game changer. They'll wank on for the next few weeks about how they're going to sign ~~Kroos~~, ~~Robben~~, ~~Ronaldo~~, ~~Suarez~~, Di Maria, etc and may end up signing one of them (it won't be Di Maria. He laughed at Spurs for even thinking a non-CL club could sign him), but one marquee signing didn't help them (Mata) or Arsenal (Ozil) to great heights last year and it won't do much now. Their squad is awful and their manager is a good coach, but it'll take ages before they become a decent team again. Certainly not in the first 3-4 months of the league. They'll probably finish 5th.

&gt;3) Manchester City - Leaving it late to make Summer signings could be costly for them, unless they bag Reus or Isco or Draxler etc 

No it won't. Their team just won the league and has enough money spent on it to buy at **LEAST** 2 more Southampton players than ours has. They'll either win the league or come very close again without too much difficulty.

&gt;4) Liverpool

Losing Suarez will lose us some GD, but Sturridge + Remy + a truckload of midfielders who can score goals should see us over the line in almost all of the games that would have otherwise been won by a Suarez goal. The biggest challenge to our GD will probably be the relegation of Norwich. Add in a (probably) better defense and we should finish somewhere around the 1-3 mark with City and Chelsea.

&gt;5) Arsenal

Arsenal finish 4th. Wenger knows exactly how to finish 4th and minimise resources (didn't he say something recently about not needing any more strikers after Sanchez?), so I'd expect him to sew that up and go full tilt at any cup competitions he's still in.",0,1406212006,null,0,false,0,cj6gocx,t3_2ble75,t1_cj6gocx,t3_2ble75,null,1434876253,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Yes. And you also narrow the gap between the lorries and the faster forms of transport. Why is it obvious that you wish to narrow the gap with the slower vehicles rather than with the faster vehicles?

This is very simple maths and logic. The claim is that a 20mph disparity is ""unsafe"" and cannot be permitted, yet there is a current disparity endangering those cycling, low powered motorbiking, riding horses or driving tractors at around 15 to 20mph from HGVs at 40mph and even more so for other traffic at 60mph. The hauliers and government cronies are demanding that there be no disparity yet they want to do the exact opposite and amplify disparity. If ""safety"" truly is their end (not that they have quantified the number of collisions which happen in an overtaking scenario which they describe) then the only way to meet their own self-ascribed target is to align the fastest with the slowest. A 30mph limit on all roads where vulnerable road users have no option but to share with fast traffic is the sane, scientific approach to road safety. Local authorities will be forced to introduce minimum speed limits which would be ridiculous or always provide off road space for vulnerable users whether walking or cycling should they want speeds of 40mph or above.

This legislation is about cost deregulatory cost-cutting not public safety, that's just the spurious pretense.

&gt; Reducing speed limits always sounds like a great way to increase safety, but I'm not convinced it necessarily has that effect.

And that would make you a flatlander. What makes the bullet unsafe, its speed or something else? The difference in stopping distance for a HGV at 40mph and 60mph is a staggering 160ft. Survival rates at 40mph are about ~5%, at 30mph it jumps to ~50%, at 20mph it's ~95%.

&gt; Where do you do this?

[Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2bl4i3/sustainable_safety_the_british_way_removal_of/cj6d8mw)

&gt; I think those incentives are a different problem; it's akin to campaigning to reduce speed limits in an effort to prevent dangerous driving.

Speed is inherently dangerous. Tacometers and geolocation would enforce speed limits. Raising the limits if not the current limits, are de facto decriminalisation of dangerous driving.

&gt; So do we at least agree that motorway speed limits are slower than they ought to be?

It's not as simple as agreement because once again I can hang them by their own logic. All roads would have to have a minimum and maximum speed limit, and ideally this would be the same figure—speed disparity is the cause of danger. If you raise the speed limit on motorways then you'd have to ban all those drivers and vehicles unable to ""align"".",0,1406212507,null,0,false,0,cj6gwuf,t3_2bl4i3,t1_cj6gwuf,t1_cj6g1ox,null,1434876358,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

It's likely that bikes will be overtaken whether lorries travel at 40mph or 50mph, whereas lorries at 40mph will have cars performing overtake manouvres, lorries at 50mph will lead to a reduction in cars performing overtake manouvres.

[Here are some of the Declarations of Causes of Seceding States](http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/reasons.html#Mississippi)

From Mississippi
&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

From Georgia
&gt;The Presidential election of 1852 resulted in the total overthrow of the advocates of restriction and their party friends. Immediately after this result the anti-slavery portion of the defeated party resolved to unite all the elements in the North opposed to slavery an to stake their future political fortunes upon their hostility to slavery everywhere. This is the party two whom the people of the North have committed the Government. They raised their standard in 1856 and were barely defeated. They entered the Presidential contest again in 1860 and succeeded.
The prohibition of slavery in the Territories, hostility to it everywhere, the equality of the black and white races, disregard of all constitutional guarantees in its favor, were boldly proclaimed by its leaders and applauded by its followers.

From South Carolina 
&gt;This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.

From Texas
&gt;We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.

[And here is a quote from Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech)
&gt;The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions— African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the ""storm came and the wind blew, it fell."" **Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.**",0,1406212902,null,0,false,0,cj6h3to,t3_2biuks,t1_cj6h3to,t1_cj6ap4j,null,1434876450,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"&gt;I'm suggesting that I get to choose who vets that money I earned

You have a chance to do that, give it to someone before you are dead. Put it in a trust fund for your children. Join them in a partnership for a business venture, invest in a company they work for. There are whole separate tax systems in place for investing in your children's future.

That is a side point though.

&gt; I fail to see how it is hypocritical to say I should get to decide what happens with my money

That isn't what I implied, I meant that there is a disconnect to think your children should have any more claim to your money than anyone else when your justification for having 0% inheritance tax was that ""It's mine, I earned it. I should choose what I want to do with it""

You are correct, it's your choice what you want to do with it, but your children have not done anything to earn it, yet you value the hard work you did to earn it in the first place.

Why do your children deserve it and the government not, when they've both equally contributed nothing towards you having it in the first place? In fact, in some cases you could even argue that the government may have created favorable economic conditions that allowed you to gain wealth.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; &gt; Yes. And you also narrow the gap between the lorries and the faster forms of transport. Why is it obvious that you wish to narrow the gap with the slower vehicles rather than with the faster vehicles?
&gt; 
&gt; This is very simple maths and logic. The claim is that a 20mph disparity is ""unsafe"" and cannot be permitted, yet there is a current disparity endangering those cycling, low powered motorbiking, riding horses or driving tractors at around 15 to 20mph from HGVs at 40mph and even more so for other traffic at 60mph. 

But surely the idea that you should reduce these gaps allows for some practicality - you'd have no disparity at all if all vehicles were forced to move at walking pace, but you'd also then not gain very much from any of it.

My understanding of what light reading I've come across so far is that the point is to have road users grouped into fewer groups each travelling at similar speeds, such that each of those groups can be treated individually but as a group - lorries as an anomaly at 40mph creates an additional group to cater for, which could perhaps be better accommodated by travelling in one of the other, already extant, groups. I don't think the less-than-25-mph group makes much sense for freight.

&gt; The hauliers and government cronies are demanding that there be no disparity yet they want to do the exact opposite and amplify disparity.

This is not what the piece referenced by the piece to which you linked says; they clearly say they wish to reduce the gap between the lorries and the traffic moving at 60mph, not between the lorries and cyclists.

&gt; If ""safety"" truly is their end

It isn't - if anyone's arguing only for safety then they cannot be advocating any movement. Everyone is arguing for their particular balance of safety and utility. 

&gt; A 30mph limit on all roads where vulnerable road users have no option but to share with fast traffic is the sane, scientific approach to road safety. 

I don't think it is. I think you'd find speeding becoming more of a norm and drivers being more distracted. It takes some conscious effort to remain concentrating on the road on some of the 20mph limits round here because nothing's happening and it's all not happening so slowly that your mind wanders. 

&gt; Local authorities will be forced to introduce minimum speed limits which would be ridiculous or always provide off road space for vulnerable users whether walking or cycling should they want speeds of 40mph or above.

Alternatively, perhaps we could conceive of a situation whereby we train road users to such an extent that we can expect them to drive at an appropriate speed, even when that speed is below the limit. Perhaps they could be taught how to overtake safely, and all the rest of it. And then maybe it's *those* rules that are rigorously enforced, rather than apparently aiming to remove all danger from the roads by simply slowing everything down until it cannot collide any more?

&gt; 
&gt;Reducing speed limits always sounds like a great way to increase safety, but I'm not convinced it necessarily has that effect.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;And that would make you a flatlander. What makes the bullet unsafe, its speed or something else? The difference in stopping distance for a HGV at 40mph and 60mph is a staggering 160ft. Survival rates at 40mph are about ~5%, at 30mph it jumps to ~50%, at 20mph it's ~95%.

The bullet is unsafe because of its speed, but it's only harmful if and when it actually hits something. I think the aim of safety should be to remove the collisions rather than just to make them slower. I also think that unreasonable-looking speed limits reduces confidence in their validity.

&gt;&gt; Where do you do this?
&gt;
&gt; Here.

[here](http://pastebin.com/zyZFDgis), I think - I didn't expect to find additional points in the letter. You're still just making the classic Police Camera Action argument that the slower something is moving the safer it is, which I dislike because the point defined as 'safe' always feels so arbitrary, especially when it changes.

&gt;&gt;I think those incentives are a different problem; it's akin to campaigning to reduce speed limits in an effort to prevent dangerous driving.
&gt;
&gt;Speed is inherently dangerous. Tacometers and geolocation would enforce speed limits. Raising the limits if not the current limits, are de facto decriminalisation of dangerous driving.

So your argument actually is that everything should be prevented from moving in order to maximise safety? If you've picked a speed and decreed that to be 'safe', how did you come to that conclusion?

&gt; &gt; So do we at least agree that motorway speed limits are slower than they ought to be?
&gt;
&gt; It's not as simple as agreement because once again I can hang them by their own logic. All roads would have to have a minimum and maximum speed limit, and ideally this would be the same figure—speed disparity is the cause of danger. If you raise the speed limit on motorways then you'd have to ban all those drivers and vehicles unable to ""align"".

Hang who by their logic? Why would roads need to have a minimum speed limit? Motorways have multiple lanes precisely to provide for different vehicles driving at different speeds.",0,1406213555,null,0,false,0,cj6hfhy,t3_2bl4i3,t1_cj6hfhy,t1_cj6gwuf,null,1434876604,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yes? Both teams add a couple of new expensive signings every window and don't seem noticeably better. Costa and Fabregas could easily get injured, too. City have amazing squad depth, too, so they can handle a whole bunch of injuries at once.

&gt;And with United not standing much of a chance thing, Kagawa, Rooney and Mata will be able to play with much more freedom next year, if they sort out their back 3, Jones +2, they could have a decent chance at winning the league.

It's not like they were all carrying around 100kg rocks with 'Moyes' on them last season and they'll suddenly play incredibly this season from the get-go.

Kidding, I love hedgehogs.  I think the comparison is always made because it highlights the inconsistency.  Certainly that was why I was making the comparison.

I think for some people it does placate them, or enable them to self-medicate - they perhaps feel they can cope better.  But you are right in probably people don't need it.

I think there are some situations where it can be beneficial - for some medical conditions it really does help the pain, not that I can claim to be knowledgeable about it.  I know a friend of my mother really values it for this reason, but I don't know her medical condition.  It can help some people to be creative.  But I think the biggest benefit in legalisation would be to prevent screwing up the lives of many people when they are made a criminal for liking weed a bit too much.   It is likely these people would carry on smoking weed whether it was legal or illegal, and there's no need to put them in a prison cell, or disrupt their lives.  Its a choice the state is making as a result of this law - to consciously put these people through the legal grinder - for doing what they are doing.  It helps no-one - not the taxpayer who has to pay for their cell and not their own life as they find it difficult to get a job after a drugs conviction.

I suspect also that many people like you or I who don't smoke weed wouldn't start a weed habit simply because of the availability.  For the same reason I don't drink absinthe every night.

It's not that the government taking your money is fair, it's more than the end result of families passing on wealth is not an end game that the majority of people benefit from.

&gt; Would you snort or inject THC (salts?) if it was water soluble? I don't think I would.
 
Considering cannabis, when consumed by smoking/eating/whatever isn't just pure THC, no because that would be a hellish experience. Otherwise (with all the correct cannabanoids and such) maybe? You don't seem to understand that just because you don't like smoking because its bad for you doesn't mean everyone feels the same way. I can't stand cigarettes but I still know that I can't change people because I don't like something.

Edibles, which is what you're talking about are more potent than smoking and are much harder to gauge how high you'll get. Which is why people enjoy smoking as they can take a few hits, feel it out and then go from there. 

You seem to think instant hits are a bad thing. The reason it's smoked is because the lung are a very fast way to diffuse into the bloodstream, if eating weed was possible (without first decarbing) I would say more people would be doing that, it's just a lot of effort and takes a long time to take effect. 

You know drugs are choices that people make, just going from the statement 
&gt; (reputation it deserves as a lung destroying instant hit with an addiction profile to match then it would be placed firmly between huffing gas and shooting up.)

 It would be very unusual to invite a speaker into the university and then specifically not allow non members to attend. It never happened while at me university. It may have been aimed primarily at members, but deny non members access would be a very big deal. 

2.
&gt;surely one would have thought the proper response to such a controversial position in a free society – and most especially at a university – would be to allow people to raise, discuss and debate it openly. If I am wrong (ever a possibility), then I expect that the rational scrutiny of others will bring me to recognise my error.

This implies that there would be some debate at the event, or at least the opportunity to question the speaker. It also seems to suggest that anyone would be able to attend, not just members. 

3.
 I'm sure it would be chaired by a member, but that doesn't make it a pointless debate.

It's sensible and will help us down the road with FFP. 

I think Moreno will be a tactical signing anyway - sign a young, promising Latin player and then sell to Madrid/Barcelona for stupid millions in a few years. That money would help fund all sorts of squad building if spent wisely, just like the Suarez cash is, and you only lose one player. It's a clever bit of speculation, but doesn't work if you sign a player for £25M and sell him for £30M. Hence we're going for £15-18M.

They're all so small and simple that basically nothing serious can go wrong with them anyway, and anything that does you can have repaired anywhere, even do it yourself if you're feeling brave. I had some electrical problems with my YBR despite it being a big name, I think it's more luck than anything. 

People like to say never buy a new bike at first, but 125s hold their value so well that you might as well do it. I did for £2000, and after three years I got £1000 for it despite it pretty obviously having been through hell and back. I rode that bike to its absolute limit, I took it green laning, it had been stolen and recovered, all sorts. I got about three feet of air over a humpbacked bridge once and it never really went in a straight line after that. I certainly wouldn't buy a second hand 125 unless you're able to really scrutinise it and make sure it hasn't been abused like mine. I could have got closer to £1500 if I'd been willing to wait and haggle and stuff, but I part exchanged it so they always lowball the value.

Mine was a YBR, the older one, and I was happy with it, but it did still get stolen despite not looking sporty or anything, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. I think it's more of an issue when people are looking at taking a brand new GSXR against a muddy old Bandit. 125s are light and easy to pinch, so if there's an opportunity they'll take it regardless of what kind of bike it is. Get an aftermarket alarm that makes a lot of noise when you arm it, and a big beefy chain to fasten your bike to a lamppost, then take out theft insurance to be sure. 

Having driven a car for a while, unless it's a Lada or something, any 125 is going to feel slow. Around town (and on your CBT) it's not so bad if you give them a bit of oomph, but certainly once you start going above 50mph they're weak and you can really tell.

---

&gt;

&gt;The Brummie accent is an example of a [regional accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accents_of_English) of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language).

&gt;Examples of celebrity speakers include, comedian [Jasper Carrott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Carrott), hip-hop and garage musician [Mike Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Skinner_(musician\)), rock musicians [Ozzy Osbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne) (and all other members of the original [Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath)), [Roy Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Wood), [Jeff Lynne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Lynne) ([ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra) founders), [Rob Halford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Halford) ([Judas Priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest)), [Barney Greenway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Greenway) ([Napalm Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death)), [Dave Pegg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Pegg) (of [Fairport Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairport_Convention) and [Jethro Tull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band\))), broadcaster [Les Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Ross), politician [Clare Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Short), [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service) soldier and author [John ""Brummie"" Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_%22Brummie%22_Stokes) and many actresses and actors; [Martha Howe-Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Howe-Douglas), [Donnaleigh Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnaleigh_Bailey), [Nicolas Woodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Woodman), [Sarah Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Smart), [John Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oliver_(entertainer\)) and [Ryan Cartwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cartwright).

&gt;It is not the only accent of the [West Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county\)), although the term Brummie is often erroneously used in referring to all accents of the region. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It is markedly distinct from the traditional accent of the adjacent [Black Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country), although modern-day population mobility has tended to blur the distinction. For instance, [Dudley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley)-born comedian [Lenny Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Henry), Daniel Taylor, [Smethwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smethwick)-born actress [Julie Walters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Walters), award winning soap actress [Jan Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Pearson), comedian [Frank Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Skinner), [Bill Oddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Oddie), and [Adrian Chiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Chiles) are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.

&gt;Additionally, population mobility has meant that to a degree, the Brummie accent extends into some parts of the [Metropolitan Borough of Solihull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Solihull), although much of the accent within the borough might be considered to be closer to contemporary RP. For example [Solihull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull)-born presenter [Richard Hammond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond) (despite often being referred to as a Brummie) does not speak with a strong Brummie accent.

&gt;The Brummie accent and the [Coventry accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry#Accent) are also quite distinct in their differences, despite only 17 miles ( 27 km) separating the cities. To the untrained ear, however, all of these accents may sound very similar, just as British English speakers can find it hard to distinguish between different [North American accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English_regional_phonology), or Australian and New Zealand accents.

&gt;As with all English regional accents, the Brummie accent also grades into [RP English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation). The accent of presenter [Cat Deeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Deeley) is listed by her voiceover agency, Curtis Brown, as ""RP/Birmingham"".

&gt;The strength of a person's accent varies greatly all across Birmingham. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Like most cities, the accent changes relative to the area of the city. A common misconception is that everyone in Birmingham speaks the same accent.

&gt;There are also differences between Brummie and [Black Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country) accents not readily apparent to people from outside the West Midlands. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] A Black Country accent and a Birmingham accent can be hard to distinguish if neither accent is that broad. The phonetician John Wells has admitted that he cannot tell any difference between the accents.  Urszula Clark has proposed the FACE vowel as a difference, with Birmingham speakers' using /ʌɪ/ and Black Country speakers' using /æɪ/.  She also mentions that Black Country speakers are more likely to use /ɪʊ/ where most other accents use /juː/ (in words such as new, Hugh, stew, etc.). 

&gt;Below are some common features of a recognisable Brummie accent (a given speaker may not necessarily use all, or use a feature consistently). The letters enclosed in square brackets – [] – use the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA). The corresponding example texts enclosed in double quotes ("") are spelt so that a reader using [received pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_pronunciation) (RP) can approximate the sounds.

&gt;


&gt;* The vowel of *mouth* (RP [aʊ]) can be [æʊ] or [æə]

&gt;* The vowel of *goat* (RP [əʊ]) can be close to [ɑʊ] (so to an RP speaker, *goat* may sound like ""gout"")

&gt;* Final unstressed /i/, as in *happy*, may be realized as [əi], though this varies considerably between speakers

&gt;* The letters *ng* often represent /ŋɡ/ where RP has just /ŋ/ (e.g. *singer* as [siŋɡə]). See [*Ng*-coalescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_consonants#.27.27Ng.27.27-coalescence)

&gt;* Both the vowels of *strut* and *foot* are pronounced [ʊ], as in northern England. See [foot–strut split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_the_high_back_vowels#Foot.E2.80.93strut_split)

&gt;* The majority of Brummies use the Northern [a] in words like *bath*, *cast* and *chance*, although the Southern [ɑː] is more common amongst older speakers. 

&gt;* The vowels in ""price"" and ""choice"" may be almost merged as [ɒɪ] so that the two words would almost rhyme. However, the two are still distinct, unlike the Black Country dialect.

&gt;* In more old-fashioned Brummie accents, the FORCE set of words takes [ʌʊə] and the PURE set takes [uːə], so both sets were in two syllables. In such an old-fashioned accent, the words *paw, pour* and *poor* would all be said differently: [pɔː], [pʌʊə], [puːə]. In more modern accents, all three are said as [pɔː] 

&gt;* Final unstressed /ə/ may be realised as [a]

&gt;* In a few cases, voicing of final /s/ (e.g. *bus* as [bʊz])

&gt;* Some rolling of prevocalic /r/ (some speakers; e.g. in ""crime"")

&gt;Recordings of Brummie speakers with phonetic features described in [SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA) format can be found at the *Collect Britain* dialects site. 

&gt;Rhymes and vocabulary in the works of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) suggest that he used a local dialect (Birmingham and his birthplace, [Stratford-upon-Avon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford-upon-Avon), are both in the English West Midland dialect area and only about 35 miles apart). [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;A study was conducted in 2008 where people were asked to grade the [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) of a person based on their accent and the Brummie accent was ranked as the least intelligent accent. It even scored lower than being silent, an example of the [stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype) attached to the Brummie accent. 

&gt;According to *Birmingham English: A Sociolinguistic Study* (Steve Thorne, 2003), among UK listeners ""Birmingham English in previous academic studies and opinion polls consistently fares as the most disfavoured variety of British English, yet with no satisfying account of the dislike"". He alleges that, overseas visitors in contrast find it ""lilting and melodious"", and from this claims that such dislike is driven by various linguistic myths and social factors peculiar to the UK (""social [snobbery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snobbery), negative media [stereotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotyping), the poor public image of the City of Birmingham, and the north/south geographical and linguistic divide""). However, the Brummie accent is the only 'northern' accent to receive such attention.

&gt;For instance, despite the city's cultural and innovative history, its industrial background (as depicted by the arm-and-hammer in [Birmingham's coat of arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Birmingham)) has led to a muscular and unintelligent stereotype: a ""Brummagem screwdriver"" or ""Brummie screwdriver"" is UK slang for a hammer. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Steve Thorne also cites the mass media and entertainment industry where actors, usually non-Birmingham, have used inaccurate accents and/or portrayed negative roles.

&gt;Advertisements are another medium where many perceive stereotypes. Journalist Lydia Stockdale, writing in the [Birmingham Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Post),  commented on advertisers' association of Birmingham accents with pigs: the pig in the ad for Colman's Potato Bakes, [Nick Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Park)'s [Hells Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Angel) Pigs for [British Gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrica) and [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\))'s ""Dave the window-cleaner pig"" all had Brummie accents. In 2003, a [Halifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_(United_Kingdom_bank\)) bank advertisement featuring [Howard Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Brown_(Halifax_Bank\)), a Birmingham- born and based employee, was replaced by an animated version with an exaggerated comical accent overdubbed by a [Cockney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney) actor.

You're more visible and cars will not be so tempted to overtake and cut you up. However, some drivers hate it when cyclists do this, so be prepared to get honked/hollered at. (I read a study a few years ago about this, but can't seem to find it now...)

In particular, you do not want to position yourself between the traffic and the kerb on the approach to a roundabout, you will become invisible to traffic on the roundabout, and may be cut up by drivers who do not think to check their nearside mirrors (ie almost everyone!). Use the outside lane as if you were a car, be confident, signal clearly, and people should see you and avoid you if you're right in front of them.

Also, get lights and high-viz and use them. Don't be tempted to ignore traffic lights like so many idiotic cyclists in Oxford, who go through reds blissfully unaware of how close they just came to being hit!

If his account wasn't hacked and he was tricked then, maybe, it counts as fraud but that would be hard to prove and is probably a waste of the courts time; ""little timmy was defrauded of 1000 warcraft gold by another player and wants it back"".

With that in mind I can't honestly say I think people should believe what they want. I don't think anyone should believe in ideologies that have great potential to cause physical harm to others for no reason other than to satisfy themselves. That's why I have a big problem with people vocally declaring religious beliefs that promote hate on certain kinds of people. Admittedly though this is because of my upbringing and my views in this area may be a little stronger than others in the UK/the norm.

Where I grew up; I saw the kinds of people that didnt have much else find religion and become horrible, intolerant and closed-minded people as a result of it. They would start slowly and say ""Nothing's changed about me"" but they would slowly change until they became unrecognisable. So that's why I'm wary of religious agendas, especially those that can promote disrespecting others.

Richardson - found openings and was not scared to attempt them. Had more pace than what I was expecting and really seemed to love his role and being around AVFC fan base.

Bennett - for as much as I cursed the guy last year, I was reluctant to see such a good showing. Great positioning, great through balls and of the four full backs (Hutton, lowton, Stevens, Bennett) looked the most comfortable playing forward.

Lambert had Westwood/Herd sit back on the offensive moves and the two wide play forward. Hutton and Stevens looked very out of place doing so.

You mention double taxation, and while most people don't like it, double taxation isn't by default a bad thing.

You could pay three times as much income tax and then have no money for the government to tax after you die, or you could have less income tax and the government gets everything when you die.

Being taxed on two separate occasions doesn't mean you are paying more, or that what you pay is less fair.

Just saying, ""it's double taxation, and that's bullshit"". It's not an argument.

Don't get me wrong, 100% inheritance tax is dumb too, almost all countries (with some exceptions where the benefit of being a tax haven outweighs the cost to function administratively) have unanimously agreed that some form of inheritance tax is a requirement to prevent out-of-control wealth disparity which is a net negative for the average person.",0,1406219362,null,0,1406219645,0,cj6kmc6,t3_2bl1lz,t1_cj6kmc6,t1_cj6k8m3,null,1434878175,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

By no-platforming anything you disagree with, you are preventing people from being exposed to other points of view and encouraging the idea that everyone thinks in a certain way. A university should encourage peoples views to be challenged, if only to encourage people to understand that a) there are other points of view and b) be better able to defend the views they hold if they are challenged. Not doing this creates idiots who when they encounter people with different views just fall back on the idea that people who don't agree with them are stupid or mentally broken.

I don't really like religion, but it is important to understand how people who do think and why they hold their views if you want to challenge them, not just making snide superior comments about sky faeries with no understanding.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"IT literacy (above and beyond driving MS Office) is needed today, if only for the circumstances you can't immediately imagine.

For example, a GP surgery wants to ""get with it"", and start offering webcam consultations. Not knowing the first thing about computers, but having experience of using Skype or whatever on their home PC/iPad to chat with relatives, they just sling Skype on all the GP's computers, advertise it on their noticeboard as a *thing*, and start the ball rolling in earnest.

Here are the problems I think of, straight of the bat:-

* Skype is a consumer application, with no guarantees of support.
* Skype takes medically sensitive information outside of the UK, the EU and probably around the world twice. Skype won't tell you what information they store, and where they store it.
* Skype doesn't run on all platforms, and requires end users to agree to particularly unpleasant EULAs to work.
* Skype will be a mess to organise; are text conversations stored in 'the cloud' or on a local workstation? If they're on the workstation, how do you get that to sync across multiple AD hosts?
* What happens if your account is hacked? Is a single password enough?
* What hardware configurations will work?
* Who will support the end-users?

This has very little to do with computer programming, but has a lot to do with computer literacy. If doctors are raised simply to 'consume' information from computers without understanding how they work, you'll end up with private consultations looking like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4ooLelKbvo).",0,1406221389,null,0,false,0,cj6ltcy,t3_2bhxsc,t1_cj6ltcy,t1_cj6ge8r,null,1434878739,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The IMF chap did admit to being wrong, but he also pointed out significant deficiencies and imbalances in the UK economy.

 "" We have sent down and made obligatory. We have sent down clear revelations in it so that you may take heed: flog the male and the female adulterers and fornicators  (الزانية والزاني)  one hundred times. Do not let compassion for them keep you from carrying out Allah's law if you believe in Allah and the Last Day - and ensure a group of believers witnesses the punishment."" (Qur'an 24:2)

Edit: Oh, and even 50 years ago , or even 200 years ago, the punishment for Sodomy/Homosexuality in the UK was not the Death Penalty. For God's sake, the last time we hung someone for witchcraft was Alice Molland at Exeter in 1684 !!!    In Saudi Arabia they did it last month !!  

edit: Sorry, my mistake. We repealed the death penalty for Homosexuality in 1861, the last executions being in 1835. So not quite 200 years, only 153 years ago. Islam still has quite a bit of catching up to do if it wants to enter the modern civilised world.

There are very well established recruitment methods (which you should be aware of) - reddit, or buzzfeed, or 4chan, are not the places to find recruits.

eg:

&gt; but I'm sitting here laughing at the idea that its been mistaken for a scam.

&gt; Anyway, do let me know how you’d do it differently and we’ll see if you have some good ideas.


Something is off, I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about this whole post is really weird.

Maybe it's the fact that you don't mention the name of the company or provide a link to an actual job posting.

1. You're a thief looking for a victim

2. You're a rapist looking for a victim

3. You're a murderer looking for a victim

4. You're a cannibal looking for a victim

5. You're a fucking idiot who thinks reddit is the best place to find candidates

IMO, characters need to have flaws to be interesting. Being a goody goody that does no wrong is just plain boring. While there are plenty of people who hated Rose due to her flaws, I find that the reason why I liked her so much. She felt like a real person that I could relate to.
Clara has none of this, so far. I have high hopes for the next season though, and looking forward to her character finally getting developed.

The circumstances of this specific case muddy the waters of what ought to have been done, in my opinion; the bureaucratic justification for the cancellation seems suspect, and that the talk was to be specifically for 'CathSoc' does have ramifications as to the ethics of allowing certain kinds of discussion in university facilities. But if a speaker can *be reasonably expected to incite discriminatory attitudes* I see no especial reason why they should be given the opportunity to air those views.

I'm pretty emotionally resilient. Some would say cold. Discriminatory speech doesn't particularly affect me any more because I can quickly come up with half a dozen reasons why the other person is wrong (and usually, a moron). In the context of a formal debate in particular, I'm not going to be offended by what someone says to the point where it has a profound and damaging emotional effect. But not everyone is in that position, and it isn't reasonable to expect them to be. Perhaps it's some sort of societal ideal for everyone to be a Roark-esque, ideologically driven alpha type who has absolute command over their emotions, and maybe many people are in that situation. It's important to remember, though that speech does have real consequences for many, particularly when that speech cultivates changes in attitudes and hence behaviours. If someone facilitates the spread of attitudes which can make vulnerable people more likely to be subjected to discrimination and abuse by their peers, they're complicit in that discrimination and abuse by proxy.

My feelings are that rather than people's hearts and minds being changed instantly by charismatic orators (a fallacy born of cognitive biases in human thinking), changes in societal attitudes to anything occur as a product of billions of tiny interactions and bits of information. 'Death by a thousand cuts' plus 'the butterfly effect'. A homophobic speech might not change the minds of anyone in the audience, but a sentence or two stuck in the minds of a few members of the audience, which they mention in passing to someone else who is already cultivating homophobic attitudes, which they spread to their children, who go on to bully a gay kid in their class who will never go within a hundred miles of where the speech took place... I'm not saying that this precise turn of events would have occurred, but this is how attitudes change. In both ways, I might add, and on LGBT issues and most others of equality and civil rights, society is progressing. Speech does have far-reaching effects, far beyond the walls of the room where that speech occurs.

&gt;It represents a group of people about to go into battle, war, and death to destroy the unity of a nation

Well that's one way of putting it I guess. So does the American flag though (and any flag that represents a nation that fought for its independence). The colonists rebelled against England because they felt their rights were being infringed upon. The southern secession was no different. At the time, slavery was much more of an economic issue than it was a moral one. I am completely aware that what we refer to as the Confederate flag was the battle flag, not the flag of the Confederate government. I wasn't planning on being that specific, but really that fact supports my point; the flag did not represent a country who wanted slavery to secure its economic base, it represents a culture of people who fought for what they believe in. General Robert E. Lee was highly respected on both sides of the war, was Lincoln's first choice to command the Union army, and disagreed with slavery, yet he couldn't fight against his home state and the culture he came from.

Taking slavery out of the equation, the flag is not offensive at all. I've already addressed the radical organizations that still use the flag as a symbol of hatred (which they wouldn't be doing if slavery was taken out of the equation). But that's not who I am talking about. I'm talking about the average individual who chooses to display the flag. If you ask them why they do so I guarantee you 99% of them will smile and talk about their southern heritage. There will be no mention of 'white power' or the 'good ole days' of slavery and segregation. In modern day, 'the South will rise again' is a joke usually said in an exaggerated southern accent. Its not like southerners (except maybe Texas) still believe in secession. It is not surprising though that in the immediate post-war period southerners would still believe in their cause and have harsh feelings towards the north, especially with the way the felt they were being treated. I'm sorry you feel this is revisionist history, but if you think there was no northern propaganda against the south, then I think you should learn more about the Reconstruction period. History is mostly written by the victors. It is not surprising that the north would bury the south after such a bloody, civil war.
&gt; In any other context, it would be a symbol of terrorism.

Except in the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and any other rebellion where the rebels thought they were being treated unjustly by their government. Talk about propaganda.

I understand that most people will view the flag as a sign of prejudice which is why I started this discussion. I think people have a limited understanding of Southern history which is based on what they learned in history class about the Civil War and slavery as well as the fact that radical groups today are associated with the symbol. However, this does not reflect what southern pride is about today. ",0,1406222772,null,0,false,0,cj6mm7f,t3_2biuks,t1_cj6mm7f,t1_cj6gdzl,null,1434879118,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

The only people who use it today are radical groups equivalent to the KKK in the South. I have never heard of a German flying a Nazi flag and calling it heritage because it was never anything more than a symbol for Hitler's political party. I guarantee you if you ask the average person (not associated with a radical group) why they fly the Confederate flag 99% of them will talk about their southern heritage. I also guarantee you that if you ask someone why they fly the Nazi flag 100% of them will talk about how the Aryan race is superior. Again, racists don't really hide it; they have no problem projecting their beliefs onto others. I can't speak for the entire South, but the Confederate flag is still very prevalent in southern culture.

You're not winding me up at all; I think its an interesting discussion. I too was born and raised in the South and still live here. I don't, never have, and never will fly a Confederate flag or display it on clothing or in any other way. Partially because of the way a lot of people would view it, but mostly because I think its tacky and people sometimes cling a little too tightly to their ancestry. I also subscribe to the philosophy that life is not meant to be lived in one place or in one way and that a truly fulfilled life will incorporate many different places and different cultures. Thus, I don't identify with one specific culture, but I do love home. I'm not a southern apologist or defender. Looking back, obviously I think slavery was an atrocity. I am, however, a lover of history to the point that I majored in it in college. I think too often people put historical cultures in the modern day and judge based on today's societal norms. With regards to the Civil War, the main thing that's lost in translation is that slavery was an economic rather than a moral issue. Across the country, black people were viewed religiously and scientifically as inferior.

Firing up CAIN with a crosstabulation report shows that the UVF killed 11 UDA members, compared with 39 fellow UVF members. Similarly, the UDA murdered 6 UVF members, while killing 22 other UDA members.


That suggests to me that what's happening was mostly internal feuding within the groups rather than inter-group feuding - so it would be a mixture of power struggles (loyalist groups weren't generally governed as tightly as the British state forces or Republican groups), killing of informers and traitors, and of course gangland-style squabbles.

Nobody wants to be seen as a ""slut"" and that's the social issue that drives a lot of confusion about consent. Being a ""slut"" shouldn't contain the implied shame that it presently does, there is no logical reason for it to but it drives people to deny they very thing they want if asked directly..... so people don't ask directly and people end up assuming based off vague nuances and language and mis-reads result in ""creepy time"".

How, though, can you forget that colonists owned slaves and that slavery was legal for almost 100 years after the US was born? That the United States Constitution was written with a clause defining slaves as subhuman? Should we also be ashamed of America pre-1863? How can we fly the American flag with pride when it represents a country that has wronged millions of people in its relatively short history? You are taking one part of southern culture, judging it in comparison to a society that has advanced 150 years, and then taking modern-day people of that culture and attributing to them the mindset of a southerner 150 years ago. That doesn't seem fair to me. Racism was everywhere during the Civil War era. Racism, rape, murder occurred in New York, Chicago, and many other places in the north. 

Here's another Lincoln quote for you from his 1862 letter to Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune:
&gt;I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be ""the Union as it was."" If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.

Lincoln's sole policy was to save the Union. He did not agree with slavery, but the northern cause had nothing to do with equal rights.",0,1406227084,null,0,false,0,cj6p4fh,t3_2biuks,t1_cj6p4fh,t1_cj6nrms,null,1434880298,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"I'm guessing from your screen name that you are a woman, but as a guy Clara is very easy to relate too.  The two traits that really seem to define her are her empathy and social intelligence.  She also shows real fear more than once, especially early on before her confidence is fully developed.

1. She found the Shard.  The Doctor hacked the computers but it was Clara's insight into people that led to the location. (Social intelligence)  She was also truly terrified that episode and not at all quick to trust the Doctor.

2.  She took on the Old God.  At first she wanted to run, but she understood that even though the Doctor was afraid he wasn't running.  She is the first companion I can think of to recognize the Doctor's fear.

3. She convinced Skaldac not to nuke the earth.  Again her empathy and social intelligence saved the day.  She was also very scared during a lot of this episode.  She acts in spite of that fear.  I think this episode and the next were in large part about Clara developing her courage.

7. She jumped into the Doctor's timeline saving his life and a large portion of the universe.  I'm going to be speculating a bit here, but at the beginning of ""The Time of the Doctor"" she is teaching Marcus Aurelius's Meditations.  A lot of that book is about facing fear and dealing with pain.  Clara lost her mother at an age when she was old enough to understand what that meant.  If she found that book when she was dealing with her own grief and if it has been a major influence on her, then it would go a long way towards explaining a lot of her behavior.

I think that the loss of her mother has greatly influenced the character in other ways.  She was about 12? That's old enough to understand the loss and to understand how her father felt.  It's very easy for me to imagine that the pain drew them much closer.  I think this is where she probably developed her empathy and is why she is able to read the Doctor so well.

Edit:
&gt;she is simply too perfect. Everything she does has a major impact that affects the entire plot and has never made major mistakes

Kind of like the Doctor?  She's being set up as his equal.  The Doctor has made mistakes and so will Clara.

Say there's 7 home cup games at £25 each, that means if you want a season ticket in the Stretford End, you **have** to pay £707, there's no choice. If you want to see all 19 homes games as a season ticket holder, it would cost you over £700. Yes most City fans will go to cup games and pay that anyway, but at least it's a choice (and there's a good few who choose not to go to midweek cup games as they physically can't due to work etc)

That's why I'm calling in a token gesture similar to City's extremely limited cheap season tickets to make them appear lower on charts.

Yes, you're right.  You can't prove an idea.  And you're also right that many claims are simply wrong and so it doesn't matter how many times they're put forward, they should never succeed.  To all intents and purposes, some arguments have been settled and will likely never be overturned.

And yet, as you yourself acknowledge - nothing is ever proven!  No matter how certain you or anyone else is, there will *always* be the possibility that you are mistaken.  And, it's for this reason that most philosophers of science will tell you that there must *always* be room to challenge even the most certain of ideas.  You have to allow for the possibility that you might sometimes be mistaken about ideas you are all but certain are true.  There is *always* room for some doubt, no matter how small.

true,apinkknee,null,null,"&gt;When Toronto was in possession of the ball, Lamela occupied the central attacking role supporting Soldado in pressing the CBs and Eriksen was tasked with cutting off passing lines to the wide areas.

I loved the article and know what he meant, but this is one confusing as heck sentence. Otherwise, the analysis was fairly spot on. 

&gt;Lennon’s central runs also allowed Soldado to drift into the wide areas and therefore lose his marker. This would lead to the Spaniard playing a vital role in both goals, by picking up the ball away from his natural areas and before passing to an onrushing Lamela.

I think this is one of the most important things that will benefit Soldado. He needs space to lose his marker; being marked anywhere in the final third is difficult for him. Lennon's workrate to come inside, effectively stretching and condensing the width of Toronto's back-line caused a bit of havoc and confusion. Both goals came from Soldado slipping his marker when Lennon came in.

A better stat would be whether or not they hit their target. Suarez used to be excellent at carrying the ball when he first came, but then he had so many off-target shots, he then changed his style to move closer to the goal before shooting and trusting his team mates to pass the ball back thus saving energy on the dribbling and converting it to better shots.
  
From Sturridges case we know he takes the ball, kicks it to some distance (from right side), then puts it in or runs with the ball after a through ball. He rarely does long shots (within 1 meter of the box isn't long shot imo) to the extent some other strikers do. The moving with the ball tells us they are capable of moving and creating space for shot, but without shots on target within those limited shots we have no idea if they are doing Coutinho style kick it side ways and then shoot, or Sturridges less desperate version where he looks for space and if he doesn't find it passes it on and moves inwards. 
  
Neat stat that he is trying to form, but it's pretty much useless without accuracy after dribbling, ratio between distance dribbled and accuracy (i.e dribbling 1m in Agueros case delivers 50% accuracy, if he increases it to 3m it goes down to 15%). And also why median and not mean? Median is pretty shit and has it's problems, obviously over football shots and countless data points it gets close, but no better than average (very few shots come from 50m runs).

true,Sage_CFC,null,null,"Slavery was a massive part of southern culture, most families benefited from slavery in some way. In fact it mattered so much to them that in six of the Declarations of secession slavery is directly mentioned, often in hateful tone.
 

[Here are some of the Declarations of Causes of Seceding States](http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/reasons.html#Mississippi)

From Mississippi
&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

From Georgia
&gt;The Presidential election of 1852 resulted in the total overthrow of the advocates of restriction and their party friends. Immediately after this result the anti-slavery portion of the defeated party resolved to unite all the elements in the North opposed to slavery an to stake their future political fortunes upon their hostility to slavery everywhere. This is the party two whom the people of the North have committed the Government. They raised their standard in 1856 and were barely defeated. They entered the Presidential contest again in 1860 and succeeded.
The prohibition of slavery in the Territories, hostility to it everywhere, the equality of the black and white races, disregard of all constitutional guarantees in its favor, were boldly proclaimed by its leaders and applauded by its followers.

From South Carolina 
&gt;This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.

From Texas
&gt;We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.

[And here is a quote from Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech)
&gt;The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions— African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the ""storm came and the wind blew, it fell."" **Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.**

Im sorry but there is no way you can claim slavery was a small part of southern culture,  it was integral to their way of life. And you are correct that Lincoln's sole purpose was to save the union, but one of the main reasons the Union was breaking up was because the southern's wanted to keep an entire race enslaved. 

Also what other part of southern culture could the flag represent? Its a flag for war and violence not ""hospitality"", good food, and religion. ",0,1406230871,null,0,1406231293,0,cj6r9na,t3_2biuks,t1_cj6r9na,t1_cj6p4fh,null,1434881311,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Token gesture:

*an action or a decision that is so small or inconsequential as to be only symbolic.*

But I do agree with the wider point about it being a disgrace. But the point stands that United fans in equivalent seats to those in the South Stand level 1 pay less for 19 league games, much less if the blue in question has to buy 'Platinum'.

That is something which you can't gloss over mate, I won't gloss over the fact that they have an enforced cup scheme (which is a disgrace), but lets not use that to say City could be worse or excuse our pricing. Is this how little we expect of City now?

Don't agree re the food and drink pricing either. The Jamie Oliver stuff is very expensive, but the standard food and drink at normal outlets is expensive also.

I won't change my mind about the United point, because I expect more of City than that. If all we have is that we're not that bad, *yet*, then I think we're on a slippery slope.

For most of us Americans, some distant relative just picked up everything they owned, left their extended family and property and moved halfway across the world. We're a nation of immigrants who don't know our personal history for more than a couple generations back, living in a country that really doesn't have the established history like European nations do. We can't see buildings or towns that were built during the Norman Invasion. Our families haven't always lived in the same general region. We eat foreign foods on holidays because ""that's what we eat"". We're very much struggling to create identities for ourselves.


They say that America is a big melting pot of people, but that's not true - it's more like a bowl of salad. Everyone brought a bit of the old country with them when they came, and that doesn't necessarily make sense when you spend time with people from other heritages. I've dated Italians and Polish girls who take one look at a Sunday roast with popovers and refuse to eat, seen really strange customs at family gatherings, and met people with a totally different way of doing things even though we may have grown up doors down from each other. I think that all of these people haven't blended their cultures into one tangible culture, and that's difficult for many of us. We naturally seek out those who share culture and customs with us, but because our family may have a mishmash of cultures, we try to separate what's what and belongs to who.

I guess it's hard to translate, quantify, or describe why so many of us focus on our ancestry. Personally, I just want to be able to tell my kids their family history.

Eriksen should be at CAM as often as possible.  Lamela is probably strongest playing at AMR, although I'm not opposed to giving him a chance to fight for that central role necessarily.  We need to see if we can entice a dedicated left winger, be it Depay or Griezmann or whomever, or else we need to commit to seeing if Chadli's got it in him to rise to the occasion.

A Principality of Wales did exist historically (from the 12th/13th centuries to 1542). The Principality was Welsh in origin, and was initially an attempt by the rulers of the Kingdom of Gwynedd to exert control over other native Welsh rulers within Wales. They were fairly successful in this regard, and by the time Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had firm control of the reins of power in the second half of the 13th century, the Principality controlled approximately 2/3rds of Wales and was starting to look like a united feudal state.

Then Edward I came along, trounced Llywelyn and conquered the nascent Principality. In the centuries that followed, the Principality continued to exist, though reduced in size (approximately corresponding to modern Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire), as an English possession. From time to time it was handed to the King's heir to rule as his personal demesne before he inherited the throne - this is why Prince Charles currently holds the title ""Prince of Wales"". The rest of Wales was divided between the King and the Marcher Lords - who were effectively petty kings in their own right, with very limited responsibilities to the crown. 

This state of affairs ended in 1542 with Henry VIII's Laws in Wales Acts (sometimes erroneously referred to as an Act of Union between England and Wales). The effects of these acts were many, but included the abolishment of both the Principality and the Marcher Lordships, the annexation of the entirety of Wales to the Kingdom of England, and the division of Wales into a number of shires.

Needless to say, things have changed again since - the Laws in Wales Acts have been repealed and Wales is no longer considered a *de jure* part of England.

The logic behind this is that it prevents laws being nullified by the use of clever loopholes.  Everything is illegal, therefore there's no loopholes.

The downside of this is that when you're caught in the sights of whatever operation may be currently underway, and you meet the socio-economic profile that's been identified as being likely to succumb to radicalisation, and if you've ever watched one moderate radical on YouTube and have a long-forgotten GCSE Chemistry textbook at the bottom of a cupboard.  Then welcome to Belmarsh, enjoy your lengthy stay before a trial (which, fortunately for now, you would still have a good chance of acquittal if there's no more serious evidence)!

Most people, of course, will never be that unlucky.  And you might even say that it's better to be safe and sorry if there's that many clues.  But the point is that the vast majority of things caught by terrorist legislation doesn't meet anyone's definition of terrorism.  It's not defined.

You only have to see how quite specific laws, like the one against malicious communication, gets stretched to jail people who say stupid, unpopular but non-threatening things on Twitter, to see the danger that even vaguer laws bring.

Okay that's sort of what I've been told to expect when it comes to the difficulty from the guy who went last year and my study abroad adviser, but I didn't know how to take it since the guy took business courses. Actually, the classes I'm taking are Level 2 at most. Organic chemistry, human physiology, and my anthropology course are Level 1, genetics and anatomy are Level 2. My classes will for sure be transferring, over half of the students here study abroad so they work hard to be on top of their stuff. They have direct grade translations for US classes, and we have to specifically approve every course through a department head before we can enroll in it at the other school. So that I'm not worried about. However, I am so worried about the part you said about classes overlapping - the US study abroad lady in charge of modules emailed me which courses she has me down for, and it was just the top 4 I put down. I found it hard to believe that they wouldn't overlap, now I know I should be worried! I'm so concerned about that. Especially since most of the courses I'm looking at have a bunch of different lectures/practicals/seminars etc to schedule. So when I get to campus will I be doing the re-scheduling? I emailed the module lady back asking that question and didn't get an answer yet. I'm feeling rather in the dark!

I don't know anything about the grocery stores/stores of really any kind there, so I'm glad you mentioned it. Love that you can get stuff delivered, that is so helpful. Do most people cook their own meals? Not having a meal plan option is very strange but I think I'll prefer cooking. I'm hoping to live in Lewes Court II (the ensuite one) or Northfield, I should find out soon. Definitely want my own bathroom. It's cheaper to get that housing than a semester at ANY of our on-campus options, which is amazing - private school problems. 

I'm looking into those vacuum bags now because winter clothes are so bulky! I am only taking a carry one and one suitcase, yep, because I'm visiting Paris/Edinburgh/London before I go to Brighton (we have family friends in London who we think we are going to ship my big suitcase to so I don't have to carry it around). Hopefully that won't cost us an arm and a leg because I really don't want to tote that thing around... 

I most definitely will be going into Brighton often! Thank you for the bus and rail info, as well. Everyone says Brighton is wonderful, I really can't wait to go.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"I think we already have quite a good system. I and my friends were done for pot when we were young I got a fine and my friends were searched and made to chuck the stuff away. (  with me the police came round to say turn down the music and my friend opened the door, said "" oh fuck it's the police"" and slammed it in their face - we got a fine after a long search. My friends were stoned as fuck caught smoking in a lane, searched  and told to chuck it down the drain ) 

The problem with legal drugs is that problem users can buy and take as much as they like ( yes you can ration but it's easily circumvented and difficult to prove it's been circumvented ).  With the current system a LOT of marijuana is smoked and the police don't care. I mean they could be doing undercover busts at glastonbury but they're not because they tend to only deal with problem users.  

There is a big denial about problem pot users from mental health problems, motivational problems, ""smoking and driving"" social withdrawal and psychological addiction. I'm not saying these effect all users but they do effect some and we have to be honest about it.  People who recognise their drugs problems like the fact it's out of sight and out of reach. The downside is that it costs money to police, inhibits the freedoms of otherwise law abiding citizens and occasionally ( I think very rarely in reality ) non-problem users are charged with cannabis possession.  Then there is the question of drugs and the young - Some say legalising it just makes it more prevalent and hence more likely to be used by the young similar to underage drinking. Some say that giving it proper legal framework would keep it out of the hands of the young. Speaking from personal experience when I was young it was always more easy to get hold of beer that pot.  The documentaries I have seen about marijuana in Colorado say that the schools are just full of it. How accurate this is I don't know. 

Personally I think we should look at ""overall harm limitation"" and realistically weigh up the pros and cons of both sides.  There is a tendency on both sides of the debate to portray their solution as the only workable solution. The ideal solution is to have it available to responsible users and unavailable to problem users ( especially the young ).  The current system in britian is in law far from this, however in the way the law is practiced and enforced it is a lot closer. Sure if you are stopped in your car ( drug driving ) you're in trouble, dealers that deal to kids are in trouble but if you are stopped in the street smoking a spliff the chances are you will at most get a fine ( it's also not that hard to avoid the police finding out in the first place)

**TL;DR**  I guess overall I come out in favour of keeping it illegal BUT with responsible and tolerant policing that only reserves punishments for problem users and those who deal to them. But I should repeat I don't think it's and easy decision , both sides of the legalisation debate have their merits, their downsides and their spurious arguments. It's only in the balance can we decide the best way forward to reduce overall harm.

That's a common misconception, but there is no specific law against giving a ""bad reference"".

An employer can state anything they want to long as it's factual and does not misrepresent a situation. 

What muddies the water is where someone might have a job offer withdrawn because of what they *perceive* as a negative reference from a past employer, even if what was said was entirely factual (i.e. So-and-so is a dirty thief and here is the police report details). There have been cases where people have tried to raise court actions against the previous employer and tried to hold them liable for their losses from not getting the job.

I don't know how far they got, but that's why a lot of places will now state nothing other than dates employed and final salary - even questions such as ""Eligible for rehire?"" are often ignored so as to avoid saying anything that could possibly ever lead to a court case.

[Drinking and driving was poorly understood](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=657048) 30-50 years ago and this ignorance was the cause of a great many road deaths. Rape and consent are currently poorly understood in the UK, and this is the reason behind a lot rapes, many rapists not believing what they have done to be wrong.

Drink driving was a growing social problem in the 1950s-1970s as more and more people became motorists and began living in lesser population densities. To deal with the growing number of road accidents and deaths attributable to drinking and driving the Dept for Transport began a [massive education and awareness campaign](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1691515.stm) in 1976 aimed at making clear what drinking and driving was, what effect alcohol would have on driving, and what the consequences were for the individual guilty of the offence, their family, their victim, and their victim's family. The campaign has been remarkably effective, with the death toll from drink driving crashes 5 or 6 years ago being a [quarter of what they were in 1980](http://www.theguardian.com/responsibledrinking/road.safety). The [UK government set out to change how people understood drink driving](https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Department_for_Transport_How_thirty_years_of_drink_drive_communications_saved.pdf) and they have been successful in changing the social norm and reducing road deaths.

Rape, and how it is understood, is a social problem. That rapists and sex offenders such as Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall, and the revelations of Jimmy Savile's prolific offending, were able to abuse so many and get away with it for so long, shows how poorly their crimes were understood and tolerated. It's known that [rapists don't consider themselves rapists](https://www.d.umn.edu/~bmork/2306/readings/scullyandmarollis.htm) as they believe that what they did was not rape, due to a poor understanding of what consent is, and is why [many rapists will admit to rape when the word ""rape"" is not used](http://www.upworthy.com/whoa-4-questions-that-got-120-rapists-to-admit-they-were-rapists-5). That past crimes are being prosecuted now is testament to how far society's understanding of consent and rape has come, however it must go further.

What is needed, and what the NUS wants, is an education and public awareness campaign for rape which follows the same lines as the drinking and driving campaign.",0,1406235140,null,0,false,0,cj6tofk,t3_2bl1x8,t1_cj6tofk,t1_cj6kdza,null,1434882516,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

It has to do with the fact that our club's sole business plan has been oriented around the maximum productivity of a defective player, that nearly all of our resources for the past 3 years have been allocated to keeping a defective player or acquiring players to feed a defective player. And, our defective player spends his offseason traipsing from Vegas to Monaco to Dubai looking for a perty instead of keeping himself fit.
 

I'm not going to assume Zarate is going to do the business until I see it happen. He hasn't pulled up trees anywhere he's played, and no team has been particularly interested in retaining his services. That does say something about him. Valencia? Who knows, maybe he can do the business, but he is in for a cultural and physical bordering on traumatic shock. Not many South Americans who've never been away from their tropical South American world make the transition to a potentially relegation battle bound side in East London smoothly. Staring into the East London rains in near freezing weather looking for a ball to drop from the sky while Robert Huth is perforating your kidney with his elbow is a new experience Enner will not have experienced.
It has to do with the fact that we are bolstering our squad with promising but completely untested names and assuming they're going to click immediately. That rarely happens. Even the best of players need a season to find their level. More often, however, players don't provide what we were hoping they would. Statistically, I'm guessing maybe 2 of our signings come good and the rest either fail or tread water. It has to do with the fact that we're going to dump Ravel Morrison because Sam hasn't got the patience to work with the kid (or because Ravel wouldn't play ball with Sam's agent). It has to do with the fact that the Dave's and young Jack are suddenly very vocal for a sustained period this summer. The last time that happened we got Avram followed by relegation. It has to do with the fact that not many of the clubs that stayed up last season have gotten worse and some have got better. It has to do with the fact that we start the season with a very difficult schedule. Start poorly and you're chasing the pack from the off. Start well and you're in good shape.

ANYWAY back to the point. The motion that was passed in 2012 (""the struggles"") did NOT mean CathSoc could not hold talks on abortion (indeed I made sure we never tried to in 2012), it just made sure that all talks were balanced and non-threatening, and that both sides of the argument were represented.

It just angers me that this motion (which caused me so much trouble), is so often misrepresented as CathSoc has issues with the notion of pro-choice, in fact they call it with ""anti-life"" (I /think/ that's the term)

However, the fact that this speaker was not approved WAS due to paperwork. This is because CathSoc has the chaplaincy on Gower Street which is often used for meetings. This meant that sometimes, the President wouldn't have to submit paperwork because they were not technically meeting in University Property and this is why other quite shocking talks have been allowed at CathSoc.

Before that slavery was part of the American culture. It was in the Constitution. Some of the most revered Americans owned slaves. A major portion of the American economy depended on slavery. American families, north and south, benefited from it in some way.

I don't know why you linked me to the declarations of secession. I have not once said that the Civil War was not about slavery, but there are a couple of viewpoints in there that were held not just in the South:
&gt;These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun.

and

&gt;disregard of all constitutional guarantees in its favor

and
&gt;by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens

and
&gt;regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.

were ideas not uncommon outside of the South because of ""science"" and religion and the fact that it was in the Constitution.

&gt; one of the main reasons the Union was breaking up was because the southern's wanted to keep an entire race enslaved.

In essence yes, but at the time the main reason the Union was breaking up was because the southerners felt their Constitutional and natural rights were being infringed upon. At the time, slavery was not a crime. Again, its not fair to compare the Civil War era to a society that has advanced 150 years.

&gt;Its a flag for war and violence

It WAS a flag for war. I'll say it again: I could say the exact same thing about the American flag during the American Revolution. What else could it stand for? Certainly not freedom or independence. Do I believe this? No of course not. That is because I am not completely ignoring the rest of American culture. What other parts of Southern culture could it represent? All of them, including hospitality, food, and religion. Why can't it? I don't understand why you keep insinuating that a modern-day southerner must have the same mindset as a southerner from 150 years ago if they display pride in where they are from. That someone who displays the flag is automatically racist. Chelsea FC itself has been linked with hooliganism and radicalism in the past.

&gt;It has to do with the fact that our club's sole business plan has been oriented around the maximum productivity of a defective player, that nearly all of our resources for the past 3 years have been allocated to keeping a defective player or acquiring players to feed a defective player.

Very true, and frustrating. Sam hitched his buggy to Andy Carroll. The board bought into that idea. They bought into a lot of things Sam said, but I think it's becoming more and more clear they're at the end of the line with Sam. If we don't make Europe, a new man will be in charge at West Ham this time next year. I remain optimistic this is the case because it's increasingly clear it's the case.

&gt;I'm not going to assume Zarate is going to do the business until I see it happen. He hasn't pulled up trees anywhere he's played, and no team has been particularly interested in retaining his services. That does say something about him. Valencia? Who knows, maybe he can do the business, but he is in for a cultural and physical bordering on traumatic shock. Not many South Americans who've never been away from their tropical South American world make the transition to a potentially relegation battle bound side in East London smoothly. Staring into the East London rains in near freezing weather looking for a ball to drop from the sky while Robert Huth is perforating your kidney with his elbow is a new experience Enner will not have experienced.

This I somewhat agree with, as well. Zarate played well as a loan for a relegated Birmingham side when he was just a pup. He played pretty well in Serie A for Lazio, but flopped at Inter. Couldn't find a contract then lit it up for his boyhood club in Argentina this year. He isn't exactly ""unproven"", but he's inconsistent so you can't hitch a club to him. Valencia is young and hungry. I've seen him play quite a bit living in Los Angeles and I see far too much upside not to be excited about him. They play dirty down in Mexico, so he's used to physicality.

&gt; It has to do with the fact that we're going to dump Ravel Morrison because Sam hasn't got the patience to work with the kid (or because Ravel wouldn't play ball with Sam's agent).

I'll believe that when it happens. Tabloids shouldn't be trusted, here. Gold loves him and has been vocal in his support.

&gt; It has to do with the fact that the Dave's and young Jack are suddenly very vocal for a sustained period this summer. The last time that happened we got Avram followed by relegation. 

I don't know what to make of it other than Sullivan is unhappy. More evidence Sam will be leaving, I think. But I don't think it'll be a midseason transition that sends us down.

&gt;It has to do with the fact that not many of the clubs that stayed up last season have gotten worse and some have got better. 

But there isn't much evidence any of the promoted sides improved enough to stay up, either. MAYBE QPR, but that's a stretch at this point.

&gt;It has to do with the fact that we start the season with a very difficult schedule. Start poorly and you're chasing the pack from the off. Start well and you're in good shape.

On top of this there were also changes to funding, in that if a student doesn't at least make a ""reasonable"" attempt at every assessment in a year the uni gets none of the funding. Essentially if someone drops out before they have achieved something, even if it's towards the end of the year they have paid (and no, it's not refundable) but the university forfeits the money.

Banning alcohol is difficult. The ingredients of risen bread and sugar are all you need. In fact even if you don't have yeast you can just leave sugared water somewhere warm to create alcohol.  If you banned alcohol yes there would be a massive dip in consumption but there would be a massive increase the horrible side effects of impure badly home brewed alcohol possibly laced with solvents or anti-freeze. 

As a nation we have been drinking alcohol for centuries. This means we are far more aware of the harm and damage it can cause to individuals and to society and we have also great experience in dealing with these harms.  In fact alcohol tolerance is embedded in our DNA - people from east asian countries often lack genes to ""properly"" metabolise alcohol. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction)

I would also argue that Drunks are more predictable. People tend to become more social and extrovert and all their senses and abilities tend to be dulled but they often just become an exaggerated more social version of themselves. Yes that's sometimes violent. But alcoholic drink does not have a monopoly on violent behavior.  Cannabis and alcohol is often a bases for some of the sickest violent crimes around [source](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/serial-killer-joanna-dennehy-bright-3063138). Cannabis smokers make up 8% of america [source](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163835/tried-marijuana-little-changed-80s.aspx) but cannabis is found in the blood of 54% of arrested criminals [source](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/05/23/192101/marijuana-is-drug-most-often-linked.html)

 I find cannabis alters my mind far more deeply that alcohol ( not as deeply as LSD of magic shrooms but cannabis does alter ""who I am"" far more that alcohol).  And alcohol does not have a monopoly on car accidents either - People who are stoned are terrible drivers with slowed reaction times often worse that those of drinkers and , in my experience, there is a lot more denial from stoned drivers than from drunk drives. ( ""I drive better when I'm stoned"".. no you don't, you just think you do ) 

There's also increasing evidence that cannabis can cause mental illness in individuals. Mentally ill people can often be more costly on society as unlike people with liver damage, mentally ill people can need people to watch over them - directly effecting 2 lives instead of 1. 

There is no doubt that if alcohol was discovered today it would be banned. But it wasn't. It's been part of who we are for 1000's of years.  It has become part of our culture and part of how we relieve stress. 

The question with alcohol is where the balance between benefit and cost lie in making it illegal. 

**If you make it illegal many people would lose their weekend stress relief and resort of unhealthy badly brewed alternatives potential laced with lethal indistinguishable chemicals.  With illegal pot a smaller portion of people find it harder to get their weekend stress relief BUT there isn't that much chance of them being sold a dangerous alternative laced with solvent.  illegal pot is nowhere near as dangerous as illegal alcohol.**

This is why I would keep Alcohol legal.

true,pass-from-coutinho,null,null,"&gt;Silence Please: If they do a minutes silence for the 96, please stay silent. Bow your heads. No rustling or talking or chanting. No clapping, it's not a celebration. I know the severity of the disaster and the pain of the years that followed is not lost on most of you, but that guy shouting 'justice for the 96' during the silence didn't quite get it. Shout that after the silence. Clap for 96 seconds...but after the silence.

At the risk of opening a can of worms here, I think it's worth uttering a few words in the defense of Boston's Liverpool fans (although I wasn't at the game and in general hate Boston fans). 

* ""A minute's silence"" is not a thing in the US. What we have is a ***moment* of silence**. The end of this moment is generally indicated by something like, for example, the releasing of balloons.

* Although I'm sure the plan for a minute's silence was announced on the PA at Fenway, it's often difficult to hear PA annoucers clearly and ""minute"" and ""moment"" sound pretty damn similar. Given that many Americans have never heard of or experienced a ""*minute's* silence"", it makes sense they would probably have interpreted the announcement as being about a ""moment of silence."" 

* In an American context, having a moment of silence for people who died and then clapping as balloons (or doves or whatever) are released is wholly appropriate and respectful. I think it's a bit unfair there's so much criticism of the US fans for reacting in a manner that was both entirely predictable and entirely appropriate in their culture. I understand it's an English team, but Fenway park is not in England, and it's silly to expect American fans to suddenly adapt to British sporting culture and traditions, especially given that most of them probably thought it was meant to be an American tradition (the *moment* of silence) anyway.

Obviously this doesn't excuse the shouting dude, but in fairness, I'd say it was a little dumb of LFC to plan for a minute of silence even though that's not done in the US and fans won't be familiar with it...and to plan to release balloons during that time, even though many fans are going to interpret that as the signal that the moment of silence is over.

You won't convince anyone with anecdotes that strangely enough support your own view. In fact, the Met Police have had massive problems with institutional racism against black Londoners for years - when even the Daily Mail is pissed off at the cover up of the murder of a black teenager, that's a sign that the Met really have problems.

White flight is bullshit, there are many reasons why many white Londoners are leaving London, but for most race doesn't come into it. Probably because it isn't 1950 anymore, and most white British realise that most people from ethnic minorities are, and this might shock you, just normal people like them. All races have their minority of criminals, but no race is entirely or mostly made up of criminals.

I mean medicals don't usually happen unless the basics of the contract have been agreed and both clubs are game. So we could have just stumbled at the final hurdle on the contract, but maybe Pellegrini has changed his mind.

Maybe he likes the way Rekik, Boyata and Nasty are performing in training, pre-season, realises there were some badly timed injuries and that Demi is gonna be solid from game 1, not start being a rock in march.

Maybe he would rather keep Nastasic than sell him, if thats the choice the club are giving him?

Or maybe he has his eye on the possible Isco move and knows there won't be room for another foreign player if were to arrive?

So my first response was ""Oh shit"" But if we had 11/12 Nastasic and post February Demichelis partnering Vinny we'd be solid anyway.

Compare the interest to a mortgage rate (they are roughly the same - Nationwide have one for 4%, I saw, on a 50% loan - i.e. borrowing £50k to buy a £100k home). When you get a mortgage, you have to take out life insurance to pay it off if you die. You also sign over the rights to your house to the bank; if you default, they get to recover their money by selling the house.

There are hundreds of thousands of students in the UK this year alone. Quite a few will make life choices which means they don't have to ever pay back a penny (becoming a child carer to raise their kids, going into a low paid profession). Quite a few others will (sadly) die over the course of 28 years, and their remaining debt must be written off. Others will emigrate and maybe just vanish.

So the loan you have for your *unsecured* (high-risk) borrowing, being roughly the same price as a *secured* (low-risk) borrowing, is fantastic value (in terms of the interest rate you are getting, not in terms of the fact that you have to take loans out in the first place). I'd be surprised if they don't make a loss.

Moreover: if you're a graduate on £30k, then you're going to have plenty of spare income - even if you live in London, if you live cheaply. Before tax, that's £2,500 per month. And you will [take home](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) £1,946.23 each and every month.

I reckon you can stab at least £200 per month off that loan even with partying. And that will massively reduce your total repayments and bring that loan term down to something sensible.

We either live in a world where universities compete with each other to attract prospective students, or a world where students compete with each other to earn university places. It cannot be both.

We live in the latter world, because that's just how modern schools are set up, with grading systems for students to be sent to the university for rejection of acceptance, as well as the flawed but entrenched model of everyone needing a degree to get a half-decent job.

In my opinion, the government should instead use the university fee system to control the education demographics to better fit the jobs available in this country. If there's not enough teachers, lower the fee cap of teaching courses. If too many people are leaving with Spanish language degrees and ending up unemployed*, raise the cap of Spanish courses, and so on.

Degrees are not all made equal, and this is a tool that the government should be using to reduce youth unemployment by steering them in the right direction.

So I'm paying 16 quid a month back to the UK. Even if I stayed over there and got a nicer salary it would jump up to about 50 quid.

In real terms you'll pay back around 70k on the 52k loan over 28 years.

When the government factors in inflation into the increases they're not making any money on that, they're just adjusting the amount you're paying to take into account that future money is worth less than current money (but on average people will also get paid more so it all cancels out).

More importantly, get a burr grinder. You can get a decent conical burr hand grinder for £20-£30. Then you can fresh grind and get a nice even grind.

If you want you coffee to be better than starbucks then you need to get some fresh roast beans. There are lots of websites which do mail delivery. I personally use [Hasbean](http://www.hasbean.co.uk/) and [Pact](https://www.pactcoffee.com/coffee_process). They are about twice as much as from the supermarket but you can get some mind blowing coffee (waaaay better than starbucks, and cheaper too)


Finally consider experimenting with the different brew methods. French press is great for getting a tonn of body but it can be harsh in terms of acidity as well as muddy. Personal favourites of mine are Aeropress and V60 filter. It can take a bit of inverstment but you can enjoy some outstanding coffee and over time the savings come.

The question is, do we have the funds to pull off the new signings.  I'm going to guess Garry had a starting budget of 15m.  So far, Emnes and Montero cost 5.5m, but we made 4m on Hernandez and 2.5m on Vorm.  Most of these were undisclosed and the fees are based on rumors, so there will be some give and take, however, I'd estimate we have about 16m left.  Payet would cost around 6.7m so that brings us to 9.3m.  Then, De Guzman would cost about 8m.  With 1.3m left, we sell Canas and we just sold Pozuelo today, so I'd guess we'd be back up to 6.8m (4m for Canas, 1.5 for Pozuelo).  This is where I put my two cents in.  I'd like us to sign Kelvin Leerdam.  He's young, he can pass, he's versatile, and he's relatively cheap.  We sign him for 2.2m and have 4.6m remaining.  At this point, I think Ki will be on his way out.  I want him to stay, but there are a lot of rumors going around.  Maybe we get 5.5m for him, and I think we can replace him with Lille's Idrissa Gueye for 4.5m.  With 5.5m left, we focus on left back.  For extra funds, we sell Tiendalli and Richards for a combined 1.5m.  Now at 7m, I hope we bid for Samuel Umtiti from Lyon.  I almost guarantee we won't get him, but he's a great young defender who can also play centre back, and it completes our theme of out with the Spaniards, in with the French.

Ok so lets look at this logically. A few years ago universities were MASSIVELY oversubscribed. 
Despite spending three years and the better part of ten grand on fees alone, graduates were finding employment in their chosen sector a huge challenge due to too many people now bei g qualified for the same niche job.

By hiking fees the government are making universities elitist again.  

Anyone who says ""now only rich kids can afford it"" is talking shit. Yes rich kids will still go to uni but now so will kids that are intelligent and hardworking because loans are available.

Yes there will be more debt but equally wages for niche jobs will rise alongside demand for employees.

Why does nobody seem to grasp this? 

University was never intended for the masses it ia supposed to be an optional form of higher education. It is not a right nor a privilege. 

Students used to live on bread,  baked beans and books. In the last few years they've been living off of nandos, belvedere and Domino's... I say the price hike is a good thing; a degree is something to be earned, not expected.

EDIT: For clarity, because it was 2am when I wrote this.

I'm not saying that price hikes improve quality of degrees nor am I saying that only clever kids can now study, I'm simply saying that by paying that bit more money, students give themselves more of a chance of actually utilising their degree in the appropriate sector because there will be less graduates overall. 

I don't like the fact that to do so means more debt but equally understand that if you have more jobs than graduates than employers have to offer more perks so as to attract employees. Ie higher wages to enable payback of loans faster.

It's called supply and demand and kind of underpins our economic system. 

ALSO, Don't compare our system to the US, it is completely different. In the states you borrow money for a degree, you pay it back whether working or not, in the UK If you never manage to achieve a graduate wage, you never pay back your loans.

 One of the great things about her personality is how well she takes things in and adjusts/ adapts quickly. But then you see that isnt the doctor, she is in fact, a human girl by the way reality hits her and she reacts to danger or seeing death or creatures/planets etc.

I believe the more direct style will benefit him greatly.  I don't think he got to show off much of his skill last year, but he's a great dribbler with a nice shot.  He's also one of our very few players that is actually good in the air.  He may not win games entirely on his own, but he can certainly contribute and thrive under Pochettino.

Thank you for your message and I hope you will find this update on the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill (#DRIP) useful. 

 

MPs debated the Bill all day on Tuesday.

 

The first part of the debate was about the timing and the fact this legislation is being rushed through before the summer, without proper parliamentary scrutiny and without any justification.

 

I said: If the Bill is so urgent, will the Minister explain why it was not introduced three months ago, as soon as the European Court of Justice judgment was announced? Why are we debating it in one day, just before the recess?

 

It is outrageous that we have been granted one day in which to debate and scrutinise a Bill of such significance. It is even more outrageous that this is being blamed on a totally manufactured emergency and represented as doing nothing other than maintaining the status quo. That is not accurate. This is a huge power grab under false pretences. Notwithstanding the fact that the status quo has been ruled a breach of fundamental rights, the provisions in the Bill, specifically clause 4, extend the territorial reach of the laws relating to data retention. It brings overseas communication companies providing services within the UK into the scope of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The implications of this are well understood by my constituents in Brighton, who have been lobbying me since last week. As one said, we have democratic process for a reason: to prevent such Bills becoming law on the basis of a nod and a wink.

 

You can read my full speech in response to the Government’s timetabling of the legislation here: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0001.htm#140715-0001.htm_spnew139 

 

We then moved on to talking about the Bill as a whole. 

 

I said: We have been repeatedly told that the Bill simply maintains the status quo, and there are plenty of legal experts who will argue that that is not accurate; we have heard many of their statements repeated in the Chamber this afternoon. Notwithstanding the fact that the status quo has been ruled a breach of fundamental human rights, the provisions in the Bill, specifically clause 4, extend the territorial reach of the law relating to data retention, bringing overseas communications companies that provide services in the UK into the scope of RIPA.

 

Even those parts of the Bill that do not constitute going further than the status quo are deeply worrying. It has been confirmed that they breach fundamental human rights in their scope and in their totality.

 

Moreover, while we are told that communications data played a role in 95% of all serious criminal investigations over the past decade, we have no idea about the exact nature of that role. That makes it difficult to judge exactly how significant the blanket retention of data is in averting terrorist attacks, for example.

 

You can read my full speech at the Second Reading of the Bill here: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0003.htm#140715-0003.htm_spnew10

 

MPs then debated the various clauses of the Bill, including an amendment that I tabled to try to time limit the damage caused by the proposed legislation.

 

I said: Almost no issue that we deal with affects people as directly as their personal communications, and, therefore, is as sensitive.

Many arguments have been advanced on why it is not necessary to pass the Bill in such a short time. There is no serious argument that this is an emergency. If there were, it would have been dealt with three months ago. People can see through that. Their concerns and disillusionment with this Parliament will be redoubled by this process, instead of being addressed by it.

 

One reason why I support amendment 2 to the sunset clause is that it would rescue something from this unhappy state. If we at least said that over the coming months, we will do this piece of work properly and a review will happen, we could build some confidence among the public. As it is, I regret to say that we have lost yet more public confidence today, at a time when we can least afford to do so.

 

You can read my full speech at the Committee Stage of the Bill here: 

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0004.htm#140715-0004.htm_spnew72

 

Finally, speaking about new clause 6, I said:

 

I think that many people who have been watching this debate are deeply concerned about what they perceive to be an issue of such importance being treated with such contempt and about the Orwellian doublespeak that we have heard throughout the past few hours.

 

You can read my full speech at this stage of the proceedings here: 

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0005.htm#140715-0005.htm_spnew5

 

At every opportunity I voted against the Bill, which was backed by all three big political parties and therefore agreed by the House of Commons with 449 votes to 33.

 

Yesterday the Bill was debated by the House of Lords. That debate is ongoing today but, despite a number of peers raising similar concerns to those raised by myself and a small number of other MPs, there is every expectation that members of the House of Lords will vote in support of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill.

 

That means it will become law almost immediately. 

 

I am sorry that more MPs did not stand up for our fundamental rights but I promise that I will keep doing all I can to represent your concerns in Parliament.  If you need any further information please do let me know.

 

Best wishes, Caroline

true,L2Kenny,lfc99,,"&gt; I just wanted to say last year we were linked with Costa, Willian, Mkhitaryan and to top that all of we didn't have CL

Costa didn't have his breakout season when we were linked with him, same with Willian. We were linked with Mkhitaryan and lost out on him to then-Champions League Runners-up. No shame in that from a team that finished 7th.

&gt; I do think Lallana and Markovic are good players but it's just now that we have CL football and shit ton of money from the Suarez deal and T.V revenue we could be chasing for better players than Bertrand.

We can get quality players without breaking the bank. Spending a lot of money doesn't mean they're better, it just means they're more expensive. e.g. Carroll, Downing, Aquilana. If we can get great talent for under £15m like Sturridge or Coutinho, then what's the problem? Bertrand isn't exactly a great player, but he'll probably be a backup for Enrique rather than a first team player.

We're also linked with £20m Lovren, £18m Moreno and however much Shaqiri was.

&gt; Perhaps what bothers me the most is our EPL rivals signing Sanchez, Herrera, Costa and being in for Hummels and players like that and we having sold our best player, is making me feel like we're falling behind a bit.

true,CombustibLemon,cnty-england,England,"My Email response was less assuring

&gt; Thank you for writing to me regarding the government's emergency legislation on communication data and interception.
&gt;
&gt;As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse.
In order to prevent this, we need new legislation which responds to the ECJ judgement on data retention and brings clarity to existing law in response to communication service providers' requests. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer.
&gt;
&gt;The Government has come forward with emergency legislation and I believe it is essential to maintain the security of our citizens and also ensure people's privacy is protected. Serious criminal investigations and counter terrorism intelligence operations must not be jeopardised. That is why I support this emergency legislation which I accept is designed solely to protect existing capabilities.
&gt;
&gt;I share your concerns about the timetable and the fact the Government has left this until the last minute. Given the limited Parliamentary time to discuss emergency legislation Labour has ensured that the Government's legislation is temporary and it will expire in 2016. This will require the Government and Parliament to properly consult on and consider longer term proposals next year.
&gt; 
&gt;Labour has also secured an independent review into RIPA - the legislation that has governed everything in this area, including data retention and access - in the light of new technology. We announced this pledge four months ago, it is a major reform and will now begin imminently. We are also seeking to amend the Bill to make this review part of the law.
&gt; 
&gt;This review will enable longer term questions and concerns to be properly dealt with and debated in time for new legislation. Changes will then follow. In addition, Labour has called for and secured further safeguards to restrict the ways in which communications data and intercept can be used to prevent misuse.
&gt;
&gt;Some people have been calling for new legislation in 5 months, but I don't believe that is enough time for the serious, thorough and sustained public debate and consultation needed to get this right. That's what Labour's independent review will deliver.
&gt; 
&gt;It would be far too damaging to the fight against serious crime, online child abuse and counter terrorist intelligence to suddenly lose these capabilities now, and these safeguards have secured a better process for longer term reform to make sure we have the right capabilities and the right safeguards in place.
&gt; 
&gt;Thank you again for getting in touch about this very important issue.
&gt;

Unfortunately, after an accident, multiple things were damaged and other bits had worn down significantly (Needed new wheel, dérailleurs (Front and rear), chainring) and I decided to splash out on a newer Alu bike. I love the new one, and it's great, rides well and looks beautiful but I sure as hell miss my Steelie. I still have it in my living room and plan to eventually get it fixed up with a whole new drivetrain so I can ride it again. She's heavy, but once you got going she rides like a dream (and I got told as much on several occasions by mechanics that serviced her over the years).
If you're used to Boris bikes, the weight wont bother you and you'll be blown away by the smoothness.

But they're still human and no matter what job you're in and how good you are at this job, you still need that extra bit of motivation to keep pushing.

And, right, there is the call for that ""marquee"" player but maybe we have that marquee player in the making at Liverpool. We also have to think/hope that our current squad - which is quite young - will continue to progress forward and continue improving.

Sometimes pulling together a group of amazingly talented individuals will work but there is also something to be said about creating a *cohesive team* as well.

That's what I think of this thought.

How are we going to define fucking link? Because right now United have been rejected by player after player. Herrera, as many have noted, is not likely to succeed at United. They have no one in their midfield to protect him. Fellaini, for the areas he does have skill, is no Mascherano type.

You have to realize that signing and being linked with a player are very different things. And, furthermore, signing and a player being better than what you already have are very different things.

Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson became English first 11 in one season because we didn't sign someone to replace them in our starting 11 and with that opportunity that grew into invaluable, exceptional players. 

We're never going to compete with City and Chelsea. They can offer money and an almost guarantee they'll be in the title race come April and May. No one else can do that.

Sanchez chose Wenger and London more than he chose Arsenal.


Very soon (and in many respects it's already happening) we are going to have pull because of Rodgers. And we're probably going to have pull in England because we've put together such a team of English talent. We'll have CL pull IF we can secure it again. If we don't secure it we obviously don't deserve it.


All the players United have been linked with have been nothing more than wishes. 

Last summer we were never going to get Costa. We were not going to get Willian (and I will continue to insist until people see it in his lack of growth that he is nothing more than an average player wrapped in an exciting style of play and...hair). And Mkhitaryan has proven that he is not world class but just a very solid player. Would he have helped us? Sure, but probably at the expense of Coutinho, Sterling, or Henderson's development depending on how Rodgers lined up with him.


I don't think you're a plastic fan, I just think you can't have been following the game long enough or you haven't learned how worthless rumors are AND you didn't watch last season when we got second because we HAD to trust kids and didn't just sign the new shiny car.",0,1406256872,null,0,false,0,cj73ton,t3_2bnc4w,t1_cj73ton,t3_2bnc4w,null,1435465354,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I make this comparison a lot - though, it may not be the perfect comparison - but the similarities between Theo Walcott and Sterling are there: two young, exciting, fast, similar-sized players, England caps, etc.

* Walcott (18-years-old) - 39 appearances across all competitions - 7 goals // Sterling (18) - 36 and 2
* Walcott (19) - 35 and 6 // Sterling (19) 34 and 10
* Walcott (20) - 30 and 4 // Sterling (20) ?
* Walcott (21) - 38 and 13 // Sterling (21) ?
* Walcott (22) - 46 and 11 // Sterling (22) ?
* Walcott (23) - 43 and 21 // Sterling (23) ?
* Walcott (24) - 18 and 6 (injury) // Sterling (24) ?

Admittedly, this is a *very simple* way to look but I think this is a nice, basic overview of the two players.

At 21 and 22, Theo Walcott has double-digit goals with 13 and 11. Then Walcott ""breaks-out"" - goal-wise - with 21 goals over all competitions. Then an injury cuts short his following season.

Now, if you argue that Sterling is better than Walcott at the same age (and I think Sterling certainly might be) then we can see some exciting things happening for Sterling who is turning 20-years-old this season. And if he continues working hard there's no reason why we won't start seeing 20+ goals across all competitions for Sterling within a couple seasons. And who knows how well he could do from there.

But - as Sterling stated - first thing is first: Working hard this season and continuing to progress forward bit by bit. Very excited for Raheem Sterling this season.",0,1406257733,null,0,false,0,cj747ep,t3_2bn2sc,t1_cj747ep,t3_2bn2sc,null,1434887560,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

true,rosscatherall,eng-TyneWear,Zoocastle,"I've fought off 8 sanctions this year. All found to be the fault of my appointed advisor at the work programme that the jobcentre sent me on. They constantly changed my address around in their system and then wondered by I wasn't turning up to appointments. But instead of just picking up the phone and asking why I wasn't turning up, they just put through the sanction requests.

On actually moving and informing both my work programme and the jobcentre, it still took the work programme 4 weeks to implement my change. During which another 3 sanctions were sent out as my post was once again going to the wrong address.

I brought it up in a meeting with my advisor. She accused me of starting an argument and told me she had to go and calm down. 

I ended up having to get my local MP involved as I went 5 weeks without any income whatsoever and zero word back on any reconsideration requests I had put in. It eventually got overturned in my favour, but by then I was already in so much debt for those 5 weeks that I'm still paying for it now.

My latest set of sanctions were similar. I put in a reconsideration and heard nothing for 5 weeks. At that point I started e-mailing my local MP. I was invited down to their office to sign a form that would hand my case over to them to sort out, along with copies of all correspondence I had received relating to my sanctions.

The MP's secretary phoned me on a daily basis for the week letting me know that she hadn't forgotten about me and detailing the steps she was taking. Eventually she had to resort to using the MP's official e-mail address to get in touch with somebody higher up to sort my problems out.

I think there's a bit too much enthusiasm on the board for the players we've brought in, and I think we're at least 3 players shy at the moment from where we need to be. Even if this lot are a bumper crop, they will need a season at a minimum to settle in.

Live Updates Provided Below from 5.30pm

@RioHoye: Will youth be given a proper first team chance this year? E.g Lee, Chambers, Potts, Lletget?

DS: The manager picks the team, not me, but I believe in youth development.

‏@MitchellClark: will we be signing any other full backs this summer? 

DS: We hope to sign one more full back as we are short in that position.

@RioHoye: which youth player do you think is most likely to break into the first team? 

DS: I think it would be wrong for me to say.

@grahamwhu: how come your loyal season ticket holders no longer get the 10% adidas discount ???

DS: we work on tiny margins on the kit and it is almost not viable with this discount but we will do special discount days for sth.

@Adam16WHU: when do we expect Enner Valencia to sign?

DS: he has signed but is subject to a work permit on the 29th.

@sewellyboyx: Are we actually going to play a more expansive style of football next season or have the fans been lied to? 

DS: [reply left blank]

@Hammer197952: are we ever going to have a state of the art training facility?

DS: [reply left blank]

@Andrew_whufc: do you miss this man [picture of AVram Grant]?

DS: avram is the nicest man but unfortunately failed to delivery as a manager at west ham.

@Lewis_PM: do you expect us to sign any other players other than a full back?

DS: yes another striker.

@daviesconnor43: was Valencia scouted before the World Cup and are tho confident he will justify such a hefty fee?

@whusmudge: Will fans ever be able to buy the replica kits in sports shops like other teams fans?

DS: we hope that will be the case next season.

@DICEY1972: why are our top young players signing for arsenal and utd?

DS: sadly they are offered crazy wages by clubs far richer than us but we are working on reversing this trend.

@maggs10: why not try and sign a proven premier league goalscorer who isn't injury prone?

DS: bony is £19m we don't have that sort of money, I wanted him a year ago but no one else at the club did!

@LBritainGooner: are we going to have a pre-season game in far-east in next few years? like china? 

DS: unlikely but I would love to spread west ham to Asia, USA and everywhere In between.

@ironviews: Do you expect Diego Poyet to feature heavily next season? 

DS: it is the managers choice not mine but I think Diego is a fantastic player for the future.

@MarkHarrison23: Who is better Benni McCarthy, Modibo Maiga or Frederic Piquionne?

DS: I think maiga because when his head is right he is one hell of a player, eg Southampton at home and spurs in cup.

@FatSamOut: Jenkinson, Shelvey, Rhodes IN, Nolan + Carroll OUT.

DS: I cannot comment on players at other clubs as it is deemed ""tapping up"".

@hands_lee: how many More players u bring in?

DS: 2 more unless someone leaves.

@JonjoHeuerman: what did you want to be when you were my age ? 

DS: a footballer or a boxer but when I was 15 I realised this wasn't going to happen!

@spencerb222: Is there any chance that carroll will be sold? If so who would you like as his replacement. 

DS: no but will update regarding AC at the end.

@Dazzairons: what's the future of oscar Borg and Reece Oxford?

DS: oscar borg has turned down a contract but Reece oxford is only 15 and we hope he will be a whu player for many years to come.

@Adoodledude: who is your favourite player who doesn't play for west ham?

DS: ronaldo as he has the same birthday as me and I think he is the best player in the world.

@WHU_MR2013: Which country are we likely to visit for pre season next season? 

DS: USA.

@Gavlar_04: Will fans both from the UK and abroad (I live in Ireland) ever be able to buy shares in the club?

DS: possibly at some time In the future.

DS: deal is done subject to work permit but we are very very optimistic.

What Twente fans, myself and others who had seen him play in more than just a couple Europa League matches tried to warn those clamoring over our new signing was that we were in fact getting a very talented squad rotation player. Given his versatility he's a damn fine one as well as he can play in multiple positions, possesses a good bit of skill and couples it all with a physicality worthy of the Prem. He's good for a spot start here and there when the squad is in need of a rotation and he is a solid impact sub for when the attack just needs that extra bit. Is he a good player? Definitely. Is he a week in week out consistent starting XI caliber player? No. That's the one thing that has plagued him for most of his career is consistency issues. One week he's great, the next he's just meh. Unless he can figure that out, I don't see him being anything more than a very good squad rotation player for us.
