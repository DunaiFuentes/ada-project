No, I started abusing you after I saw that you were a blogspammer with badly-concealed alt accounts, and you had already abused others who (genuinely and apparently without realising you were actually the author of the crappy articles you were posting) had criticised the articles.

So, while I may have picked our particular argument, that had nothing to do with q_pop or the mods of /r/ukpersonalfinance, and was subsequent to your pattern of behaviour of abusing other posters, and also mods in other subreddits who considered you unwelcome.

Whereas 'fake' or 'counterfeit' cigarettes could be anything from nettles and envelope paper through to pallet wood and cardboard. I've seen worse.

Tax on cigarettes/tobacco brought in the U.K. used to pay for the NHS almost outright. Since the 'smoking ban' I very much doubt this is still the case. Bare in mind, the company selling them makes between 80p and £1.50 per 20, (the rest is/was tax, that £8 per packet is pure governmental profit).

Why buy cigarettes in England?  It's not worth it anymore when you can get a sleeve of 200 from Spain for 32 Euros (£25), and you're allowed to bring as many as you can prove you're able to smoke back through customs. (it's not necessarily 1600 anymore) Cheap flight to spain, £70, 1600 cigarettes while you're there - £204, meals and accommodation for a weekend another £90. That's £364 round trip including 1600 cigarettes. sell 800 (half) of them at the pub for £5 per 20, that's £200 back from the holiday cost and 800 ciggy's to smoke.

Again, you cannot tell in advance what exactly the scale of the novel new externalities will be, but every single prohitibition we do see again supply moving into the black market and negative externalities revolving around quality of supply and giving crime a stream of revenue (in a marketplace that is self-regulated by force).

You have no good empirical grounds to hold they might be minor, and ample case studies stand against that view.

What makes you think that mental health issues aren't already being tackled?

Besides that, the NHS spends millions on advertising campaigns to promote mental health awareness, and runs a wide range of services to support and help people. There's always more that could be done, but to think that those issues aren't being tackled is absolutely wrong.

&gt;Banks can create new money because bank deposits are

different to anyone else in the economy. When the bank
makes a loan, the borrower has also created an IOU of 
their own to the bank. The only difference is that for the

&gt; Conclusion
This article has introduced what money means and the
different types of money that exist in a modern economy.
Money today is a form of debt, but a special kind of debt that
is accepted as the medium of exchange in the economy. And
most of that money takes the form of bank deposits, which
are created by commercial banks themselves. A companion
piece to this article, ‘Money creation in the modern economy’,
describes the process of money creation by commercial banks
in more detail.

I didn't realize you were an agent. 

Personally speaking, if I had a client who; **a)** was in a complex contract/starting situation with his parent club, and **b)** could walk in as a starting goalkeeper to effectively any Champions League side right now (including the current title holders, given Casillas' recent run form), I would be making as much noise as possible and letting clubs know that if he isn't going to start at his parent club next season, he's open to offers.

Again, beyond speculation about Cech's future what exactly are they doing? They're saying Courtois wants to start? Have the demanded the club to sell? Are they calling him a cripple who needs to be put out to pasture?

Also agents are notorious for saying one thing and doing another, in any sport. They want the best for their clients and are largely uninterested in individuals impeding their results. That and I remember reading somewhere that TC's manager is his father, so take that into account. So agents are going to be hypocrites about a slate of bullshit.

Imagine, Capaldi doesn't know how to fly the damn thing, so they begin to crash... straight into 1986. As people are attempting the systems test, there's a power surge that no one anticipated, and suddenly a strange man and young woman are there, next to a big blue box. They now know the reactor vessel is about to rupture.. The strange man begins moving and telling everyone what to do and saves the building from exploding. It causes a massive radioactive leak, but it saves the immediate lives of people in the surrounding town. 

Clara is safe, the doctor ordered her to stay inside the TARDIS (which is not affected by this radioactivity) where she's attempting to get more information on the Doctor's transformation from the on board hologram. Sort of a split story here. 

Back to the Doctor, who is able to withstand the radiation, helping the emergency crew to clean up. He's in a constant power struggle with Akimov, who dismisses everything the Doctor points out. Eventually the doctor knows he can do no more to help, so he heads back into the TARDIS.

Clara's found out whether Doctor got more lives, or what ever had happened. She's afraid of him as he walks in, both because of her new found knowledge and because of his reaction when entering. He's angry he couldn't do more to help, he's angry that Akimov wouldn't listen to him, he's throwing things, breaking things, screaming at the console for taking him here. 

Suddenly the TARDIS starts up, with no input from Doctor or Clara. Woosh, off through space and time.. to 3 weeks later. The Doctor steps out, they're in a hospital room with Akimov. He's dying from radiation poisoning. Akimov apologies to the Doctor, telling him that he was too stubborn and he should have listened to what Doctor pointed out instead of what his boss said to do.

Mandzukic or Bony are somewhat realistic. Bony would be a nice change in the targeting of what we want a striker to do but I doubt it would happen.

Some of the QPR fans complaints I heard were about his defensive ability and lack of strength, not as big an issue if he's fielded as part of the '2' in a 4-2-3-1 with a hard working ball winner like Sandro alongside him.

Both Carroll and Bentaleb should be kept around through the first half of the season and see at least regular playing time in the Europa and League Cup matches to see how they do and get as much time under Pochettino as possible. Then look for a second half loan options for both , if needed, to Premier League clubs.

Bentaleb and Carroll both have a passing ability that seems to be lacking from most of Spurs other options in central midfield, in particular, Dembele but also possibly can be or are much better and more composed distributors than Holtby and Paulinho as well.

&gt;

&gt;The __Seven Warring States__ or __Seven Kingdoms__ ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 战国七雄; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 戰國七雄) refers to the seven leading [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(Ancient_China\)) during the [Warring States period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period) of [Zhou Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty) China. They are almost always listed in the following order:

&gt;


&gt;* [Qin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_(state\)) (秦)

&gt;* [Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state\)) (齊/齐)

&gt;* [Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state\)) (楚)

&gt;* [Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_(state\)) (燕)

&gt;* [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_(state\)) (韓/韩)

&gt;* [Zhao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_(state\)) (趙/赵)

&gt;* [Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_(state\)) (魏)

&gt;Over the Warring States Period, many of the seven states underwent bureaucratic and military reforms in order to mobilise resources on a greater scale; this led to an intensification of warfare over the period, but also led to economic and cultural developments on a large scale.

&gt;Of the Seven Warring States, Qin eventually grew to be the strongest, and successfully annexed the other six states; Han was the first to fall, in 230 BC, while Qi was the last to surrender in 221 BC. Yingzheng, the King of Qin, took the title [Shihuangdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shihuangdi), a new title composed by combining various honorifics previously used individually for various human or divine rulers (somewhat arrogantly according to the opinion of some).

&gt;The great thing about democracy is we can say no and veto all we want if we don't like it.

Yeah, we can. Unfortunately the idea of democratic institutions is to work to an agreed consensus. Not everybody is happy, but generally enough of a compromise is reached so that at least all parties are equally aggrieved. The idea of working together is a pretty key one.

Hardly spying when the info is already out there in the public domain.. I'd be absolutely certain that it's a similar story with the anti-fracking protests too.

This time was know as the Meiji period, in which Japanese society moved from feudalism to the society they have today.

Part of that change involved a modernisation of their legal system, and European legal systems, especially from France and Germany formed the basis of this reform. 

In addition, after WW2 the Japanese legal system underwent further westernisation under the guidance of Allied authorities. 

Before the Meiji period, the countries laws were very different from ours, for example, imperial families had a huge amount of power, and could sentence people to death at will. 
The modernisation process aimed to end practices like this and allow Japan to fit in with Western countries.

I did these numbers really quickly so they may be a bit wonky - what I'm trying to do is illustrate to OP roughly how to calculate the cost of different car options, as the OP talks about finance cost per month, which is a bad way to buy a car and tells little about the real cost involved.

A Hyundai i10 will cost you about £9,500K optioned and undiscounted - source: Hyundai website

You can get a perfectly lovely 2011 30K Fiesta for £6K used (IMHO, a much better car and barely run in at that mileage) - source:  pistonheads.com classifieds

You can buy a three year warranty for a Fiesta for £850 (I wouldn't, but let's compare like with like) - source http://www.warrantydirect.co.uk/

After three years and 30,000 miles, the Hyundai has lost about £3K of value, and the Fiesta will have lost somewhere between £1K and £2K, let's call it £1,500 - source: pistonheads.com classifieds or we-buy-any-car

Hyundai finance is 5.9% - difficult to calculate costs here without knowing exact arrangement so let's just assume that you happen to have £6,850 in the bank, you're only going to pay the interest on any finance until you sell the car and therefore the Hyundai is going to cost you an additional 5.9/100 x (price of hyundai - price of fiesta) each year to finance.  Obviously this is unrealistic so adjust to suit your situation.

So costs for a new Hyundai after three years before negotiation are:

£9,500 (purchase) - £6,000 (sale) + £470 (extra finance costs of the higher purchase price x 3 years) = £3,970

Costs of the Fiesta would be:

£6,000 (purchase) - £4,500 (sale) + £850 (warranty) = £2,350

You can then factor in insurance, negotiation, the need to do MOTs, you annual milage etc and decide what is right for you.  You may decide that you'd prefer to pay more money and get the i10, that's your call.

Maybe if we shoehorn people into positions of power based on the minority group they belong to maybe all the worlds problems will be solved.

Which brings me to my second point, MP's are elected not appointed. 'Parliament' has no say in its members. Is the entire voting public (50% of which are women..) conspiring to keep women out of parliament? Or are there just fewer electable female politicians?

This is nothing more than the modern-day ham fisted chucking of ""*-isms*"" in lieu of making an actual point.

It's this boring little game called 'comfortable status quo' that people try and play in arguments, where the rules are that only minority groups have agendas and that having an agenda somehow magically invalidates a viewpoint. Naturally you don't have your own bias that needs examining, you only need to find one in other people and make out as if that answers any questions.

Authority - I have no interest in authority and was not assigning any to Mumsnet users. I mentioned it to imply that you would only take seriously comments that came from men and imbue them with a mythical sense of authority that you're happy to dismiss Mumsnetters for lacking, even though as you say there is no source of authority for a subjective complaint like this one. 

In short, I think your original comment is meaningless because it can be applied to any group identically in any situation. I think 'it's fairly safe to assume' that it only got posted and upvoted because most of the 'core user group' here has an 'agenda' that leaves them blissfully unaware of that side of social life and 'I sincerely doubt' that they want anything more out of this conversation than a simplistic and self-assured one-liner to upvote that lets them dismiss the subject without too much more thought.

&gt; Men's football is loved in Britain simply because the players are men, and men like watching other men play football, and what men like to do and like to watch is, de facto, culturally important. Even the fact the men's World Cup is not explicitly stated to be a men's competition erases women – I predict there will be little fuss made of the Women's World Cup in Canada next year.

Men don't watch women's football because the quality is so, so poor. I've watched the last world cup and euros and the quality of the games was seriously below non-league. Why would you watch a terrible standard of sport when you can watch a much better standard? 

So what about hockey? Dominated by womens teams, women are better at it but is watching it sexist to men? of course not!

That entire article is extremely sexist towards men.

edit: just to add this to:

&gt; You could argue that the Fifa World Cup is also **ageist and disablist** (footballers are doomed to retire as soon as their wisdom teeth fully descend and disabled people are tacitly excluded – let's not forget that a former England coach was even sacked for his dodgy views)

My hand goes up - ""Why isn't it that colour in any of the paintings, then?""

Why ""undoubtedly""? Plenty of people doubt it.

It's also very easy to see, from looking at NAFTA, that many people do not benefit from such agreements, whether it's American  workers who lost their jobs because their company moved their factory to Mexico, or Mexican farmers who lost their livelihood when their market was flooded with US food.

You could argue that there is a net benefit, although that's almost impossible to evaluate given the degree of secrecy involved, and almost impossible to take as a matter of faith given the amount of  influence that corporate lobbyists have been allowed.

However to pretend that there will be absolutely no losers is either naiive or incredibly dishonest.

Holtby is better playing slightly more reserved. He hit a stride right before AVB was fired in which he was featuring in the ""controller"" role alongside the CDM, and was consequently swept out from over his feet by Sherwood drastically changing the midfield to a two-man central midfield of similar players for ""balance."" Sherwood went back to experimenting with a three-man midfield, but it was after Holtby had left. I think Holtby is exactly the player Sherwood was ruing having let go when he said we had no one to move the ball from deep.

For more evidence, check out Holtby's heat map for Fulham even while playing as a CAM: http://thepremierleagueowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-23-at-10.20.01.png

In contrast to this, check out an Eriksen heat map against Norwich in September playing as the CAM: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/14/article-2420164-1BD18BE3000005DC-550_634x561.jpg

Holtby can certainly provide cover as the CAM, but with his weakness of dribbling but strengths of creativity, throughballs, and holdup play, he's a fantastic option at DLP for us since we hardly have anyone else at the moment who can play vertically.

Dembele's one match on the wing against Newcastle is hardly indication he's better in more advanced roles. Check out his stat lines my friend, he does not have the numbers of an attacking mid. Far too little assists, key passes, and throughballs, and far too few dribbles in the attacking third (despite being our best player at it through the middle third).

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Just to reiterate what I said before, I don't think Britain is a Christian country in the sense that religion is important in the day to day lives of its citizens. Nor do I think that it's only definition is of being a Christian country, you could also define it as an island nation, or a democratic society, or any number of other definitions.

What I am saying is that it is not wrong to call this country a Christian nation, which seems to upset some people, any more than to define it as anything else. Our legal system, our system of government and the majority of our national institutions all have their basis in the Christian religion. It it was hugely influential in what we have become today. 

The way we think as individuals is hugely influenced by our Christian past, which includes our legal and political systems, as they have all be historically entwined. If you were brought up in a middle eastern country, you would probably have very different views on certain things, because our societies would have evolved differently. 

The Christian influence has been a part of Britain for thousands of years, which is why it is so strongly tied to our culture, and why it is fair to call it a Christian nation. With Japan, that influence has only been there for around 100 years, and it is all from a secondary source, the Church has never had any direct impact on Japan. You could certainly argue that Christianity was very important to Japanese development, because it's attitudes towards crime and the law all have their basis in Christianity. But it is less so than most western countries, as there are many parts of its society which have no links to Christianity, most of their history, traditions and institutions. This creates a cultural split, which is very unusual. 

With most nations around the world, their development has been heavily influenced by their religion, and you can quite easily group nations in that way. Nations which have been historically Christian are have similar laws and institutions (not identical, but similar themes weave themselves throughout those societies), same with Islamic nations and Buddhist. The Japanese systems of government and law before modernisation were similar to those found in China and East Asia at the time, so without that modernisation Japanese society would be a lot closer to those societies. There is clear evidence of western influence in Japan(as it was intentionally decided to make Japan more western), which is not so apparent in China and other similar countries, so obviously the modernisation process has affected things, and the Christian influence can be seen.

It's pretty much like the ""clean shirt"" scene in Peep Show. Kids are horrible but they aren't dumb, if a kid is a shit then he will keep being a shit as long as he feels he is safe from repercussions. I'm not saying you should smack kids for being cheeky everytime, but even the possible threat that the 25 year old they are yelling abuse at could walk over and smack them round the head would be enough to make them think twice.

If you try to get physical they ""know their rights"" and will calle the police or their parents.

If you try to outwite them or insult them back then 9/10 it will just fuel the fire.

Scene I was talking about from Peep Show

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJQTmKl4_Wg

So while actual physical punishment should be saved for severe incidents generally the threat might be enough to deter people.

I think it is also relevant in schools. Speak to people when they used to get hit, they would think twice before being cheeky to a teacher.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I agree, stats can easily be manipulated. But that simply isn't the case here. Look at Dembele's stats compared to other players tasked with moving the ball from deep at roughly his price range, such as Badelj, Banega, Dzemaili, and Valero. He is known for being strangely averse to taking on a back line. I'm not fabricating or twisting anything here bud, I'm simply pointing out that he is just not an effective player in the final third and there is nothing, from what I've seen on the pitch or in any statistic collection service, to suggest otherwise.

I apologize for not being clear, my meaning by ""holdup play"" was referring to defense, holding up the ball-carrier. Holtby certainly does not have the physicality to perform the role of ""holdup play"" in regards to receiving the ball, as such I assumed we would be specifically referring to the defensive implication of the phrase. The other traits are indeed strengths of a No 10 which is why so many players tend to play both positions. However, Holtby's weakness in dribbling limits his effectiveness from a pivot position. He's simply more predictable. Eriksen has superb dribbling ability in tight spaces and more physicality, and as such he is a signature CAM. 

There is no better manner of referring to the differences in positioning than two different heat maps. It's difficult to compare situations in which two players would be playing the exact same position in the same team. Nonetheless, I encourage you to google heatmaps for each of them (but be wary to exclude Eriksen's most recent heat maps playing as a winger under Sherwood). You'll find that the trend is the same, Holtby's is far more spread out. So the differences of scenarios in those two maps is insufficient basis to discredit that point.

---

The issue is that through social change and policy the percentage of the population who smokes has been consistently in decline year-on-year; the current policy is working. In a couple of generations smoking will be a niche and un-trendy past-time, like knitting. At which point there will be no /public/ health interest.

Statistics say that the majority of people are introduced to tobacco in their youth, which is why it's illegal to sell tobacco to minors - and yet a number of them still begin smoking. This policy does nothing to tackle that, it's just fluff, and risks replacing policy that is proven to work with one that is unproven.

The cost of bringing in the consultancy company is £14,400 a month with a 10% extra for expenses.  The Telegraph assumes the 10% is always spent but still this doesn't come to £200,000 so they just round it up to maximise the outrage.

It states that a Trust chairman usually only works one or two days a week.  No source is given for this claim.  Even if true I can't see any link that this new guy will also be only working one or two days a week.

The one or two days gets rounded down to one day a week, again to maximise outrage.  The stupid calculations that follow again assume that he will only ever work one day a week and will always claim maximum expenses.

Could you face making your own sandwiches and taking them to work? If you did that each day it would probably cost a pound or less, and you probably spend £2 or £3 at work. so that's an extra 20-40 quid. (Personally I don't do this because when I get up in the morning, I don't want to spend 5 minutes making sandwiches before I go to work, and making sandwiches the night before is too long as they go manky).

Avoiding takeaways means that you have to make sure you have food in the house that's reasonably convenient to cook. Maybe not junky snacks which can be expensive and don't fill you up that well, but stuff like chicken breast + veg that you can make a stir fry with in 10 mins or less. For example at coop, each week when I go there almost always some bits of meat that are near the sell by date and reduced in price by a quid or two - those can go straight into the freezer so sell by date doesn't matter. Then coop do an oriental veg bag which has a bunch of veg which you can just wack in a frying pan for a few minutes after you have browned the chicken... if you like stir frys anyway!

As to getting a credit rating - get a credit card and pay it off in full each month by direct debit. Don't use it to borrow money or tide you over, just buy e.g. your weekly shop on it and pay it off in full automatically. Before long you will have a respectable credit history.

One thing about failing to pay council tax is that some councils punish people by refusing to let them pay by direct debit, which makes things worse for those on more of a budget as you have to fork out several hundred quid in one chunk at the start of the year instead of in nuggets throughout the year.

Your biggest problem is that in two months you will need to find 1 month's rent for a deposit on your next place which will be a nuisance.

However Mikels biggest weakness is probably breaking down a counter attack. Sometimes his challenges are good but Oscar is more consistent and has our highest ball winning ratio behind ramires and his fouling nature. If Tiago is an improvement there, a lot of which might depend on his mobility as well as his reading of the game, then he would be a massive improvement on Mikel.

I'd argue aside from a high rate of burglaries - which is directly related to idiot students leaving expensive stuff just laying around with the doors unlocked - there's hardly any ""visible"" crime outside of deep into the council estates, where you'd expect it in any city.

The Lace Market is a brilliant little corner of town but there isn't a great deal of housing there, and what there is is highly sought after and thus prices are inflated. Not to mention the Lace Market is constantly busy 6 nights a week so you might have to consider the noise not dying down until late. You'd be better off looking at areas a little out of the city centre, there are a lot of areas that have converted old industrial buildings containing pretty nice flats and still within walking distance of the middle of town. Plus the main runs of areas like Sherwood are looking much better and are still pretty cheap - plenty of 2 bed terraced houses with a bit of garden falling well within the lower end of rent prices.",0,1403543824,null,0,false,0,cieywh0,t3_28rp97,t1_cieywh0,t1_cidzorv,null,1434367240,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Had the UK received Coptic immigrants rather than Somali ones, I somehow doubt you would be up in arms about FGM being intrinsically linked to Christianity.

true,Lord_Monboddo,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;OK, so since we've established this is actually a cultural phenomenon, do you find it impossible that this culture is related to the religion that these people have? A religion which insists that women should defer to men and remain sexually modest.

Well as I said it's happening in a specific geographic locality so I see no issue calling it geographic but if you prefer culture, fair enough. Of course it isn't impossible, I actually said in the beginning ""religion may compound the problem"" and also ""religion is a cultural phenomenon"". Culture and religion are not entirely distinct things, they interact with each other. In fact since I am an atheist and therefore do not believe in divine provenence then I believe religion to be a purely cultural creation.

What we were arguing (which related to the original point made by the OP) was what had the greater influence in this, religion or the culture of the people and to be honest I think I have shown that picking out any particular religion for criticism on this issue would be pointless. It is not limited to any particular one but seems to be a practice of a cultural group. They may use religion as the reason for doing this but if the clerics of that faith and the majority of its adherents do not agree then I don't see why we should pick a fight with them. The cultural practise should be denounced and any religious figures supporting it denounced too.

Also frankly I can sense this comes from having an ax to grind. This is being changed into an argument about Islam (your terminology revolves around Islam), which is a current issue. Whilst I feel that Islam deserves some criticism for its practices and views I find it tiresome that every argument that can be turned against Islam, is. Islam isn't the issue here, cultural practices are. It seems pointless to start a fight with Islam over this specific issue when so many Muslims are opposed to the practice (similarly with Christianity).",0,1403544801,null,0,1403571939,0,ciezfas,t3_28v7nu,t1_ciezfas,t1_cieyu40,null,1434367488,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They go to an experienced foster carer and are fast-tracked for adoption and because they are babies they will almost certainly be adopted quickly.

This process has a much, much higher success rate for the children than ones who are taken off parents for the first time.

Elf are notoriously hit and miss as far as cosmetics, but the studio line of brushes (black handles) are great for the price: I like the eyeshadow c brush (just bought 2 more) and the small angle brush and flat eyeliner brush are nice. The handles may need gluing back in after a while, but no biggie. 

I haven't used their mascara or foundation, so can't comment on them. The HD powder is pretty much the same as any (it's just pure silica). I have a cream blush which has a firm bouncy texture and is decently pigmented. Their powder blushes and blush bronzer duos seem highly recommended, although haven't tried them personally.

I have a few of the all over colour sticks. The twist up mechanism of the packaging can break, but the product is all right, perhaps not for oily skin. I use as highlighter or under foundation to add glowy dewyness. 

Their eyeshadows can be pretty crap. The loose pigment shadows I have are great, but their pressed shadows will need primer and a good base to help them out. Don't bother with the cream eyeliner, they often ship dried out, mine is too stiff to use. 

The pan concealer in yellow is a great cheap colour corrector, but the other shades don't run too pale if that is a concern. Their oil free concealer isn't very pigmented so not good for serious undereye circle or blemishes. 

I have some of their mineral (?) lipsticks and found them gritty and not very pigmented, they slid around a lot.

The truth is in the middle, religion is neither inherently good nor inherently bad, I believe its central tenet is wrong (that there is such a thing as the supernatural) and I can believe their central doctrines are wrong but that doesn't mean it is always a problem socially or that it is inherently bad.

Both have pros and cons with what you start with. For example, Series 1's crappy effects could put people off. But starting with s5 could make you miss out on a couple of details (admittedly, not THAT many that are urgent or can't be presumed from context during an episode). Both are very good entrances to the show. 

If you're a bit of an idiot and forgot to watch anything until just a day or two before series 8 begins so don't have time for Matt's era, watch Doctor Who: The Ultimate Guide (2013) (The 2 hour one!). It's basically a documentary covering as much as possible up to the 50th. Then watch the 50th and Time of the Doctor.


Alternatively, you could start either right at the beginning or with the 3rd Doctor, at Doctor Who (1963) 7x01 Spearhead from Space. I wouldn't recommend this. The Classics are better to be watched after you're a fan and know the series IMHO (especially with series 8's premiere closing in).

£21,000 BMW costs you £229 a month for 2 years, providing you pay up a £3000 deposit, and not go over the agreed mileage, say 10,000 a year.

The dealer then ""contributes"" a few hundred, effectively knocking some off to sweeten the deal. Call it £600.

You then drive off with a new car, but it isn't yours until 2 years down the line, where you can either pay £8000 to keep the car, or you can walk away and start a new ""deal"" for another new car. And any mileage over the agreed is charged at ridiculous rates, as is any damage, however minor.

That's over £14,000 you've paid on a car that you have to either hand back or stump up more to keep - most people just p/x it into another finance deal because it will cost too much to walk away. £14,000 can get you a MUCH better (second hand) car than a BMW 1-series. (BMW M5/M3, Range Rover, TVR, Porsche, RS4/6 Audi....)


This can work, however, if you are self-employed. If the vehicle is used for ""business use"" (anything to do with your work) you can put the cost as an expense, which in short terms ups your tax threshold, so you can effectively claim a lot of it back.

 It has nothing to do with the relative cost. most people wouldn't start smoking blunts instead of spliffs if the price came down, for the same reason that people wouldn't start drinking spirits instead of beer if alcohol became cheaper. 

People aren't putting tobacco in it because of the cost, it's because they find it more enjoyable to smoke it that way.

Thats where youre wrong and ill tell you why: 

Keeping in mind that the more you smoke on a regular basis the more you need to smoke for the same effect (or to put it another way, the more you can smoke comfortably) and staying with the alcohol analogies. Tesco value whisky is rank and you have to mix it with coke to make it palatable, as is most cheap weed. Expensive whiskey tastes nice enough that you can sip it on the rocks and in the same vein as that ive had some very tasty cannabis in my time, it just doesn't come around that often because its a premium product with less demand. So if weed because cheap enough that everyone could afford top drawer stuff people would probably get into the habit of smoking pure cannabis. Because we all know tobacco is bad for you, we aren't stupid.

The burden of proof is entirely on the landlord when making deductions, for example if they wish to bill you £100 for a stained carpet they must **prove** that the carpet was stained during your tenancy and the only way to do this is with a signed and dated inventory from the start of your tenancy, and then they must demonstrate that the £100 is a reasonable cost for the work. No inventory? No chance of deductions!

Although it's entirely up to you how you decide to pay your final months rent, it's best that you pay as normal to keep your relationship with the landlord reasonable (they will give you a bad reference if you try and use a portion of the deposit) and it will make them very unhappy with you. Remember that when you ask your next rental to perform a reference check they're very likely to speak to your current landlord!

If you do decide to use the deposit to pay the final months rent make sure you communicate this to the landlord **before your rent due date** (preferably immediately). If you have any concerns about the deposit protection scheme your landlord has used dig out your copy of the prescribed information and give the deposit protection scheme a call and ask them, they're all very helpful and will happily answer your questions about the process (or you can read on their website).",0,1403550494,null,0,false,0,cif2fo7,t3_28vqnt,t1_cif2fo7,t1_cif28qb,null,1434368975,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

But ultimately, you want Sterling to make runs from the outside to make their defenders drop back so Sturridge can make runs on the opposite/middle without being offside, which allows deep balls or crosses.

true,sheeplessinseattle,null,null,"This review is my opinion only.

**REVIEW**: So I bought the June issue of Glamour Magazine specifically for the Eyeko Eyeliner. It was £2 for a full size product that retails for £12 (only a pound less than Stila Stay All Day Liquid Eyeliners with a felt tip pen style). Sad to say, the product is completely useless for me and it was a waste of money even at £2 as I don't see myself using it at all. 

To start, my eyes are oily, hooded and the skin is loose, especially at the end. 


**The product:**
It's a felt tip pen with a very fine tip containing 2g of product. The size is like a slender pen and did not hinder application. What did hinder application is the tip. There is barely any liquid coming out from the tip, so you don't benefit from the fine tip at all. The only way I could get the product to apply on my lids is by placing the pen parallel to my lids- the pen was pretty much horizontal! It made applying on the corners a nightmare, and I couldn't get a nice thin line unless I was very very lucky. 

The colour is a beautiful deep inky blue, and once it goes on your skin it stays on. Unfortunately it smudges, and migrates to other areas even after drying. I managed to get 2 hours with no budging with the Rimmel primer, but then it started flaking and the flakes would smudge when I touched it. The colour also wears off around the corners of my eyes, where it would be especially oily/crease more. 


**Application:**
The experience was a nightmare for me, the product does not cooperate with my eyes at all. Sometimes I couldn't get any colour to apply, but when I make a mistake suddenly the fucking ink wouldn't budge at all, even when I tried removing it with cotton tips that's wet with makeup remover! I had to press the pen with some force for the product to apply on skin, and where there is loose skin it applies unevenly (if it did) so there was no hope in winging out my liner at all. 


**Conclusion:** No bueno. Too finicky to apply and does not last on my eyes. Will not repurchase. I suspect this particular eyeliner falls flat with the type of eye I have - so if your eyes are not hooded, the skin type is dry and you don't have loose skin, especially arounds the corners you might have a better time with this eyeliner.

**Notes** If the liner works for you, when the tip gets worn out you can pull out the felt tip with a pair of tweezers out of the pen. The other end is a fresh tip that you can use like new when you invert and reinsert the felt tip.  http://imgur.com/a/EbaNj",0,1403551458,null,0,1403552764,0,cif2xxf,t3_28warp,t1_cif2xxf,t3_28warp,null,1434369214,4,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,4

It has the potential to be like wine though and be bred for flavour. And ultimately i think thats what would happen and people would maybe start passing pipes or glass blunts round since straight spliffs are pretty hot and unreliable burning. If you assume a hypothetical future where tobacco has a larger negative health stigma than weed it makes it make more sense as well.

I don't find longevity to be a problem, I use urban decay primer potion with eyeshadow as a base, I use urban decay's 'virgin'. I had a good old cry today and my eyeliner is still intact!! Not to mention that the weather was hot as balls and the rest of my make-up was sweated off.

Also there's never really a set guaranteed number of away tickets, most of the time they announce the sale of away games tickets after they get aware of how many away tickets the club has been given. Sometimes this happens a few weeks before the match, sometimes it can be way before.

What with Tottenham being in London, the tickets usually sell out on the presale, I'd say it's very unlikely to find any left over tickets go to a general sale.

Long story short, it won't be easy or necessarily cheap but not entirely impossible. You're gonna have to ask around and do some legwork, maybe see if a nearby supporter club has the official recognition from the club so they can be eligible for getting group tickets.

I think our pressing is the most effective in the 4-4-2 Diamond because the formation allows us the flexibility and tactical asymmetry necessary to fully press without critically exposing yourself at the back. The way we play our 2 at the top really functions as one side of the front 3 in the 4-3-3, with one striker moving over to press the opposition's possession side while the other slides central. When we win the ball back in this formation as opposed to a strict 4-3-3 our counterattacks have a 10 to play through. Our players - between Sturridge/Suarez's versatility, Gerrard's prowess as a deep lying playmaker, and our choice in center midfielders - lend themselves to being optimized in the 4-4-2 diamond.

The maths tripos used to only ask for single maths. They increased it as undergrads who didn't have at least some further maths were struggling. They didn't make double maths essential as not all schools can provide tuition in further maths. They reckon that if you are Cambridge standard, you'd be able at the very least to teach yourself three modules of further maths from textbooks alone. There is some support for those who haven't done the full further maths (for example lectures in physics for mathematicians).

If you are really worried, find the books and teach yourself. Ask a teacher to help if you get stuck. Or find an online forum (Ask NRICH is a good place to start - there's probably others).

Now I can't say this with absolute certainty, but I'd be very surprised if you were the only one with single maths or 1.5 maths. Especially as it's not essential.

true,thetasigma4,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The doctor transitions over his first few serials where he slowly becomes more friendly and so on but the Doctor in the old series is nowhere near as in love with earth as the new ones with only one speech about how great humanity is coming to mind (which makes it all the more special and notable, I am thinking of the one in the Ark in Space for reference)

 I would definitely say it is worthwhile to watch all the classic series as there are many great stories e.g. Genesis of the Daleks, Mind Robber, the Silurians, Inferno etc.


Here is a list of my recommendations if you want to skip about but that is up to you.

 1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good


2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World


3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

I will add almost everything by Robert Holmes is fantastic.

It's horrific to think that there are people out there in relationships like this, getting hurt daily by the person who is supposed to love them.

Let's be honest, when Blair was signing away our rebate to let unknown numbers of Poles in, do you think these politicians called Blair reckless or incompetent? Of course not, because his actions massively benefited Poland. Something also tells me that if we had decided to join the Euro they wouldn't be calling that decision incompetent or reckless either.

You need to find £500 (+ agency fees?) in the next two paycheques: £250 per month. 

This leaves you with £1010 per month.

Your listed expenses equal £901, giving you an excess of £109pm, plus your £100 in cash. You owe £300 in council tax, so in 2 months time after moving and pawing your tax you will have an excess of £18.... The good news is that you *should* be able to afford it...ASSUMING that you have listed ALL your expenses, they are accurate, and you can stick to your plan.

That gets you past your flat move.

For the future, you could get one of these credit cards to build your credit score http://www.aquacard.co.uk/. Set up all your bills to come out of it every month, pay it off in full every month, and leave it alone - don't use it for everyday use!!! 

You probably shouldn't plan to use a credit card as a buffer in future, just use it to improve your credit score. I would tend to think that you need to prioritise rebuilding your cash buffer.

You said you want to go to Taunton in Aug. I think you will struggle to afford this as you'll only will only make an excess of £18 total before August, unless you make savings elsewhere. 

If you also want to save up for a trip to Seattle it will take you realistically 12-18 months of saving (starting after August), with no other trips or other expenses and no other savings.

I think you should possibly look at some of your other expenditure; 

- do you need to be spending £95pm on internet access and games? can you find any other activities that are less expensive that you enjoy as much? 

- What are you spending £70pm on? can you make it £60? every little helps....

- Food. I have the same problem with getting back and can't be bothered to cook. Here's some ideas: baked potatoes with filling (cheese, tuna &amp; mayo, chilli, etc), tortellini and parmesan, crepes (easier than you'd think...), mash potato and sausage, salads with stuff in (avocado &amp; mozzarella is great).  Do this and you should be able to live on a lot less than £120pm. 

- Motivation: if you want a low cost way to spend your free time that will make you feel more positive and motivated, go out and get some exercise - regularly. Even if you just go for a walk on your own, it still helps, and you'll enjoy it.

[**The Devil To Pay**](http://www.felixdennis.com/poetry/the-devil-to-pay/)

The Almighty made the universe and

then He went away,

Casting down the Devil, saying:

“Here, sir, you shall stay!”

But the Devil growing bored and having

talent, in his way,

Mated demons with orang-outangs, 

— and here we are today.

Of course, surely money has a lot to do with it, as well. Liverpool was great in an era when spending wasn't out of control yet, and developing players was the way most sides did it.

In my view, the idea that faith schools churn out religious conformists is the opposite of the truth. In fact, precisely because they have an overarching ideological worldview, faith schools are more likely to foster critical thinking, feelings of intellectual agitation, a questioning of big moral systems and end-of-the-world religiosity.

I know Manchester reasonably well and it's a nice place (if you stay in the right parts) with lots to do. Personally I'd suggest there out of the 3 places you've given. 

I'm assuming your budget is monthly in which case it seems reasonable depending on where you intend to stay. There's certainly suburbs of Manchester that you could get a flat share for that budget if not less (I was looking at flats in commuter suburbs for a potential job and could get a 2 bedroom to myself for £300/month, 20 minute train journey into Central Manchester). If you're aiming to live in the Center that it's probably not realistic as with all cities it's expensive centrally. 

Cycling should be pretty easy I think. I'm not particularly familiar with cycling routes though so I may be wrong. I'm from London myself but I've seen people take bikes on trains, but never on busses or the tube.

The jobs market is variable but I'm sure if you can put together a half decent CV and hold up an interview you'll find somewhere minimum-wage...cafés or supermarkets or a shop somewhere. You'll just have to put in the effort.

How much would I take? At least budget for a couple of months before finding a job, and then maybe another one or two for emergency funds and you may need to pay a deposit for rent (I've never been in your situation so I don't know how house-share renting works) and such. So probably at least £1,000 (to cover a few months rent if nothing else). 

I wouldn't rule out places down south though, not sure how you narrowed it down to your 3 but obviously London is an amazing place to live and although it's expensive you might find some places on the outskirts or within commutable distance that could fit in your budget.",0,1403560694,null,0,false,0,cif7toj,t3_28wp3z,t1_cif7toj,t3_28wp3z,null,1434371514,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10

I know a way of sorting social housing out. Ban these types of evictions from taking place. If this landlord's business can't cope with it, and he has to go bankrupt, then so much the better. The state jumps in, nationalises everything he's got, barring the property he lives in of course, (compensation optional, according to whether it's politically feasible to stiff the landlord) and we suddenly have a new tranche of social housing, which brings in rent to fund more housing, and , after the current tenancies end, helps alleviate future social housing problems. Sort out the social housing BY punishing the fucking business.

true,avapoet,null,null,"There are two major taxes in the UK that you ought to be aware of:

* **[Income tax](https://www.gov.uk/browse/tax/income-tax)** (goes to national government) - most people pay this directly out of their paycheque under a PAYE (Pay As You Earn) scheme, so you don't need to think about it, and you don't need to fill out a tax return. If you do any self-employed work then you may need to fill out a tax return and make payments upon your additional earnings at the end of the year. If you make any money in interest payments on your savings, your bank will pay the tax at the same time as they give you the interest (unless you tell them not to, in which case you'll be expected to declare it yourself at the end of the tax year).
* **[Council tax](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/working-out-your-council-tax)** (goes to regional government) - this is assessed on the value of the property you live at, and is typically paid monthly, quarterly, or annually (your choice) either in person at your local council offices or (more-conveniently) online or by direct debit or standing order. Discounts are available for houses which are only occupied by a single person, or for houses that are occupied by all but one or entirely by students. In other words: if the place you're living is only occupied by students, you won't have to pay (although you might need to tell the local council that if they send you a statement, and they may ask to see a letter from your educational establishment). Your landlord might take council tax directly through your rent (common if you live in the same building as your landlord), or you may be expected to settle it yourself (common if you don't).

There are a handful of other taxes that you don't need to think about, such as VAT (a cleverly-implemented but sometimes complex tax, similar to a sales tax, levied on many goods at the point-of-sale: this is virtually always included in the prices you pay for goods and services so you don't generally need to think about it), inheritance tax (paid on the value of an inheritance: unless you're planning on having somebody die on you), national insurance (like income tax, taken out of your paycheque), duties on fuel, tobacco, alcohol etc. (paid at point of sale), and so on. Don't even think about them: most of us don't except when the price of beer goes up.

**tl;dr:** Income tax comes out of your paycheque; don't worry about it. Council tax might not be payable, as you're a student, but [check with your local council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=57&amp;LGIL=8&amp;ServiceN) if in doubt.",0,1403561451,null,0,false,0,cif8793,t3_28wauo,t1_cif8793,t3_28wauo,null,1434371692,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

The closer to London, the more expensive it gets for all things accommodation, but the more numerous the contracts and usually with greater day rates. All McDs are probably the same cost regardless of location, around £4 i suppose.

And let me say I wholeheartedly approve.  International Football is boring without a bet. I really couldn't care who won.  With a bet - even a small bet - the tournament becomes interesting again, I have a stake in the outcome.

Whenever people talk about gambling they always talk about the negatives - some people are problem gamblers ( incidentally the betting industry will allow you to [ban yourself](http://help.ladbrokes.com/display/4/kb/article.aspx?aid=1595) from their premises and online and hence betting - more than the food, alcohol, tobacco, retail or body image (anorexia and insecurities in women) industries do combined). But what about the legions of people that make sport more interesting, what about fun of trying to predict the outcome, the maturity that comes from accepting your choices be they win or lose, The realisation that at odds of 1-10 on your prediction about chelsea beating stoke does NOT make you some kind of expert, the maturity of knowing that in every risk there is a degree of luck.   

Then what about the harm gambling does for it's worst addicts - It's financial harm and that has consequences, serious consequences for some, but gambling does not kill it's addicts, gambling is rarely the reason for uncontrolled violence on our streets and in our homes. 

The truth is gambling - unlike alcohol, tobacco, junk food, is a minority activity.  A lot of people have a grand national flutter but they don't really understand gambling or the fun it can bring. Often  people who do gamble find gambling is a solitary pleasure, Gamblers are quickly judged for their hobby and so rarely speak up to it's merits.  This leaves people who hear of the harm it causes the few and they start looking to restrict it or ban it.  

Where I live the real problem is not gambling, It's the drink and drugs. In fact I would wager that there is not an area of Britain that wouldn't swap the drink and drug problems for a few more betting shops.  Yes betting shops cluster in poor areas but so do bars and drug dealers - and the bars and drug dealers sow more harm than bookies ever did.

1. Marquez (CB) - Lead the defense brilliantly throughout the match and scored the breakthrough first goal. Not a bad performance for a 35 year old I'd say.

Had a [wonderful shot](http://gfycat.com/ObviousJealousAmericansaddlebred) that was so close to nestling into the top corner. Also picked up an assist and helped to keep Mexico's midfield and defense tight against the Croatian attack.
3. Miguel Herrera (Mexico Manager) - Set up his tactics perfectly to stop the Croatia attack. Until the goal they were restricted to hopeful crosses and long shots. Will be interesting to see how he deals with Holland.

**Worst**

1. Pletikosa (GK) - Only had 4 shots on target and let in 3. Can't remember his save but definitely a game to forget for him.

They'll be waiting for a bloody long time, unfortunately even the mere technical possibility of having nukes requires at least two nations to have them.

&gt;Does Britain have greater status in their eyes?

I'm going to go with yes.

&gt; Over 140 states are bringing pressure to bear on the nuclear weapons states, on the basis of recent research which shows that the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons use would be even greater than previously imagined notably through its climate impact, with a relatively ‘small’ exchange leading to over a billion deaths from starvation in parts of the world unrelated to any conflict.

Global power balance can only be maintained by several countries having nukes, this results in the contradiction that having nukes is the only real way of avoiding nuclear war. 

&gt;Under international law, weapons cannot be indiscriminate in their impact, killing civilians as well as “legitimate” targets like military personnel. Nuclear weapons are, by their very nature, indiscriminate. So how can their possession –with their potential for use – be justified legally, never mind morally?

Who cares about legality when you have power? If you were the only country to have nukes, you would have ultimate power over the globe and so once again, the only realistic way of reducing the likelihood of nukes being used is to have multiple nuclear states.

But I'm talking calmly. So you're just shouting your head of and then claiming parody as a defence. Your shouting is effectively a straw man attack. And it's still shrill.

&gt; Whats Kennedy got to do with this, apart from it being Eco related?

Because your attitude to the case will allow me to understand where you're coming from. Your lack of response to my question is revealing in itself. It suggests to me that you don't want to risk answering difficult questions because you lack the confidence to do so.

&gt; Finally, surveillance and ntelligence is part of police work, your opinion otherwise makes no difference to that fact. 

Ofc my opinion can make a difference. If nothing else, it can be expressed at the ballot box, and I also have the option of attempting to convince other voters.

Police surveillance should only be used if there is a substantial threat of a serious crime being committed, not for political reasons as in this case. Watching a gang suspected of planning to import hard drugs is not remotely the same as infiltrating a group of protestors who are discussing blocking a road. At best, the latter is a waste of police resources, which could be better spent on solving more serious crimes. And at worst, the threat of police infiltration will discourage open protest, and cause tensions to build up unexpressed before eventually spilling out much more violently. 

In other words, Police inflitration of people protesting legally and openly is likely to cause the very problems that they claim they want to prevent. People need to vent. They should be able to do so legally and without fear of being observed by inflitrators from the secret police.

Now it's mostly the Americas that provide birthright citizenship.

What's more, being American can give you dual-citizenship of another country, but technically it can't be done the other way around.

I am British. My wife is American. She became naturalised in the UK and so has American/British citizenship. Our children were born on US soil, so also have both. But if I apply for American citizenship, I am supposed to give up my British and can't be both.

true,thegreenmonstuh,CO,colombia,"You're missing the point, which is that it's his MANAGER which is someone who has authority over Lukaku, and therefore should be treated with respect. And yes, it is quite clearly an attitude problem. He constantly complains in the media that he doesn't want to play at any team where he is not the number #1 striker. For a 21 year old kid who has only proved himself in the PL league for a mere 2 seasons he has the attitude of a world-class European champion striker. He has a huge ego and is quick to disagree with any sort of decision that leaves him outside of the playing field. Sometimes managers make decisions that players don't like, but players expected to deal with it like professionals. He got mad because he was subbed out for who happened to be the player who scored the game-winning goal. That just makes Lukaku like even more of a jerk.

Just because he's a Chelsea player doesn't mean he can do no harm. I really hate how so many fans have this mentality. A lot of our players might be talented, but let's not forget a lot are also very young and immature. Not saying we should do away with Lukaku at all, I personally think he's a hell of a player,  just saying he needs a serious attitude adjustment.

Secondly - when the NYT quotes the Ofsted report:

&gt;The school was “inadequate,” they wrote in a report published this month. The children there were not prepared for life in multicultural Britain and were not protected from “extremism,” the report stated.

That's *not* a hoax.  [That's a real report.](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/138059)

However, the Trojan Horse letter possibly is a hoax.  Even so, [Wikipedia tells me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Trojan_Horse)-

&gt;Around a month later, Birmingham City Council said that it had received ""hundreds"" of allegations of school takeover plots, similar to those illustrated in the letter, some dating back over 20 years.[4] Tahir Alam, the chairman of the Park View Educational Trust which runs six schools in Birmingham, was found to have written a 72-page document for the Muslim Council of Britain in 2007 detailing a blueprint for the “Islamisation” of secular state schools.[5][6]

Also:

&gt;Investigations by Ofsted and the Education Funding Authority in 21 schools found evidence of ""organised campaign to target certain schools"" by Islamists.

As far as Park View goes, Wikipedia tells me:

&gt;Posters were found in the classrooms encouraging children to begin lessons with a Muslim prayer, one saying: “If you do not pray, you are worse than a kafir”, and staff reported that loudspeakers were set up in the school to broadcast a call to prayer. The few pupils that elected to study a Christianity unit as part of the Religious Studies GCSE course had to ""teach themselves"", because the teacher focussed on Islamic studies which the majority were studying.[33][34]

&gt;Year 11 pupils about to sit their GCSEs at the school were instructed to partake in an Islamic fast, taking neither food nor drink, to place them in the right “spiritual frame of mind” for the exams. Additionally, students were expected to fast during the month of Ramadan. Some staff at the school expressed fear that neither eating nor drinking amid high temperatures during the 18 hours of daylight in the months of June and July would compromise pupils’ health and their ability to learning.[35]

&gt;Subjects such as Personal, Social and Health Education, Biology and Sex and Relationships Education were bowdlerised to conform with a conservative Islamic teaching. Pupils studying biology were not taught the section of the syllabus about Reproduction and the teacher stated when briefly outlining Evolution that ""this is not what we believe"".[37] A former staff member said that one teacher had handed out a worksheet stating that women “must obey their husbands,” and told his class that wives were forbidden from refusing their husbands sex.[34]

Was there an element of hysteria and witch-hunting to the investigation?  Quite possibly.  Was there double standards because of Islam?  Maybe.  Still, I think that there's genuine cause for concern.

Hazard rarely runs long in a straight line. He also weaves lots. 
You either need a very lean upper body to keep inertia down as much as possible or a very strong core to minimize wasted movement and energy. Ideally both. 
A good comparison is compare hazard to Shaqiri. Both are similar height, both can turn the pace on in an instant but hazard has the ability to change direction faster. Because although Shaqiri is stronger he has to move more mass.
Players like c.Ron can move very angular movements because they have very developed cores and keep their centre of gravity so central. But even he rarely weaves through defenses as often as he used to. 

I think the main aim now for hazard would be to improve his back and core without impacting his overall size. Let him ride tackles and minimize injury potential.

I've followed his career ever since he said his favourite club was Chelsea. If you did indeed follow him at Anderlect then you'd know that he wasn't consistent for them either and had a tendency to drift out of the game for most of the game until he got the perfect pass and scored a goal. A lot of his goals were tap-ins too.

Secondly, I've watched that documentary as well and he was 16/17 years old then. That was 4 years ago. You are presuming that he has not changed at all since he was 16/17. John Terry was a Man UTD supporter before moving to Chelsea at 15 when he was still very young. Do you think he still LOVES Man UTD? When I said I am yet to see his love for the club, I meant since he moved here.. because ever since his transfer, all he's done is talk shit about the club AND the manager and his ego has shot through the roof. Now I'm sorry if you have some sort of an affectionate adoration for this kid, but I'm not going to judge him based on what he said or did 4 years ago. I'm going to judge him based on what he's doing now.

Him finally coming into the team just as Nando went out to CHE killed me and I spent the whole week just mad.  I think Capitano was out also with a pulled hamstring or something and then spending that money on Carroll I wasn't in the most positive frame of mind leading up to his debut.From the first second I saw him warming up on I just inexplicably started getting butterflies in my stomach and couldn't help but smile.  I remember it had been a pretty nervy match against Stoke with us leading just 1-0.  I told my friend there with me that he'll score within his first 15 minutes on the pitch with a breakaway, rounding the keeper and finishing coolly in front of the Kop.14 minutes later he gets the ball on the break, rounds Begovich, and scuffs it toward the goal as the CB tries clearing it but the ball ended up in the back of the net.  I knew from that moment we had someone special on our hands.The rest of the year he was honestly rather sloppy at times, or even wasteful but if he was on the pitch you were always just on the edge of your seat as he was capable of something magical out nowhere.Love the guy, glad he had his moment the other day even though it was against half our starting 11, and I hope he puts fuckin 4 past Italy tomorrow.Fuerza Luisito!

And it's a fact that it's not a nation-state but then a nation-state as you say isn't the only prerequisite for nationality. As for identity vs nationality, people identify themselves as Northern Irish, because no matter where one considers themselves on the British-Irish spectrum, the border has grouped us in a territory, and has created a three generation shared history of people born within a state who share their first language and aspects of the culture. Perhaps the dividing rather than uniting Northern Irish history is where our claim for Northern Irish nationality can be seen to fail. On the other hand, now that we are a few generations into our shared history, and the latest generation has been born since the peace process, those that presently claim Northern Irish as their nationality *do* share culture and *are* united by our history and they represent the green shoots of a nationality that will grow and become less contested.

In last year's LucidTalk polls, the majority (catholic and protestant) wanted the border to remain.

The Riverside Inn has the nicest beer garden but it's overpriced. If you're more into bars check out Baroosh.
