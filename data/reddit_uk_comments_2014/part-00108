I'd pass through St Andrews on your way down if you can, it's a nice old University town (also famous for golf) with beaches and plenty of places to eat. There's not a huge reason to visit Dundee, but it has two quite popular Universities (Dundee University and Aberay ""University"") and there's the Discovery museum ship.

Then you could either go through Edinburgh or Glasgow on your way south, I don't think you'd have time to visit both really, Glasgow will take you onto the motorway for heading south, if you go to Edinburgh you have to head back towards Glasgow to get the motorway, but as I said, I don't think you would have time to actually spend in both without skipping a lot of England. You could do Stirling on your way to Glasgow though, if you skipped Edinburgh, which has a nice castle (cheaper than Edinburgh's iirc, but still a good visit).

As others have suggested you could instead go via Edinburgh and take the country roads, which are more scenic. This might actually be better if you're wanting to see more of the countryside than just hopping on the motorway south from Glasgow. You could still include Stirling and take the Stirling-&gt;Edinburgh motorway, missing out Glasgow. If you do stop in Edinburgh the National Museum of Scotland is free, and might be worth a look around, but you could waste all day there.

We annoy people because we take more pride in our sports teams than any other city in America. The Boston Celtics while being in 26th out of 30 ranked teams, we are #12 in attendance. It doesn't matter how good or bad a team is doing we support them because they are from Boston. Thus when one of the most powerful organizations within New England becomes involved in a sports team we support them fully. 

And to those who think we are annoying, we love being called as that. Boston is the best sports city in America, and will pour that support into Liverpool. ",0,1397669609,null,0,false,0,cgu23h9,t3_2358r5,t1_cgu23h9,t1_cgtuz0h,null,1433383064,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;I think you misunderstand the theory of capitalism. People invest money into companies with the aim of receiving dividends. If there are no dividends then there is no investment which means no company. The only reason any companies stop paying dividends is because they believe they have an investment opportunity that will generate even larger dividends further down the road.

People invest money into companies in the hope of a greater return in the future (ideally above market rate, otherwise we'd all just buy market portfolios and go home). Dividends specifically are the company's way of going ""Hey, I can't put this money to good use, have it back"".

&gt;No, our government is only giving the rail companies too much money if it could spend the same money in other ways to get an even better rail service, or if it could spend even less money in other ways and receive the same quality rail service. Those are quite possibly true. However you do nothing whatsoever to demonstrate that either is the case.

Referring to my point above, Transpennine paying out £21m dividend to it's owners signals to the market that they have no better use for the cash, which is surprising and slightly conflicting since the government gave them £52m from the franchise agreement and £145m in the track grants. The government (Network Rail too) have a pot of money that goes towards funding various activities that the TOCs can ask for, so I don't necessarily have a problem with that aspect of it.

&gt;The government is essentially buying a service (provision of rail transport for the public). So the main question should be - is it getting good value for the money it spends? Or could it save money by making a different buying decision (e.g. nationalisation). What happens to that money after it is spent is far less important.

I would agree with your last statement if the taxpayer weren't propping them up, but we are. I have no problem with procuring services from private companies where it's clearly cost effective, getting services from the market where there is clear and functional competition is good for everyone. Can you imagine if the government tried to manufacture it's own stationary or build it's own computers in house? I dread to imagine.

I don't think renationalising everything would solve it either. There's probably a middle ground like Network Rail which exists in a legal limbo but is geared towards high service quality. If there are any parts of the system which can be continue to run under the privatised system then they ought to be kept as such to reduce taxpayer liabilities.",0,1397671549,null,0,false,0,cgu33tq,t3_2362mq,t1_cgu33tq,t1_cgtxuuc,null,1433383539,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Oddly enough, this is not always good advice to save money; ditching fully comp can cost you *more*.

From the link I posted elsewhere in this thread:
&gt; Before we begin, it's important to understand there are three different types of car insurance: third party, third party fire and theft, and fully comprehensive (full definitions below).

&gt; Logically, third party insurance should be cheapest for young drivers as it offers a lesser level of cover than fully comp, yet this isn't always the case. So get quotes for third party and fully comp, just in case it's cheaper. Plus always make sure you check your policy so you know exactly what you are and aren't covered for in the event of a claim.

&gt; The rationale might be that insurers see third-party buyers as a higher-risk group, as because their car is uninsured (except for damage caused to other cars), they may be more careless with it, so prices are pushed up. **In one low-risk young driver quote, we found a £1,500 saving for having comprehensive cover over a third-party only policy.

true,MessiSuarezRonaldo,null,null,"I honestly think the Prem would be a bigger deal.

In the champions league once you are through to the last 16, you can really focus on one game at a time, this means more times than not the other games dont matter and this means on a good day any team can beat any other team and progress, to be honest this is sort of what we did because there were a few very close calls but even though we were underdogs we were always the (in my opinion) the best English team and the ones to beat.

In the Prem more often than not, the best team really does win. Its a game of odds because how good the other teams are doing is just as important as how we do, take this season for example at the start of it Arsenal were running away at the top of the league, they looked unstoppable and many people thought arsenal were favourites but then they dropped off and late on in the season they are battling for 4th.

Chelsea and City are on the verge of starting the biggest dick measuring spending contest since the cold war, their hoarding of talent may potentially create a talent gulf, on paper we didn't stand a chance but our young players are really starting to come of age and BR through both tactics and player development is getting thee absolute fucking most out of them, as a MEGA plus the team is young enough to keep improving and developing for a long time",0,1397671853,null,0,1397672119,0,cgu39fi,t3_236wsg,t1_cgu39fi,t3_236wsg,null,1433383610,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

No, this is not obvious. It is an expense. MEPs don't even have to give receipts. The system is obviously a very poor one and the question of MEPs expenses generally is scandalous. That is why Farage is correctly trying to end this scandal by pulling the UK out of the EU.

I think it's time to bring Lukaku back and use him as our second striker. We compete in so many competitions he will definitely get games and he'll get experience playing against the kinds of opposition he'll need to beat to be our main striker at some point. 

We need a striker and if it is Costa, that might give us some way to work in a deal to leave Courtois out on loan if we don't want to move Cech on just yet.

true,JoelDalais,,IBWT,"As you say, chargebacks are a big risk, though with a card you need a bank account, the chargeback risk with people using cards to get bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) is a higher risk than normal.

1st step getting a UK bank (properly/fully aware) on board is one thing, adding the risk of credit card/chargebacks to that account is a whole other matter.

Also there's the case of Mastercard ... let us just say that Mr Mastercard is not very friendly to Mr Bitcoin. So much so that Mr Mastercard would probably not help Mr Bitcoin if Mr Bitcoin was on fire and Mr Mastercard had just had a lot to drink, Mr Mastercard is a bit like that, if you get my drift.

Anyway ..

If anyone can figure out a system whereby an exchange can safely (very low rate of chargebacks) accept credit/debit cards (directly) then you will have one very happy exchange and customers (IBWT would adopt direct card funding if there was a viable safe way).

Or ... - https://www.okpay.com/en/company/news/okpay-accepts-credit-debit-cards.html

Which effectively = you can fund ibwt with a credit/debit card ;)

Admittedly, its not as great as a UK bank faster payment system, but ye .. the banks will capitulate eventually.

Edit: Judging with how things are developing, its quite likely that a credit/debit card will be designed with protocol (push) technology which will enable a system of credit/debit cards that are far more trustworthy.

Keeping in mind that our deposit via royal mail is cheaper and doesn't require so much verification and every post office and post box is basically a deposit location.

I sort of understand your position on this but I feel that you have not generalised this statement enough to be even handed on the issue, as it reads with a nationalist slant rather than a more proportional statement.  Why not try this.

The freedom fighters were protecting the nation from the agents of a foreign state where a corrupt political regime led by a fascist dictator hand in hand with the church and a compliant, corrupt police force was attempting to foist its religion, language and history on the people.

As to “Yes innocents were killed but it was war” ... Fuck Off!!!

My point is not to compare the two as frankly they are just different sorts of players at different periods in their career, but for me personally, Suarez gets perhaps gets more credit when it isn't deserved and Sturridge takes a lot of stick when it isn't.

If you just want to row socially in the summer on the harbour then thats fine, you just stay in the open sessions. If you want to row competitively then as long as you're committed to training sessions then you'll get on a crew.

The cheapest stocks &amp; shares ISAs
Everyone now has a new allowance - how to take advantage of it

It's a new tax year, so we're giving you something totally new. We normally focus on cash ISAs (see best buys up to 3%), but now we're covering stocks &amp; shares investment ISAs. See our new Stocks &amp; Shares ISA guide, here are the 10 need-to-knows...

**1. 	What is a stocks and shares ISA?** Everyone in the UK over 18 has a new £11,880 ISA allowance. You could use it all to invest in stocks &amp; shares, or put up to half (£5,940) in a cash ISA (which over-16s can open).

It may still be called an ISA, but stocks &amp; shares ISAs are very different to cash ISAs (savings accounts you don't pay tax on). You can invest in:

*  Bonds. Where you lend your money to a company or government in return for interest.
* Shares. Where you invest in companies, literally buying a share of them.
* Funds. Most buy this way. They can include bonds, shares, cash or a mix.

Remember, when investing, you can lose your money as well as gain. For full info, see our new Stocks &amp; Shares ISAs guide.

	
**2.  Stocks &amp; shares ISAs are tax-efficient**, but not always tax-free. Cash ISAs are simple beasts but stocks &amp; shares ain't. They help you save some tax, but not all of it...

- You don't pay capital gains tax in an ISA. This is the tax on gains made when you sell an investment. You can 'gain' £11k per year outside an ISA without paying any tax, but in an ISA you NEVER pay tax on any 'gain'. CGT Info.

- ISA dividends - payouts if companies have done well - are taxed at 10%. Outside an ISA, they're 10% for basic-rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher-rate and 37.5% for top-rate, so only the latter two benefit. See Dividends Info.

- You don't pay tax on interest from corporate bonds in an ISA. Outside one, you pay at your income tax rate. See Corporate Bonds Info.
	
**3 . 	Should I use my cash ISA allowance or invest it all?** It depends whether you gain from the tax breaks above and whether you're willing to risk your money investing. But it's complicated, so see our Should I use my allowance for cash or investments? section of the guide.
	
**4 . 	Don't confuse choosing funds with where you buy your ISA.** ISAs are available from different providers but for the cheapest, buy via a specialist website, often called a platform. These are middlemen, not the company actually investing the money for you.

It's a two-stage process: (i) Pick which provider to buy your ISA from. (ii) Then decide what investments to put in it. It's like buying bread in a supermarket. Initially you pick the shop (decide which platform to use), then which loaf to buy (your shares/funds/bonds).

Fees warning: You're usually charged by both the middleman and the investment fund company. See Stocks &amp; Shares ISA Charges.

If you're not sure where to invest, you can seek help from an independent financial adviser. See our IFA Guide.
	
**5 . 	No ISA charges in year 1.** We've pored over the research to find the cheapest deals. Here are the results:

*  Best for the 1st year. AXA Self Investor* isn't charging any fees till 1 May 2015 if you open an ISA before the end of this month (you still pay the fund company). After that, AXA charges 0.35% of what you invest each year (£3.50 on £1,000). Full AXA Self Investor info.
* Best for the long-term. If you don't want the fuss of tarting your investments, the cheapest website is iWeb*, charging a one-off £25 account opening fee. Buying and selling funds is £5 a time. Full iWeb Funds info.
* Best alternative. Cavendish Online* is a good option if you know you won't transfer out in the 2nd year and will be a frequent trader. The annual fee's 0.25% and there are no charges for buying or selling funds. Full Cavendish Online info.
* Best for shares. Those who like to invest in shares should use iWeb*. Its one-off £25 account opening fee and £5 per share trade make it a top pick. Full iWeb Shares info.

	
**6 . 	Current ISA provider overcharging? Ditch it.** Cheap yesterday doesn't mean cheap today. Our research shows one of the UK's most popular fund platforms, Hargreaves Lansdown, is actually now one of the most expensive. Check the charges with your provider, and don't be afraid to switch.

Two things to consider. 1) Your new provider might not have the funds your old one has. Like changing supermarket, your new one might not stock all the brands you've bought before. 2) Some platforms charge you to leave, so always check first. Here are our top transfer picks...

*     - Best for 1st year. Axa Self Investor* isn't charging any fees till 1 May 2015, if you transfer money &amp; open an ISA before the end of April 2014 (you still pay the fund company). After, it's 0.35%. Full AXA Self Investor info.
*     - Best for long-term. If you don't want to keep switching, iWeb* charges a one-off £25 account opening fee on transfers. Buying and selling funds is £5 a time. Full iWeb Transfers info.
*     - Best alternative. Biggie Interactive Investor* charges £20 every 3 months, which gets 2 free trades/quarter (then £10/trade with a discount for frequent traders). Ask to transfer by 30 April &amp; new custs get up to £240 cashback in year one. Existing custs get £120. Full Interactive Investor transfer info.

	
**7 . 	How to do a shares ISA transfer.** It's easy, but not quick. Call your new provider. It'll do the rest for you - it'll take no longer than a month.
	
**8 . 	ISA allowance jumps to £15k on 1 July.** Since 6 April, everyone's been able to put £11,880 into a stocks &amp; shares ISA (£5,940 into a cash ISA). But from 1 July, all ISAs become new ISAs (NISAs) with a £15,000 allowance. It can be ALL in stocks &amp; shares, ALL in cash or a mix of both. The 2 questions Martin's most asked:

* If I open a stocks &amp; shares ISA now, what happens in July? You'll be able to top it up to £15,000 to count as your 2014/15 allowance.
* Should I wait till July? To use providers' April offers (such as those above) you need to open one now, not in July.

	
**9 . 	Use your ISA allowance by 5 April 2015 or lose it.** You must save or invest by 5 April 2015, the end of the tax year, or any unused allowance will be lost forever. Savings or investments within the tax-free ISA wrapper continue to reap the tax benefits until you withdraw them.
	
**10 . 	Can I convert my old stocks &amp; shares ISA into a cash ISA?** Yes, but you'll have to wait till 1 July. It'll be simple - just contact your new provider, tell it you want to transfer, and it'll do the rest. You can already transfer cash ISAs into stocks &amp; shares ISAs, which won't change.",0,1397675070,null,0,false,0,cgu4x2h,t3_236p5i,t1_cgu4x2h,t3_236p5i,null,1433384472,12,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,12

I think it's probably only not obvious if you start with the assumption that the EU is just a big con designed to rip us off.

You could claim that they should have been more explicit but people will always find ways to abuse the system, and the media can point out to the electorate those who do.

There's no reason why eurosceptics shouldn't have an office. It's just that as eurosceptic MEPs are pointless, then eurosceptics MEPs having offices is also pointless.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"They're so frustrating. They have a history of getting relegated with pretty decent looking sides (on paper). I've seen them do it time and time again over the years.

I remember back around the turn of the millennium they were 2nd in the Premier League in early December one year. By the end of the season they'd slipped to 7th for a 2nd consecutive year. The following Christmas they were comfortably in midtable and I went to the SoL to watch them beat Everton 1-0. Then they drew with Blackburn on Boxing Day and then they sold Don Hutchison and Alex Rae. In the 2nd half of the season they won like 1 match and finished 17th. The next season they finished rock bottom (19 points, a PL low at the time) with many of the same players who finished 7th two and three years earlier.

Then they walked the Championship with a record number of points, came back up, and got relegated again by resetting their own record for lowest PL points with 15.

Every season though they seem to have a decent squad. They're never going to get the best players but they pick up some more than capable 'rejects' from the big clubs. Two seasons ago their entire first-choce back four were players United had sold to them: Bardsley, Brown, O'Shea and Richardson. Three of them are still there. They have Adam Johnson who in his days with City had a fledgling England career.

Their troubles this time around came a couple of years ago when Darren Bent handed in a transfer request. He moved to Villa and Sunderland never really replaced him. They had players like Gyan and Sessegnon who did really well in the meantime but they weren't at Bent's level from his Sunderland days.

I've seen Sunderland be relegated 3 times, and each time they've come back up to the Premier League within 2 seasons. Each time, they've won the Championship (or Division 1 as it used to be known then). And yet each time they come up, the buy about 15,000 new players and then struggle for a few seasons before going back down.

**1)** 

Like /u/Nowimnotalurker said, our 11th place finish last season seems impressive but aside from a miracle [10-game unbeaten](http://i.imgur.com/wrtG2SK.png) run and 2 wins against teams who had literally nothing to play for at the end of the season we were absolutely dire; no imagination and struggling to even create chances, nevermind take them.

Oddly enough, I wouldn't say it has gone entirely wrong this year. I would say that compared to last year we've been playing *better* football, we've been creating a much greater number of chances and generally looked like a better side. Our problem has been scoring the chances that we create. For whatever reason our final ball... crosses, shots, through-balls... just haven't worked.

Not that I want this to become a wall of text, but let me bring up a few examples from this season.
&gt; 
&gt; AVL (H) - we won a penalty within the first 5 minutes and Snodgrass stole the ball from RvW and proceeded to royally fuck up the taking of the penalty, Villa scored shortly thereafter and for the remainder of the game we created 12 chances with only 1 on target. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; CHE (H) - mid-way through the 2nd half with the score at 1-1 we looked like the better side and were creating more chances and seeing more of the ball but 2 wonder strikes from 2 substitutes soon put an end to the hope. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; CAR (H) - 31 chances created. No goals scored. Draw.
&gt; 
&gt; MUN (H) - with the game at 0-0 at half time and Hoolahan enjoying his first game in months we looked like the better side and the more likely to take the game. We created 15 chances to their measly 7 but a single mistake from Bennett followed by a lucky bounce of the ball off another player put Welbeck in 1-on-1 with a chance he couldn't miss. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; CAR (A) - We scored within 5 minutes and looked like the better side throughout the first half, with Cardiff unable to find a way through. Just after half-time they score a goal after Hooper's loose cross-field defensive pass mistake and then they immediately score another within a minute. We go on to create 27 chances in total, to their 13, but are unable to find a way to score. Remember the Cardiff game at home I mentioned? Yeah, that's 58 chances created versus Cardiff this season and we only managed to score one goal, taking one point. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; WHU (A) - Despite creating more chances than them (consider it's away, this is impressive) and dominating the game, we were unable to score a goal and conceded 2 soft goals in the final 5 minutes. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; WBA (H) - 69% posession and more chances than the opposition again, but no goals. Loss.
&gt; 
&gt; FUL (A) - 55% posession and equal chances in another decent and very non-Norwich-like away performance. No goals scored. Soft goal conceded. Loss.

The amount of times this season that we've been consoled with messages from opposition fans, right after we lose, telling us that we were better and deserved to win the game is sickening.

Like I say, this season hasn't gone horribly wrong overall. We just haven't scored the goals required at the sharp end of the pitch.

**2)**

Realistic?

We lose 3 and draw 1.

I would love to be wrong.

**3)**

I haven't seen much of Adams, but from what I've heard he likes to play a more attacking and exciting brand of football than Chrissy did which can only be a good thing. Keeping the fans happy is important, no-one wants to see their team score at the start of the first half and immediately proceed to defend for 80 minutes.

If we are relegated I wouldn't mind Adams getting a shot at taking us back up.

If we stay up I'm not sure, perhaps get in someone with experience. I would like Lennon or Laudrup honestly.

**4)**

Olsson has been the standout performer, which is honestly a shame because Garrido was the same for us on loan last season and we made his deal permanent and he has barely seen the bench.

Fer would be the next best, some much needed strength and height in midfield with some surprisingly good ball control as well. No idea why Everton didn't sign him up.

Redmond has been exciting, though aside from one shot on target versus Southampton early in the season he hasn't been able to do anything other than fire the ball towards row z any time he tried to shoot or cross.

Hooper has looked like a brilliant finisher in clear-cut scoring opportunities, but with no consistent partner or formation it's been difficult for him to settle.

RvW honestly looks fantastic, his movement off the ball is just a little bit too intelligent for the rest of the team though it seems. He is constantly pointing where he wants it and making little runs but then whoever has it in midfield either doesn't anticipate it or just plays a bog-standard easy ball. It's so frustrating to watch, especially with people saying how awful he looks when he clearly looks like a cracking forward player who the team just don't quite understand.

Elmander can go die in a firey hole, though he'd probably trip over his own feet on the way and somehow manage to find his way back.

**5)**

*Player of the Year:* Olsson

*Young Player of the Year:* Redmond, despite being awful in the attacking third all season.

*Most Improved Player of the Year:* Howson was our best player alongside Fer in midfield until his injury a few months ago.

**6)**

Huckerby, I've only been a fan for about 12 years so I'm not as well-versed in our history as some so Huckerby is probably one of the best players I've experience at the club.

**7)**

Sturridge.

Don't get me wrong, Suarez is something special, but if I'm thinking about what would benefit our squad the most right now it's some height and strength up front. Hooper is strong and can hold off a defender but he's so short that he almost never bothers to challenge for a header, which means we lose a lot of Ruddy's goal-kicks immediately.

**8)**

Not watched too much, never been able to afford to go to the games and only managed to get the games in HD this season... so no good memories of playing against you guys. Just 3 Suarez hatricks in a row. Sigh.

**9)**

Won: Some kind of miracle... Hoolahan (please play Wes ffs Adams!)...

Lost: Standing off Suarez like we did at Anfield.

**10)**

A stressful but, as usual with Liverpool, attractive game of football ending 3-0 to the Reds.

* **Your role in /r/technology** -  there's been some controversy about that subreddit's moderation recently. I did not shape the moderation policy of that subreddit, and infact I would like to see improvements in many aspects. I caught flak for this, but it was a shoot the messenger situation. I'll do my best to improve it, but I'm only a junior moderator there and do not create the rules. This will take time.

[The Marriage Act 1836](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836) provided the allowance for people of a non-Anglican religion (excluding Jews &amp; Quakers who already had the right) to have their marriage recognised in properly licensed premises of their appropriate religion. At the same time registry offices were introduced to allow people to have civil ceremonies without any religious aspects or influence.

Essentially, the law was changed so that it was no longer a requirement that a wedding must be performed by an ordained CoE clergyman for it to be recognised by the state, as had been the case until the mid-18th century (from 1753 onwards it also had to be in a CoE building).

Or, you know, all those Catholics, atheists etc. could have just moved to a Catholic or atheist country rather than making a country they move to cater towards their wants.

What about the Muslims who were born here, like kids who are now taking their exams? Which country did they move to and from where?

And if you deem the above analogy as being not-exactly-the-same, then I can break it down a little more for you. The request, or proposal, is for some alterations to be made i.e. more people taking an exam in the morning period. I doubt very much that anyone is going to request that the timetable is changed dramatically (e.g. days either way), or that such a proposal would be given serious consideration.

Something like this is probably not going to cause anyone any ill effect. Potentially it might cost a little in administration, but in a case like this I'd say it's fairer, or kinder, to cater for kids that will be under the pressure of exams and, potentially, the pressure from their families/community/peers over religious observance.

And I say all this as an active campaigner for the NSS.

true,Evis03,null,null,"Depends on the scheme. Thing is that the NHS scheme is a defined benefit scheme, which is quite rare. Most pensions you contribute to a fund which is invested, then when you retire you take that fund and buy a regular pension pay-out with it. That fund size depends on how well investments pan out, how much you pay in, how much your employer pays in, loads of factors. Long and short of it is that you have no idea exactly what you'll get until it's time to cash it in.

With the nhs scheme there is no fund, your pay-out is based on years of service and your final salary (soon to be average salary over your career). This is why it's called a defined benefit- if we know the value of the factors that define it, then I can tell you to the exact penny what your pension will be years in advance. Because of that the amount you contribute actually has little bearing on what you get- it's based on years of service and salary, NOT your contributions. People often have a hard time getting their head around this :)

So the metric by which I compare NHS and non NHS pensions is a return on investment time, or rather how long it takes for you to start getting more money back than you put in (otherwise why not just save the money?). With the NHS scheme that can be, depending on circumstances between about two and six years. For other pensions it's usually much longer, often well into double digits.

So to answer your question it depends on the pension you are taking. The employer could contribute 14%, or you could be contributing the equivalent of your contributions plus a 14% on top of that, but the pay-out could still be lower, or the return on investment longer. That's the problem with comparing pension schemes, the terms and way the pension is calculated don't always match.

Occupational pension schemes in the private sector generally have a longer return on investment time (remember, that's just how I compare them in this case, some people may have a better way), usually because they employer doesn't contribute as much, and/or the pay-out calculation isn't as generous. Same goes for non occupational pensions.

Final note though is that some pensions also offer extra perks. For example the NHS pension offers life insurance policies and covers you for ill health retirements too.",0,1397678539,null,0,1397679184,0,cgu6pr5,t3_2369c3,t1_cgu6pr5,t1_cgu39u7,null,1433385388,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Did it start with previous posts of pictures at some point in the past or was the post about an Islamic poster in a Leicester school the first ?

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; It's amazing how few people understand this stuff. I'm not having a go at you; it's just really disappointing that this sort of stuff isn't common knowledge.

A lot of it is down to the fact that most people pay their tax under PAYE.  They don't really perceive taxation, because it's taken from them before it ever gets into their pockets.

A huge number of self-employed people and people running small companies do something comparable: they pay someone else *(an accountant)* to take care of it.

A  lot of it is then excused on the grounds that, *""Tax is really complicated!""*  Which is only half true.  Some tax legislation is spectacularly complicated.  But the tax affairs of most people really aren't that labyrinthine and neither are the rules relevant to them.

The thing is: the people who are best able to explain these things are incentivised not to.  An accountant isn't doing himself any favours by pointing out, *""You know, you could prepare three line accounts and submit this yourself online!""*  Similarly the government [any flavour you fancy] has little incentive to go out of its way to explain, *""Here is what you pay and here is what we do with it.""*",0,1397680119,null,0,false,0,cgu7juv,t3_232zhj,t1_cgu7juv,t1_cgswgt0,null,1433385780,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't think so. A mod earlier today said (in a now deleted thread) :

I have only just checked reddit for the first time today so I was not aware of any post removals. I will investigate the reasons why and look at how the rules are enforced, *as I believe common sense should dictate that you don't remove topical posts based on tiny issues that are not strictly upheld.*

The issue with the larger subs, and the defaults especially, is it is no longer always possible to find or contribute to a civilised and actual discussion due to the commentary being awash with memes, jokes, and KS3 or below level comments. 

This is seeping into /r/uk, but no where near to the same level. Still, the /r/uk of today is of a noticeably lower quality than the /r/uk of 4 years ago. I wonder where we will be 2 years from now.

2. Do you have any ideas on how to combat Voting System misuse?

Often, I find Redditors which are considered controversial (such as /u/ruizscar) are downvoted unfairly despite making a clear, concise and often very understandable contribution to the thread. Ideally, I would like  to see the comments outright rather than having to scroll to the bottom. Perhaps a roundtable with other mods to discuss a solution?

3. What are your thoughts on bias?

Like any sub, /r/uk has a certain hivemind that reflects in the submissions and, more importantly, the voting on those submissions. Thus, we are overwhelming fed Guardian and BBC articles at the cost of many others. Recently I took a picture where 9 of the top 10 links on our page were Guardian articles - http://i.imgur.com/K40gze4.png.

But drp in and watch the circle jerks (obviously female equivalent, because it would be offensive) that they consider themselves as middle class who now shop aldi because it is ok to do so and are so right on it hurts, in actual fact dig deeper they are complaining that there tax credit has been stopped because they earn above the threshold, housing benefit might be stopped because they have a new boyfriend, or someone said something to them that could be construed as rude for not saying/thinking the right thing and not potentially understanding that they could have a hidden mental health issue.

I've tried to keep low quality content out of here, I think we're doing ok in that regard.

Comments are a lot harder. I'm iffy on removing comments, that's something really hard to get right. /r/AskScience is one of few subreddits I know of that practices it, and their sub often looks like a comment graveyard at times.

Most of the obvious memes and image macros are easy to pick up on, but other stuff is harder. It's hard to even define what ""bad"" content is, let alone moderate for it.

b) There isn't really any way to prevent this, the voting system and reddit is what it is, without a fundamental code change, that's always going to happen. People use up/down as like/dislike and there's no way to stop that.

c) At one point in the past I tried something where we'd only have a maximum of 5 out of 25 images allowed, and that sort of worked. We could try something like that for any one domain, perhaps.

**Joe Allen**. Haven't seen as much of him as I'd liked to this season, but henderson, coutinho and Gerrad have been in such good form it's hard to drop one of them. Whenever Joe Allen has been called upon he's looked fantastic he hasn't been a £16m player for us yet imo, but the way he plays when he gets game time he can definitely more than justify the price we paid. 

**Mingolet**. IMO he's had a great season, of course not as fancy comfortable on the ball as Reina but he's made some really clutch saves and won us many points this season. Definitely worth the price. 

**Alberto**. We haven't seen much of him this season, so you can't say whether or not he's justified the price we paid for him. He's still young and clearly has potential, I'm not convinced he can turn into a world beater but he has the potential to be an important part of our squad for years to come.

**Touré**. He's kolo Touré, enough said. 

**Sahko**. Sahko hasn't had a good run in the team as of yet, mostly due to injuries and partly due to Agger hitting form whenever sahko's been available. Whenever he's played he's looked like a solid defender, good in the air, good positioning and good going into the tackle, not as good as agger on the ball but superior all around at defending IMO. One thing that excites me about sahko is that he's 24, he has lots of time to mature as a defender and he already looks like a solid centre back. I think he'll more than prove his worth during his time with us. 

**Aspas**. I know a lot of people probably don't want to hear this but I think of all the signing here Aspas is the only one that really didn't workout for anyone invloved.  Personally I don't think he's good enough, whether that's due to not being used to our style of football, homesickness, lack of skill it doesn't really matter, from what I've seen he's simply not good enough to hold a place in the squad. It's shame because he seems like a nice lad, but I think he'll go in the summer. 

**Coutinho and sturridge**. I don't really think anything needs to be said about these two. Fantastic.

I suppose it depends on a lot of contributing factors as well, if your new friends often go, then you are more inclined to join in, same with if your partner or their family goes. 

And then there's the money side to it, and the fact I don't really like *people* - that's an issue.

It's a shame he deleted five threads about the original topic first, and a few more complaining about the moderation. You can see why there's allegations of censorship, although he didn't target this topic for it's content, he repeatedly removed the content whenever the community repeatedly attempted to discuss it.

I get angry when I see mods doing this. Rules and moderators are there to help sub-reddits accomplish their purpose. Enforcing the rules shouldn't obstruct a sub-reddit from doing its job.

This isn't people starting their own businesses, this is people doing minimum wage or no wage, commission only work and not being given any contract, guaranteed hours, pension rights - nothing. This isn't the apprentice wannabes, this is people who get given a 'job' and find out after they start that they have none of the rights you should get with a job - you might work all day and earn absolutely nothing in some cases - because you have no contract -  but it's very hard to get out of that situation if you've been long term unemployed because walking away can result in benefit sanctions and an even longer gap on your cv. 

There are notorious schemes where a 'marketing company' will advertise jobs, have people work for a week as 'self-employed', handing out leaflets on the street, doing door to door sales etc. and then that company will just disappear, it will leave the office it's rented for the scheme, it'll change it's name etc. and no one gets paid.  And no one can sue them even if they can trace them because they were 'self employed'. They are a few that pop up in Bristol every summer targeting students looking for summer jobs. Their names change but the modus operandi doesn't. They usually target parents of young kids with limited flexibility, teenagers, long term unemployed - people with crap prospects in the job market who will just sign anything because they are desperate for work.

&gt;Not to bang a racist drum here or anything, but given that white British people now make up only 44% of London, maybe, just maybe there might have been a tad too much immigration.

&gt;You're getting nationality and race confused
&gt;Well the two are intrinsically linked. The history of the British Isles, the British nation and the British people are all intimately interwoven. Your heritage and roots are the people from which you come, yours being Jamaican, mine being British.
&gt;You can get black germans, black austrians, black swedes?
&gt;You really can't, that's absurd. **Mowgli can live with the wolves, but he is not a wolf, he is a man. Same with races.**

But, moving on...

&gt;Oh give it a fucking rest already. Make a new fucking subreddit for all I care so you guys can wank yourselves to death about the ""muslim invasion of britain"" or whatever fuckwitted conspiracy you think is going on.

I made this post because over the last week particularly, but probably the last fortnight there have been a lot of anti muslim or anti immigrant posts that dont bother to scratch the surface of how the situation really is - which is, newsflash, Britain is still pretty much the same as it was a decade ago and there is no vast muslim conspiracy to kill off the people who live here and move into the ruins.

I still havent seen any kind of confirmation that that ""music is haraam"" picture is legit. What we do know is that there is an ALLEGED - not yet proven - plot that is under investigation so I think the best thing to do is basically let the people who are doing the investigating do their fucking job and either let the thing explode when they actually find some concrete evidence, or shut the fuck up about it. 

Since we've had god knows how many posts of the news of this investigation, the people spam posting it today werent doing any more to add to the discussion beyond stirring shit up.

&gt;I believe these Moderators have a tight circle of friends, and a few shill accounts to help them out. That's my two cents.

Hazard is wonderful where he is, but he won't be able to do what Oscar does across the board. Tackling, winning the ball, dropping deep and defending (not just defending on the wings and helping full backs). Finally, Lavezzi! Why are you forgetting about his age? and since when does our team have a target man that will head a crossed ball into the net? Lavezzi would have been a good player for us, if we had bought him few years ago. He is older now, expensive and won't bring anything of great to the table. Just a waste of money. There are other positions that greatly need new signings. Attacking midfielder is the least of our worries. Btw, Cavani has only been there for a season. How do you expect PSG to sell him?

Whatever I need to know in order to be a parent, MN generally has the answers. Even if it's just something stupid like finding kids' clothes on sale or how to clean a humidifier or how to get a statement of special needs or apply to schools. They take a very hard line on anything to do with drugs or alcohol or poly relationships, which I don't usually agree with, and I can get a more nuanced view from reddit.  Like reddit you can pick and choose your boards and areas of interest, and just not bother with the dross.  I don't browse the feminism boards there anymore than most redditors subscribe to TRP.  Unlike most other parenting forums, most MN users are or were highly educated professional women - the bright girls from university don't just disappear once they pass 30, you know.  (And they hate poor spelling, paragraphs and grammar just as much reddit does. See, they are equally awful people!)

TL;DR. Don't just knock it because it's somehow cool to sneer at older women who have children, it does have something to offer.

Immediately afterwards a page supporting the campaign, which has since been removed from the site, appeared on Mumsnet, saying: ""We're backing his [Ed Vaizey’s] call, and we'll be pressing him to ensure that ISPs comply as soon as possible.

Flat hunting isn't very easy here, there are far too many mediocre, amateur landlords who put absolute minimal time and money into maintaining the property. Most properties are old, often with poorly thought out conversions into flats. The landlords get away with it because the huge waves of students each year leaves many of them with little choice in a sellers market. 

Landlords generally don't do short term except during the festival when they get crazy prices. It tends to be a 6 month lease. Also flats often come onto the market 1-2 months before they are available, as the current tenant gives notice. 

Your best best may be to take a room in a shared flat and stick it out whilst you look for a permanent one. 

I've never actually had to produce a reference, I imagine a lot of the agencies do require it as per policy but probably some are just using it as an easy way to deny someone they don't like the look of.

It's a psychological thing, once you're safe you lose your fight, your drive, your determination. They'll honestly be looking forward to just getting the season over.

Now clearly their win against Everton today shows what they can do when they are fighting, but they no doubt went in with a ""nothing to lose, everything to gain"" mentality. If they won they're pretty much guaranteed safety. If they didn't, no harm done because they weren't expected to.

Now they no longer have anything to fight for do you really think they'll have that hunger and energy? I don't. 

Palace are my second team and my brother supports them. They've done exceptionally well to climb the table under Pulis but I don't see them as a threat to us.

If the Mods believe the content of his posts are against their rules then they are able to ban him? How is this an excuse to censor posts here? How is this evidence of a raid on the UK subreddits? Moreover, how does this provide sufficient reason to censor topics of discussion?

I'm using his posts as an (extreme) example of the increasing number of posts expressing bigotry and irrational hatred of people for no reason other than they happen to be born in a different country.

&gt;Agreed, but that's not why that topic was censored. As a matter of fact, we still don't know because there's been a level of deception at work here. The excuses have changed each time.
&gt;...
&gt;So you're in favour of banning topics that speculate on any event/news that hasn't been fully investigated yet? This is simply ridiculous, as half the discussions taking place here would have to cease in such an event. I still have not heard a satisfactory reason as to WHY.WE.SHOULD.NOT.BE.ALLOWED.TO.DISCUSS.THIS.TOPIC.

I am not in favour of banning discussion - I just see no reason to flog a dead horse that has already been melted down for glue. This alleged ""muslim schools conspiracy"" was submitted yesterday and has been a fairly regular fixture for the last couple of weeks, particularly in the Telegraph. To post the ""Music is haraam"" image without a shred of evidence that its actually present at the school is simply shit stirring, especially given the last couple of days with some thread content that has been particularly vitriolic at targeting muslims or immigrants and basing prejudiced opinions on far outliers of their communities.

&gt;I don't believe that a few comments like that are sufficient excuse to censor discussion on this subreddit. Surely you agree with me there? It appears there has been a level of inappropriate censorship taking place. Furthermore, the mods have continued to seek to silence people that are willing to expose this.

Eh, I will freely admit that I will not lose sleep over the ""FREEZE PEACHES"" argument that so many redditors like to trot out, because reddit is simply the latest in a long line of message boards I've used where you exchange your freedom of expression for the ease of your expression. 

In your case with such a long post history of dubious topics I might even sleep more soundly.

Essentially this comes down to a fundamental difference which is that I do not fire myself into a shitting-the-bed frenzy of FREE SPEECH when a thread is deleted - and particularly when a moderator probably made the logical choice of recognising when such a topic is likely to descend into a complete frothing shitshow and removing it. Unfortunately all they did was try and put the flames out with a can of petrol.

true,AssholeDeluxe,null,null,"Here's the problem: things are rapidly improving for Arsenal as things get rapidly more difficult for Everton. 

* Schedule is most obvious. Hull, Newcastle, WBA and Norwich for Arsenal. No guaranteed points, but all very winnable games. Everton must claw through both Manchesters, and a very good Southampton side. You finish with Hull, but the hard part will be getting there with your record intact. 

* Injuries: Arsenal are a squad that is very quickly returning to full strength. Ramsey is back from injury and will likely be starting soon. Wilshere and Ozil are back in training with the latter slated to play Sunday. I'm not immediately familiar with how your injury record stacks up, but I don't think you are regaining that level of firepower in the same time period. 

* Form. Obviously Everton have been on an insane tear. But today surely wasn't where you expected to drop points, even given Pulis' achievements this season. It will be interesting to see if you capitalize on a largely neutered United side in a way that Arsenal failed to do this season. It's not a must-win for you guys, but it's damn near close. Meanwhile, Arsenal are through to the cup final and yesterday was a good (but not great) performance and the players look like they're playing with something to prove. Admittedly, there is still some fragility in the side, but I think we've largely gotten past the public castrations we've suffered this season. 

I think this loss will hurt more than any other this season, as the Toffees made the rest of their campaign immensely harder from here forward. Just predictions of course, as this race for 4th could easily go either way. Should be a good race to the finish and either way, Martinez is in the mix for the best manager in the Prem this season.

I don't think its been reduced to 5:

&gt; Players are required to have made 10 appearances in a club's first team to qualify for a medal.

&gt;It's my understanding that it's criminal under the letter of the law. 

Ok, starting right here; your understanding is completely wrong.

The sort of thing we're talking about works something like this:

*(This is highly generalised and not specific to Starbucks.)*

1.  The parent company sets up a subsidiary within a fiscal authority with a low tax rate.

2.  They assign to the subsidiary the right to sell on the right to their intellectual property.  *(The brand.)*  

3.  The parent company sets up a trading company in the UK.

4.  The UK company enters into a contract to licence the brand from the low-tax company.  

5.  Under the licence the trading company pays for the use of the brand.

It is really important to understand that all these things **do** happen.  There is intellectual property and it does have value.  The right to licence it is assigned to the one company and it does licence it to the trading company.  Money is paid for the use of the licence.

&gt;They are falsifying transactions via shell companies to disguise profit so as to lower the tax exposure.

This is the thing.  They are **not** falsifying the transactions.

There are a few lines of attack that **could** be used to challenge these sorts of mechanisms.

a.  Rules applicable to deductions allowable in computing the liability to Corporation Tax:  In order for an expense to be eligible for deduction in calculating tax it has to be **wholly** and **exclusively** for the purposes of the trade.  That is, you spent the money to earn income.

The problem here is that you have to show that the expense was incurred **for some other purpose**.  This is pretty easy when your company buys a horse for your eleven year old daughter and claim that it's for *advertising*.  The thing is, Starbucks(UK) **does** need to licence the brand to operate and it **does** incur an expense.

You might not like this as described, but the issue is rarely *(never)* properly addressed in the media.  Imagine I start up a company.  It's awesome and profitable and my brand has real value.  You come to me and ask if you can start up a franchise under my brand.  I will charge you for that and I'd like to think that you'll probably understand why and that that's not unreasonable.

b.  Transfer pricing rules.  Transfer pricing addresses the issue of whether you overpaid for something with regard to its open market practice.  If you overpay an adjustment can be made for tax purposes.

This is pretty easy with tangible assets.  Say your company buys gold bars from your other company based in the British Virgin Islands.  We can check if the price you paid looks like the arm's length value.  If it turns out you paid 3,000% of the value on the London Metal Exchange, you can be forced to fix it.

With intellectual property the issue of valuation is far more complicated.  What *is* the genuine commercial value of the right to use the Starbucks brand?  It's clearly genuinely quite a lot, but not a simple matter to value.

&gt;&lt;Snip&gt;

&gt;Genuine costs can decrease your on-paper profits but the moment you start using fake expenses to do so you are breaking the law. 

Yes.  Absolutely!

But these aren't fake expenses.  This isn't comparable to you writing out an invoice for something you didn't buy, or drawing in an extra 0 on an invoice to inflate your expenses.

&gt;A full audit would throw their bullshit out of the window, HMRC just won't accept that you pay multiple times over the market rate for your supplies.

First point:  The accounts are audited.  The auditors *(Deloitte &amp; Touche, according to an extremely quick search)* will have signed off the accounts as being a **fair and true** account of the company's financial position.

Second point:  Agreed and addressed under Transfer Pricing above.  The valuation of IP is far from simple.

&gt; That these cases are not prosecuted is a different matter. 

In order to be prosecuted you must commit a prosecutable office.  In order to commit fraud you must make a false representation that you know to be untrue or misleading.  In common terms, you must lie.

Starbucks simply don't need to lie.  There will be an entry in their accounts that more or less says, *""We paid £X""*

There is no false representation.  If their senior management were going through the invoices with a bottle of Tippex increasing the costs you bet HMRC would be all over them.  But it's a fundamentally different problem.

The self post thing I think deserves an explanation, it could be entirely innocent but it appears to be ideologically based. The ""here are links to profiles of people I want to call out as a moderator"" sounds like witch hunting to me. The ""dont let your subreddit be dominated by _these people_"" similarly looks like rabble rousing to me.


This post is an interesting one: http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/237ewm/mods_qa/cguahl7

The conversation is essentially ""why did you delete my thread?"" to which Skuld gives an explanation, he then later revisits the post and says (paraphrased) ""actually it was because you've instigated a brigade of this thread"". I'm not sure if Skuld expects us to believe this kind of ex post facto reasoning or not.

true,ctp95,lfc55,,"It was a horrific lie but part of the reason it was swallowed so easily was because of the prevalence of hooliganism in British football at the time. Also remember that Hillsborough happened just 4 years after the Heysel Disaster, which some Liverpool supporters were at fault in and led to a 5 year ban on all English teams competing in Europe. Other fanbases were not overly sympathetic to Liverpool and the general public regarded football supporters in general as animals. To clarify, absolutely none of this is meant to excuse what the media and other punters did, but just explain a little bit of the mentality. 

I can somewhat see how people would have an easy time believing that drunkenness or hooliganism was a contributing factor. Being force-fed that narrative day in and day out would have made it even worse. Even now in the UK, *everyone* reads the paper and the S*n is the most widely read paper in the country, so everyone all across the country was confronted with their lies every day. Also remember that this was long before the internet or 24 news channels, so there was little opportunity for the survivors to tell the truth en masse. There was an information vacuum and that fucking rag filled it with lies and deceit. 

I also feel that Hillsborough would have been handled somewhat differently had it not happened to a Northern team. The north-south divide in the UK is a very real thing and many people in the South are extremely disdainful, even now, of Northerners. If it had happened in London I think there would have been a quicker public outcry and investigation into what had really happened. Either way, fuck the S*n and Justice For the 96 always.

Now is **not** the time to risk putting Aspas or Alberto in. They've hardly kicked a ball in 2014 and they almost certainly won't be involved in our other three fixtures. If Sturridge is out of the Chelsea game I think we'll line up like that^ and it makes sense to practice with this lineup if that's the case: remember, it'll be our first game this season without Henderson in midfield so we definitely need to figure out our shape for the next three games.

I think that everybody needs to show Norwich a bit more respect. Our recent record against them is admittedly strong but they're a Premier League team fighting for survival so there's little to no chance of it being an easy game like people are suggesting.

The fact is that actually, the North/South divide does exist (the disparity in income is pretty big, and as much as private vs state education gets brought up a lot here, nobody makes a fuss that out of the top 100 schools in the UK only six or seven are in the North). It's just that a lot of Southerners seem to have no awareness about this at all *except* for when they're tactlessly taking the fucking piss out of you for it.

true,kezza596,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"Well, I'll try putting it into perspective for you, from how it is in my job.

Regardless of what he spent most of it on, let's say a man in my homeless accommodation has a total £10,000 of debt. This includes a council tax debt, a debt from a previous tenancy, a crisis loan debt, and a water bill debt. There are other debts too, eg that sofa suite he bought shortly before his wife divorced him, took half is savings/pension and left all the bills in his name. He has turned over a new leaf, kicked his habit of drinking to deal with his issues, and wants to clear his debt and get back on his feet.

He gets £72 benefits a week. Each week, without any choice on his behalf, £10 a week is taken off his benefits before he even receives them, in order to pay back his crisis loan. £5 a week is taken from him to pay back the council tax debt. Also, the water debt people have threatened legal action, unless he pays them £5 a week also. This is indisputable on his behalf - in fact, if he contests it, he very realistically faces being sanctioned without receiving hardship money whilst they 'investigate' for up to 3 months. To be sanctioned means to receive absolutely nothing, not a penny. Is it worth the risk? No, it really isn't.

This means that the guy actually receives £52 a week into his account. That rent debt I mentioned? The landlord is now pursuing legal action because the guy hasn't been able to afford to pay anything, because he's trying to eat. The guy now gets a bill for £~20 for the debt collector simply to visit his house, and they guy wasn't in to answer the door.

This guy still has rent to pay on his own home, council tax, water, gas, electric. If he doesn't pay these, he is street homeless. He often goes hungry to try to keep up with these bills. Keeping a roof over your head is far more important than keeping your belly full. Besides, even when going hungry, the guy simply doesn't have enough to pay these bills, even if he strip washes in the sink instead of showering, even if he only flushes to loo when necessary, even if he boils his veg in the same pan of water night after night.

If the guy decides to buy more/better/any food instead of paying his bills, he loses his home, he racks up more debt, and he's still hungry anyway.

This is what a foodbank is for. It is very common for people to go hungry in order to keep themselves a place to live. This is a very dangerous practice.

Yes, he is paying bills whilst receiving foodbank food, but you need to realize what it is that he's going hungry for. It's not just to keep a roof over his head, but also to keep an address under his belt. You try applying for a job without a proper address. C/O? Won't touch you. You can't receive any documentation as you have no postal address.

I hope that getting a glimpse into the world of the average jobseeker helps you understand it some. He may be paying his bills, but you need to understand that he's not claiming a food voucher 'just because'. He's been going hungry to keep himself in a home, and now there is the option to have food whilst he does it.",0,1397692680,null,0,false,0,cguds5k,t3_235typ,t1_cguds5k,t1_cgtve5x,null,1433388781,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We shouldn't TRY to not be in Europe, and we shouldn't be disappointed if we don't, but we should be happy. I think in order to become successful in Europe we need to get a team that has an implemented system and an established manager. 

What is the use of europe (especially Europe League) If we play games with a team that hasn't played in a particular system, get sort of far with the talent we have, get injuries, and end up losing to teams that know how to play with each other. If Van Gaal is our manager, he won't be coming in until after the WC and have little time to get the players to play in a particular system. Europe would injure our players and make us less likely to establish a starting XI, ruining chemistry and stagnating us in the same position. 

If we aren't in Europe we can make a team that can BECOME contenders in Europe. By not being in Europe, we are aspiring to be in Europe at the same time (if that makes sense). I believe the highs and lows of a team are something that people overlook. Lok at Liverpool, Everton, Roma, etc. I am NOT saying I don't want success for the club. I want it more than anything.

You're obviously going to win the argument if you force it to be Kane isn't as good as Eriksen because that's obviously true but that isn't the argument though is it. 

You also can't compare the level of development youth players from teams like Ajax have in comparison to our youth players as Ajax aren't spending 110 million on players in one season. Look at Bale you could just as easily apply you argument to him as he wasn't doing a lot at spurs at 21 it took him 3 season to get into the spurs team regularly.

Eriksen and Lamela are exceptional youngster that are very good for any age and could be world class players, that is not what most players are like at 21. Players like Adebayor, Paulinho, Dembele were not setting the world alight at 21. 


I think this is where we vastly disagree firstly the fact that you are so quick to dismiss these player because some have even made a first team appearance. and there are about 5 or 6 clubs in the world that make players consistently of the calibre you're talking about.

You have no idea how good some of these players are going to be but the fact we are producing them is only a good thing isnt' it? We either develop them and see if they're good enough for the first team if they are great if not free money.

Edit: Actually having skimmed his church times article (available through a link on the guardian) seems to me that it's not all that bad. It's still mostly bollocks, but it's not a call to arms. If he wants to be christian, fine, just really try to understand the important nature of secularism, just a little bit? Instead of unjustly going against it. As in the church times article, Cameron says because 'we're a christian country' different faiths are tolerated. Rather, I'd say we're just a naturally demure and not-bothered nation, mostly and that helps us learn to 'tolerate' people most of all. Christian or not being little to do with it. In fact some of our most inflamed periods have resulted from a strong christian faith, we now have a modicum of reason to understand even if revelations says this or that, it's not likely to be the end of the world tomorrow.

Mignolet - Filled in well for Reina and while he's not as good on the ball, few are. He also saved us a reasonable amount off our wage bill. He's not a liability in the net. 

Iago Aspas - I've said it from day one, he's not liverpool material. Nice guy with good work ethic, but he's just another Assadi. 

Alberto - I've liked what I have seen. He's going to take Borini's spot if we don't get Borini back. Plus he was technically affordable. 

Kolo - I feel that he was brought in solely for his veteran leadership and a straight replacement for Carragher. Great to have on the bench but I wouldn't ever want him to start. Worth bringing in to the squad. 

Coutinho - An insane steal. I can't fathom why anyone doesn't think he's a star.

Sturridge - Genius. Sturridge quietly having a Torres in his prime type year. 
Allen - Expensive but at the time we were an 8th place club. When we are able to bring Allen off the bench, that's a luxury I'm happy to have. Great work ethic but needs help in the offensive third. a little to small to be a strong defender so has to live in the true midfield, which he's done pretty well.

There is a part of Selly Oak (Tiverton Road and close streets) that is full of student houses, maybe you want to avoid those, but you can also find some quiet areas in Selly Oak that are still well connected to the city centre by train. Btw, don't worry about the supposed ""crime wave"", personally I never had a problem at all and I don't have a feeling of unsafety around; just take the basic precautions and you should be fine.

You could also consider living in Moseley or King's Heath, those areas are close enough to cycle or get the bus to uni and are quite lively; if you like independent cafeterias, pubs with nice gigs and so... You will definitely enjoy those areas. (I take the bus to go to King's Heath as much as I take the train to go to the city centre.)

You can also think about Harborne. It is a really nice area and some houses in Harborne are in a walking distance to university. Ofc, as you've been said already, the city centre is another option since the university has its own train station, but I think you can find cheaper and nicer places out of the city centre that are well connected so you still can enjoy all the amenities there.

Btw, if you are planning on staying in the same place for several months I'd advise you to view the place first first of all.

Here's some statistics on the subject according to a [Gallup poll conducted in 1999](http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistbigotryprejudice/a/AtheistSurveys.htm). The percentage shown is the percentage of those asked who said they would *not* vote for a presidential candidate who, whilst other wise qualified, has one of the following traits. In parentheses is the statistics in a different year, if the same question happened to be asked.  

Catholic: 4% (1937: 30%)

Black: 5% (1958: 63%, 1987: 21%)

Jewish: 6% (1937: 47%)

Baptist: 6%

Woman: 8%

Mormon: 17%

Muslim: 38%

Gay: 37% (1978: 74%)

Atheist: 48%.

As you can see, 52% of Americans will immediately not vote for an atheist candidate.

It makes sense because Norwich midfield is probably their greatest asset. Rodgers is likelier to opt for Coutinho to start on the left flank, with Sterling on the right, Suarez playing through the middle. If BR decides he needs to mix things up, it's a lot likelier we'll see Moses coming off the bench. Reason is simple, VM has a lot more PL experience than Aspas and this will be a very very important game.

Additionally there's going to be at least one youngster on the bench. If Sturridge won't be able to make it, we might see two youths among the subs. I point this out, because I think BR will sooner opt for one of the youngsters than IA. Rodgers is fully aware of how important the mental game is, even in football, and if far more likely to give the opportunity to a young player, eager to prove himself. Unfortunately for Iago very little, if anything, has gone his way this season at Liverpool. Consequently his confidence is seriously damaged and I think we all know, a player can't have doubts on the pitch of a Premier League game.

Also, anyone else feel Luis Alberto will be on the bench for our next game?

Tenuously I would argue that people who live and are born in the South tend to vote for politicians who were also from the South, and are happy to keep the wealth centralised in Southern areas and focus future investment there. But to be honest I'd be hard pressed to really debate that argument any further because I have nothing to back it up and I'm not sure I really believe it.

And I went to university in the South East and stayed down here to work rather than finding a job back in the North, so can't be too judgemental around economic pressures - and actually Manchester and to a lesser but similar extent Liverpool seem to be doing pretty well for growth and development these days. 

What mostly gets to me is just the low undercurrent of prejudice. It's probably not as bad as foreigners get, but it still definitely seems to be there. It's far less rare than it should be that people seem less trusting of you, assume that you're relatively poorly educated and were brought up in a city council house (or some run-down Yorkshire miner's village if you're from the other side of the Pennines) and marvel at your triumph against adversity of being from the north to somehow escape to land a proper well-paid job in the real world down south.

And yet despite apparently holding this opinion of the North being some godforsaken terrible place to be brought up, none of them actually seem to give a shit about the idea that maybe something could be done about it. Instead everyone should just move to London and push house prices up even further beyond anything that someone moving from the North could easily afford.

Paul Lambert could send an SOS to compatriot Billy Stark to help stop Aston Villa’s worrying slide.

After four successive defeats, the Midlands club responded by suspending assistant manager Ian Culverhouse and head of football operations Gary Karsa.

They face the sack over allegations of bullying and rising criticisms of training, as revealed by Mirror Sport .

Under-fire boss Lambert has temporarily promoted development coach Gordon Cowans and experienced keeper Shay Given for Saturday’s vital home game with Southampton.

But Lambert is also considering bringing in Stark, who is also the Scotland Under-21s' coach.

true,Messisfoot,null,null," I never said the academy has to be producing Lamela's and Eriksen's every year, you keep missing the point. The goal is Top 4 finish on a consistent basis, right?

Well that is accomplished with a quality squad. If we can achieve that with youth development, then it's all gravy. But the chances of a youth player achieving that level is a shot in the dark. Not even La Masia, arguably one of the best youth systems in the world, consistently produce youth products that make it to their first team. They consistently produce youth products that make it to other first teams, but not theirs.

Now, back to the first point. If we can't produce youth players that make it into our first team, if our goal is to have a first team that consistently makes it into the Top 4, then you have to go purchase abroad -edit: or other clubs in the prem. league. 

Going off of that, I don't think Kane, Carrol, Livermore, Rose, or Townsend have shown the potential to be Top 4 players at their age. Let's take one of the names you dropped, for example Suarez, and see where he was compared to Kane at around the same age. At 20-21, he scored 34 goals in the eredivisie; his first season at Ajax (so much for that argument). Kane at 20... well... yeah. We could argue that Kane is actually not a striker but a number 10, but it wouldn't help his case that much. The point is, at the same age, these players were showing potential to be stars. Our youth products - Bentaleb aside - are not. Who knows, maybe that changes next season and I eat my words. But as of right now, they are not demonstrating the ability to be Top 4 material. That's it, can't make my argument any clearer or simpler.

The BNP definitely isn't fascist, at least not these days. The BNP actually wants a more direct democracy with more power in the hands of the individual.

So basically your opinion is unless a player at the age of 18 or at most 20 isn't walking into our first team and showing the potential to be as good as Suarez or Erisken they won't ever make it.


My opinion is it's harder to get into the Tottenham team as we can afford to buy first. that's why we loan players as we have the luxury or having other clubs blood our youngsters players like Walker. So to say that our academy players aren't good enough because they're not in our first team at 20 is bullshit. 


Also the calibre of player you are talking about is so rarely produced, ever that's why they are worth millions of pounds. I agree Kane probably won't be as good as Suarez.


Also you get top 4 not just having a fantastic players you also need a squad of good players Caulker instead of Toure would have helped Liverpool for example or Flanagen coming in has helped them considerably. Stone in at Everton is another. And speaking of Everton Coleman and Baines weren't suarez level good at 20.


Basically this isn't really getting to a conclusion. You think our youth products aren't as good as Suarez and aren't going to improve the first team at all that's fine.

The rise of UKIP. They don't have a chance of winning next year's general election, although they might get a seat or two. But they might win the MEP elections, which will make them even more politically relevant. The Conservatives are shifting to the right to try to counter this threat, while Labour are mostly ignoring it, in the hope that most UKIP votes will come from former Tory voters (this may be misguided). Having said that, I personally don't think UKIP will be able to cope with being in the spotlight - they are not a particularly, shall we say, politically disciplined group. Some UKIP bigwigs are prone to making somewhat controversial public statements, and I don't think they will cope well with sustained media scrutiny. 

As you said, the Scottish independence campaign. I won't say too much as you're already aware of it, but although it is still unlikely to result in a ""yes"" vote, support for independence is creeping up and Alex Salmond is a wily operator - we should never rule anything out. 

Free schools might become quite a big issue. This was brought in by Michael Gove, and essentially schools can become ""academies"" - they have a lot more freedom and are no longer bound to the national curriculum, and are accountable to the Department of Education rather than to their local council (as with normal state schools). However they still receive state funding. It's something of a middle-ground between state and private schools. At the moment, few significant problems have emerged. However support for this development is shaky at best, and a few well-timed pre-election scandals could really sink the free school ship. 

Very broadly, support for the Lib Dems has almost evaporated (mainly due to the tuition fees fiasco, and the fact that British people simply aren't used to coalitions. There's a perception that Nick Clegg, the leader of the Lib Dems, is weak, and the idea that he ""lied"" about tuition fees has really sent their support tumbling). The economy appears to be doing well, at least according to GDP figures, and Labour are focusing on the ""cost of living crisis"" - essentially the fact that inflation is outstripping wage growth. Expenses are a perennial issue. Within the Conservative party, George Osbourne and Boris Johnson are both positioning themselves for post-2015 leadership runs, and are gathering support and subtly briefing against each other behind the scenes. There are other challengers, such as Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove. 

Wow, this is a lot longer than I meant for it to be, apologies. 

Edit - oh, I forgot about the Leveson inquiry into press ethics. This isn't a huge story any more, although it is yet to be fully resolved. Basically, the News of the World (a now-defunct trashy tabloid paper owned by News Corp, Rupert Murdoch's news group) were discovered to have been repeatedly hacking the voicemail systems of celebrities, etc., in order to generate stories. This story really blew up when it was discovered that they had hacked the voicemail system of a murdered child called Milly Dowler. By all accounts this was a pretty cunty move, and the paper was soon shut down. A major press inquiry followed, conducted by a man called Brian Leveson. It made a few recommendations, most notably for the reformation of the Press Complaints Commission, a body that is supposed to monitor and mediate complaints about the UK press. This body was fairly toothless. A new royal charter was proposed, but it does not have the support of most newspapers, who have not signed up to the new system. 

Ha and one other thing - although the NSA revelations have made quite a big splash over in the US, similar allegations against GCHQ in the UK have been greeted with a certain degree of indifference (although The Guardian, the newspaper that initially broke the story, has been constantly reporting updates).

I read your link, but I don't currently see a way to directly fund okpay from a card.. you can do it through liqpay, but they only support EUR and USD not GBP. If liqpay added GBP support that would be perfect for me, but I've found most bitcoin users are terrified of liqpay because it's Russian, so I'm not sure how many people would use that anyway, if it existed. It might be possible through some other intermediary such as MaysusFS? I might look into that, but it isn't a great user experience if you have to funnel money through not one but two intermediaries that all demand verification.

I don't know what Mr. Mastercard thinks of bitcoin, but I haven't seen any evidence of a coordinated campaign to shut down bitcoin services in the same way as has happened with UK based FP transfers. I also don't believe Mastercard was responsible for shutting down your cashplus account, regardless of whatever you may have been told (perhaps the way APS's business is setup they were the messenger, but not the origin).

Not *ever*.

Hell, if a youth product does amazing at another club, let's resign him. That's what Barcelona did with Pique, Fabregas, and Alba.

Suarez isn't an Ajax academy player. Let's make that much clear. He never spent a single year at their academy. He was brought in because he was banging out the goals the previous year at another eredivisie club.
I just used him to compare a striker to striker since their stats are more readily available. Kinda hard to compare LBs to LBs. Also, Zlatan is a product of Malmo, not Ajax.

The point is that the current EU is the product of a long continuous evolution of European Communities based on experience, and it's not like we've suddenly stumbled into the current situation. Let's not forget the reason we started down this road in the first place.

Sovereignty of nations is going to be one of the bigger issues of the coming decades, with ever closer interdependence for resources, trade, military, security and labour. The internet, too, will test national legal boundaries - as we've seen with the superinjunctions of a couple of years ago, and the position of the UK as the conduit between the US and major European intelligence communities. The EU is unlike any other supranational union, save perhaps for the UK/US Military/Intelligence relationship, where sovereignty of each nation's assets is secure, but a fairly free sharing of those assets is allowed to occur.

Part of the *point* of the European Communities is to take away some sovereignty on some level, in order that the events of 1914 and 1936 are prevented.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;LVG would bring someone in to play a DM slot rather than play bentaleb.

This is probably the most frightening thing to hear on this sub-that LvG's going to ""bring people in and make money moves"". 

What he's going to do is come here (hopefully), manage the club with the existing players while Baldini looks for a new left back in the summer, and then fuck off in one and a half years to his Portugal estate.

The thing is, his passion isn't for big signings, it's for bringing the U-21s into play. He picked Puyol as Barca's captain, and gave Xavi and Iniesta regular minutes. He started an 18 year old Mueller and moved Schweinsteiger off the bench. If anything, we're going to see more youth, not less.  What makes you think that someone as arrogant as him is all of a sudden is going to change? 

&gt;Be honest, do you want to see bentaleb in the starting 11 with the squad we have?

In a future where we have Van Gaal, why not? All precedence points to that direction. Bentaleb not only has a future at the bench, but possibly even the starting XI. 

&gt;They both need to go out on loan and prove their worth.

Harry Kane has been loaned four times in the last four years. He's pushing 21, so now is the time to start integrating into the first team. Bentaleb I'll concede, but I'm not convinced. Most people use him as a scapegoat to attack Sherwood's failure to utilize any sort of defensive mid, which is completely unwarranted. 

&gt;These two are so special that they can come right into our first team, especially if we want to be a top 4 side.

You sung praises of Carroll last week when we were having this same argument, but what has Carroll done to prove that he belongs in the first team over Bentaleb? Bentaleb is only 19, but he can run the entire 90 minutes at the top level. 

Tommy Carroll's fucked off to the Championship for what seems like forever. Do you think that Carroll is more eligible to start over the likes of Eriksen, Siggy and Holtby by that logic?

I agree that sovereignty is going to be an issue and perhaps the EU was always intended to take some sovereignty away from its members ( i agree about the trade being an intended deterrent to war). However, because of the convention that only Parliament can make or unmake British Law (see Dicey), the UK never recognised that the EU could do so. This is the source of the conflict. EU says 'you signed up for this'(handing over sovereignty), and the UK says 'we can't give you that power, so you can't have it'. 

Personally, observing as a Scottish law student (and therefore British where EU law is concerned), I believe the EU(well, the European bodies as a whole) is becoming too intrusive into our legal systems, especially considering the many cultural differences.

It's pretty fucking clear that you don't know what a deep lying playmaker is.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=deep+lying+playmaker

Someone like Holtby, Dembele, or even Paulinho as you hilariously mentioned, they don't fit this mould. Want a not so ""legendary"" example? Try Moutinho at Monaco. They set up people from the back, track back a fait bit, and occupy the DM spot. It's not my fault that the people I mentioned are legends, it's just that their function is damn near invaluable. 

Before we move on, let's establish that I've never said that Bentaleb can be a Busquets/Pirlo/Xavi/Superman, I just said that he's capable of playing that role. Since you don't know what a DLP's job on the pitch is and think that any midfielder can play it, who'd you have in mind for LvG's defensive mold, given that we're probably not going to sign a small country's worth of players? 

 &gt;but carol is better then bentaleb and shows a lot more promise.

Carroll, just like Bentaleb, has good and bad games. Bentaleb sticks out more because we've rarely played 4-3-3. His best game for us was exactly in the position I'm describing to you.

Great! Let's sell off Eriksen, Ade, Lamela, Soldado, all of the new signings too! After all, they are managing and listing the formations, tactics, etc., right? Oh, wait...

&gt;Tell me what has been so good about bentaleb other than passing backwards that makes you think he's good enough to be in this squad. 

See: Newcastle game. He didn't just pass backwards, but passed forward too. He made great runs down the middle, a key pass which split open their defense and allowed for Ade to score. Bentaleb was literally everywhere on the pitch that day, at a time when Paulinho, the one you'd put over Bentaleb as DM, disappeared on us. It's not even that, but he proved he can play well. Capoue effectively blocked passes in the middle. Bentaleb was right there, ready to pick it up, pass to the winger (At first Dembele, but he did well with Chadli too), and position himself for an attack if the left winger couldn't put in a good cross. That would probably explain why he hit the post during that match. 

Other than that? Any of his games against weaker opposition. Even in the Norwich game, he looked like the only one who gave a shit. Again he passed through the middle, again he serviced a toothless attack. Not his fault that our attack is toothless, but his job isn't to help in attack, it's to shift it between going backwards and forwards. 

tl;dr-he works great with a pure destroyer for the time being. Where they can't pass too well (because they really don't need to, frankly), he picks up the ball from them and goes forward, or expands the team's options to play wide. 

If this is Tim Sherwood's legacy, him and Kane, it's a nice parting gift because he's clearly prepping him for at minimum a bench spot next season. He's 19 and he's already adjusted to the tempo of a fast and physical league.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Incompetence is not the only issue. The reason they can have their headquarters elsewhere is because we want international businesses to be able to do business in the UK. If only UK businesses could provide goods and services in the UK our economy would be less competitive and customers would lose out because they would have fewer options. We have to let international companies do business in the UK if we want their services but equally we need to allow them to do their own accounting. If Starbucks UK has a bad year we want them to be able to pump money in to keep it afloat until it can be profitable again because we want their products. There are a multitude of legitimate reasons why companies should be able to move money in and out of the country not least because it's the private property of private citizens until time comes to pay your taxes. But if we allow them to move money where they need or want it it opens to door to them declaring profits elsewhere to avoid taxes. 

It's basically a choice between a small and uncompetitive economy that fucks consumers, tax avoidance or the government would need to control and limit what private people who own private companies can do with their money which in turn would cause companies to leave the UK and once again consumers get fucked. Now, the government may be able to come up with intelligent solutions which stops tax avoidance, protect international commerce AND means companies remain free enough to use their own money as they need but that's a tough problem it's not a black and white decision like most people seem to think.

Temper flaring, the scouser has to be restrained by his teammates to prevent all out fighting. The game resumes after Suarez stands back up but with a little difficulty. Again, Torres latches on a through ball, but is stopped by Gerrard who lunges in, two-footed, from behind. Red card in injury time. Lots od pleading, angry word from both sides.

It turns out the graduates have the toughest job market, well, ever right now - low wages and massive competition for jobs, plus they are now being charged massive amounts (to us) for university education.


Massive cuts are being made to public services - the police, NHS, Fire brigade, cost guard etc. Most of these services are saying they can't keep going as they are:

* The fire service is worried that it won't have enough resources to go to large calls or multiple calls at once as fire stations have been closed
* The NHS is now saying that it's nurses are at breaking point and patient care is suffering as a result; this in the wake of a few scandals about poor hospital care leading to unnecessary deaths
* the Government have told the police to cut their budgets, and the government have said that this won't affect the number of police on the streets, but the police chiefs are now saying it is affecting that figure, and the police are now at full stretch and might not be able to effectively respond to large scale public disorder any more.

The Coastal Search and Rescue role that has been handled by the RAF is being/has been privatised, and the contract has gone to an American company. Now the American company bit isn't an issue, I just thought I'd put it in for perspective.

It turns out that the Metropolitan Police Service (of London) has been actively trying to prevent a whistleblower from speaking out about the poor state of the service from the inside - racism, sexism, bullying by senior officers etc etc.

The police have also been accused across the country of ""under-recording"" crime at the order of the government. This means things like trying to record violent theft as just theft if no one was hurt, car theft as taking without consent etc etc. The government has also told police to ""dissuade"" people from reporting crimes if the police are unlikely to be able to solve the case. This includes sexual assaults.

So, it's not just the first choice. It's all 5 choices. Did you wilfully misrepresent that to make a point, or am I looking at the wrong thread?

Schools can be hugely variable in terms of quality, how easy they are to get to etc. Many parents do care about which school they their children go to. It can be upsetting not to get your first choice, or even any of your choices.

Being a mum can be isolating. Having an online forum to vent, rant, or ask advice is helpful. That is what this person is doing. They are asking advice about something material and important to them on a relevant forum.

The first was that they were not to be used on their Catholic neighbours. The second was to keep the shipment a secret lest another battalion get jealous.

I'm quite amazed at just how open the UVF and IVF operated at the time, whilst they never published a list of members (which in the case of the UVF is still held by the Unionist Council, although the Ulster Covenant would have been a good place to start) the papers of the day were quite happy reporting on the size of the forces that drilled, where they drilled and who were the local commanders.

Whilst tensions were high discipline was seemed to be well kept, I heard of one instance (I think occurred in Rostrevor), after war broke out, were the UVF whilst on parade to their drill ground received cheers from the IVF who fell in behind, and in turn got their own cheers when the UVF had reached their grounds and the IVF went on. Whether or not such good will would have been extended if war hadn't broke out is doubtful but it's strange to think how the assassination of a duke in the other end of Europe may have stopped a full scale civil war in Ulster.

Also it's quite paradoxical the reasons the two groups were set up, the UVF was set up to fight against Britain to stay with it, while the IVF was set up to fight with Britain to leave it.",0,1397718312,null,0,false,0,cguo9g4,t3_238s8w,t1_cguo9g4,t3_238s8w,null,1433393785,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

I'm in my third year as of right now, and it has proven to be  a mixed bag in terms of impact. I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool projects to help pay my way, but it has cost me substantially in terms of my ability to get through the program. My advice would be to make sure that you're really sorted in terms of funding so that you can concentrate on the course.

The application and interview process weren't anything special or unusual. I am one of the few students at the OII (and Oxford postgrad in general, it seems...) coming from the UK. I applied elsewhere in the UK, and the materials I had to prepare (personal statement, research proposal, three references) were all required for my other applications. One thing the OII required was an interview, which wasn't as tough as I had imagined it would be. In general you should expect to have your research proposal critiqued and to defend it. You should also have to explain verbally the questions computermacgyver has outlined below. Do you have further questions? Let me know.

What's your background? Do you consider yourself to have a disciplinary identity? What methods do you gravitate towards? These are some pretty fundamental questions that will shape your experiences applying and studying at the OII.

Childhood indoctrination distorts the lens you see the world through, before you have sufficient comprehension or intelligence to question it.  I think you'd probably agree that if I tell a child throughout the first eight years of its life, *""There IS a God!""* at eight it will accept it.

This is where the problem starts, because at that point the child **knows** there is a God.  Any opportunity to test this is then subject to a huge amount of confirmation bias.  This is a problem with a lot of things, but it's how our brains are wired.

Imagine that I'm investigating a murder.  I saw you do it, but for whatever reason the circumstances mean I can't use that evidence.  I **know** you did it.

I get a piece of evidence that says Bob had a really vicious argument with the victim **and** he was headed to their house right before the murder **and** he was seen on the Tube later splattered with blood.  I don't suspect or investigate Bob, because I **know** it was you.

That's not to say that that's what's going on here. It'd be just as reasonable to suggest that Mr. Cameron's new-found evangelical position is just placement in the early lead up to an election.

Skuld claims he was enforcing a policy on images, which still isn't made clear in the side bar, and which he admits isn't set in stone, but he also removed three posts that didn't break this policy on images.

A politician's term in office may be as short as four years.  Thatcher and Blair's stints as PM are quite anomalous in the length of time they were in office and in both cases the duration is more or less a decade.

You can argue a position anywhere between, *""They're amoral douchebags who'll say ANYTHING for votes!""* and *""A politician who doesn't accrue enough votes just doesn't get elected so they're as good as invisible!""*  The simple fact is appealing to the largest group who votes gets you the job and a disproportionately high percentage of older voters actually vote.

The solution is to get more young people, a **lot** more younger interested enough to vote.  Because when the young section of the electoral base turn out they'll get better representation.  *(Whether that's because the usual suspects start to pander to them, or because they're replaced by MPs whose position better reflects the position of younger voters.)*

Obviously if it did happen there's a good chance they wouldn't want to talk about it because it could be embarrassing, so I'm not going to rule out that it most definitely has never happened to them.

I also would disagree with the telegraph that it's the UN cherry-picking. I think it's more a feminist busybody looking for something to complain about who just happens to be with the UN. She even complained about something on tumblr about picture of women eating on trains.. which when I saw that someone made it genuinely made me feel like shit especially as a messy eater. But after delving into that subject it turns out it was set up to counter a tumblr about taking pictures of mens crotches in secret on public transport.

Have you noticed many reports recently about horsemeat in our food chain?  N,o because the FSA has done a pretty good job of recovering the situation even though, in common with equivalent agencies in Europe, they were caught out by a continent-wide case of fraud.

Other things that you won't read about are the FSA [shutting down illegal food processing facilities](http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Food-Safety/Man-convicted-of-running-4M-illegal-poultry-firm) which sell directly to fast food restaurants or [prosecuting for breaches in storage standards](http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/south-west/69831-23000-fine-taunton-meat-company) both of which pose a far greater risk to public health than the horsemeat debacle did.

Like all quangos the FSA have their problems, but ignoring the horsemeat scandal is not one of them.  Nor are they just focusing on what's trendy, this is simply what appears in the media because it is newsworthy.

It's also recently been renovated. There's a garden and stuff now.

The flats in the halls are fairly average. For a 5 bedroom flat there are 2 toilets (one with shower) and a good sized kitchen/lounge area.

Chances are, most of your flatmates will also be international students. Edinburgh has an insanely high foreign student rate compared to other uni's (I've heard that there's only 10% Scottish students but I don't know if that's true).

You'll need a few things handy when you're flat hunting. The first is around £700-1000 in cash for a deposit. It's not strictly first month's rent as deposit, but it's generally around that much. You'll also need an employment contract with your salary information (and they might ask for confirmation from your HR person). This isn't mandatory, but all the landlords I talked to asked for it. Third, you'll likely need a letter of recommendation from your previous landlord. So, let them know that you'll be asking for it.

Money gives a lot of privileges and advantages, and instructing an awesome, expensive legal team is one of them. An unfortunate reality of our economic positions is that not everyone can get 100% of their legal costs back in any legal action. This has applied to the civil courts for many years - typically you only get 60-80% of your legal costs, and even then they have to be proportional and reasonable. If you can afford to continue living within your means after winning a court case, the pressures of the climate I think justify the state NOT remunerating you for everything.

However, if you cannot afford it to the same extent, then it should be subsidised. If you don't have means to fight it then there should be protection for you, which currently isnt sufficient.

true,Raerth,cnty-england,London Town,"Look. Mods are not employees of reddit. We are not paid by reddit or anyone else. We all have full time jobs (or education) that we have to commit our time to. We became mods either by [creating the subreddit](/reddits/create), or by being invited by the creator. 

Sometimes people make hasty or poor judgements. Sometimes people have real life issues to take care of and see deleting the thread as simpler than checking the comments for 8 hours for the ""ALL MOSLIMS SHOULD DIE"" crew.

Of course we're not perfect, but we are honestly doing our best to allow people to talk about whatever they want, as long as the convo doesn't descend too far into the gutter.

We do all this not for money, not for e-peen, and definitely not for respect (ha!), but because we enjoy reddit. 

Personally, I've modded many diffferent subreddits over the years, from /r/Politics to /r/Gonewild, /r/Trees to /r/Juggling. I've stepped down from most because I either don't have the time anymore, or I just can't be arsed to deal with the constant abuse from the userbase.

If you think a subreddit is terrible, then creating or joining a new one is the best option. I have done that myself. Expecting the mods to be infallible is a pipedream. 

Believe me though, the mods here honestly want this sub to be a good place to visit. Take a step back from the blatant witchhunting and dramawhoring of the last day and get a bit of perspective.

&gt;__Received Pronunciation__ (__RP__) is the standard [accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(dialect\)) of [Standard English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English) in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), with a relationship to regional accents similar to the relationship in other European languages between their standard varieties and their regional forms.  RP is defined in the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary* as ""the standard accent of English as spoken in the [south of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_England)"",  although it can be heard from native speakers throughout England and Wales.   [Peter Trudgill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Trudgill) estimated in 1974 that 3% of people in Britain were RP speakers.

Someone can open a nightclub and set the music and door policy, which sets the tone for the club. However it's not the owner that makes a good club, it's the patrons. You need a good crowd of people there or it's an empty club.

Sometimes a club will be the first in a town and get popular just because there's lack of competition, but other clubs can open and if the first club is shit, people will leave to the new one.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Thank you for taking the time to reply, however, I think most people will be pretty disappointed by the response you have given. The whole point of this place is to promote discussion, and deleting several long ongoing discussions on an issue just because you don't have time to check every comment is a poor excuse. 

I saw all of those discussions and there was almost none of what you described, and what was there was downvoted quickly. There are over 70,000 people subscribed here, so obviously there is going to be a range of opinions, but that's a good thing. People were more upset with the censorship the issue than the image itself. 

I think many people will be genuinely surprised to hear you say that you censor posts and comments as you do, and will see it in a very negative light. Sometimes people get upset about what they see in society, some people are prejudiced against Islam, and they come on here and express that. They are almost always downvoted, because most people are tolerant and reasonable. That is the community in action, and it doesn't need you interfering with it.

Is this a tolerant community? or are you constantly deleting anything you view as intolerant, thereby changing the political/religious/social nature of the forum? I believed up until this point that this was a neutral forum, and the political/religious/social leanings of the forum reflected the general views of the people who posted here, but perhaps its not, perhaps the views of the forum are decided by the people who moderate it.

The compensation is for workers who are owed money from insolvent companies. Insolvency proceedings are long-winded and very complicated. There is usually in proceedings a 'ring fenced fund' which is 10% of the value of the assets and employees are given priority creditor status. Unfortunatly if there is a creditor with a charge on assets they take before employees, which sometimes means that employees are not paid their total salaries. It should be noted that this is capped per person.

In these situations, the government has a fund to make up the difference (which was only implemented as a result of EU Legislation by the way).

Therefore the company must have erroneously paid the OP, realised the mistake, are asking for it back and urging him to be remunerated by the proper procedure.

He was pretty clearly a troll like poster, with comments which were abusive, vitriolic or bigoted to one degree or another. To get an idea, see this post [from a thread below](
http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/180f65/banned_from_runitedkingdom_because_i_am/):

&gt; **I do not want to see men kissing each other in adverts on TV. I do not want to see gay men flirting with one another on TV. It's fucking disgusting to the majority of people in this country.**

&gt; **You are a socialist cunt though. Keep whining about the empire you little feminist shit.**

&gt; **My country is GREAT! You foreign cunt!**

He was eventually banned for repeatedly posting BNP-esque slogans without any elaboration. You'd have a normal thread on r/europe, and then at the bottom you have a comment from CaineFaraday which is literally just ""Britain for the British"", with 17 downvotes. It was pretty clear that these were posted mainly to get a rise out of other people, and it added nothing to the discussion. 

When challenged, I clearly remember CaineFaraday's main defense being that it was some sort of anti-BNP satire, and it was obvious to everyone that he was posting these sorts of slogans as a joke, which was a very odd response, and, to be frank, simply not true, especially given the general tone of his comments.

I don't know about r/unitedkingdom, but on r/europe we have specific rules against personal attacks, bigotry and troll behaviour, and this poster fell foul of some or all of those rules on numerous separate occasions.

Now, whenever some other issue with the moderators come around, either in r/europe or r/unitedkingdom, CaineFaraday is unfailingly one of the most upvoted posts, talking about being censored. To be honest, people need to exercise a little bit more scepticism about the claims which are made in threads like this. Not that there aren't genuine problems, but there are also plenty of people who were banned for valid reasons, and who simply continue to hold grudges.

1. Say you create a subreddit. You set the theme and rules and work hard to get it populated with early content. 

    People enjoy it, they join, they also contribute. After a while of careful cultivation it grows to a level where you're not submitting most content yourself, but is self-sustaining.

    Eventually it rises above 10,000 subscribers. Occasionally people join who don't read the rules, or who do nothing but troll. You remove these posts and keep on trucking.

    Your subreddit passes the point when most people have no idea who you are as a mod, or what you do. You remove a thread for being off-topic and the submitter gets angry. He calls out the mods, or submits to /r/SubredditDrama, or to another website. Says you're ruining his subreddit.

    People jump on this bandwagon and kick you out. Happy?

2. /r/Atheism discovers people can vote out mods, take aim at /r/Christianity.

    Maybe people think /r/ainbow is full of filthy homosexuals and decide to brigade and replace their mods.

Why? 

It seems that it works as intended. It's just that it often creates ""lowest common denominator"" content in larger subreddits, although not always. You might not like this but that is the purpose of reddit, why use reddit if you don't like the core concept? It seems what you want is what has been achieved on more conventional message boards and forums for years instead of trying to mould subreddits to your own personal vision?

I also read that one reason for your heavy-handed moddings is reposts and overly discussed thing. Surely you realise that this subreddit has lots of people and some might want to discuss things more than you or have not seen ""reposts"" because not everyone spends as much time browsing the sub as you.

Also, to be a bit pretentious, *Quis custodiet ipsos cusdoes*? It seems you are using your personal values and ideals to moderate and aren't really accountable to anyone. Your record in other subs suggests that this moves beyond questionable choices to downright censorship of certain topics that most people think are relevant to the subreddit.

Your rules are, perhaps, too vague and open to interpretation which allows you a lot of discretion. This can be a good thing but also makes it easy for mods to abuse their powers. A good example of strict moderation is /r/askhistorians, they are never accused of the behavior you are because there is a clear purpose of the subreddit and a strict set of rules that is always followed.

Of course he might not be but some of the topics he has been involved in censoring make his intentions very questionable.

http://dvmx.com/British_Muslim_Youth.pdf

I believe this is where the figures come from. What is actually says in there is markedly different to how it is shown in the telegraph

&gt;59% of Muslims would prefer to live
under British law, compared to 28%
who would prefer to live under sharia
law. 37% of 16-24 year olds prefer sharia
compared to 17% of 55+ year olds

So really we are looking at 40% of young Muslims which I think is a very important point. These are not immigrants but probably British kids who feel alienated in their own country. Because of this they turn look to their roots and feel a stronger connection to a country that perhaps has Sharia law. A less western country. The fact that over 55 the amount who believe it drops pretty steeply is very interesting. Most of the Muslims I know are through work and are above 25 so that may be why I do not see this apparently widespread dislike of Britain.

Unfortunately I cannot find where this poll was posted or how many people were asked. These are pretty crucial in working out whether the poll can be trusted or not. I'd agree though that the percentage of young radical Muslims is alarming, but I think it's not down to the fact they are Muslim. I think that if they were another religion they'd feel just as radicalised towards that due to that sense of not belonging here being there. It's something as a country we need to work on, not just criticise and believe it's just because they happen to follow a certain religion.

As for the American poll, it's very, very small and I'm not overly surprised. Would be interesting to see the demographics they used for it. I also wonder what the results would be if you were to ask say evangelical Christians in America the same question, but that's another matter really.

Honestly, I don't think they are in the minority. In fact, your first link would agree with me. 60% don't want Sharia law. Their views on homosexuality are very far behind, which appears to be, again, a British problem. Muslims in other parts of Europe are much more liberal than they are here.

I think it's very easy and intellectually quite lazy just to point the finger and go ""it's just Islam"" that's the issue, whereas the reality is in fact far more complicated.

I don't think anyone is trying to defend racism. You might not be aware but Skuld has been shown, pretty undeniably, to abuse his mod powers in other subreddits, this means that even if his moderation here has been perfect people will be uneasy about what he *might* do.

What people can and should do are very different things. Reddit is designed to have a democratic element (the upvote/downvote system).

Again. A lot of people are angry with specific moderators interpretation of the rules, not the rules or the subreddit as a whole.

Even if you do take that, the book itself may not be sufficient, or we may not understand it properly.

Creeds for instance are based on an understanding of the Bible, and as understanding or theology advances may change.

Because there are clear definitions. The fact that these are not the same as they ever were does not change their clarity at the present time.

&gt; Rather than just doing something for yourself you do something for your country and for the betterment of your people.

Not a bad ideal, I'm just no sure why people need patriotism to think of others though, and I'm not sure why it needs to be just for 'your people', and not people in general. Also, it sounds a little bit like socialism, which you whinge about later in the post.

&gt; One of the major problems today is that people are more concerned about what they can take from this country in welfare and Government programmes. What we need is to go back to the days when people did things for their community and their country.

Not to soapbox, but it seems most people who are taking from the country are those at the top, abusing tax laws and government influence, not those at the bottom. Perhaps they should think about what they should do for the country, and not put all the blame on those at the bottom?

&gt; Consumerism, diversity, multiculturalism, socialism and the mass media are turning our people into fat lazy scroungers and it draining us dry.

I'm not really sure how to address this, it really does sound like something from a BNP speech, blaming diversity and multiculturalism (basically foreigners), socialism and consumerism (strange contradiction) for our problems today. And, again, I'm not sure how patriotism would be the solution to this, unless you define patriotism as removing diversity, and controlling political beliefs of others and controlling the media.

&gt; I believe that Britain has the potential to be superior to all other nations. This country is a crippled lion that can rise again - one day.

And this is what too much patriotism makes you think. Britain is a country of 65 million people, and I don't quite understand how it could be superior to all other nations. I'm not saying people shouldn't be proud of where they come from, or what they've achieved, but suggesting such a small country has the potential to be superior to all the others does just sound delusional.

true,masok88,cnty-uk,London,"You guys heard of the about Jesus's response to the women caught in adultery though right? Or Jesus hanging out with the Samaritan women? Its somewhat disingenuous to at least not consider the implications of these passages if your wanting to pull up Christianity specifically.

Paul likewise doesn't advocate it in his letters . The only time (without reference) is in Ephesians where he tells kids to honour their parents and for parents to not exasperate their kids. In fact such a claim is ironic since Stephen the first Martyr was killed by stoning.

Please don't rail on me for using Wikipedia but I googled your claim and couldn't find an historical citation for it. In fact the Wikipedia page on stoning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning) details its usage in both Judaism and Islam but doesn't even mention Christianity except for 1 reference in article.

1) The Jewish practice of stoning prior to ""early-Christianity""

The only other reference is to an Iranian TV show depicting Jews stoning Christians.

I appreciate the article isn't authoritative but again I think its somewhat disingenuous to make a claim without making a Christian case for it. Even then just because some states in the US have the death penalty and some US legislators are Christians a case for capital punishment in Christianity does not make. 

The only reference I could find to early Christians and capital punishment is a quote from St Clement (a leader in the early Church)

""to witness a man's execution, regardless of the justice of his prosecution, is forbidden by the moral law of Christ."" (No citation unfortunately)

So please correct me if I'm wrong but I disagree with you on several points. Yes the verse is correct (a separate topic too) in a Jewish context - in a Christian context there are mitigating factors which I haven't explored that mean this verse is very much part of a historical narrative of the faith but one that hasn't ever been active for those who call themselves Christians.

I agree that there needs to be rules and the mods need to delete some stuff. The question is what should they delete?

/u/Skuld has a record of censoring things that are relevant to the subreddit and doesn't break any rules.

It often starts of as being allegory and open to interpretation; many sects assume their texts to be divinely inspired works of humans.

&gt; if you have to keep interpreting it, and keep getting different, sometimes contradictory interpretations then what is the point of using the text to begin with? 

Assuming for the moment that there is a God (which you sort-of need to do in this kind of discussion) it's because the texts document the human side of the beginning of a relationship with God who humans don't yet fully understand.

It's about a shared effort with people of your culture.

&gt;Also, it sounds a little bit like socialism, which you whinge about later in the post.

Socialism is about control and centralising power with committees. What I advocate is a better society based on good people being good because they love their country and their people, not because the Government tells them they have to act a certain way.

&gt;Not to soapbox, but it seems most people who are taking from the country are those at the top, abusing tax laws and government influence, not those at the bottom. Perhaps they should think about what they should do for the country, and not put all the blame on those at the bottom?

Many rich people do betray their country. People from al classes do it in a number of different ways. I would as far as to say almost everyone puts themselves first in today's society.

&gt;I'm not really sure how to address this, it really does sound like something from a BNP speech, blaming diversity and multiculturalism (basically foreigners), socialism and consumerism (strange contradiction) for our problems today.

Multiculturalism is an attempt to make foreign culture equal to British culture and by extension aims to destroy pride in being British. The biggest advocates of multiculturalism are ethnically British.

Socialism and consumerism are not contradictions. Consumerism is turning people into ignorant sheep.

&gt;And, again, I'm not sure how patriotism would be the solution to this, unless you define patriotism as removing diversity, and controlling political beliefs of others and controlling the media.

Patriotism is about educating people about the dangers of these ideologies.

&gt;And this is what too much patriotism makes you think. Britain is a country of 65 million people, and I don't quite understand how it could be superior to all other nations.

Are you sure? The voting system as designed isn't used as such. Voting is supposed to be on comment quality and contribution, but as said elsewhere this is rarely the case, instead fermenting a popularity based syndrome where lowest common denominator posts winout. While LCD gives Reddit a very democratic fuzzy feeling, it does make, eventually, for poor quality unless this is otherwise stifled through moderation (as in /r/AskHistory, /r/askscience).

&gt;For example moderators who delete things that follow the rules but disagree with their political beliefs are damaging the subreddit in a different, but just as damaging way as shitposts and memes do.

I agree that moderators should stick to the policy they prescribe on the sidebar. But at the end of the day, this sub is owned by the mods. Whatever policy they wish to implement is up to them. If we don't like it, we can soon create a new sub with different moderation ideals.

I realise ITT contains massive amounts of Skuld bashing. But the way I see it, this sub is one of the best, and Skuld plays a large part in ensuring that. If anything, I am grateful. To be perfectly honest, I would be happy with MORE moderation - to ensure quality of discussion and variance of sources. I don't care what Skuld gets up to in the cesspit that is /r/technology.

I don't think it is 'most'.

&gt;so either it is and you need to take it all at face value ""as true today as when it was written"" -or- that things in it can be found to be false and are relegated allegory or ignored completely when it does not suit the current climate, it cannot be both.

Yes, most religious people take one position or the other.

&gt; The problem is that if it is the latter then people will pick and choose and you get no true scotsmans everywhere, so why bother even saying you belong to [insert religion] when there is no clear definition of what [insert religion] is?

Because you don't join a religion in order to be a member of a club, it's based on a shared set of beliefs, heritage, culture and suchlike. It's not like joining a working men's club despite being opposed to the bar closing at 10pm.

&gt; this becomes especially annoying when people say they'll persecute X people or wont do Y because [insert religion] tells them that is what they need to do to be a good member of [insert religion]
&gt;
&gt; It seriously is like handing someone a blank check on morality and saying 'go nuts, just rationalize it with your self by saying that your particular brand of [insert religion] says you have to do it in order to get [insert reward] in the afterlife'

I don't know who is doing the handing there, but it's *much* more like one group of people have their well-defined set of beliefs and rules and a subset of that group reexamine their foundation and come to a different conclusion as to the intended meaning and consequence of the foundations.

Because that's not how they're viewed by the people whose motives you were questioning. I'm going through a particularly non-cynical phase at the moment, so pardon me if I've mistaken atheist proselytism for genuine interest, but if you want to know what ""the point of using the text to begin with [is]"" then you need to attempt empathy with those people who use it; you can't treat it in isolation and expect to come across a reasonable answer.

If you do have some interest in this beyond being some apostolistic atheist you'll find it far easier to empathise and therefore understand what drives people of various religions if you notice what their views are based on and grant them a litle suspension of disbelief; from an outsider's perspective it's little different to how fans of science fiction series view their respective universes.

&gt; it is the like being in an English class where the tutor is insisting that the author used the color blue for the curtains to foreshadow or give some sort of deeper meaning, when in fact if you asked the author he'd say it means the curtains are blue. 

It depends on the text; in some text (especially poetry) that sort of detail *is* there to convey some meaning or set a scene with some particular atmosphere. In others it isn't.

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"&gt;The Islamic Sharia Council based in Leyton, East London, is the largest Sharia body in the UK. Sheikh Haitham al-Haddad is a board member and its representative:

&gt; “a man should not be questioned why he has hit his wife, because this is something between them”.

&gt;  “it is consensus of all scholars that female circumcision is sunnah [proper]“.

&gt; He endorses child marriage and has said that in Islam there is no minimum age for marriage. Rather, the marriage of children should be at their parents’ discretion (although he qualified this by advising “the earlier, the better, especially for girls. But you have to be careful of the legal, yaani [you know], issues”.

&gt; He has also recommended that children be married off during their GCSE’s (aged 15-16).

If anyone was still asking about Islam and integration - IMO, this is the worst example of a failure in this regard.

These remarks show a backward step for some in our society, in some cases rights that have been fought and argued for and won here a long time ago are being put into jeopardy.  The people put at risk by these courts are people who have been isolated from UK culture and language, and are brought up to respect these courts as being the true law.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; It's about a shared effort with people of your culture.

And why not a shared effort with people in general? This might be considered a slippery slop argument, but when you discriminating by culture, you're also setting out a precedent for people you won't help because of their culture. What would be stopping me, for example, from saying I don't want to help people on the dole, as they have a workshy culture? At the end of the day, culture divides are essentially arbitrary, and the more we adhere to them and try to keep cultures separated, the further those divides grow.

&gt; Socialism is about control and centralising power with committees. What I advocate is a better society based on good people being good because they love their country and their people, not because the Government tells them they have to act a certain way.

Not necessarily. Socialism, at it's heart, is about people working together for the betterment of the people, not doing stuff just for the profits or for themselves. It doesn't require the government to seize the means of production, or to centralise everything, although that's likely what a socialist government would do. It seems what you envision lots of patriotism achieving, people being good and doing good things because they love their country, is very similar to the results of socialism.


&gt; Many rich people do betray their country. People from al classes do it in a number of different ways. I would as far as to say almost everyone puts themselves first in today's society.

This may be true, but I'm not sure how patriotism would solve this. Back in the days when Britain had a massive Empire, and patriotism was probably at it's peak, you still had plenty of people who were selfish, people who only looked out for themselves. Patriotism isn't a quick solution to stop inequality and hardship.

&gt; Multiculturalism is an attempt to make foreign culture equal to British culture and by extension aims to destroy pride in being British. The biggest advocates of multiculturalism are ethnically British.

Rubbish. Multiculturalism is a word thrown around a lot, and I'm not sure anyone really knows what it means. However, I can confidently say it isn't a plot to destroy British pride, and I'm not sure how viewing some foreign cultures as equal is a bad thing. British culture isn't superior just because it is British.

You also haven't explained how you think diversity is a problem.

&gt; Socialism and consumerism are not contradictions. Consumerism is turning people into ignorant sheep.

You don't really explain how they are not contradictions. Consumerism is about individualism, and working to better yourself, whereas socialism is about the community, and working to better that community.

&gt; Patriotism is about educating people about the dangers of these ideologies.

How is it? I can think of plenty of examples where people have used patriotism, and nationalism, to remove freedoms and discriminate against those different to them, but not too many where people have used patriotism to promote freedom and diversity.

&gt; This country was never the biggest or most populous nation on earth, yet we've managed great things in the past.

Part of that was through exploiting colonies in Africa and Asia, and exploiting the workforce in the UK. The world is a fairer place now. If, for example, China didn't want to trade with us today, we couldn't group up with some other Europe countries and invade to force them to. What facilitated our dominance in the past is no longer an option today.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"Of course I wouldn't like to be, it sounds pretty awful. It's also pretty awful to be the victim of a crime (eg sexual abuse, or whatever he was accused of).

I think the difference in our views is that I see the presumption of innocence as having two parts. There is the courts' legal responsibility to presume innocence, which is basically intact and not under question (would you agree? I don't think anonymity is *required* to be presumed innocent in a court setting). There is also society's responsibility to presume innocence.

There is a contract between the people and the state in any democratic society that both will hold up democratic values. The most obvious of these is the vote: the state promises to hold elections and transfer power peacefully, and the people promise to actually scrutinize and vote with their heads for which people they believe are most adequate to govern. They promise to put themselves up for the job if they believe none others are up to the task. Similarly, the state promises to hold independent courts and presume each defendant not guilty. Society must also promise to do the same thing.

Synergy between state and society values are necessary for a healthy democracy. Think about Egypt - it had a democratic state (an elected president, a parliament...), but not a democratic society. Because the elected head of state - who might not have been the most tasteful elected head of state - who was elected in elections deemed fair and free was toppled by the military and this was basically seen as fine except by the presidents' supporters (who would never have seen it as fine). If a society does not hold the same democratic values as the state, the society needs to adopt them.

If people are not capable of seeing somebody in a court dock and not assuming he's guilty immediately with no due process required, then that is a big problem with society. The courts don't need to change, the people need to educate themselves and be educated on the legal court processes. Granting the defendant anonymity in these cases simply patches over a crack, *it does not deal with the underlying problem that people don't understand one of the most important processes in our society*.

If I have nothing in common with somebody I don't see why I should care.

&gt;Socialism, at it's heart, is about people working together for the betterment of the people, not doing stuff just for the profits or for themselves. It doesn't require the government to seize the means of production, or to centralise everything, although that's likely what a socialist government would do. It seems what you envision lots of patriotism achieving, people being good and doing good things because they love their country, is very similar to the results of socialism.

It always results in centralising of power. No socialist society has ever managed to achieve what you say it aims to achieve.

&gt;This may be true, but I'm not sure how patriotism would solve this. Back in the days when Britain had a massive Empire, and patriotism was probably at it's peak, you still had plenty of people who were selfish, people who only looked out for themselves. Patriotism isn't a quick solution to stop inequality and hardship.

It was better then than it is today.

&gt;Rubbish. Multiculturalism is a word thrown around a lot, and I'm not sure anyone really knows what it means. However, I can confidently say it isn't a plot to destroy British pride, and I'm not sure how viewing some foreign cultures as equal is a bad thing. British culture isn't superior just because it is British.

British culture, whether you think it is superior or not, is still our culture and it should never put dragged down to the same level as immigrant cultures.

&gt;You also haven't explained how you think diversity is a problem.

It's just a leftist way of justifying immigration and multiculturalism.

&gt;You don't really explain how they are not contradictions. Consumerism is about individualism, and working to better yourself, whereas socialism is about the community, and working to better that community

Consumerism is an obsession with buying things for the sake of having things. It destroys the very fabric of society. Capitalism and consumerism are not the same thing.

This is a country obsessed with mobile phones, clothes, shoes, celebrities and fast food. This is a sick country.

&gt;How is it? I can think of plenty of examples where people have used patriotism, and nationalism, to remove freedoms and discriminate against those different to them, but not too many where people have used patriotism to promote freedom and diversity.

I don't want to promote diversity.

&gt;Part of that was through exploiting colonies in Africa and Asia, and exploiting the workforce in the UK. 

Not really. This country has a great history that pre-dates the Scramble for Africa.

&gt;The world is a fairer place now. If, for example, China didn't want to trade with us today, we couldn't group up with some other Europe countries and invade to force them to. What facilitated our dominance in the past is no longer an option today.

To be superior to other countries does not mean that we have to pull our weight in the world, it does not mean we even have to engage with the world.

Courts and justice routinely favour women, giving them lighter sentences for the same crimes and giving them custody of children far more often than men despite often being unsuitable compared to the father.
Women are doing far better than men in education, despite this there are still programs promoting women for university schemes.

Oh, and also the recent ""anti-rape"" campaigns, exclusively targeting men, saying that having sex with a drunk woman is rape.

I have yet to see the same attention given to women, telling them not to have sex with drunk men, lest they become rapists.

And of course the endless domestic abuse campaigns, men are domestically abused just as much if not more than women, yet they receive nowhere near as much media coverage or help, and the justice system very rarely prosecutes a woman for abusing her husband/boyfriend.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"I wrote a full reply to you last night but I must have forgotten to post it. Dumb. Brief summary of what my points where:

Branding: Starbucks first UK franchise opened in Feb 2013. All other stores are wholly owned by them and they intend for the franchises to remain only a small fraction of total UK presence. I have no issue with branding being billable for genuine franchises but you simply cannot franchise something to yourself. IMHO there needs to be clear definitions in law requiring genuine separation between companies. As it stands this aspect *may* be legal but it's touch and go as other successful prosecutions have been brought in the past on those who created shell corps to cook the books. There was a big one on VAT a few years back plus a google brings up ""Roderick Smith"" from 2007. What they did as individuals is the same as what Starbucks is doing as a corporate entity i.e. maintaining accounts which they claimed were not connected to them. Why should there be a disparity?

Billing: they ""buy"" beans from a shell company in Holland, which fraudulently inflates the price so as to disguise UK profits, literally as you describe it in your Tippex example, the prices is specifically set to wipe out UK profits, there's probably even a direct correlation between their annual UK sales forecasts/costs &amp; the fake price paid for consumables. In an HMRC audit they will not accept this between me and my Ltd Co, all my costs have to be genuine. For example, if I work at home I cannot bill myself beyond market rate for the use of space or my power consumption. I cannot create a company in Luxembourg and sell myself floppy disks at £10,000 a piece. 

""In order to commit fraud you must make a false representation that you know to be untrue or misleading."": this is not true for fraud claims. With financial fraud there are very rarely actual ""lies"", everything is reported exactly as it is. The fraud derives from the structuring of whatever scam it is so as to fool someone without outright lying to them. More of a ""mens rea"" sort of thing. That aside, Starbuck's claims of the cost of beans from the Netherlands *is* an untrue or at the very least ""misleading"" statement.

Everyone on reddit says this is ""obvious"", but I've tried looking up statistics in the past and the picture doesn't seem to be very clear.  Women are far more likely to win custody nowadays (that wasn't the case long ago, when both the wife and kids were considered to be the man's property), but they are also far more likely to want custody in the first place, less likely to give up part way through the process, less likely to make a non-serious attempt at gaining custody (to try and win concessions in a divorce settlement or whatever), and less likely to have committed domestic violence, which obviously isn't looked upon favourably by the courts.  It really does seem to be very difficult to tease out all of these factors and the reasons for them and come to a clear understanding of which gender, if any, is favoured.

&gt; criminal justice system

That one is even more complicated.  When there are such extreme correlations between the likelihood of committing and being a victim of various crimes and your gender, it's kind of hard to compare how the system treats male and female victims, suspects and convicts.  Though the judges and top police officers and lawyers are still overwhelmingly men, so it's obvious that the system isn't uniformly biased against men.

&gt; divorce courts

Again, this seems pretty doubtful.  There are lots of men's rights sites insisting that divorce rulings systematically favour women, but every non-MRA site I have found presents a far less certain view.

&gt; education system

I'm not sure what you mean by that?  Clearly men aren't as strongly encouraged to go into teaching as women, but those that do tend to be far more likely to be promoted to senior roles than women.  I'm not aware of any big gender disparities as far as the pupils are concerned, except that girls tend to have fewer sporting opportunities.",0,1397743944,null,0,false,0,cgutz9w,t3_2397fy,t1_cgutz9w,t1_cguqbea,null,1433396545,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

There is nobody in the world you have nothing in common with, and plenty of people in this country you have little in common with. Just because someone isn't exactly like you, doesn't mean you shouldn't care about them.

&gt; It was better then than it is today.

You'd rather live in a country where the working classes live and work in horrible conditions, often being a wage packet away from starvation and death, where everyone is at risk from diseases we have eradicated or reduced the risks of today, where many didn't have the right to justice or access to democracy? Take off the rose tinted glasses mate, I would much rather live today than in any other period in history. 

&gt; British culture, whether you think it is superior or not, is still our culture and it should never put dragged down to the same level as immigrant cultures.

It isn't dragging down British culture, it is simply not viewing other cultures as inferior just because they are different. 

&gt; It's just a leftist way of justifying immigration and multiculturalism.

Ignoring the fact that there is already a lot of diversity between people native to Britain you're ignoring, are you suggesting to someone not wanting everyone to look, think and act the same is simply a way to justify immigration and multiculturalism? Rubbish.

&gt; Consumerism is an obsession with buying things for the sake of having things. It destroys the very fabric of society. Capitalism and consumerism are not the same thing.

You still haven't addressed how Consumerism and Socialism aren't at contractions with one another. It has nothing to do with capitalism. 

&gt;  This is a country obsessed with mobile phones, clothes, shoes, celebrities and fast food. This is a sick country.

And, again, how would patriotism stop that? Have you forgotten the patriotic circlejerk the media has around things like the monarchy?

&gt; I don't want to promote diversity.

Can't say I'm surprised. This is why people are suspicious of too much patriotism, because often it turns from 'I want this country to be more patriotic' to 'I want less people who aren't like me around'. The push for patriotism in some seems intrinsically linked with a push bigotry and discrimination.

&gt; Not really. This country has a great history that pre-dates the Scramble for Africa.

For most of it's history, the British Isles can't be considered to have a great history. Interesting, don't get me wrong, but until the 1700s Britain, or its constituent countries really didn't have much influence over the events in Europe, compared to other countries like France or Spain. Britain can only really be considered to be a major power in the 1800s and 1900s, a time when Britain did exploit a lot of countries in the world. This doesn't ignore the things Britain did well, like the technological gains which fuelled industrialisation, but to claim Britain would have been world dominant without some sort of exploitation quite simply isn't true. 

Again, I'm not saying everything Britain did can be put down to exploitation, and that we should necessarily feel guilty for it now, but that was a major part of our rise to power.

I think someone will eventually play ball, but the infrastructure around Bitcoin needs to develop more, its a risk factor atm, and the banks that are along the lines of ""hmm, maybe.."" want to see less risk factor.

Though in other countries they do see that wire transfers are safe (with lloyds they have a nice security system when doing wire transfers).

But to be honest, some 'higher' ups in the banking world I've chatted to have given across the impression that they know quite well what Bitcoin is capable of, and they don't want to assist its growth at all.

But as you say, someone will play ball eventually, then the rest will follow, as whichever bank decides to accept Bitcoin businesses first will reap the most reward.

And therein I believe lies the answer, once infrastructure is a bit more solid in the UK and business/individual adoption has grown a bit more, then the banks will start to see the 'almighty profit' in it.

For the last few seasons we were the butt of all jokes and now were on the verge of winning the big consensus is that others fans don't want us to win because we'll be unbearably smug - well honestly, fuck them because we would have achieved something any team would be proud of and after all the banter and shit we've been given we deserve to be smug for once.

The one thing that really annoys me is all the 'ITT: Liverpool fans' or 'Here come the Liverpool fans' or any other general complaints about liverpool fans commenting in other match threads, it's gotten to the point where the majority of the top comments in pre/post match threads are these complaints.
