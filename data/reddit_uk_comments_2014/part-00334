I can't agree with this. I think Pellegrini knows exactly what he's getting when he puts Toure in 'defensive' mid. He knows Toure won't do much defending but his attacking abilities are utilised more often when he's in a deeper position, so against most opponents (more so in previous seasons than this season) we can afford to be a bit light in the defensive side of midfield.

My aunt goes to London quite a bit for work too, so for a few years (even before I started supporting), I had been building a small collection of West Ham items after every trip.

I do have a confession though, the only match I've ever seen in person was at Millwall. I saw Leicester at Millwall on a high school trip years ago. I'm planning this spring to make up for that by getting to the Boleyn Ground for a game.

&gt;Honestly the linked report is just from one vendor, the same story repeats across them all. Your silly hand-waving doesn't mean shit.

It doesn't prove your assertion whatsoever, though. If you need to attack me personally for that, then by all means do so. However that still doesn't alter the facts. It is quite an obvious thing. There have been a lot of trojans written since the dawn of time. You'd need to have over 50% of said malware installing itself automatically and thus without user interaction for your original statement to be true. The rate of which detected automatically installed malware (of which you limited to trojans and rootkits) is blocked is a subset of automatically installed malware which is a subset of malware. Each parent set is bigger than its child, but it is precisely how much bigger what we are arguing over.

As the attack vectors used by malware are numerous and varied, and they always have been. They've come through installers, infected executables, drive-by downloads, vulnerabilities, etc, it would be extremely unlikely that coming through such a diverse range, that the majority use a single non-interactive installation vector.

Since you cannot adequately prove your point, I will help you out by proving mine...

It would be restricted to small items obviously, which already limits the items offered for delivery.

I've generally only seen it suggested for prompt delivery, again surely that's a limiting factor. I can't think of many items I would need within a relatively short time frame that I could not simply get up and buy from a 'traditional' shop. As idea of drone deliveries seems to be limited to larger urban areas, I'm not actually sure it's providing a service that an urban area's is lacking. 

Take my purchase of a dustpan and brush yesterday as an example, a relatively small and light item. Generally things like that I get from online retailers as I've planned ahead and you can pretty much guarantee they will be as cheap as if not cheaper than the high street and probably of better quality. 
Problem is, I smashed a glass and hadn't planned ahead. I needed that dustpan brush asap. If a drone could deliver in say 2 hours, that's all well and good. But it took me 10 minutes to walk to the shop, buy one and clean up. Sure, it might not be as good a product but then again I didn't have to have broken glass knocking about for 1 hour 40 mins. 

Perhaps a stupid example, but it's the best I can do to explain it. I don't believe a problem has been solved by the offer of drone delivery.

Not to mention the obvious issues with crowded airspace, emergency aircraft, security and so on.


For items needing to be delivered promptly, I genuinely see 3D printing as a more realistic alternative. Take the article you posted for example;
&gt; “Logistical issues with moving keys around at short notice has prompted thinking about the most efficient solutions - congestion makes it very difficult to get keys or small parts to an engineer the other side of London if there is an emergency""

Again, don't know much about 3D printing but surely it would be far less problematic to send a copy of the keys to the other side of London and have them printed. At leas that seems like an easier solution that building, maintaining and paying for a small aircraft to fly them there physically. Obviously 3D printing comes with a whole new set of issues security concerns and drawbacks.

I think Chelsea are unlucky to have their CL win attributed solely to Abramovich's billions by everyone, it's every bit as impressive as our 2005 CL win in my book.

Just think about it. They needed a huge performance from Drogba (who, remember, was well past his best) against Valencia to get through the group stage. Then they went 3-1 down against a Napoli side featuring Cavani, Lavezzi and Hamsik.

They then binned their £13m manager and appointed a club legend whose career highlight as a manager was securing second in the The Championship with West Brom. His career lowpoint was probably getting replaced by Roy Hodgson.

They then forced extra time in the second leg thanks to goals from club legends Didier Drogba, John Terry and Frank Lampard, at which point Branislav Ivanovic, the £9m Serbian utility man, sent them through.

They then beat Benfica home and away, despite being outplayed over both legs, needing a deflected goal from Raul Meireles in stoppage time to assure progression.

Then came Guardiola's Barcelona, led by Messi in his 91-goal prime. Again, they were outplayed, but managed a scrappy goal and a clean sheet in the first leg. At the Camp Nou, against the CL holders, they went a man and two goals down. Ramires scored, Messi missed a penalty, and running joke Fernando Torres scored the most unlikely goal of his career to kill the game and put Chelsea through to the final.

Chelsea, who in the meantime had finished below Newcastle in sixth, were missing Meireles, Ivanovic and Terry through suspension, and had to field Ryan Bertrand on the wing and Bosingwa at RB against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena. Thomas Muller scored in the 83rd minute, and instead of moping off, Chelsea won a corner as a result of Torres's other notable contribution that season, from which Drogba scored the equalizer.

In extra time, Drogba cocked up (like he did in Moscow four years previously), giving away a silly penalty that was saved by Cech. This forced a shootout, where Drogba, on the pitch to take penalty five (he was down to take five in Moscow, but got sent off. Terry took it, missed, and united won the CL) scored with what seemed to be the last kick of his Chelsea career.

People are saying that the current system doesnt work, that it needs changing, but instead of actually pushing for reforming the system and making changes, they decide to further complicate the matter and add even more bullshit into the equation which will just end up costing far more money than it would save.

It is like saying that someones Kidneys are failing and, instead of treating the failing kidneys, the doctors put the guys legs in plaster casts and say he's cured! 

The only type of major change i would support somewhat is the largest cities in the UK being given a mayoral post like London.

Why would I support this and not other things?

because adding in a Mayor adds in only a very small amount of bureaucracy and it is very easy to keep an eye on them as it is essentially the mayor and a small team added on to the local council.

Mayors may be a good thing. Regional assemblies and/or an English parliament would be pure wastes of space and money.",0,1415402880,null,0,false,0,clw6qg5,t3_2kzajk,t1_clw6qg5,t1_cltoey4,null,1426135708,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm guessing you don't have much time on your hands so you'll need to make a few £'s the easy way. Try selling some of your uneeded belongings on Gumtree, Ebay or Amazon. You could net £50 or £'s to keep you going. 

Also, I'd spend a few mins each day looking for free food promos that companies do for promotion. Hot Deals had a free pizza coupon the other day. 

Can you buy cheaper tobacco to keep you going until you don't have a uni deadline to focus on  and you can go cold turkey? 

Remeber to buy nutritious food (Google that stuff) with your remaining money. Your brain runs better and builds itself on nutrients. You'll need all the brain power you can get for your uni work. Frozen veg is usually cheaper than fresh veg. About-to-expire meat is cheaper and can be frozen and cooked some other day - just inspect it on the day you buy it to ensure its not gone stale. Dried rice is cheap. Potatoes are nice and cheap too. Bread doesn't have much nutritional value but can fill in the gaps. 

If you have a sweet tooth buy Sainsburys basics chocolate or sweets. I haven't tried them but some entrepreneurial girls in Camden use all Sainsburys basics stuff to make fudge and cookies then sell them at a premium price in Camden market. This is to say, the taste of Basics is probably not that bad and is doable for a few weeks.

Final thoughts: you didn't mention this but try your best to avoid pay day loan companies. Their interest rates border on criminal and will hit your wallet hard.

I'm sure half the reason for why a fucking bus is never on time is because the bus drivers don't leave when they're supposed to. Too busy pissing around smoking a cigarette or arguing with another customer. 

Oh yeah, and they will happily let you get onto a bus paying a fair when there is a cheaper one they could have offered you. I really fucking hate bus drivers and if one of them speaks to me or another customer rudely, they can expect to get treated like absolute shit from me.

I don't give a fuck if it's a hard job being a bus driver, that's not an excuse.

I haven't seen the Planetarium show there, so can't say if it's worth the money, but the museum's quite interesting if you're into History of Science. If you like historic buildings, head back down to the Royal Naval College - it's the bit where some of Les Miserables and Thor: The Dark World were filmed.

Love the Natural History Museum, and personally think it's worth seeing for the building alone. Also in that neck of the woods, you've got Kensington Gardens (Albert Memorial, Peter Pan Statue, Princess Diana Memorial thingy) and the Albert Hall. You've missed The Proms, but there might be [something else on you'd want to see](http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/default.aspx).

Agree with the recommendation for the Southbank for culture, (and also the London Eye and the Aquarium) but if you want cheap theatre tickets and don't particularly mind what you see, head to the [Leicester Square Ticket Booth](http://www.tkts.co.uk/leicester-square/) as they often have good deals on tickets for that night if you head down there in there in the afternoon.

false,xu85,null,null,"Wow, what an unbelievably misleading chart. A cursory glance might indicate the UK has ""average"" numbers on non-nationals, but let's examine from left to right. 

Luxembourg and Cyprus. Well Lux in basically a non entity of a country, let's be honest. Probably German/Belgian/French expats. It has a population the size of Brighton - 500,000.

Cyprus .. I presume that's because half the country is divided and Turks are living in the north. The rest are probably wealthy retired Brits with summer properties. Population is the same a Birmingham, 1M.

Next up, Latvia and Estonia. These are basically fully assimilated 3rd/4th/5th generation Russians, who decided to keep their Russian citizenship after the Soviet Union was dissolved. They aren't really migrants.

Now, Ireland - a sparsely populated country which probably has lots of NI/UK passport holders living there through family connections. Some Eastern European people too. OK. Population 1/10th of the UK.

Austria - they're German with a few ex-Yugoslav migrants and Turks. This is the largest country of the list so far, with a population of about 8 million (London - or 14% of the UK)

Now, Belgium. Historically a divided country, there'll be a Dutch and French passport holders everywhere, with a few non-EU nationals. A densely populated country. 

Spain has 6 million foreign-born people living there most are from Romania, Morocco, the UK and south America. They have a pop of 45M but roughly a third of the population density that the UK does at 240.

The only comparable country on this chart you've provided is Germany, with what looks like a 6% non-national population (Turks i'm guessing) and a few % EU (Brits, Poles, French I suppose). *BUT*, while Germany has a higher population (80M) and a higher area (357km2), the UK is 65M/242km2, you must remember that the spread of population is fairly even all over Germany. Pretty much all of their land is habitable and comfortable and the wealth is spread evenly. Now Scotland, Wales and N.I make up 48% of the area of the UK, but they are not taking an even share of migrants, the majority are in *England*, which has a area of 130km2. And on top of that, most are in the *southern* because the north is economically depressed. No immigrant is settling in the Scottish highlands, Scotland has had a natural not artificial rise in population over the last 100 years. This is a key factor which the graph ignores. Wales has no industry and attracts no migrants. NI has almost none, it's 98.5% white British as of the 2011 census.

I don't want to go through the rest of the chart, but France also a similar population but a lot more space than us. Italy has a wealth divide (north/south), but i'm not sure what migration they are receiving. Sweden has a very low population (the size of London) and loads of space, but yes mostly only the south is populated, and they are having problems with migrant influxes. Sweden Democrats, the Swedish UKIP, currently hold 14% of the seats in the parliament. Unthinkable 15 years ago.

Liechtenstein is a non-entity and Switzerland has always had a multi-cultural multi national presence (French/German/Swiss). Obtaining Swiss citizenship is also very difficult and cumbersome, much harder than other European countries. You need 12 years permanent residency for a start. 

I want to add in some other factors too. The UK is also on the edge of Europe making it that much more of a challenge to go back and forth, compared to a country in central Europe receiving migrants from neighbouring countries. The majority of EU citizens learn English as an additional language, making the UK a natural destination for any EU citizen. Even if the competence is basic, it's a foundation that can only be improved upon. The UK is also doing best economically out of all the EU countries at the moment, with one of the lowest unemployment rates, again compounding the issue. The UK is also one of the least xenophobic/racist countries in the EU, and has welcomed people from all over the world, making migrants feel more welcome and increasing the pull factor. The weather is mild and hospitable compared to say Scandinavia. The UK is also not in the failing Eurozone, making us a destination for foreign capital as well as labour. The UK also has a good welfare state, housing/child benefit is very generous, as is essentially free and good quality healthcare via the NHS. Education is also world-class, meaning people want their kids educated here.

false,rainbowscooter,null,null,"Just a thought, is there anything stopping you from buying a house just now? 
I ask because if you're canny about it, buying a buy-to-let property can give you one of the highest returns on your money. The rent income should cover the mortgage and allow you to build up a profit each month.
BUT you can't get a buy-to-let mortgage on your first property usually so if you're able and willing to buy your first property, and you want to get a good return on your savings, then if you can afford to buy your first property, you could do that and then move on to a buy-to-let property.
Obviously you'd need to make sure you're buying in a popular area for rental, and if the property needs a bit of work it's worth investing a little in a basic refurb to get better returns. 
Not going to advise this without research first but here are some example figures for a 2 bed flat in a good rental area.

Mortgage: £600 per month - £7200 annually
Rent £800 per month 
Profit £200 per month £2400 annually

You're investing in an asset that you own so you'd want to buy somewhere with a reasonably steady rental demand which can stabilise the property values in the area. Like near a university for example.
So for an annual investment of £7200 you get a return of £2400 minus taxes and fees (such as having your rental managed by a letting agent). ",0,1415409461,null,0,false,0,clw9mwo,t3_2lkcex,t1_clw9mwo,t3_2lkcex,null,1426134284,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

We moved back to the middle of the states (Nebraska to be exact). Unfortunately, the crowd here is few and far between for appreciating the game. But it is growing. NBC Sports picking up the Premier League was and is huge. I can watch it from my phone, or computer, in bed, hungover or not at 9am.

I am heading to the south coast next summer, and am absolutely thrilled to be at least getting pictures next to St Marys. Hoping to get inside and (hopefully) get to see the pitch. If anyone has any advice please let me know. I will be in the area early July, so there may not be much going on at the stadium.

Go Saints!

WE NEED TO RETAIN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THIS YEAR!!! people complaining about our lineup selections in champions league games need to take a hard look at the fact that champions league money doubles from this year to next(30m to 60m). 

With the size of our stadium, we cannot compete with the man u's  or the man city's or many others on matchday revenue. that is why us retaining champs league is so important. combine the lack of 60 mil for champs league(if we dont qualify), with the fact that they already have the financial leg up continues to retract from the appeal for world class names to join us(we can't pay 300k a week for average to decent players, honestly, no offense you trollers)... and make no mistake we need 2 world class players at the moment.

I'm kind of surprised that people are saying you should spend more money than your student loan on experiences. It's great to have experiences but the whole point of doing this stuff when you're a student is it's pretty cheap. You can airbnb and get a student eurail ticket.

But anyway, you asked about saving! 
There is a lloyds account that pays 5% on up to £2000, and I think you can open more than one. There is also a Santander account that pays 3% on balances over £3000, and a First Direct savings account that pays 6%. These are the best rates I've found, and I check regularly.

£2000 at 5% over a year will give you £100 interest, after tax £80.

Again the opposite of what everyone else is saying but based on my own experiences, I'd be inclined to work as much as I could over the summer. If you can get more work whilst you're there at that rate, then do it. You could double the amount you save over the summer and if you can keep most of it, you'd be in a good position when you leave uni, to set up your own business or move to a new place for work. You'll have more options.
That's what I would do if I had that much to save. 
I saved much less than that when I was a student and it came in very handy for if I was ever hit with an unexpected expense.

You can check your eligibility for certain credit cards on moneysavingexpert.com without being credit checked, and it also recommends the best one for your needs.  
But don't apply for one unless you actually do need it as an emergency.  
The best deals are always for new customers - for example some offer 0% interest on purchases or balance transfers for the first 18 months. If you get one of these cards now and don't use it, the interest free period will have expired and it's not worth using.  
I'd say save an emergency fund (even if it's just £50 a month each) and if some cost comes up, then get a credit card with a good deal on it.  
It's too too easy to get into debt by accident if you have a credit card. It gives you the illusion of wealth and makes you spend more on stuff you don't need.

Well, there are several reasons. One is that we had an empire and have a commonwealth and told various peoples around the world that Britain was their mother country, in order to placate them while we looted their resources. Then, after the war, we needed cheap labour. It also did the British ruling classes no harm at all if coloured people were placed straight into working class communities, thus providing a convenient scapegoat and a nice divide-and-rule strategy. 

Also, during the Cold War we spent years saying to the poor Third World countries; don't be like the commies, don't accept aid from them. Be like us instead. Have a nice capitalist market economy, free trade and all that. In the meantime, open up your markets, and produce cash crops for us, and we will lend you money, to the detriment of your local economies.

One component of free trade is supposed to be free movement of not just capital but labour. But labour ceased to be scarce some time ago, and therefore, as a commodity its price went down. Some poor worker in some poor country, enticed by capitalist propaganda into believing that the west is a paradise where if you work hard, you can be a success, wants to emigrate and make money for his family. He wants opportunity. He travels with great risks, only to find himself jealously barred out from the market, and vilified in the gutter right wing press. The markets of his own country were forcibly opened, but the west practices protectionism. The best he can find is some sub-minimum wage exploitation somewhere. 

People are brought in because it's economically useful to someone. The history of immigration in Britain after the war has been the history of cheap labour and divide-and-rule. And none of the big business parties want to change that, or are capable of changing that, including UKIP, whatever they say to get votes. 

You say that people's communities are being changed. What they are being transformed by is free market principles. And until people realise this, they won't develop an adequate critique to combat it. The Empire, the Cold War, the end of communism and globalisation... all these things tended to shake up populations and displace them. Immigrants are brought in because it makes the economy more ""dynamic"". You can pit foreign workers against native workers. That's why it's done.

You can meet the income or savings requirement in many ways. It doesn't have to be £60k of cash sitting in a bank account. An ISA is fine.

First of all if you've been living there less than 6 months he can't issue one to come into force before the end of that 6 months as you're protected under an Assured Short Term Tenancy . Secondly it has to give **2 MONTHS** notice and there is also a requirement in the Housing Act for when it is to start. If he's given you the Section 21 with it dated starting today and the rent was due last week then the notice is invalid as it has not got the correct start date. The very earliest it can start is the next date the rent is due and again, it is 2 months.

However even when the notice is up you don't have to leave. He will have to apply to the court for a possession order and this will be thrown out if you can prove the Section 21 wasn't issued correctly. Even when you get that you don't have to leave. Only when he gets a warrant of execution and the **COURT** bailiffs turn up do you have to leave.

If he does try to evict you then he is committing an offence. If he's constantly phoning you and knocking on the door he's committing an offence.

I did once see my wife switch to Welsh to deliberately confuse restaurant touts when we were in Turkey, but they were very pushy and then they left us alone. 

If you think carefully about this story for a second you will realise it doesn't make any sense. Firstly, why would anyone care about Welsh people speaking Welsh in Wales? If you are trying to annoy people it seems like a pretty feeble effort; there are many more effective things you can that require less set-up if that is your aim. Then, why would two Welsh speakers who clearly know each other even be speaking English at the start of the story? Why would two people you have never met before try to annoy you just because walked into the same shop they were in? Is it all English speakers they are trying to annoy because that would be about 80% of the people they see, it would take all day; or just you? The plot relies on them knowing you're not a Welsh speaker, when you just entered and haven't said anything, yet. Why is it so important to you that you can follow their conversation anyway? You weren't going to just talk to strangers uninvited were you? What are you, American?

This does get said a lot about the Welsh for some reason, it has become almost a sort of urban myth about us.

It finds RTD had more episodes passing the Bechedel Test, and that River Song is a violently strong character woefully dependent on the Doctor. I have not seen any counter-evidence of the same quality or depth, and nit-picking at the Bechedel Test does not count.

Part of the problem is that you cannot subject women and men to the same sort of trials and tribulations in the plots of popular culture without inciting rhetoric from the same groups that are angry about everything. It is sloppy to resort to the old fallback of talking about a man, but that's not an indicator of misogyny.

&gt; He hasn't hired a single female writer for Doctor Who, ever, and only one female director.

Is that a bad thing or is it an indicator that women may not be interested in writing sci-fi as much as men are? It could go either way. If women don't write sci-fi, then they won't try to leverage their way into getting on the writing staff through a writing sample or two.

&gt; He has said some pretty shitty things about women

Did you even read some of those quotes? Some of them are awful, but some of them are pointing out how he thinks about who is going to go with the Doctor. Mostly young, single women are a plausible plot device because they might be the most drawn to mystery men like The Doctor.

As for ought, my experience is the opposite. One of the reasons Welsh became an endangered language in first place was a kind of inferiority complex about it. Welsh speakers would feel like they should speak English in mixed company. It was a peasant's language and not at all associated with being educated or successful. Some of that persists today in consciousness about dialect.  I once saw a first language Welsh DJ addressing some adult learners at a Welsh-language disco for them being embarrassed about his dialect. He said to them ""don't pay attention to the way I speak Welsh, listen to your teachers.""

The very reason Welsh language activists in the 60s made such a big deal about getting all the road signs made bilingually and Welsh language TV station was as a way of building people's confidence to use it.

It's only necessary because the writers have trouble showing any sort of moral ambiguity or darkness to the situation.

He has costed us quite a bit over the last 18 months and I'm surprised no one else has made a big fuss out of it on here. Everyone's too mesmerized by his flashy ball control.

Some extra stats from last season: 

Highest shots/game ratio out of Sterling, Coutinho, Silva, Hazard and Mata 

     Coutinho 3.64 
     Hazard 2.2
     Silva 2.21 
     Mata 2.13

false,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"This is such a stupid situation, on both sides of the wider story.

I grew up in North Wales, one of the counties with the largest share of bilingual people in Wales. Despite not being from Wales I speak Welsh perfectly well though my parents do not. Ignoring the fact I got bullied for being English in some nasty ways as they were rare and isolated events, there has been next to no issues with my parents not being able to speak Welsh in their day to day lives.

Walk into the local shop and the shop staff are speaking Welsh? No problem, they have the common courtesy to speak to my parents in English when serving them. Yes, occasionally they will start the conversation in Welsh but all you have to do is say ""English please"" and no one thinks twice, and often my parents will say ""diolch"" when leaving the shop. There is literally not a single issue with the situation so why on earth shops feel the need to ban Welsh speaking is completely beyond me.  Its a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.

But on the other hand there is a situation that exists where my mother can't get a job she is more than qualified to do because she doesn't speak Welsh, despite the job not involving any situation where not being able to speak Welsh would prevent her from doing her duties. That, to me at least, is just as unacceptable as telling Welsh speaking staff they can't speak Welsh.

Turns out that Land Economy is on the Mill Lane site, so St. Catz is *very* close. Clare and Caius are further away, but that's further away in Cambridge terms -- less than 5 minutes walk from the main college. Magdalene is further still, but in the scheme of things it's still not far.

Note, however, that in Magdalene you are guaranteed to live very close to the college for your undergraduate (it's all, with the exception of some roads in the way, contiguous). Clare second years usually live in the Colony, which is the 'wrong' side of Magdalene from the point of view of town and the Land Ec. department, and first years live in Memorial Court, which is the furthest part of the main college from Land Ec/town, but close to the UL; Caius has accomodation on Sidgwick Avenue, which is further from both the land ec dept and from town, and Gresham road, ditto. Second year Catz students live on Grange Road, which is quite a trek (and away from town, though closer to the UL).

So if you go for Magdalene, you'll be the furthest away from Land Ec in your first year, but you'll always be in pretty much the same place; in all the other colleges you are likely to be further from land ec and from town than Magdalene in your second year, but closer in at least one of your first and third years.

You have to offset the long-term planning with enjoyment of your life now. I wouldn't sweat too much about saving more - it's a delicate balance. You're saving more than 15% of your net income, which is a pretty reasonable starting point!

A couple of points:

* Rather than arbitrarily deciding to take high(er) risks, think what the money will ultimately be used for, and tune the risk to that. Also consider if you'd be kept up at night if the value fell by 40% (not out of the picture with an 80% equity portfolio).

* Is the regular saver paying 6% gross still? If so it's a pretty reasonable pre-tax return, but I would argue that you'd probably be better drip-feeding the money into a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA. Once your emergency funds are taken care of there's really very little point in hoarding cash.

* You mention that you don't think you'll be saving enough to justify fees on monthly investing. If you go the index tracking fund route (as opposed to ETFs) this is a non-issue. Charles Stanley Direct (0.25% PA) don't charge any buy fees on index funds, and it's arguably better to contribute monthly and benefit from [pound cost averaging.](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/62457/the-benefits-of-pound-cost-averaging.aspx)",0,1415440864,null,0,false,0,clwj16w,t3_2lku28,t1_clwj16w,t3_2lku28,null,1426129889,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I do have a serious problem with the dismissive attitude towards evidence his answer to that question revealed. Let's be charitable, and I'll agree for the moment that that was just a horrendous misspeak and not hold it against him - my main problem anyway is a lack of specifics.

I'm aware Brand has written a book, and I'm not going to buy it. I would buy it if anyone (including Brand) gave some indication that the book has anything other than fatuous and empty content, but thus far nobody have (I should say I am extremely grateful for you taking the time to convince me otherwise - I'm surprised there is even one intelligent person who rates Brand's political philosophy, so the fact you are both intelligent and appear genuinely convinced he has important things to say makes you the best argument for at least giving him a chance I have come across yet). 

I know the difference between a corporation and a cooperative. I want to know how Brand intends to solve the problem that coops seem to be unable to survive on the open market (*pace* John Lewis and the Co-Op). Subsidies? But he has already said using public money to subsidise corporations is wrong. Legislative changes? Which ones, and what are the knock-on effects? Which cooperatives? All cooperatives? Even cooperatively owned energy companies who screw the consumer to make money for the worker-owners? Why does Brand think co-ops will fail to respond to market conditions and raise energy prices in response to demand?

These are just questions I have off the top of my head which don't even delve into specifics. I would say answers to these form the outline of a policy which might get me interested enough to read the book. After all, if I said 'Murder is bad so we should stop doing it', that would not constitute a great piece of moral philosophy, and in the same way, 'Corporations make profit at the expense of ordinary people, and this is bad and they should stop doing it' doesn't constitute political philosphy by itself.

&gt; Cyprus .. I presume that's because half the country is divided and Turks are living in the north. The rest are probably wealthy retired Brits with summer properties. Population is the same a Birmingham, 1M.

You presume, wow. ""Probably,"" yeah. Thanks for not misleading us as much as the comment you are responding to!!1 ...pointless, again.

&gt; Next up, Latvia and Estonia. These are basically fully assimilated 3rd/4th/5th generation Russians, who decided to keep their Russian citizenship after the Soviet Union was dissolved. They aren't really migrants.

You have provided no source and even if you had, one of the points of the anti-immigration believers is that culture and language is such a big deal. Evidently keeping their Russian passports, culture and language after generations would be considered a problem by them, so how come it's not a problem in the Baltic states? You know, the same Baltic states that are under threat from Russia because of that same minority. Hypocrisy.

&gt; Now, Ireland - a sparsely populated country which probably has lots of NI/UK passport holders living there through family connections. Some Eastern European people too. OK. Population 1/10th of the UK.

So? What's with the sparse population comment? You think migrants come to Ireland and build houses in the forest? No, they move to urban areas. Even if they didn't infrastructure still needs to keep up, regardless of where exactly they live. Pointless, again.

&gt; Austria - they're German with a few ex-Yugoslav migrants and Turks. This is the largest country of the list so far, with a population of about 8 million (London - or 14% of the UK)

So... what? Pointless, again. But just to humour you, you do realise that the south of Austria, the biggest part by far, is mountainous and the people cram themselves into the lowlands in the north? See the map I posted below.

&gt; Now, Belgium. Historically a divided country, there'll be a Dutch and French passport holders everywhere, with a few non-EU nationals. A densely populated country. 

Okay, maybe, so... what?

&gt; Spain has 6 million foreign-born people living there most are from Romania, Morocco, the UK and south America. They have a pop of 45M but roughly a third of the population density that the UK does at 240.

Again the population density. As if empty countries held infrastructure just waiting to be used (and, of course, as if immigrants moved into empty areas instead of urban ones). Again neglecting the constantly repeated ""culture"" argument that should apply here as well.



&gt; The only comparable country on this chart you've provided is Germany, with what looks like a 6% non-national population (Turks i'm guessing) and a few % EU (Brits, Poles, French I suppose). BUT, while Germany has a higher population (80M) and a higher area (357km2), the UK is 65M/242km2, you must remember that the spread of population is fairly even all over Germany. Pretty much all of their land is habitable and comfortable and the wealth is spread evenly. Now Scotland, Wales and N.I make up 48% of the area of the UK, but they are not taking an even share of migrants, the majority are in England, which has a area of 130km2. And on top of that, most are in the southern because the north is economically depressed. No immigrant is settling in the Scottish highlands, Scotland has had a natural not artificial rise in population over the last 100 years. This is a key factor which the graph ignores. Wales has no industry and attracts no migrants. NI has almost none, it's 98.5% white British as of the 2011 census.

Isn't it weird how you can make all these detailed considerations when it comes to the UK, but not to all the other countries? So here's some reality: Germany is [not equally populated](http://i.imgur.com/4xeek.jpg). You'll find that West Germany, which is part of the Blue Banana together with England, has a comparable population density. And again, infrastructure has to accommodate a population, and that doesn't depend on density so much. When it does, it does on the contrary – it's easier to provide for people who live close to each other. Dig up a street in Dortmund, lay some fibre optics, thousands of people get fast internet. Do the same work in the middle of nowhere and maybe you can connect up a few houses.

_________

Today I witnessed the human emotion triggered by an event known as ""fun"". It was another gator incident and the humans could not find the most effective route to the pitch. Instead of evaluating the situation and making calculations they just tried to power the gator through. It made some of the humans very nervous but most very ""happy"" ('happy' : ref log 2747482.9).



My judgement is that the emotion ""happy"" and ""fun"" limit the already abysmal decision making ability of the humans. I don't like ""happy"" or ""fun"" but can pretend to blend in, for the most part, I am once again perplexed by this anomaly.

Soldiers don't get a choice in where in the world they're deployed, who they fight against or what their overall mission is. They get very little say as to the equipment they use and their job is defined by what they're good at rather than their desires. 

Soldiers are told essentially to kill the enemy but...do they? Look up Dave Grossman sometime, he's written a number of books essentially about war psychology and battlefield statistics, comparing conflicts like the Napoleonic Wars, World War 1 and 2, and Vietnam. The findings he posts are quite the eye-opener. When the opportunity arises, it seems a person will prefer NOT to kill. Some soldiers deliberately fire and miss, while others simply don't make use of the weapons they're given. [This short exerpt] (http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=536561) does a better job of summarising his findings than I do.

Now yes, the argument exists that in all these conflicts there were drafts, so men that didn't want to be on the battlefield found themselves given rifles and uniforms and told to go do violence. However, even considering that, the ratios proposed make no sense. 

On top of this, you need to understand that returning to civilian life for a soldier is a pretty shitty thing. An Officer or General may be able to find good work off the back of his or her rank in the military, but for your average grunt? Yeah, shit's way harder. Some of these men probably feel trapped by circumstance. Fighting against someone they don't particularly feel any ill will towards, ordered to do things they don't want to do or face court martial and discharge. 

Yes, it's true, we have absolute sociopaths in our military, as do likely all militaries. That doesn't mean that we don't have young men who are put in psychological positions that are difficult to describe and even harder to imagine every time they leave to actually go do their jobs and be soldiers.

Really? I think you're mistaken there. 

I'm Welsh and until I moved at 22, I lived in a town just north of Aberystwyth and have never heard of Welsh-only speaking communities (I'm fluent in both English and Cymraeg, but English is my first language)... Hell, the whole area is so completely dependant on English tourism that a ""Welsh before English"" Attitude simply couldn't work. 

There are plenty of groups who prefer to speak Welsh, of course, and the rare old person who speaks little to no english, but there's no whole communities where English is not spoken at all (except for maybe a couple of clubs like Young Farmers). 

&gt;But there is a much higher proportion of people whose first language is Welsh

Less than you'd think. Of the population of Wales, less than 19% can speak *any* Welsh at all, there's no data that I can find about first languages, but figures would be much, much less for Welsh as a first language. 

The areas with the highest percentage of Welsh speakers are the North and West... Most of which are huge tourist areas that wholly depend on their staff talking in English, Aberystwyth even more so as it's population doubles/triples when the Uni Students are there. 

As for this ruling by Lidl, If they're going to ban Polish being spoken between staff, then they have to stop Welsh being spoken between staff. The argument that Welsh is the language of the country doesn't work when 81% of it's population don't speak it. The crux of it is this: 

&gt;""However, it goes without saying that our staff are able to assist a customer by conversing in their native tongue, if the customer is unable to speak any English.""

Welsh can and will still be spoken to the customers, just not amongst staff, of which, by the population average, 81% are not welsh speakers.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; Balo alone up front, This is not the issue we are having

This is *completely* the issue we're having. Balotelli doesn't pose a threat as a lone striker. The fact that he doesn't pose a threat means that the opposition defence can sit higher up the pitch, and don't need any assistance from midfield defensively, which means the midfield can push higher up too. 

We're losing the midfield battle every game because Balotelli isn't problematic enough to make their defence leave more than one or two players back whenever they go forward, which means our opposition can press high and hassle us off the ball (as QPR and Newcastle did). Putting another striker on actually helps us further back because it means our opposition have to play deeper and give us more space. 

We played with a lone striker for ages when we had Torres because Torres (in his prime) was a player who could drop deep to get the ball when he had to, would work the opposition defence, and could score from pretty much any half-chance he'd get. Then it worked, because the defence and midfield would shit themselves just trying to make sure Torres couldn't get the ball and it gave space for Alonso, Gerrard and Kuyt. Balotelli doesn't offer anywhere near that kind of threat, and even relegation candidates can completely take him out the game by just sticking a defender on him.

Kolo may not be matchfit. He is ageing and has played very few minutes this year. We cannot play him every single game and so the sensible thing to do is to persevere with S&amp;L and hope that consistency prevails, as despite popular opinion, I do think they are capable of forming a solid partnership.

Balotelli has not been poor. The service to him has been poor. Whilst I agree his decision making at times has been frustrating, I think his workrate has been more than fine, and with a bit of luck he could have scored a few more than he has.

Despite this, I do think it's a shame that such a good performance by several of our players midweek has gone unrecognised by Brendan, and I think it sends a bad message to players such as Borini who now warrant a chance.",0,1415449077,null,0,false,0,clwkcac,t3_2lo1p7,t1_clwkcac,t1_clwk4o9,null,1426129278,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

false,xu85,null,null,"The reason I can make detailed considerations when it comes to Germany is because they have a comparable economy, culture, population, population density and landmass .. *on paper*. As you see though it's not really comparable because we're comparing Germany with the UK, as do the media, when we should be comparing England with Germany, and only then specific regions of England where the wealth and jobs are concentrated. When there is a rapid rise in population, the local government (the ones who slavishly adhere to metrics) are simply unable to account for this artificial rise in population. If they know how many kids are born in a borough, they know roughly how many school places to provide. But when a London borough has a 20% population increase in 10 years, mainly down to migration, it lowers standards across the board as more will cram in to one room. 

My country by country analysis is a totally fair and justified response to the person I replied to, who dismissed /u/madeinacton concerns and shoved some googled chart in his face telling him why he was being awfully misguided and wrong because look at this chart, young man. Most people would look at it and go ""Oh my god .. the UK doesn't have it so bad after all, look at these countries on the left and the right!"". Yeah OK. I'm sorry for not giving due weight to countries like Luxembourg, Cyprus, [Latvia and Estonia](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/images/map-russia-nis-russians-1994.jpg), which make up a population is less than half of London.

I don't usually like doing this but let me respond to your comment

&gt;So? Does Luxembourg's infrastructure handle the extra people through magic? No, by investing in it so it can deal with the extra population. This is a pointless addition from you.

You don't get it. These people ""migrating"" to Lux are wealthy as fuck. Businesspeople, people working in finance. They don't *require* infrastructure because they have space, and they don't need high government spending. People have their own cars. They educate their kids in private schools. They use private healthcare. They require less from the govt.

&gt;You presume, wow. ""Probably,"" yeah. Thanks for not misleading us as much as the comment you are responding to!!1 ...pointless, again.

Again, there is a different calibre of migrant. They don't go to Cyprus to work .. they go their to funnel their stolen and ill gotten gains into the safer Eurozone economy. Remember the bank accounts being emptied into EU coffers? Older European migrants settle there when they retire, people with money ..

&gt;Evidently keeping their Russian passports, culture and language after generations would be considered a problem by them

See pic above. You can feel free to Google Russian People in Latvia.

&gt;Again the population density. As if empty countries held infrastructure just waiting to be used (and, of course, as if immigrants moved into empty areas instead of urban ones). Again neglecting the constantly repeated ""culture"" argument that should apply here as well.

Of course that's a fair point. But i'd counter that population density is still a very important metric when measuring capability to accommodate a rapid influx. If the infrastructure isn't there, it can be mitigate by a lower population density people quality of life (something that I can conveniently for you not measure what qualitative data) doesn't take as much of a hit. I'm sure a lot of Spanish nationals do resent continued EU migration when they have over 50% youth unemployment.

Thanks for the EU population density map, I wasn't aware that Germany had to much empty less populated space in the East. There is room for expansion, I see. They don't have their population clustered in two areas [London and the North West](https://i.imgur.com/sARe4F0.jpg) - (this map is more accurate than your more misleading zoomed out map), but it's more evenly spread over a much larger western area. I agree that it's cheaper to build infrastructure, per head, when people congregate in urban areas .. at least in theory and in the short term. You mention laying some fibre obtic, why does that come to your mind instead of things like school places? Schools can't just allow 35 kids per class, they need to build a new school. But land is very expensive now, so where will they build them? And how good will they be? What about building houses? These people need to live somewhere, and oh they also want to live where the jobs our so that rules out Cornwall and Newcastle. Oh and there's a big movement in the UK to protect the green belt so that rules out vast swathes of the UK. It's not easy to just build some houses in a city, it takes years and years of long term planning. These houses need roads, water, schools, amenities, transport links, rubbish collection. When London suffered from an overpopulation before the war, it took *decades* and a generation of returning soldiers for the government to build social housing on a big scale, with public support. Land was much cheaper than. I don't know if you've noticed but since the 1980s councils haven't really been building houses, one of the reasons house prices have shot up. High house prices also force people to share smaller spaces, reducing the quality of life for everyone except the landlord in that area, with unregistered and artificially increased demand for public services. Again this is something which disproportionately harms the less well off who can't afford private education, cars, private healthcare. With UK wages [5 times higher] than some parts of eastern Europe, I think we can safely assume millions of people would accept a lower quality of life because it is mitigated by higher earnings and better opportunities here. This comes back to my last paragraph which you either didn't read or plain ignored. It's one of the most important points. We can go by numbers, statistics and arguments and you can cherry pick examples to disregard my view like the other person did, but qualitative information is equally if not more important than pure GDP type data.",0,1415450880,null,0,1415455673,0,clwkojt,t3_2lki5l,t1_clwkojt,t1_clwjc7d,null,1426129119,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

that is how it currently works, with UEFA ensuring that the CL winning team is invited as one of a countries 'slots', that is why Chelsea went through instead of us in 11/12 (we were 4th), but they also went straight into the group stages rather than getting the 4th PO slot.

In the new system that kicks off in 15/16 the Europa and CL champs both get a 'special' place in the CL groups and then all the other country co-efficient places are added. 

So in effect if we say chelsea will the CL and come 1/2nd in the EPL then they will take the ""special"" winner slot and the 1/2nd EPL slot(place 1-3 get direct group stage entry) will shift down to the next team in the table, this will also shift the Play-off slot, and the europa league slots accordingly.

Obviously I'm aware that you may not get maximum speeds advertised but the agent I initially spoke to stated that we should be receiving a minimum speed of 4mb/s to a max of 9mb/s based on our area.

I should clarify that I have asked Sky if they have any record of speed tests done on the property before with emphasis on what sort of tests were done at the property either by their tech team or the engineer to ensure the property was getting the correct speed at time of installation. And to add, I'm aware that in the time we have been with Sky, connection speeds get better &amp; better but there's not a lot of education on the jargon that could help consumers understand whether or not their speed reflects their package or not.

As far as I'm aware, our area is ADSL2+ &amp; we are waiting on fibre optic being installed in the area &amp; my argument is about the minimum speed our area that we should be getting.

&gt;“He [Osborne] still has to pay a big amount and he didn’t negotiate a discount today and no discount has been awarded,” said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup nations which use the single currency. “Britain has had this rebate system for a very long time.”


So the head of the eurogroup nations is contradicting him. 



Meanwhile, you're quote from the comissioner says that the statement was factually accurate, but hten talks about the rebate - if the rebate isn't affected then why is she talking about it. 



It's very confusing at the moment. But if the rebate is affected then downing street have lied to the public, as has the chancellor.

I'm glad you asked!

It's important to plan your meals so nothing goes to waste, and you have a locked down list of things to buy at the shops. This means you don't get distracted and impulse buy stuff you don't need.

A few recipes I can think of, off the top of my head, that require little to no cooking ""skill"":

**Breakfast**

* Porridge (with milk). Seriously - it's good.
* Eggs on toast, [French toast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_toast) or [egg in the basket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_in_the_basket).
* Fried (canned) potatoes with a bit of [mayonnaise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo9HPyu7zOo) and some baked beans.

**Snacks**

* Nuts.

**Lunch**

Anything from breakfast, or:

* [Pasta carbonara](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2876/learn-to-make-spaghetti-carbonara), nice with some lardons but not essential. Use cream in the sauce.
* Baked potatoes with [mayonnaise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo9HPyu7zOo).
* [Egg fried rice](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eggfriedrice_67782).

**Dinner**

Anything from lunch, or:

* [Creamy vegetable soup](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/basic-cream-of-vegetable-soup-recipe.html).
* Roasted potatoes, carrots, onions

Like I said though, these are all really basic recipes so while they might seem boring, you can do [something more interesting](http://www.annabelkarmel.com/recipes/cheesy-vegetable-cashew-nut-burgers) if you put more time into it.

You can get by well off these basic items which can be picked up for &lt;£3, but most of the time well under &lt;£1. Hopefully I've not missed any.

* Herbs / spices / seasoning / sauces - mayonnaise, salt, pepper is good. ~£2 a cannister though so go easy. You can go without these but your meals might get bland.
* Cream - 500ml is about £2, probably the most expensive item.
* Full fat milk - 6 pints is about £1.50, maybe less.
* Butter - 500g is about £3. It's relatively expensive but it'll last.
* Eggs - 12-15 eggs is about £2.50. You want a lot because these are going to give you your protein and they will keep you feeling full.
* Brown bread, medium sliced, £1 a loaf. Besides the obvious, it's useful as a filler in soups.
* Wholewheat pasta or brown rice. £1-2 a bag.
* Porridge oats. Long lasting breakfast food, will keep you full for hours. ~£1.50/kg
* Tinned potatoes, vegetables and baked beans - 10p a can. These can, but shouldn't form staples of your diet as they're slightly less nutritionally rich than the fresh stuff, but in terms of ease of cooking and their use as a meal filler, they're great.
* Nuts - cashews and peanuts are quite versatile as a snack and use in recipes. Fairly expensive but cheap to buy in bulk. ~£10/kg but it'll last a while.
* Other vegetables - dirt cheap, but I'd recommend getting things like onions (important for taste), carrots, baking potatoes, peas, broccoli, cucumbers and courgettes.
* As a bonus, Any cheap meat you can get - midweek at about 7pm onwards is the best time to pick it up reduced. The best reduction ratios I've found are (ironically) Waitrose branches. You can sometimes find some lardons (diced bacon) for around £1-£2. The quality of cheap meat isn't that great but it's nice as a treat, I guess.

Fruit is completely gone from this list because it's relatively expensive, doesn't keep you full, and has a short shelf life once you've bought it. With this in mind you need to really make sure you're getting enough vegetables and associated nutrients otherwise you'll feel like crap.

Again, meat is more or less off the list unless you can get a quick deal. Bacon and chicken meat is relatively cheap if you want to treat yourself.

If you have a microwave and adequate storage, I recommend cooking in bulk and then storing the food for reheating on a biweekly basis - this just keeps your gas/oven/electric costs down and provides you with time to study instead of spending an hour or two a day making food for yourself from scratch.

I really hope your smoking quit goes well, you'll feel amazing after the initial hurdle and since you're quitting whilst comparatively young, you should go on to enjoy a decent healthy life.

I do apologise, kBps is what I was reffering to. I measured the speed via speedtest.net &amp; the speed was reflected on steam downloads &amp; confirmed on Sky's end.

The Sky agent I initially spoke to stated that based on our area, our minimum connection speed should be 4mb/s with a max of 9mb/s. That min/max is not advertised though the agent did state that on the phone.

Like I said, I am waiting for an engineer to look at our connection &amp; hopefully fix the issue though my issue after that is that Sky, after stating we should be getting a minimum speed of 4mb/s, has not been providing us with that service, regardless of whether the consumer is aware of the difference or not, and should have been looked into when they run their checks to ensure we are receiving their connection.

Though, OFCOM do not state anywhere that proof of service level has to be clarified which is a worry I have if other consumers not ""in the know"" have been experiencing similar.

I have been assertive with Sky but I am not one to shout &amp; ball as that is just a stress for both the consumer &amp; the agent helping us. Sky has been great so far in helping us so I give that to them but my parents have been paying for more than they are receiving for a number of years.

STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY. EVERYONE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THE WORLD JUST STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM AND HE WILL GO AWAY.

He does not represent any Muslims. I am a Muslim, raised in a family of Muslims, associated with probably thousands of Muslims, and every single one of them despises everything he stands for. He holds no official positions, he is literally just a nobody who says controversial things to get in the headlines. If he was head of an important official organization, then sure this would be a story. It's essentially like asking some crazy dude on the street for his opinions. Or like finding the head of some bizarre BNP splinter group and acting like their views represent anything even resembling what most normal white people in the country think. 

Whether he even believes the bollocks he spouts is pretty debatable (see: famous photo of him drinking in his university days). He is **exactly** like Katie Hopkins. Making a living on the fringe of celebrity, saying occasionally outrageous things so people share it on facebook or whatever.  

It's the fault of newspapers and media. Whenever they need to increase viewers or drum up some publicity, they will add him into their panel or write an article about him. It's pretty much guaranteed he'll claim something insane and get them some clicks/views. 

Let me repeat: IF YOU STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM, IF YOU STOP SHARING LINKS ABOUT HIM, IF YOU STOP POSTING SHIT HE SAYS ON REDDIT, HE WILL GO AWAY. 

Sincerely,

Pissed off Muslim who's sick to death of the fact this fucking piece of shit twat is the ""apparent"" self-proclaimed face of Muslims in the UK, when he officially represents absolutely zero of them.

**Price of product:** £8 for 25ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *"" Scientifically proven to brighten skin in two weeks. Energises the skin for a visible radiant glow. Hibiscus is nature's brightness booster and a wonderful hue of pink. Natural AHAs from the flower act as mild exfoliators to help leave skin smoother and brighter.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea.

On the other hand there are loads of roads which are limited to 40 and I can't see any reason - they are devoid of pedestrians, driveways, junctions and any other hazards, they are well lit and sufficiently wide, highly trafficked yet they are for no obvious reason limited.

First off, using Speedtest doesn't tell you the sync speed and gives you no indication of where the ""problem"" is. Log into your router and check your sync speed. That's the relevant speed for now. Username is admin, password is sky. Have you done the same speed test with a wired connection to your router? What's your actual sync speed?

&gt;spoke to stated that we should be receiving a minimum speed of 4mb/s to a max of 9mb/s based on our area.

I should be waited on, hand at foot, my every whim catered to. But that's not how the world works. They're telling you the sync speed they would expect to see. That's not ""what you'll get at speedtest.net"", that's ""what speed the router will connect to the exchange at"". 

It also is based on the implicit ""if everything else is equal"". This is often not the case. You could have a longer length of copper to your premises than your neighbor.

**Price of product:** £8.40 for 100ml

**Where did you purchase:** Bravura London website

**Product claims:** *""Purifying Calendula Toner is an effective facial astringent recommended for normal and normal to oily skin. Its normalising pH helps to fight bacteria, making it particularly valuable for skin types with partial oiliness and break outs.*

*This exfoliating facial toner combines the effective exfoliation properties of 10% Glycolic Acid and 3% Lactic Acid with hydrating aloe vera and healing calendula extract. It works to remove the last traces of cleanser, along with dead skin cells and excess oil to leave skin feeling smooth, soft and ready for the next stage in your skincare routine ... [As recommended by Caroline Hirons.](http://www.carolinehirons.com/2014/09/acid-toning-part-one.html)""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased due to the high percentage of AHA and calendula extract.

**Your opinion:** This toner is too astringent for my skin, my own fault for selecting the wrong product. I am also not keen on the medicinal scent. However I have found it useful for microneedling preparation and clean up: calendula has anti microbial properties and there was no stinging when wiping away pinprick bleeding despite the fairly low pH. I likely will repurchase for that purpose.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, aloe vera gel, glycerin, lemon juice, 10% Calendula extract, 10% glycolic acid, sodium glycolate, glucose, fructose, sucrose, urea,  dextrin, alanine, glutamic acid, hexyl nicotinate, 3% lactic acid, alcohol denat, fragrant oil, bisabolol, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate.*""

Not really. The questions they ask you were standardised years ago, the way they work out the price is fairly straightforward:

 - Start with a price for the policy.
 - Ask a standardised set of questions.
 - Depending on the answer to each question, either refuse to insure altogether, bump the price up or drop it by a %age. This %age varies by insurer and even by product (if an insurer wants to specifically target older drivers, for instance, they'll introduce a new product where they bump the price up or even refuse to insure anyone below a certain age).
 - Note that the insurer can choose precisely how specific they want to be in looking at answers to questions. They might, for example, find that drivers of 5 door Corsas are involved in fewer accidents than drivers of 3 door Corsas. Or they might find that a particular trim level is stolen more frequently. Whatever; every single vehicle - right the way down to the engine and trim level - has a code number applied to it (the ABI code) and they use this number in calculating the exact risk. Insurance groupings do play a role, but if the insurer finds that of two cars that are nominally in the same group, one is much more likely to be involved in an accident - then the grouping can go to hell.
 - You might also apply other logic to the premium calculation - a common one is ""collaring and capping"". This ensures that no matter what the answers, you won't offer a price below - or for that matter above - a certain level.

By the time you've drilled through all these numbers, the only way two people on the Internet can possibly compare insurance prices is if they start with exactly the same answers to every question.",0,1415455016,null,0,false,0,clwlnd0,t3_2lnwmg,t1_clwlnd0,t1_clwk0hx,null,1426128668,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;

&gt;The __Birmingham Oratory__ is an English [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) religious community of the [Congregation of the Oratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Oratory) of St. [Philip Neri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Neri), located in the [Edgbaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgbaston) area of [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham). The community was founded in 1849 by the [Blessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatification) [John Henry Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Newman), C.O., the first house of that congregation in England.

&gt;Part of the complex of the Oratory is the __[Parish Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_Church) of the [Immaculate Conception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception)__, commonly referred to as the __Oratory Church__. It now also serves as the [national shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_shrine) to Newman.

**Price of product:** £6 for 2 x 30ml

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on BOGOF

**Product claims:** *""Naturally Radiant Glycolic Overnight Peel is formulated with a unique energising complex infused with kiwi fruit and mulberry extracts to help revive skin's radiance and even out skin tone. With glycolic acid, a powerful Alpha Hydroxy (AHA) and a fruit acid blend, the refreshing gel formula also refines and retexturises the skin's surface, providing a brighter, more youthful complexion.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. This product was my first glycolic acid purchase.

**Your opinion:** I have used almost a full tube on face, neck and decollette. A little goes a long way and the gel is easy to spread. However it doesn't play nicely with silicone serums, balling up underneath them. My fingers have also been extremely dry, and I suspect the alcohol in this because they have improved since stopping using it. I feel the name is disingenuous since glycolic acid is way down the ingredients list. I may use the second tube on neck and decollette only but will not be repurchasing.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, propylene glycol, alcohol denat, glycerin, bilberry extract, xanthan gum, sugar cane extract, orange fruit extract, lemon fruit extract, sugar maple extract, soap berry extract, Caesalpinia spinosa gum, dulse algae extract, glycolic acid, fragrance, kiwi fruit extract, lotus flower extract, mulberry leaf extract, disodium EDTA, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, citronellol, coumarin, eugenol, geraniol, linalool, sodium hydroxide.""*

Tested with universal indicator paper at pH ~4

I do understand that longer wires take longer to transmit data, again, I'm not an idiot. What do you mean by ""illegally moved""?

If our line cannot accommodate the service we are paying for then I am sure Sky would know about that &amp; if they did know that yet still sold us the package then that is a breach in OFCOM point of sale legislation as they were aware that we would never get, the now confirmed, minimum connection speed we should.

And again, I get that but regardless, a Sky representative confirmed what our minimum &amp; maximum speeds should be &amp; confirmed that is not what we are receiving.

I will find out the sync speed ASAP &amp; will notify Sky of my findings to see if that would grant further indication of the issue but I am confident that an engineer will still have to be sent out to run their own diagnostics.

No company releases confidential employment records.  Least of all not an intelligence service.  They have oversight policies detailed in their internal documents and they've stated as much in response to certain accusations.  Of course that's not particularly salacious and doesn't make headline news, so nobody cares.

&gt;Can you instead give a good reason why the government should have this power?

Government requires information to perform its many duties.  The more information it can obtain, the more capable it is of carrying out those duties, in any aspect.  I think it should have this power for the same reason it should have the power to compel you to complete the census form.  For the same reason it can compel you to surrender certain information about your financial standing.

**Price of product:** £6.50 for 60 pads

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""Unveil younger-looking skin with our innovative Glycolic Fix. 60 radiance-boosting pads, soaked in exfoliating glycolic acid (2.8%) retexture + resurface skin whilst witch hazel helps to tone. This moisturising formula with hyaluronic acid + soothing blue daisy helps to reveal brighter + smoother looking skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased to compare with other daily glycolic acid exfoliators.

**Your opinion:** I have only started using these pads this week, but I really like them. The pad format makes it easy to treat around the nose without the solution pooling and irritating. They are gentle enough for my reactive skin with only a very slight rosacea 'flare' that quickly recedes. However I don't find them potent enough for my neck and decollete.

I probably will repurchase tho only at half price because I feel the RRP is outrageous for only a months supply.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, glycerin, 2.8% glycolic acid, polysorbate 20, sodium hydroxide, PEG-12 dimethicone, witch hazel water, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, alcohol denat, disodium EDTA, blue daisy extract, panthenol, lactic acid, fragrance, limonene, ethylhexylglycerin, dehydroacetic acid, sodium hyaluronate, linalool, geraniol, citral.""*",0,1415456262,null,0,1423006899,0,clwlzq9,t3_2lo783,t1_clwlzq9,t1_clwl54t,null,1426128508,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3

How on earth did you manage to take that away from that graph?!

- 45% require specific user interaction
- 26% require a USB insertion - another form of interaction
- 4.4% are infected files - which would require interaction to be opened

Then for you,

- ~23% run without requiring a user

So that is 75.4% which require user interaction yet you've somehow managed to to interpret that as meaning the majority don't?! 

&gt;it doesn't matter if 55% or 10% come from sources requiring no user interaction

Is that not back pendling somewhat? You're the one that came up with the unsupportable assertion that the majority of trojans and rootkits are installed automatically, not me.

&gt;both levels are intolerably high when trying to support the silly notion that a skilled user has no use of AV.

I made no assertion over their utility of an AV, I said it wasn't 'needed'. I specifically attacked the word ""majority"". But for sake of argument, it wouldn't matter if 100% of the malware you mention was installed without intervention. An expert user could likely still avoid it.

I realise it is difficult to visualise use cases that you have one has no experience of, but that is not to say that they don't exist nor that they are wrong. That said, you've probably come across a Linux server a few times right? How many of these run AV do you think? What about Solaris boxes or AIX? BSD systems, etc?

Not really. If you consider the first duty of a police officer to prevent crime then hiding away wont make people slow down, it only catches them afterwards.

If you are a new driver, the cost can be prohibitively expensive, it always has been as young drivers are in a disproportionally high amount of accidents for the amount of them on the roads. If you have a speeding conviction your premiums will go up.

Recently insurance companies have started offering discounts based on having a monitoring system installed into the vehicle. It measures where and how far you drive (gps) how you drive (accelerometer) and what time you drive (time). From this you can calculate speed, what the speed limit should be etc.

**Price of product:** £23.00 for 118ml

**Where did you purchase:** Paulas Choice website, I so wish they sold them
at boots so I could get some Boots advantage points when purchasing these items

**Product claims:** Unclogs and shrinks pores almost overnight
Anti-inflammatory ingredients calm skin irritation
Reduces and prevents marks from blemishes

**About you:** I have oily acne prone skin which slowly being tamed, with
small patches of PIH left on the skin

**Your opinion:** This is a great exfoliant not only has this helped with
my acne, like actual pimples (I dont get them anymore) It has also helped
with closed Comedones as well and has overall made my skin much more
smoother. This product has also helped with the PIH that I have left once a
spot has gone and it is starting to make them fade which is great. 

The extra strength solution has also helped with my oily face where I no longer
have a face which is an oil slick by the mid day. Overall great product and 
would say you must try this if you're struggling with acne like I was.

It has a nice light liquid texture to it and soaks in nice a quick and leaves 
your face matte

First game refund: Beat Hazard; it had advertising saying you could 'play with your entire music library' - but I couldn't; at the time it came out, it couldn't cope with iTunes format AAC files.  I pointed out that the claim was untrue, so it was false advertising - they refunded.  Second refund: Slamit Pinball: BIg Score which was so bug ridden and awful, and had rotten game physics.  Again, a polite request for refund, since the game seemed unfinished, broken, ball went thru flippers, etc. resulted in a 'we don't refund, you pay that's it'.  Again, a more strongly worded email saying quoting back the words on the description about 'realistic action', etc. resulted in a refund.

In both cases, Steam said it was done as a 'goodwill gesture' and a 'one time only refund', but if I encounter any other games that are said to be fully working (obviously excluding their early access things) that I don't feel they have acted honestly, and I'll approach them again.

**Product claims:** *""This treatment is one of [makeup expert Wayne Goss' favourites.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tdtt7n2pXc#t=08s)*

- *Extraordinary treatment guaranteed to reveal younger-looking skin overnight*

- *Unique delivery system allows the AHA to work while reducing irritation*

- *Proven antioxidants to make your skin look younger*

- *See fewer wrinkles, discolorations, and dry, rough patches*

- *Dramatically improves an uneven skin tone*

- *100% fragrance-free and contains no dyes or coloring agents*

*Sunburn Alert: This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** This treatment is a clear silky liquid which is easy to spread thinly. Stung a little on application and itched a little whilst on, both of which are normal  when exfoliating my reactive skin with AHAs. Did not make my skin dry or tight during the wait period and did not ball up when applying a silicone serum right over the top.

One sample did two treatments for face, neck and decolette so the cost per use is reasonable. I loved this and will be purchasing the full size for use perhaps twice a week.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, methylpropanediol, glycolic acid (10%), butylene glycol, aloe vera leaf juice, sodium hydroxide, green tea leaf extract, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, licorice root extract, grape fruit extract, burdock root extract, oat kernel extract, borage extract, Boerhavia diffusa root extract, German chamomile flower extract, white nettle flower extract, willow bark extract, slippery elm bark extract, glycerin, allantoin, propylene glycol, tetrasodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol.""*

Once again we start with 1 up top and change it 80 minutes too late. Our football is slow, negative and boring. There's no movement and our desire to win has disappeared.


Our subs were made 10 minutes too late and we replaced arguably our two best players. There was space in midfield today and still Lallana doesn't get a chance to exploit it, much like the game against Newcastle.

false,Isaleem,null,null,"**Name of product:** Bravura London Lactic Acid 10%

**Price of product:** £9.59 for 30ml

**Where did you purchase:** http://www.bravuralondon.com/featured/10-lactic-acid-30ml.html

**Product claims:** Lactic acid is a mild chemical peel (Apha Hydroxy Acid or AHA) and is thought to be more accepted by the skin than other AHA's as our body produces lactic acid. This alcohol free chemical peel is infused with Rose Water and is the perfect treatment for dry or dehydrated skin suffering from hyper pigmentation, acne, dry/dull skin, ageing skin or to just freshen the complexion and revive your natural glow. PH 3.75

**About you:** Sensitive eczema prone skin (around eyes/lips/neck) prone to irritability. Eczema scarring around forehead and eyes. often extremely puffy in the morning. I wear no make up (male) and am working on my daily routine at all times! I have used corticosteroids and tacrolimus around my eyes more recently. Recently worked in a full daily routine using eucerin cleansers and aveno moisturisers as a base.

**Your opinion:** This is my second AHA exfolliant (first being Cleanance K by Avene). As with my first AHA upon application there is a slight sting (particularly at my hairline for some reason, more so using this lactic acid than cleanance k) before the sting reduces to a slight tingle as the product dries out. application time i leave on for 7.5 mins after working up from 3) I apply with my fingers using the amount from a full squeeze of the pipette (usually results in a half full pipette). Possibly slightly too irritating for daily use but i use it every other day now. I have seen results in that my face generally looks a lot more even around the nose and cheeks and I think that my scarring is becoming slightly less noticeable than it was previously. Packaging was sufficient and postage was speedy with updates via email. I have been using for approximately 2 weeks now and depending on my usage and other products I will most likely be purchasing again.

**Ingredients:** Purified Water, Rose Floral Water, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide and Sodium Citrate

It's even worse at postgraduate level - my course is structured so that you can't really do any work outside of it, and if I hadn't received scholarship funding it would have been impossible to do.

Depending of what exactly young people are doing it can be much more or less difficult to find work, and although the economy is doing better now than it was, that hasn't really translated to more job opportunities and definitely hasn't translated to allowing young people to work flexible hours.

Example - a friend of mine doing a phd on Japanese culture had ZERO contact hours apart from a monthly half hour meeting. He was able to work pretty much any day of the week at any time, whereas my course was structured so that for 3 months I had 9 - 5 lectures and then the rest of the time was 9 - 5 lab work, and outside of those I still had other things like statistical analyses of the data I've collected, research, graphing, writing the paper, giving presentations etc.

I suppose it depends on the specific region as well, since some regions are doing far better than others are. There are definitely more jobs where I am, but my brother is going to lose his job in March because the company is closing that location. There's nothing else around that he can fit around his degree (he still lives at home) or actually get to (we live in an isolated place without great public transport and he can't afford to buy/run a car). It's not easy, and in some cases not really possible, to work as a young person.

- Where the hell did Hendo go?  He was brilliant for a stretch there, and it's like he's been invisible since.

- Is there something in Stevie's contract that doesn't let him get subbed?

- The true problem with Balo is that he just has no motion where he's supposed to.  shows great effort on EVERY other part of the pitch except the box.  Gets in the striker's area and just does fucking nothing.  Stands still while midfielders come up with the ball, watches aerial balls just drift by with absolutely no effort to make anything happen, finally gets the ball and stands there holding it with one foot and dancing with the other...  it's dumbfounding.  

- Absolutely baffled by how BR's mind works.  How he chooses lineups, how he constantly tries to make the high-dollar, underperforming acquisitions work, how he chooses who to sub off, everything.

Moreno

on my skin, I apply this the night before and it will be either gone or 
dramatically reduced in terms of size and redness.

I used to use this product every week as it suggested but decided to use it more
often to get better benefits and my skin hasn't reacted badly to it. 

I now use the product every Tuesday and Friday night and I am left with nice
smooth skin the next morning.

When first applying this product there was a little tingling sensation that 
was felt on the skin, and places where I have more sensitive skin; like around
the mouth the feeling was more apparent, but that feeling dissipates after 5-10
mins or so.

Don't have enough words to describe how disappointed I am towards Glen Johnson. I don't like to rip on our own players, but for that second goal, why the fuck is Coutinho in that physical battle with Azpillecueta and not our right back? Every time the ball came to him he took an absolute age to do something with it and when he did do something with it, it involved cutting onto his left and having absolutely no idea what to do from there. 

At this point I feel sorry for Mignolet. Because Gerrard isn't a defensive midfielder. He's an instinctive, explosive, attacking midfielder, not a tactical genius. Gerrard's defensive ineptitude combined with Johnson's cluelessness leaves Mignolet, our center backs and Moreno exposed constantly. Not a single team in the league has a right back as lazy and a defensive midfielder less suited to than their position than we do, thus why we're leaking goals.

Sterling looks exhausted to me.

Cahill's goal should not have stood. Matic redirected the ball with his hand/arm, otherwise it was going off for a corner. 

We can speculate about the penalty too. I mean it was an obvious penalty, how it wasn't given is beyond me. But I think the first goal changes more tbh. 1-0 up at home against the best team in the league. If we can hold it until half time we would've seen it out, I'm sure of it. Matic probably would've been given a yellow and knowing him would've got a second.

**Our defense**

First Mignolet, I like him but after all the criticism he is absolutely lost. He doesnt have confidence to do anything...Every single kick was into the crowd or to Fabregas. For some reason he is not going into crosses. He punched the ball once today.  Not good enough. Also I think he could punch the ball better (away of 16yard box) with the second goal. 

Skrtel and Lovren, they cant play together, they are equally terrible. They lack confidence, they dont trust each other they are not aggressive enough (Lovren vs Costa, facepalm) and simply not good enough. Their distribution is equally terrible, every pass is silly. They cant pass if the life depended on them. And corners, oh my god the corners. Last game they put the smallest player to mark Demba Ba it was WTF... [Corner from 1:1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B17X6zaIAAEE1_o.jpg) Any idea why is everyone so up the pitch? Why are Can and Henderson and Skrtel not covering their players? Its stupid and silly mistake..Skrtel shouldnt go for the ball at all...He was marking zonal and should stay where he was  
 
**Our Midfield**

Its slow, so slow that the only player covering both ends of the pitch was 33 years old Gerrard. They are not quick enough to defend not quick enough to attack. Its mainly their fault that Balottelli looks like lazy donkey. You cant simply pass the ball to Sterling and then stop. The only player in the box was Balottelli every single one was outside of the box. Coutinho played good but again there was no movement in the last third. Where is everyone? Its really bad. 


**Our Attack**

is non existent. You can blame Balo all you want but he is alone and doesnt get any service at all. He could be freaking Messi and wouldnt get anything from it cause he needs ball to the box with players around him that will create space. But he also needs to do better. He is always offside. Dunno how he is doing that, but every single time he picks his run he is offside. He needs to do better
 
The problem is everything. Our defense doesnt trust Mignolet with the kicks so they are under pressure to create something, our midfield doesnt trust defense because their passing is terrible so they are sitting deep if we lose possession (and we did so many times in the first half oh my god) so our attacking players must go deeper and balo must go deeper. We are working extra time thanks to this. And we get the ball only Balo, Sterling, Coutinho are attacking and thats simply not enough

Who is to blame? Brendan Rodgers partly, partly players...Dont be mistaken Brendan is under huuuuge pressure. There is something going on under the scenes. We fired scouts that were apparently misjudged some players. I dont think we will fire him in january or etc. But I think he will be gone in the summer if we dont get our shit together. Can we? Thats the question. i think we can but Brendan must do something with our distribution of the ball.

**Name of product:** Paula's Choice SAMPLE Clinical KP Treatment Cloths

**Price of product:** £6.75 SPECIAL PRICE Normally £7.50 for a pack of 10 cloths

**Where did you purchase:** Paulas Choice website

**Product claims:** Effective for: Acne Breakouts, 
Keratosis Pilaris, Redness
Combines 8% lactic acid and 2% salicylic acid to reduce and potentially 
eliminate bumps and breakouts

**About you:** I have oily acne prone skin which slowly being tamed, with
small patches of PIH left on the skin

**Your opinion:** I find these cloths as a very convenient way of applying both 
 a BHA and AHA as opposed to using a cotton wool which can waste a lot of the
 product by being absorbed. Although I am not using this product to treat KP 
 I am still seeing the exfoliating effects on my skin and as with any AHA that I 
 use on my skin I get that initial tingling sensation.
 
 I use this product every night, the neat thing about these clothes is that 
 they are quite large, 1 sheet is more than enough to cover the face. So what I do
 is cut the cloths into quarters and store the extra within the pack which is enough coverage for the face and also makes sure
 that you get more uses out of the product as well.
 
 The product is also good at controlling oil as well.
 
 The dimensions of the cloths are 20.2 cm X 8 cm

**Ingredients:** Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Aminemethyl Propanol, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract, Sodium Citrate, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA.

The language evolves, it contracts, there are places in France (Lyon) that etymologically speaking are named after pagan Irish Gods. The Thames river in London is a Gaelic name.

**Price of product:** £9.59

**Where did you purchase:** Bravura London website

**Product claims:** ""Salicylic acid is a very effective ingredient for treating oily/acne skin types that are prone to open pores and blackheads. Because it has a larger molecular structure to Glycolic Acid it stays on the surface of the skin longer giving it fantastic pore clearing capabilities. As this is a daily use peel, it gives far better results on congested skin than a weekly peel.""

**About you:** Dry to normal skin, occasional individual zits, a little PIH that tends to fade quickly.
 

**Your opinion:** This is a rinse off product and you are supposed to work up in time (starting at 2 minutes and moving to a maximum of 10) but I know at least one person on here who doesn't rinse it off. This is a good product, it reduces existing acne and stops new pimples from forming. My skin is a lot smoother because of the daily exfoliation. But you only get 30ml, and at 1ml per day (the recommended amount) this will not last long. I'm considering switching to a Paula's Choice product simply because you get a lot more in a bottle, and I dislike reordering stuff every month or two. Otherewise, I would repurchase this. Bravura say this has a pH of 3. The packaging was good and I received it quickly.


**Ingredients:** Distilled Water, Salicylic acid, Propylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide. 


**EDIT:** I have now successfully not rinsed this off for two nights in a row, and my face hasn't fallen off. It actually looks better, because of the longer time for the acid to work.

If you're willing to travel across Europe, and learn a foreign language to better your earning potential, then you're pretty well motivated, and of course most/many of these people are young and fit, and are pretty flexible about where they will live, and what kind of work they will take.

The sad fact is that many Native Brits are not as motivated and not as flexible as migrants. They don't want to work unsociable hours in hotels or restaurants, or go out and graft in to the fields picking veg. If they take a factory job they appear to think its all below them.

I've worked in factory environments for the last few years, with lots of British and foreign temps at this time of year. 

Young Brits turn up late, work slackly, throw Monday sickies and generally cant be bothered.

Of course I would, and so would he, but realistically he and I both know that you've got to start somewhere and whilst - at his age - a year seems like a long time, it's a drop in the ocean when compared to how long he's likely to be working for.  

An apprenticeship is means to an end, it's a fixed-term 12 month contract after that he'll either be taken on by the company on a proper salary or go back to looking for work with 12 months experience and a couple of BTECs or whatever under his belt.  Either way he'll be in better position then than he was before he started and arguably more employable than if he'd have been working in a supermarket on minimum wage instead.

&gt;It's the company I disagree with

As far as I can tell, he's not actually paid by the company but by the local apprenticeship scheme - in his case it's the local HE/FE collage.  The government fund some of it through the college and the company funds some of it.  

I'm sure there are companies abusing the system for cheap labour and just cycling through apprentices every 12 months, but in my son's case at least they appear to be pretty good about either making a full time job offer well before the apprenticeship ends or letting the apprentice know that they'll be let go at the end of it.

The vast majority of us pay much more, and are having further increases every single season.

Only a fool would be taken in by such a calculated token gesture. It's not designed to aid City fans, if it was, there would be thousands of these tickets, not a couple of hundred.

It's designed for the club to lay claim to the cheapest season tickets devoid of all context, and conceal the wider trend. It's all a concern with public image, not real substance.

Also, you give that the 'mixed' reaction (something I really can't say I've seen, at all, even the infamously negative Gallifrey Base seems to love him) as a reason he could leave tonight - Asking with no offense intended at all, but are you American? Because the way stuff is filmed here, in particular shows like Doctor Who means it doesn't work that way.

A lot of shows in America have more episodes in a series, and regularly still film as the show's airing, and that means the writers and producers can take note of audience reactions while they're still making the show. That doesn't happen here - Except rarely, a series is finished filming a while before it starts airing. S8 finished filming completely in early August, I think.

My point being basically is that even if everyone in the audience but yourself hated Twelve, that wouldn't have an impact on whether he leaves tonight. Hell, it wouldn't even have an effect on Christmas, considering they finished filming that on the 3rd of October.

So don't worry - If it's a plot point that he's leaving tonight and the Christmas episode has been a big fake out and they've somehow filmed it with a new Doctor without anyone knowing, as incredibly, near impossibly unlikely as that is, then he might be leaving in Death in Heaven.

false,the-londoner,lfc68,,"Ridiculous that the BBC etc aren't saying much about the Cahill handball at the end, other than we'll complain it should've been given. Course we'll fucking complain, it was a penalty. Seems like after last season, refs are reverting to type and not giving us much. We should've had a point, and might've had all 3 with luck on our side. 

Having said that, Rodgers still cocked it up again. I'm only bitter because we took the lead and should've had a pen, but really we were outplayed. How Kolo doesn't start after shutting down the best player in the world over Lovren - who couldn't handle Bobby fucking Zamora - is beyond me, but then it seems the only person in the world who disagrees is Rodgers himself. 

And whilst Allen did create chances when he came on, taking Can and Coutinho off could only warrant bringing in a player with drive and spark on i.e. Lallana. Again, Balo up top on his own has been shown to be ineffective, confirming what the rest have been saying for about 7 weeks. I think he was offside so much because he knew deep down he was going to do nothing from deep and tried to give himself as much room as possible. 

Positives are that Mignolet seems like hes turned a corner to some extent, Can, Sterling and Coutinho are playing well, and despite Johnson's inaccurate passing, he defended well enough. 

Negatives: Moreno's lost a bit of confidence in the tackle again, perhaps after Newcastle. Stevie again just seems tired and Hendo's become lacklustre after such a good start to the season. Can has to start now to accommodate these 2 in current form. Lovren of course, still shite. 

But the biggest problem now lies with Rodgers. He made bold statements both literally and figuratively mid week against Real but failed to validate them with this line-up (Lovren in, Balo alone etc). I'm not one of those mental, delusional fans who thinks we should get rid of him, but he shouldn't be untouchable because of last season. If we were failing this season because he picked players on form and in the best formation to suit those who are fit that's fine - that's the players not being good enough after losing Suarez and Sturridge, and can be addressed by new buys and team chemistry. But being shit because he's picking favourites and choosing a poor formation, continually for 2 months? That's inexcusable.

What we all get anxious about and what is being echoed in this thread already, is that when he is under pressure with the ball at his feet....which is quite often considering Mignolet and BR love to play it out of the back, no matter the pressure level of the other team.......he is nowhere near as accurate or confident. So he settles too often for the side or back pass instead of maybe being more aggressive with link up passes.

Our average season ticket prices for an adult are circa £650. That's not cheap, and it's a lot more than it used to be just 3 years ago. Our cheapest goal end tickets are now more expensive than equivalents at Old Trafford.

And they're going up every single year.

I fail to see how you cannot recognise that a couple of hundred cheap tickets represent nothing more than an exercise in calculated public relations.

&gt;Then they go; okay so Melberger, the poor bastard, can't afford just under £70 per month for his season ticket so we'll set a few aside at half that price.

Totally unwarranted facetiousness on a serious topic that effects a lot of people. The 'I'm alright Jack' attitude in microcosm. Cretinous.

The key point though, being literally 'a few': they're a drop in the ocean. There are thousands of blues who can't afford our regular season ticket prices, and there are thousands more who are being slowly priced out with the yearly increases.

You don't think that's a problem? That our match going fanbase is being gentrified, the core support being slowly priced out?

The core point is: the club does not care about those being squeezed by the price increases. The club cares about its public image: hence the calculated token gesture designed to give the impression they do in fact give a shit.

false,Cazmeister,null,null,"Right, I've got time to kill so I will give my opinion on each player individually.

Mignolet - Average. We need to buy a keeper in January who can challenge him for the number 1 spot. Valdes would've been perfect but unfortunately that doesn't look like it's going to happen now.

Moreno - One of the few Brendan Rodgers signings that has impressed so far. He is still very young however, and does make quite a few mistakes but we have plenty of time to work on it with him. We also have decent cover for him in Enrique and Flanagan.

Lovren - One of the worst Centre backs I've seen play for Liverpool. He is incompetent in even the simplest areas of football. Rodger's worst signing to date. 

Sakho - Still undecided on him. He was keeping Varane out of the France side during the world cup, but he looks like a completely different player when playing for Liverpool. When he's fit again we need to give him a chance in the starting line-up to show the form he is capable of.

Skrtel - Seems to polarise this sub. Personally, I think he should start with Sakho despite his habit of losing focus and his fetish for pulling shirts in the box.

Johnson - Not good enough. Simple as that.

Manquillo - Solid RB. Looks decent defensively but still lacks quality when attacking. 

Gerrard - A 34 year old shouldn't be playing 3 games in a week. He doesn't offer enough defensively, and his passing range does not compensate for this. Desperately need a DM in January.

Henderson - I am a fan of Henderson. The only problem I see with him is his ability in the final third. Whenever he gets near the box he always dribbles too far/gets tackled/picks a poor pass but a still think he is a valuable part of our side.

Allen - Very average. Not good enough for Liverpool unfortunately.

Emre Can - Looks like a decent prospect for the future.

Sterling - Obviously one of our best players. Seems to have lost a bit of form since the 'controversy' he caused with England. I feel like he is wasted on the wing and should play in behind the striker.

Coutinho - Inconsistent but has the potential to be world class. He will dribble past 4 players and then fail to make a 5-yard pass.

Lallana - Good, but not £28 mill good. Don't know why rodgers didn't bring him on today either, one of the few players who could've made a difference.

Markovic - Still very young. Not good enough to start for the first team yet and needs to get a bit of muscle on him.

Balotelli - How Rodgers doesn't realise that Balo upfront on his own doesn't work is beyond me. Needs a strike partner desperately. However, it is concerning that he is still yet to be involved in a goal in the premier league. Hopefully when sturridge is back this improves.

Bornini - Can't fault his work rate, but he is simply not good enough.

Sturridge - Need him back desperately.

Personally I think, when everyone is fit, our strongest side is: Mignolet, Moreno, Sakho, Skrtel, Manquillo, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana/Coutinho, Sterling, Balotelli, Sturridge in the 4-4-2 diamond formation. I'm not going to blame Rodgers yet, but his stubbornness is concerning.

If you want to include wealth, you need to include a detailed measure of age since some should be accruing wealth (while working) and some will be spending wealth (retired). The interpretation then gets reasonably nuanced (you are in the x^th centile of people your age), and I suppose a touch problematic if you want to make cross cohort comparisons since current birth cohorts are spending far longer in education (and so have less time to accumulate wealth) as well as other structural factors (lack of access to the housing market) 

&gt; doesn't take account of large variations in necessary expenditure.

Isn't that part of the role of the equivalence scale? It's still a blunt instrument in the sense that it won't account for regional variation (for instance) but a think a fair chunk of variation in household expenditure is accounted for by household composition.

&gt;It singles out debates over faith schools, gay marriage and assisted dying as areas where religious beliefs are increasingly coming into conflict with a secular view.

&gt;The report also specifically highlights the way in which British Catholic adoption agencies which refused to place children with same-sex couples have been forced to close as an example of what it calls a “hierarchy of rights” in which equalities take precedence over religious rights.
The Prince said: “It is essential that governments honour their duty to uphold the right of people to practise their faith.

I sure am sorry that your freedom of religion does not include your freedom to discriminate against minorities you don't like.

&gt;Britain’s “future as a free society” depends on recognising the “crucial role” played by people of faith, he said.

**Price of product:** £19 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Clinique counter

**Product claims:** *Step 3 of Anti-Blemish Solutions 3-Step System. Lightweight, soothing formula helps treat existing blemishes, prevent future breakouts, control excess oil. Creates a barrier against blemish-causing agents. Lightly hydrates to minimize dryness, peeling.*

*Anti-Blemish Solutions All Over Clearing Treatment was known as Anti-Blemish Solutions Moisturizer.*

**About you:** Combo breakout prone, sensitive to exfoliation

**Your opinion:** I like this as a gentle leave on BHA treatment (I remember a study somewhere that showed gels/creams are less ""effective"" than alcohol-based acid toners/liquids). It's pretty lightweight and suits me best during Summer, but need an extra moisturiser on top for the colder/dryer months. Like most department store brands it's got a decent dose of silicons for that silky feeling that some hate/love. The preservative benzalkonium chloride is pretty interesting too, wiki says it's usually found in disinfectant products but is better than those alcohol hand sanitisers because of better residual activity and reduced irritation.

**Ingredients**: Water, cyclopentasiloxane, ppg-14 butyl ether, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, sucrose, steareth-21, acrylamide/sodium acryloydimethyl taurate copolymer, acetyl glucosamine, camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract, algae extract, laminaria saccharina extract, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, glycine, anthemis nobilis (chamomile), chamomilla recutita (matricaria), hinokitiol, menthol, salicylic acid, isohexadecane, caffeine, steareth-2, glycerin, quaternium-22, butylene glycol, polysorbate-80, phytosphingosine, pentylene glycol, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, benzalkonium chloride

&gt;

&gt;The __Peaky Blinders__ were a [criminal gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_gang) based in [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), England, in the late 19th century and, to a lesser extent, in the early 20th century. They were one of the urban youth gangs in the era, which were among the earliest of modern street subcultures.

They were pretty poor, but they played like previous seasons' West Ham in a lot of ways, and our old ability to keep clean sheets definitely shows that parking everyone in front of the goal makes it hard to score.

Our culture is supposed to value individuality and creativity &amp;ndash; school is more about conformity and rules. Oddly in some respects it resembles a prison more than the outside world, i.e. the ""real world"" that it's supposed to prepare children for.

I don't accept that uniforms have anything to do with bullying; that's almost certainly a red herring. Countries like Finland with no uniform code (which it has in common with most European countries) do very well academically, and I am not aware that they have a greater problem with bullying. Real reasons for bullying include things like homophobia, which the generally conservative high-school environment has not done much to oppose.

When you leave school and go to university, you need to adjust to an entirely different culture. Schools are oddly conservative places &amp;ndash; they place (what I would consider) undue emphasis on conformity, obedience and discipline. Universities, if they are any good, tend to emphasise individuality, initiative and creativity. So you need to decouple all of that authoritarian nonsense from the concept of ""education"" when you go to university.

Because medicine has done a hell of a lot to help us live longer, but IMV rather less to guarantee quality of life towards the end. 

The chances of developing Alzheimer's, for instance, are 20% at the age of 80, and close to 50% at 85. There is very little effective treatment today, and given the time it takes for anything to reach the market, even if a major breakthrough is made on Monday morning it's too late for anyone who starts showing symptoms in the next 5 or 10 years.

Cancer is another example. Yes, we can cure much more easily than we could even 10, 20 years ago - but 161,823 people died of cancer in 2012. And the process of going from outwardly healthy to dead is often a long, slow, painful one involving an awful lot of time in hospital on various opiates just to slightly numb the pain. Your nearest and dearest get front row seats to all this.

We usually know if a case is hopeless some time before it gets to that stage.

In other words, it ain't dead. It was your apparent confusion with this assertion that prompted my reply.

If you instead want to argue about the value of spending public money on the Welsh language, then fine.

First things first, I feel that the extent of public expenditure on the Welsh language should be made clear. In 2013-14, £25,076,000 was the budget allocated to the Welsh Language by the Welsh Government. In 2014-15, this fell to £24,376,000, and the budget is due to be cut further in the 2015-16 financial year, falling to £23,511,000 ([source](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/language-campaigners-demand-re-think-welsh-6257448)). Therefore, in 2014-15, expenditure on the Welsh language amounts to an impressive 0.16% of the Welsh Government's total managed expenditure of £15.7 billion, 0.37% of the health and social services budget, and 1.23% of the education budget ([source](http://wales.gov.uk/docs/caecd/publications/131203budget1415-meg-en.pdf)). Any claims, implied or otherwise, that spending on the Welsh language is holding back the provision of essential services are dubious at best.

Now, on to the reasons why I think public support for Welsh is wholly justified:

* It has the support of the people of Wales. Numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, all of which have found that governmental support for Welsh has a broad base of support. Moreover, the people of Wales continue to give their votes to parties whose stated aims include promoting the development of Wales as a  fully bilingual country. 
* It is the most utilitarian option for a second language for a child growing up in Wales. You are more likely to run into Welsh speakers in Wales on a regular basis than speakers of any foreign language, and knowledge of Welsh can also confer advantages in the jobs market given the existence of positions, particularly in the public sector, which require knowledge of Welsh. Of course, learning Welsh and learning a MFL at the same time are by no means impossible - and that is exactly what happens in schools across the country. 
* Some things are about more than simple economic utility. Knowledge of Welsh provides access to a vibrant Welsh language culture, which is as strong as it ever has been, producing a range of contemporary music, drama, literature and poetry. Support for the Welsh language is support for that culture and all the economic benefits and international recognition that it brings to Wales. 
* Lastly, I do believe that knowledge of Welsh really helps in expanding an individual's knowledge of Wales and Welsh identity. It opens up a treasure trove of culture - and provides access to certain viewpoints about what it means to be Welsh that are only really ever articulated by Welsh speakers. In a sense, it broadens your horizons. ",0,1415467617,null,0,1415474882,0,clwq9b1,t3_2lmd2n,t1_clwq9b1,t1_clwn32h,null,1426126469,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Back then, I would only ever pay attention to league results of Southampton FC. So when my uncle from Winchester got in touch and told me he had a ticket for me to see Southampton play at Wembley, I was a little perplexed, but *so* ready for it. I planned out a route and booked my travel tickets with (I thought) a bit of time to spare before the match.

It was an unforgettable day: I caught a flight from Stavanger to Heathrow. Took the Heathrow Express to Paddington. Hopped on the tube to Wembley Central on the Bakerloo line, with more and more red/white striped shirts entering as the station drew closer. I realised getting to the stadium from then on out wouldn't be a problem as throngs of fellow Saints fans marched down the streets. Even though I was in the company of strangers, I was no longer alone; what a great feeling! I'd figured out long beforehand which way round the stadium to go in order to find my entrance as quickly as possible, and everything was going smoothly. I found my uncle and cousins, and sat down for all of five seconds before [Invaders Must Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTw2YvutJRA) started playing on the PA system and the players sprinted onto the pitch.

&gt;I'm with him. Tying conflicts today to the world wars through the Poppy is a cynical way to try and silence dissent over contemporary wars.

So the division is clearly not just coming from the right. There are those on the ""left"" who want the poppy to only be about the world wars, they see the poppy as political and not just an act of remembrance.

It's not as though remembrance day was started to remember those who died in particularly heroic and just wars, it was started to remember the ""Glorious Dead"" who died in an imperialistic war commonly viewed as pointless where soldiers were willingly sacrificed by donkeys. The poppy appeal was started to raise funds for the survivors of that war, but since then we've continued to remember the dead and support the survivors of more recent wars.

I can't see how people wearing poppies and standing at the cenotaph are political statements, how it endorses the government, or silences dissent. Despite it being something of an act of solidarity with the armed forces, a warmongering government is going to have some doubts about such a prominent annual event that reminds people of the human costs of war.

There's approximately 50 weeks of the year when people aren't wearing poppies, plenty of time for anti-war statements and protests from even those who wear a poppy for a fortnight.",0,1415468378,null,0,false,1,clwql1j,t3_2lob2s,t1_clwql1j,t1_clwna7m,null,1426126251,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

You're right it seems like they're just using buzzwords.

All their product descriptions start with:

""[Product name has] unique anti-blemish and youth-boosting solution containing the maximum permitted level of spot-fighting active Salicylic Acid, combined with anti-shine Cimicifuga and a potent anti-ageing complex consisting of Lactic Acid, Phytoprotein and a Polyglycan.""

---
The maximum level of *Salicylic Acid* in the EU is 2%, so that's cool. Though I don't know why they don't just say, ""we have 2%"".

They claim *Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract* is a key ingredient in anti shine. But I can't seem to find any evidence to back that up. Only stuff about it being taken orally for menopause and menstrual pains. 

*Phytoprotein* - Hydrolyzed plant complex with a dermoprotective and hair restructuring action. In cleansing products, it reduces the harshness of traditional surfactants. In hair care products, it carries out a conditioning and restructuring action. In skin treatment products, it acts as a protective and moisturizer. PARABEN-FREE. Liquid. ([source](http://www.sinerga.it/cosmetic_ingredients/products/functional_ingredients/40/PHYTOPROTEIN.html))


*Polyglycan* - Polyglycan® Sterile Solution is a commercially available patented formulation of hyaluronic acid, sodium chondroitin sulfate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine used for post-surgical lavage of synovial compartments. ([source](http://www.arthrodynamic.com/polyglycan/))

Weird that Glycolic acid is way down the list below Lactic and Salicylic. I really don't like that it's a peel off mask, I've never liked how my skin felt after a peel off mask, always a bit raw.

*Magnesium Aluminum Silicate* is Kanolin clay, which is interesting, I guess this is to help the anti shine? 

*Olea Europaea Fruit Oil* olive oil! So if you have a sensitivity to this, be wary.

*BHT* is a [Polyphenol antioxidant](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients/polyphenolantioxidants), but it's sooooo low down the ingredient list.

~ [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7e09164640.html)

The ingredient list is looking very very familiar at this point.

*Palmaria Palmata Extract* looks interesting as there are claims that it has polyphenol antioxidant properties, but I can't seem to find anything that says so that isn't sponsored.

I really wish the *Bisabolol* was in any of the serums as it's a great anti irritant. It's a bit wasted in the cleanser.

Today was completely different as we attacked constantly and always had the threat of scoring goals. I am very frustrated at the poor finishing displayed today which somewhat reminded me of last year when we would make chances but would always fail to score.

Why Cole was brought on instead of Carroll and Nolan was brought on instead of Amalfitano is a mystery to me, but I can't help but feel that if Carroll had had 15 minutes, we would have won that game.

Would automation sweep in easily and take all those jobs? The role of a blue collar worker can be highly varied and needn't necessarily be sidelined by automation depending on the task at hand. We're forced to be vague there as we can cherry pick jobs that support automation and can't function without a human hand. 

Boiling everything right down we seem to have a vaguely simple choice (but not a simple fix): Either the blue collars of Britain re-educate in skilled areas with jobs, or jobs are created, or we consign ourselves to the idea that groups of people will be unable to work for much of their lives due to a lack of opportunity, money to change their circumstances (education isn't necessarily cheap or easy to come by - especially if you're not an 'attractive' candidate for it)?

He didn't change again until the movie in which he doesn't regenerate but possesses the body of a human. I'd count this as his 15th body as his 14th had been destroyed at this point. He is then sucked into the eye of harmony and we don't see him again until Utopia, in which he states he was brought back by the timelords to fight in the war but instead ran away. I'm assuming that he did this with the first body of his new set of regenerations ie his 16th body overall. He then regenerates in to his 17th body, takes over Earth and gets shot by his wife at which point he refuses to regenerate, seemingly to spite The Doctor but actually because he had plans in place to be resurrected without needing to use a regeneration. I'm counting this as the same body. He then does some off screen heroics to stop Rassilon escaping the timewar and was never heard from again until last weeks episode. So Missy is by my count at least her 18th body and 3rd in the current regenerational cycle.  But we don't know what happened after he ran back into the timewar (at time of writing, who knows what might be revealed in tonight's episode?) so the body count might actually be higher.

Your point about the midfield is well taken. Last year when Suarez or Sturridge would come in field to take passes Henderson or Coutinho would run behind them making it so the opposing CBs couldn't just bring the line up, and that would open space between the lines, but now there is just Balotelli kind of jogging around, getting vaguely marked while their midfielders press Gerrard and shut us down. It's easy. Last year, despite the prodigious goalscoring of Suarez and Sturridge there was so much movement and cycling from the front line to the midfield that there was no one way to defend us but now all it takes is 8 competent professional footballers setting up two banks of four and waiting for Hendo or Gerrard to give them the ball back.

So what if the party has some former tory members and donors? It doesn't mean their polices will become tory, on the contrary, the tory stance is becoming more UKIP.

Removal of tax from the minimum wage is not pandering, it's them saying that no tax on the minimum wage is what they want. Other parties in fact, are pandering to UKIP. 

&gt;Most of their supports know little about them besides they want to get out of the EU ""because our country is being run from Brussels init"" or ""stop the immigrants taken er jerbs"" because the low wages have nothing to do with the corporations paying a little as possible for work right? It is all the immigrants fault apparently.

However true this may be, there are people who understand the stance of UKIP much better than the ""immigrantz taken our jerbs"" group. This is also common with most parties- ""I vote labour because my parents do""  or ""voting tory because they will offer an EU referendum"". This isn't uncommon, most voters vote for parties because of a few issues very important to them, e.g. immigration, the economy, EU ect.


&gt;They are barely a political party because anything they say in terms of policies that gets negative attention gets scrapped the next day. Their own deputy leader claimed the NHS has failed and he wants a privatised health service like that in america.

  
They are very clearly a [major politcial party](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10674846/Ukip-must-be-treated-like-any-major-party-Ofcom-rules.html) and they have no *official* policies for 2015. Also, the deputy leader doesn't dictate the party, he has ideas like anyone else, and like anyone else, some are idiotic.

&gt;They are a party of the rich looking to get richer and use protest votes and ignorance of the general public to do it. Hence why outside of fighting the EU their main message has been ""fight back against the establishment and join the peoples army"". Which is the biggest load of fucking shit I have ever heard. It means nothing and serves only to drum up support using emotions instead of actual policies.

They are not a party that wants the rich to get richer, even if you want to believe this, it's false. The party speaks to people in a way many parties simply cannot, hence why they got within 600 votes of a thought to be safe labour seat, why they're on course to win Rochester and why a Survation Poll that prompted UKIP, put them on 24% against the tories at 27%. 


Whatever you may think of UKIP, you cannot deny they have made huge progress in a year, they won a national election, many people including UKIP supporters though they were not going to get any seats in the general election, now they are about to get their 2nd, and may get 3-10 in the next general election.

false,pennypenny22,null,null,"**Name of product:** Glycolic acid 10% peel. This peel also comes in strengths of 20,30,40,50 and 60%.

**Price of product:** £6.60 for 30ml of peel, fan brush to apply with and 50ml neutralising gel.

**Where did you purchase:**http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/glycolic-acid-229-p.asp

**Product claims:** ""Exfoliates dead skin cells from the surface leaving the skin softer, smoother, and brighter. Encourages skin cell turnover and boosts collagen production.""

**Your opinion:** This is a rinse off weekly peel, which you leave on for a maximum of seven minutes, working up to that by increasing a minute each week. It will sting if you're not used to acids, use a gentle acid toner for at least a month before starting on stronger peels. This does leave my skin smoother and softer and reduces PIH and redness. It's a good price point too. However, I think for me milder daily use acids are more effective, so I'll use this up but likely won't buy again. Tested at a pH of 3.

**Ingredients:** Peel: Glycolic Acid, Water, Glycerine, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide.

No other party has had to completely disavow their previous manifesto however so most people generally know what their party stands for except for UKIP. No other party leader has had to say they didn't even read their previous manifesto and say it was a load of rubbish despite the fact that that particular person actually approved it back in 2010.

So straight away UKIP are untrustworthy.

&gt;his is also common with most parties- ""I vote labour because my parents do""

However for the majority of those parties, people arent voting for them for that one misinformed reason. Unlike UKIP.

&gt;They are not a party that wants the rich to get richer, even if you want to believe this, it's false. 

Oh honey.

What we have is essentially a perception that cheap labour through immigration is depriving people of jobs - I have no idea how accurate this is so I'm not going to comment - coupled with a government desperate to keep the welfare bill down and cut it where possible, likely resulting in destruction of programmes that may actually get people into work. The result is a working class that feel like they're getting a kicking. 

We really need to be willing to train people and help people into work a bit more thoroughly than the token efforts we are doing now. The welfare trap as it is known is, in my opinion, more a product of a workforce being incapable of moving into meaningful employment than it is of welfare being better than meaningful employment - we really aren't doing enough.

What we need is for a society where when a worker cannot get a job and feel they have been undercut, be it by foreign labour or whatnot, they have options. They should be able to decide that it's time they tried something new and there should be options. They should be able to decide they want to attend courses or a certified training program, backed by a welfare programme that ensures they don't starve while doing these that actually provides them with the information they need to get on them. What we have is a welfare programme which makes a token nod towards this, but does nothing.

I do doubt that. One reason the tories haven't dropped far behind labour is because people are voting based on 1 thing, the leader, and Ed Miliband is worse rated than nick clegg, there is also a single point to people voting tory from labour, is because they will offer an EU referendum.

&gt;But when you look at it as a byelection with a 36% turnout when the amount of rain that day can decide who ends up winning the near victory looks a lot less impressive.

Nope, I still find it quite impressive, UKIP came within 600 votes of winning a safe labour seat, we'll see at the general election if the result changes. I also find it impressive that[ UKIP are polling in 1st/2nd place in 26 constituencies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29568123). 

&gt;Unfortunately a party based on ""fighting the establishment"" and ""the peoples army"" and ""fuck the EU"" I find that unimpressive. Because the BNP did the same thing and gained a similar surge in popularity (albiet not as big), only they collapsed due to them being too obviously racist.

Yes, of course you find it unimpressive because you do not align with their views. If say, the green party were polling at the levels of UKIP, I do doubt you'd be saying the same.

false,Morsrael,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"&gt;One reason the tories haven't dropped far behind labour is because people are voting based on 1 thing, the leader, and Ed Miliband is worse rated than nick clegg

This has a different issue being most of the media is inherently right wing and hates Ed Milliband due to Leveson and him coming out against the Sun especially. Seriously when was the last time you saw a big mistake made by cameron in the newspapers instead of some pointless article based around getting a picture where ed looks funny (albiet not exactly a difficult thing to do"")? There is a lot less mainstream information on ed milliband as a leader because every news story is he looks funny and doesn't like bacon and very little about his policies.

&gt;UKIP came within 600 votes of winning a safe labour seat, we'll see at the general election if the result changes. I also find it impressive that UKIP are polling in 1st/2nd place in 26 constituencies[1] . 

Again, byelections will not change who enters number 10. It won't change the current government. So they are mostly protest votes and like I said the rain can easily stop most people even bothering to vote. So no it is unimpressive. Similar things could be said about polling. If they actually gain seats in the GE when their policies have actually come under scrutiny then I will consider them a real political party and not a hateful protest vote against the establishment.

&gt;If say, the green party were polling at the levels of UKIP, I do doubt you'd be saying the same.

Why do you think I support the greens? A lot of their policies are insane.

Anyway I would say the exact same thing is then greens gained popularity not on their policies and ideas, but on appeal to the ignorance of the masses and fuck the government attitude.",0,1415473235,null,0,false,0,clwsqya,t3_2lo27f,t1_clwsqya,t1_clwsi97,null,1426125243,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Given Bacuna Senderos Clark Richardson Cole Bent.

GK - Given. RB - Bacuna. CB - Senderos. LB - Richardson. MF - Bacuna/Richardson/Cole. CF - Bent.


There is literally no tactical point in having 2 center backs on the bench. One is always enough to cover the possibility of injury. Clark only came on because Lambert got scared that Carroll was coming on. All it meant is we were stuck in our own box and Carroll got 2 free headers anyway.

To give you an idea of how multicultural the UK is I'll describe my local area. Although I live further North in a small town south of Birmingham. There's a lot of people of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani descent around here but London is even more diverse:

1. 30 seconds walk from my house there are 3 Indian restaurants (all awesome food!!).
2. My family doctor (GP) is Indian and he's cool and everyone likes him. The GP practice has 4 other doctors - 2 of which are Indian.
3. One of my best friends from university is an 'Atheist Catholic' Indian doctor (long story).
4. The nearest garage (gas station) is owned by a cool Sikh family who everyone knows.
5. There's a small local shop also owned by a cool Sikh family\*. 
6. There's 2 Chinese restaurants about 1 minutes walk away. 
7. Oh and the traditional British Fish &amp; Chip shop is owned by a really laid back, friendly Indian guy and his sons who make great kebabs, curries and fish and chips.
8. There's a pizza place next to the Indian restaurants run by a cool Turkish family.
9. About 90% of the local taxi services are guys of Pakistan Muslim descent. The only time anyone gets testy about them is during Eid when they put the prices up!! But that's understandable! ;p It's only like Brits charging more to work Xmas day.
10. People of Indian descent have been a part of UK culture for much longer than the US due to the Raj. It could be argued that curry is like a second national dish in the UK its that popular.

I'm quite proud of what that the UK has managed to accomplish with its patchwork of cultures. The country would be so boring if we didn't have Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Poles, Afro-Caribbean, etc. I love being able to buy take away baltis or kebabs, chat about Islam with my taxi driver and eat Polish sandwiches.

Your more likely to be noticed as American when you speak. In which case people may make fun of you for being a 'Yanky'. But it would be all light hearted.

We've got plenty of electronic signs, plenty of cameras and police. We have the odd 20mph ""school zones"" but why am I driving slower passed a school zone at 3am? Just incase a 5 year old decided to pop in early? My local school has 30mph speed limits outside the front, but then every 6th former illegally parks their car opposite the zig zag yellow school zone stripe. I genuinely think we can make everyone safer by applying a sensible approach to traffic law. The person who consistently drivers at 30mph on the 50mph road and causes traffic mayhem needs to be taken off the road more than the person who goes 60mph because it's quiet. In recent years the drop in fatalities has a huge amount to do with the collapse in drink driving numbers, and the prevention of phone use is going to have the same effect, making these things unacceptable (not illegal) does more than any speed limit.

Yeah like I said, horseshit. You doing a Twitter search for #righttodie and seeing literally thousands of supporters does not give your argument any credence at all. You signing an e-petition and seeing thousands of names on the website means jack shit. You seeing a Facebook group called ""Let People Die In Dignity"" accumulate 100,000 ""Likes"", and then seeing another campaign called ""No right to assisted suicide"" get only 2,500 Likes means nowt. Neither does you downvoting me and seeing my comment score in the net negative. 

One of the main reasons we don't have capital punishment any more is because we might accidentally kill the wrong person - and there's no going back once the deed is done. Seems illogical for me to be in favour of this measure when many, many many more people would kill themselves on pressure of loved ones, or society itself implying a significant number of people are telling them they are no longer of any use and their life should be considered an option. We mustn't encourage the idea that one must weigh up the pros and cons of continuing ones life, because it is all too easy to put undue emphasis on the cons, often without basis in reality. An ill person could very well not be in a correct mental state to decide, it's not like we can quantitively measure how sound of mind someone is. Even if there was no ""direct"" pressure from a relative or a doctor, the mere fact that the law would exist would place pressure upon people to kill themselves. *5 years to live? May as well end it now .. I cost too much to care for, i'm a burden to the treasury, i'm taking up a bed a younger person could have* etc. An elderly person may be suffering from depression and decide to end themselves, only that may be depression could well pass but it's too late then. You wouldn't tell a mentally sound person ""you can kill yourself if you want to"", you would discourage it bc we recognise that we don't exist in a vacuum but are rather interdependent on each other and owe a basic duty of care to other human beings.",0,1415475839,null,0,1415551893,0,clwtwj2,t3_2lod5j,t1_clwtwj2,t1_clws2py,null,1426124705,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

Personally I would go with Lovren and Balotelli for Borini and Kolo. Not for the usual reasons but because of what Rodgers said awhile back. He improves players on the training ground. He needs to let those players settle and slowly improve and be played in the easier games. 

Our biggest problem is the lack of intensity/organisation in matches and those replacements bring that. I think we need to do that until Christmas and then you'll see Lovren and Balotelli improve by then. Just like the whole team improved by January in Rodgers first season.


This will give us our intensity back short term and by January it will feel like we have two new signings in Balo and Lovren.

Except that is not strictly true. The Terrorism Act has a very loose definition of terrorism. Trying to kill a head of state can definitely come under that.

Even under your tighter definition you can argue killing a head of state is terrorism. After all, if someone can kill the Queen, they've already directly influence when the heir comes to the thrown. Their actions will also have a direct affect on the government and it's next moves as well. For all we know they could be connected to a larger group who is trying to gain influence over the government, something which may or may not be shared in the future.

&gt; All of a sudden because apparently anyone who is a Muslim and is commuting a crime is suddenly a terrorist.

Or maybe it's because the biggest terrorist groups that threaten the UK and the West, are groups who call themselves Muslims.

I'm not saying all Muslims, or even the majority of Muslims support these terrorists actions, and I am definitely not saying there is something in Islam that encourages terrorism. What I am saying is that right now there are a large number of nutters who call themselves Muslims,and who are also part of terrorist groups that threaten the UK and the West.

&gt;Those are the only choices Spurs have at the centre of defence

Missing Dier.

&gt;Mousa Dembele is half the player he used to be, 

Eh wat. He's getting forward more than he used to, iirc he would get about 20 yards from the box and stay there almost bewildered about what to do next. He's looked more positive going forward so far this year in general than I can remember before, I would like to see him take a shot or two more though.

&gt;Benjamin Stambouli and Nabil Bentaleb are squad members at best, while Paulinho is on the way out.

Stam's had what, &lt;10 games and Bentaleb's 19. **19**. I wasn't aware players stop developing in their teens. When Bale was 19 he didn't really play that much iirc. Neither are to be judged yet.

&gt;In normal seasons, Spurs would look at a visit from Stoke as an all-but-definite three points. 

Wat. Stoke were generally a tough to break down team and were a good counter. Pulis knew how to play it.

&gt;Meanwhile, it is Spurs who have been increasingly looking for the long ball forward in the hope that someone can get on the end of it.

This isn't the same long ball Stoke of a few years ago, Hughes has really improved their football. Oh but of course, Stoke still rely on the patented Delap throw.",0,1415477409,null,0,false,0,clwukxu,t3_2lp33s,t1_clwukxu,t3_2lp33s,null,1426124387,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

He officially represented several groups Al-Muhajiroun, Al Ghurabaa, Muslims Against Crusades and Islam4UK and had close links to Hizb ut-Tahrir, The Saviour Sect and Need4Khilafah. The largest of these groups is around 10,000 members depending on whether the UK government bans them or not. They would say that he 'officially' represents their views. You saying otherwise doesn't change anything.

&gt; The point is I could easily land a few thousand twitter followers

You appear to have a problem with numbers (dyslexia?). 20,000 is not a few thousand and I doubt you're interesting enough to get past a few thousand.

&gt; None of the many Muslim bodies in the UK have appointed him in charge. 

No but there's several groups that point to him as a leading proponent - read the above list. When your planning to kill and murder paperwork isn't your strong point.

So, seeming as how you opened this large can of worms, lets just see if he does represent the views of 'normal everyday muslims'.

A 2005 report by YouGov said that one in 4 Muslims (24%) expressed sympathy for the motive of the July 7 bombings. 6% polled (representing 100,000 muslims) FULLY SUPPORTED their actions and said they were completely justified. A third of all those polled agreed with the statement ""Western society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to bring it to an end"". 1% (representing 16,000) declare themselves ""willing, possibly even eager, to embrace violence.""

If you head outside the UK things get far worse. Places like Jordan and Lebanon where research has been done show that the majority of the population (57% and 73% respectably) say that suicide attacks are fully justified on civilians.

It may be hard for you to read this - but it's the truth. Saying that Chowdry is a hardline wing nut that represents absolutely no one in the Muslim community is nonsense. The vast majority ARE probably the most peace loving, honest, kindest people we have in this country, but a significant number are and that is not or even close to zero.

For those who never fall prey to the fame illusion, the TV shows mean nothing. But for those who like to dream, the shows allow them to dream.

I fully get the reason for insurance. But there needs to be a breaking point. How is £2-3k seen as a ""normal"" policy. Are there really that many accidents on British roads. I thought we had some of the safest roads out there.

We worked the ball out of the back on the ground and held possession relatively well considering we had no real attacking threat.  None of this is to say that Gerrard is the only problem, or to minimize the amazing things he has done for the club - but I think unless Rodgers wants to switch to a 3-5-2 there is no way to Gerrard can play at the same time as two strikers",0,1415481039,null,0,false,0,clww5m9,t3_2log2e,t1_clww5m9,t1_clwovdq,null,1426123582,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Nothing, turns out. Instead we got a terrible, bullshit resolution which involved Danny saving the day because we all know he had to at some point.

Some of the worst hurt for me comes from the fact that BOTH of the clips from the Next Time trailer for Dark Water were red herrings. The TARDIS key scene and ""Clara Oswald has never existed!"" made me really excited about the Missy-Clara connection and wondering what she meant. Turns out neither were what they looked like.

false,[deleted],null,null,"To sort of add/ respond to this train of thought:

We had a string of maybe five or so good results under Sherwood before the same old problems resurfaced. Our problem is far deeper than a manager's philosophy. Short term, I agree blame partially the players: there are a number of parasitic personalities in the dressing room, Adebayor prime among them. The fact that the exact same problems-- rudimentary problems like a lack of movement, poor defensive positioning, and crowding passing channels don't go away among a crop of ostensibly talented players is disconcerting and leads me to believe that dressing room politics are in serious disorder.

But the fact of the matter is that there is a divide in how our managers conceive the team playing and the bigger picture of the club's management structure that is generating a lot of tension. The transfer committee is so woefully disconnected from concerns for management style and squad needs that we can't even integrate our biggest transfer talents.

Poch has not been a perfect manager, but his track record and expectations, and furthermore, the fire he seems to have in his belly have shown me that with backing, his style of play will take us forward. He's made questionable tactical decisions, has been overly-cautious with Kane, but more often than not, gets his subs right on the money, and seems to be mending our side's wounded mentality when we give up opportunities. Progress is a process that requires time and resources. New tactical systems are not self-evident for players, and managers ought to always be given a pre-season and full run at the league to prove their muster. For their own sake as well as ours as supporters, I hope the club hierarchy realizes this and actually back Poch. 

Players are ephemeral; a managerial system that works with players whose abilities suit it is what defines a club's style and on-pitch identity. Stability is key, and Levy has backed himself into a corner.",0,1415481643,null,0,false,0,clwwf4s,t3_2lp33s,t1_clwwf4s,t1_clwufsc,null,1426123460,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Last year and three years ago we as a group of 9 went to McHugh's and it is a pretty good joint, decent prices and they gave us a long time on the upper floor which kept us all together, Staff are lovely too.

Two years ago we went to the Kitchen Bar which was alright again Staff where accommodating, but the food wasn't at the same level as McHugh's 

This year we are off to Flame on Howard Street, its a fairly new joint, looks decent inside lovely smell and atmosphere and a fairly decent choice of items on their Christmas menu.

some food for thought :)

All in all, I give this season 8.5/10 and it's my favorite season of NuWho so far. 

Stray Thoughts: 

* Clara pretending to be the Doctor to the three Cybermen were fun to see. She even mentioned the questionable status of the Doctor's kids and grandkids! 

* I enjoyed Michelle Gomez's performance as Missy thoroughly these past two episodes. I hope this isn't the last we've seen of her in this show.

* Holy crap, The Brigadier came back as a Cyberman? I hope he comes back in the show later in some form because that's too big of a thing to not mention again in this show. 

* Osgood :(. I didn't think it would be permanent.

* I'm not too sure about the Christmas special. The preview didn't do much for me.

* The Doctor discovering that Missy lied to him again was devastating.

* I hope Clara shows up later in the show. Either Clara Prime or one of the time-splintered Clara.",0,1415482418,null,0,1415502385,0,clwwror,t3_2lpgwc,t1_clwwror,t3_2lpgwc,null,1426123297,60,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,60

Also, if the Master has gone again, what a waste of a brilliant character and actor. She needs to be the main nemesis next series! Lets hope she just teleported away.
