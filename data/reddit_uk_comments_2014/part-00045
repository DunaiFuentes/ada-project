Some started as major groups and are open to all. Others are invitation only while some are closed shut to everyone outside. They have a hundered times more members than Cfcuk. They are seperated by nationalities, ideology, interests while all having Chelsea as the focal point. You will find Chelsea gamers Africa and then Chelsea supporters table tennis enthusiasts of China.

These groups all stem from the major groups where some people became friends or saw similarities with other posters and made a more light hearted and smaller group, these then even go on to become smaller ones.

If you search for ""Chelsea football fancast"" group on Facebook you will notice its same sense of community as well as it's smaller groups of friends branching out. I bet you that posts on it will offend most of you here.

 Cfcuk is nothing different from those smaller groups made by friends. 

If we were being elitist why would most of us post here on a regular basis? I post here everyday and behave like everyone else does here and over there I can do a little bit more of pissing about because I know those people. If anything I put nore effort in posts here not to piss off you sensitive lot while I spew total bollocks over there at times. This is because when a sub grows you lose this sense of community and only some retain it. /r/formula1 is a good example which grew big but it still has that same sense of private jokes and we regulars know each other and the knowabouts. A time will come when we will look like pricks talking between ourselves when the community outnumbers us so obviously we will create a more private area to piss about.

Please stop these elitist claims. If you aren't in cfcuk it isn't because you aren't elite and they are, it is purely because we don't know you and you don't know us and what's the point of making it awkward for someone and adding theme when they won't give a toss to our idiocy.",0,1392416161,null,0,false,0,cffiy5g,t3_1xx0xz,t1_cffiy5g,t1_cffi6rp,null,1432400910,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

I wouldn't say the castle is that amazing. I mean, I guess as Americans you'll be pretty impressed, but it's quite empty and there aren't many exhibits to look at. Have an explore of Princes Street Gardens below it afterwards as that's lovely, and from there you can loop round the New Town and along George Street (Urban Angel does wonderful food!), back across North Bridge and have a good walk around the much older and more wandery Old Town. You could also try and climb Arthurs Seat if the weather is good, but I suspect that will be more energy than either of you will have after your flight!

The Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street is very good, and don't forget to find the statue of Greyfriars Bobby and pat his head.

Cfcuk isn't some bastion of shining hope for all discussion, it is just a place where we can be ourselves. You aren't missing out on anything if you are not a part of it because you wont like it even if you were. The only reason you'd be joining would be to talk between friends. Yes we are more open to opinons and it is more discussion focused but that is natural and there are no rules for it.


People get in by a referral basis. You aren't required to be elite or whatever punch word is being repeated in this thread at this moment.

 For example someone read your comment and thought it was funny/good and would fit in well at the other sub even though you wrote it not knowing the content on the other sub so you belong there in the first place. Nothing is required of you and there are no quality checks or employee evaluation. You get in, you be yourself and we respect you for it no matter how much we disagree. I've unfortunately even broken these rules yet they dealt with me respectfully.

Also no one has been kicked out of cfcuk apart from some people starting drama here. That should tell you how 'elitist' we are when we kicked off people trying to start shit by creating threads here promoting drama between the two places. No one had been removed as far as I know.

You seem to have very strong opinions about that place and are failing to accept anything I'm telling you. That place just isn't for you because of your preconception.

This really isn't true, they obviously have very high standards, but they also have an emphasis on blooding in home grown talent- more so than any top club in the world. Pedro for example was played heavily as he was developing; Cuenca, Tello and Bartra likewise to a certain degree, but if you look at the team- very few players in it were bought in for big money in their prime (they very rarely buy more than 2 players per season).

Whilst Deulofeu will not be a regular first teamer for a good few years to come, I could easily see him becoming a valuable fringe player for Barca- but it depends on if they think he will develop better in that system, or on Merseyside.

It angered me at the time, because it was so taken out of context, clearly by someone who has a massive axe to grind, and missed that pretty much 95% of what we say on /r/CFCUK is hugely sarcastic (which is one reason why it wouldn't work well as a public sub).

I was stunned that people were believing EMD's post, as I thought the satire was really blatant. You can see here how it wasn't planned - why would I be so surprised otherwise? 

ATIWHS's post is then saying - ""it can't have been us upvoting it, there isn't enough of us"" - I fail to see how this is apparently evidence of brigading. 

EnglishMD is obviously taken the piss out of himself. The JoMo was something he once joked about, as the nickname 'Mou' annoys him, and so he started using it on /r/chelseafc to see if anyone would comment, and apparently it caught on with a few people. (Other nicknames for Jose on /r/CFCUK include Moudog). 

The rest of it is again quite clearly a joke. 

It looks bad if you're not in on the joke, but to someone who is, it's really funny to see our comments where we are just joking around being painted as some sort of malicious plot to take down an entire subreddit.

Then there are thinner parts of the skin like the eyelids that are less red and have more blue, unless it is an older gentlemen then you see a redness come through around the eyes.

The next thing you have to think about is hair follicles in the face.  These will send a cooler tone where a beard and mustache would have grown.

Rest Flanagan as he has played a lot of games on the bounce since back from injury and also give Kelly a chance to prove himself. 

Agger in for Toure is only sensible as he is a left footed CB. Nothing to do with any howlers (which I think are more to do with him playing further to the left than anything).

That is three changes from the one we played against them last week. Agger is an improvement. Kelly and Flanno are on par at the moment.

I just hope Teixeira gets another run out.

true,alister667,lfc68,,"I'm sorry to disappoint, I'm a long distance fan (Northern Ireland), and to be completely honest after Heysel and Hillsborough in the 80's I grew away from football for a good while. 

It was partly growing up and finding beer, women and pubs I suppose... I was always a fan, but I didn't follow the team as closely, certainly not as closely as I do now. My local club, Portadown were going through something of a golden period of their own, but I'd always keep an eye on Liverpool. 

My fondest memories are from childhood, my first football memories are of the 1977 season. David Fairclough, Supersub, coming on and scoring a wondergoal (I think it was that famous match against St. Ettienne). I remember asking my Dad why didn't Fairclough get to start he match since he was obviously brilliant. Dad told me that was how good Liverpool were that even a player that good couldn't make the starting 11. It was an amazing match. I think I was hooked then. The '77 FA Cup was a travesty against Man U. I was furious! 

Then the European Cup Final. What a match. By then I knew the players, Phil Neal, Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan and Emlyn Hughes. Kevin Keegan was my favourite. I remember reading and re-reading the Kevin Keegan 1977 Football Annual. I was distraught when i learned he was leaving. He was tireless and had that rare ability to raise a team to his level, really pull the whole team up, the way Gerard could do  at his peak. Winning that match against Borussia Mönchengladbach was glorious. My little team stood against the best in Europe and won! This was something only the big clubs of Europe won, and Liverpool had somehow won? Incredible. 

I was relieved that even without my hero Keegan, Liverpool, and their new Scottish signing, a fella called Dalglish, were still unbeatable in Europe, although the final against Bruges wasn't as good a match as the '77 final it was great to see Kenny score the winner, a wee dink over the onrushing keep (as I remember).

Over the next few years Liverpool and Notts Forest slugged it out for the crown of best team in Europe - my Dad was a fan of Brian Clough, so we always had plenty of rivalry, but I always liked Cloughy myself and I cheered  them on any time I got to see them playing against European opposition.

I remember Graeme Souness, although he was a disaster as a manager, being a midfielder of immense toughness. I swear I remember him playing in a European Cup match recieving the ball near the centre circle, when an opposition player made a move to close him down. Souness glared at him, and he oppostition midfielder stopped in his tracks, and backed off, terrified.

To be honest by the end of the 80's Liverpool's success was taken somewhat for granted. I look back now and wish I'd paid more attention to the likes of John Barnes. I thought this was just me, but I saw Hansen talking about bringing the League Trophy around Anfield in 1990 and it was expected, taken for granted. We were Liverpool, of course we would win the league. That's the way it was, and the way it always would be. Wouldn't it?

I remember I was at university at the start of the 1990s and watching the Man U vs Notts Forest FA Cup Semi-Final. It was likely to be Fergie's last match if they lost, but they won. I disliked Man U, of course, and I remember saying to a mate that I hope he keeps his job, because he's useless and Man U would never win a damned thing with him as manager.

Yeah, that as all my fault, I'm afraid.  

The best matches from memory were the two 4-3's against Keegan's Newcastle. I listened to both those on the radio and I remember jumping round the room when Collymore scored. To be honest I still like to listen to football on the radio. I think it's partly nostalgia.

In 2005 I followed the European run from a pub in Antrim. With each win I became convinced that watching from the pub was a lucky charm, but for the final I couldn't get night shift off work. Again, I had to listen on the radio. We were 3-0 down and I was fixing a machine when I heard someone cheer. I finished up as quickly as humanly possible to get back to the radio. I still rememer facing a window, fists clenched, eyes shut as the penalties were being taken. It was amazing.

I found /r/LiverpoolFC a few years ago (about 2010 I think), and it's made a huge difference to how closely I follow the team. All of a sudden I know who's injured, what the latest rumours are, news from the club, I get a good idea of what other supporters think of the team. The Carling Cup win under Kenny was special, since I'd started following things much closer.

This year has been very, very special. The team is playing as well as I've ever seen, we're not as consistent, nor as tight at the back as in 2009, but going forward we're just scary. I think the consistency will come with a little more time, but this team can play at a level I've never seen before.

TL;DR That went on bit. I support Liverpool.",0,1392426866,null,0,false,0,cffn6y4,t3_1xw3rv,t1_cffn6y4,t1_cffjknb,null,1432402911,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

As in he very well could be, but from what I've seen of him I'm still undecided. He's got talent, but that's not always enough. And we have players of a similar age who have developed a lot this season. I'm *not sure* he'll be able to make that step up to hold down a regular spot in our first team.

Are you suggesting Southampton are at the same level as us? Surely I don't have to point out that none of Southampton's players would make it into our first 11, with the exception of maybe, perhaps Lallana, so therefore it's perfectly feasible to suggest that a player like Suso would certainly be good enough for them, no? It'd do him good to play for a mid table club that play at a high tempo with hard pressing. What's your point exactly? You think he's good enough for our first 11? If not, what club do you think he should go on loan to? It really needs to be a Premier League club now. It needs to be one with a similar style and method to us. You've got Southampton and Swansea to pick from essentially. I picked Southampton because I think they press harder than Swansea, and are more tactically discipled, which I think would do Suso the world of good.

The other big game that comes to mind is [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-4UG1S6rQI), which was as big for us as it was for city, as we as good as needed to win to stay in the premiership (although in the end some other results went our way and we stayed in the premiership anyway).

Som players from the past that I hope someone a bit older and wiser than me can tell you about include Gerry Francis (who later became our manager for a while) Trevor Sinclair ([who scored what some people still think of as one of the greatest ever goals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcIR6ftJuk)) and David Seaman, ex-England goalkeeper with funny hair. 

Present players to look out for are (in my opinion) Niko Kranjcar, Joey Barton ([who is about as nice off the pitch as he is on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegUySZ7gUA)) and Charlie Austin.

Hope this helps.

Edit: I forgot to mention that at the moment, we aren't exactly the most liked club in the world.

Every team is dropping points, no one looks steady. This won't be ""squeaky bum time"", this will be a shit show.

I won't say we are likely to win, though I think we have a stronger bid than some. I will say no one is likely to win, but someone has to. You can't pick a team out of this mess and say ""they are the likely winners"". At best, maybe, you could pick 2 and say it is more likely that one of these 2 will win. But that is a stretch for sure. 

In the first half of the season we gave 3 points to Arsenal, City, and Chelsea. We've settled the score with Arsenal and I think we will do the same (hopefully with the same flare) with the other two. Those results won't put us on top, but it will put us a game away from top. 

Maybe I handle disappointment better than others, so I don't feel the need to insulate myself against the hope. Right now I'm buzzing with hope! This is the real shit right now.

I requested access to it at one point and never got a response, but I'm not bitter since I comment infrequently at best, and besides it would be pretty petty of me to hold a grudge for something as silly as access (or lack thereof) to a site on the internet.

Seriously, it seems like some people here are determined to stir up drama and get offended. It's a little ridiculous. Members of /r/cfcuk are all over this thread responding calmly and rationally to the people who were upset over this whole situation, and their arguments are being ignored in favor of circlejerking and unfounded angst. It's pretty discouraging, and also very much demonstrative of why they wanted a separate community in the first place.

Prior to all of this bullshit, /u/EnglishMD was the user that probably contributed the most meaningful and interesting content of anyone in this subreddit, and it sickens me that he's gotten chased out like this. It's a massive loss for this subreddit and people seem to be ignoring that fact in favor of this rhetoric that he's some sort of elitist troll. Besides that one post every one of his contributions to this subreddit has been nothing but helpful and informative.

Similarly, /u/lachiendupape was an excellent mod and contributed greatly to this sub with his transfer roundups and loan reports, among other insightful additions. The crucifixion that occurred after a simple joke was one of the most humorless, ridiculous responses I've ever seen.

And to add to all that, there seems to be a downvote brigade here that's burying any pro-cfcuk sentiment in the thread. You guys are just proving them right, you realize that don't you?

I'm placing my hopes in us finishing at least 4th purely so that we can have a return of those great Champions League nights, can have a bit more pull to transfer targets, and so we can show everyone involved in the club that we are heading in the right direction (which would hopefully lead to Suarez staying and a new contract for Rodgers, two big issues to face this off-season).

I think 99% of people understand 4th or 3rd would represent a huge season, and that winning the title is unlikely.

First of all, despite everything you've all said in /r/cfcuk 's defence, it still sounds very elitist and unnecessarily exclusive. Heres why I dislike /r/cfcuk and **feel like** down-voting it's members when I see them post.

1. It's exclusive. It sounds like a place for good quality discussion about our club, and I don't like that not everyone can read/contribute. I hate being excluded more than anything.

1. It doesn't need to be exclusive. Seriously. Keep it private if you must but let regular /r/chelsea members request membership. Mods could easily check user history before approval in order to keep the trolls/agitators/gunners out. 

1. You say the sub name has nothing to do with nationality but I don't buy it. Hostility (no matter how slight/subtle) towards non-UK fans is evident in the broader chelsea fan community and I have no doubt that at least a few of those elitists belong to /r/cfcuk. The magazine may have provided some inspiration but I bet that plenty of your members feel it's meaning transcends that. 

1. I'm seeing some discrepancies between some of the defences of the subs purpose.
/u/ScreamingGerman stated that
&gt;  It’s very much an effort to restore the quality of discussion that the main subreddit has suffered from as a result of growing as large as it has. 

 But according to other members it has just as much of the off-topic and meaningless discussion that has deemed /r/chelseafc not good-enough for their 'superior'  conversations. 
 eg. 
&gt; Mostly Chelsea related, but off-topic at times as well

 and


  &gt; We keep our personal and unrelated chitchat within /r/cfcuk

 and


 &gt; we've had a thread in the last week or so discussing the sports we play ourselves

 and


 &gt; What doesn't [migrate to /r/chelseafc], frequently is the kind of stuff that would likely not be of interest to the community at large

 


So is it a Sub for those who want a better quality discourse than /r/chelseafc offers? or is it a small private community for conversation between a group of friends?


I wouldn't mind it being the latter at all if it weren't for posts like  /u/ScreamingGerman 's that serves no purpose other than letting us know we aren't included. Also the fact that you invite new members based on the quality of their discussion suggests it's not between friends but rather those who you deem worthy enough to join in your superior conversation.

If it's the former. then fuck you let me in. or better yet have that better quality discussion out here in the main sub where we can all read it. 

I've always thought of reddit's chelsea fanbase as a united, family type community but /r/cfcuk has made me think otherwise.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Really the only ones who fit this system are:

1. Balotelli
2. Cavani
3. Suarez

Players who could still be amazing for us, but don't fit ""Mourinho way""

1. Lewandowski
2. Ibrahimovic

Realistic Options from the lists above:

**None**

Other ""top strikers"" who are available but do not fit the system and why:

1. **Mandzukic**: Although a great goalscorer and very *very* hard worker his technical abilities let him down. This guy is probably one of the best target men in the game right now, you literally put the ball in and he will just attack it, but thats really the best way to use him. In our system we dont really whip in crosses a lot, we play through the middle so we need someone who can hold up the play, interact with our midfield and make smart runs to get played through. This is why Lewandowski would have been a 10x better fit. 

2. **Higauin**: Another great striker, always knows where to be and has a tidy finish. Problem with him is that he is a small figure, can't really bully anyone and not a 'Mourinho type player'. Even though he has played with Mou before, Jose had made it clear many times at Madrid that he didn't feel his strikers were adequate and never really had a favorite between him and Benzema. Higuain is much better suited in Serie A then in the Premier League. In Serie A he can get away with his small frame and use his expert positioning to his advantage in the much slower paced matches.

3. **Diego Costa**: Alright lets face it, the guys a massive prick. But on footballing terms he has definitely been having a killer season. However one half of a great season shouldn't merit a move to Chelsea. This guy is an aggressive, whole-hearted clinical finisher, but what else can he really offer to us? His hold-up play is iffy at best and he has a tendency to lose the ball a lot, more so then any of the players listed above. This in combination with the lack of a consistent goal scoring record prior to this season definitely leaves the jury out on Costa. Now he wouldn't be a terrible purchase, but his overall attitude and other football aspects I mentioned just put a lot of risk into his transfer.

Best 3 dream strikers for us and Mou (In order):

1. Cavani: Consistent goal scorer, tall, strong, technically great, hardest working player on the pitch, in his prime, everything you could ever ask in a striker + amazing attitude

2. Lewandowski: Amazing holdup play and linking with midfield, clinical goal scorer, strong, great in the air, great longshot, another complete forward with a great mindset.

3. Balo/Suarez:  Its really hard to pick, both have a lot of baggage but are amazing strikers. Suarez definitely better for now but Balotelli has potential to eclipse him in the future. Both strictly on footballing terms offer what Chelsea needs, albeit in different ways. One for the long term, another for the short-medium term. Although both are amazing in the present.


Edit: I guess I forgot about Rooney. I assume most of you already know a fair bit about him so no need to divulge into it. He is a great striker and has everything we need and Mourinho wants. Only problem is off-field qualities, might be a troublemaker in the dressing rooms, highest wages in the PL (by some way), he has been the poster boy for Manchester United for the last few seasons..and so on. (He is also English of course). If we get him I won't be disappointed, on a purely football basis he would be amazing for us. Its just everything else that would worry me.

true,jbubermensch,US,usa,"Rami is a classic example of a player that influences the game far more through his movement off the ball than he does when he's on it. When he has the ball, he'll make relatively frequent mistakes in terms of missed passes and errant shots, but if you watch any game that he plays in a second time, without having to focus on where the ball is, he's a massive influence. 

He's constantly running, all the time. Which means he'll be up at the front drawing a defender away from a player higher up that's more likely to score, and then we'll lose the ball and he somehow makes it all the way back into defense before the rest of the midfield, getting into passing lanes, making interceptions, and generally slowing down the opposition to allow the rest of the team to get back and help out. 

He only seems like a liability if you watch just once because on first viewing it's only natural to get caught up in the drama of the game. When that happens you tend to watch the movement of the ball instead of that of the players.

true,DEADB33F,null,null,"Out of interest, how often are you having to empty it?

My tank services three houses (one I live in, two I rent out) and needs emptying every 10 years or so. The tank is of brick construction and is about 8'x8'x6' with a brick built baffle down the middle.

If you're having to empty more frequently than once every few years then it sounds like either the bacteria have failed (IE you're using too much bleach &amp; cleaning products), or more likely, the soakaway which takes away the liquid runoff has become blocked/collapsed.

* If the tank is quickly becoming full of liquids and isn't draining then your soakaway is blocked.  
* If the tank is quickly becoming full of solids then your tank bacteria aren't working.

If it's a bacteria issue then you just need to use far less cleaning products and allow bacteria levels to naturally recover.

If the soakaway is blocked then you should hire out some drain rods and rod out the soakaway into the field/lawn it drains to (or hire someone to do it for you as it's not a very fun job). Once a blockage has been located, attempt to remove it using the various rod attachments. If the pipe has collapsed or had severe root impingement you'll need to count the number of rods then go that distance along the pipe before digging down to it and replacing the damaged section.

---

None of this will help in the event of huge floods ...the tank will still likely fill up with flood water and overflow.

But they just don't bring the same intensity to other games. Then the other team scores due to a defensive error, all our shots hit the post and everyone starts to panic a bit. 

It was beautiful seeing us persevere and grind out a win anyway, quite the improvement from recent years. Either way, we're not gonna play like we did against Arsenal every time. Even if we do, we need City and Chelsea to drop points in a couple of easy games each.

4th is what we want, and 3rd would be cool too, and might be possible. 4th gets us into CL, and given the intensity for big matches I  just mentioned, we do well in tournaments.

* The pilot likely ignored a low fuel warning - The flight guide for the Eurocopter states that the pilot should land within 10 minutes of the warning being made.
* There was an issue with one of the aircrafts display systems.
* Fuel transfer switches were off, which prevented the small amount of fuel remaining in the tanks to be properly transferred to the engines
* There is evidence the pilot attempted to restart both engines without success. 

However, a statement from Eurocopter revealed that there was a known issue with the EC135 helicopter:

&gt; ""The first analysis shows that the indication of the fuel quantity in the supply tanks could be overestimated,"" the company said in a statement.

&gt; ""All crews should be aware that in the worst case a red warning ""Low Fuel"" could appear without any amber FUEL Caution before.""

Other cool stuff to know:

* [Paul McGrath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGrath_%28footballer%29) is God. This is very important imformation.
* Villa are one of the oldest English football clubs in existence, having been founded 140 years ago this year.
* The club was also a founding member of the Football League (one of the club's directors at the time, William McGregor, proposed the idea)
* Despite our relative lack of goalscoring prowess in modern times, Villa have scored more goals in the FA Cup (817) and League Cup (457) than any other club.
* Gabriel Agbonlahor is our all-time leading scorer in the Premier League, and a local who ""came good"". Also a fan. 
* Villa have provided more England internationals than any other club. Ever. The current count is 71 (not counting unused substitutes). Hopefully, Fabian Delph will make that 72 soon.
* Chuck Norris is afraid of former Villa captain and all-round Swedish legend [Olof Mellberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olof_Mellberg).",0,1392452900,null,0,false,0,cffuzxk,t3_1xorxq,t1_cffuzxk,t3_1xorxq,null,1432406657,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

&gt; You do love stirring up drama don't you!

&gt;&gt; For all any of us know, you guys could have a discussion thread open right now about how all of us lowly chimney-sweeps are falling for your trap again.

&gt; I don't know if should even dignify this was a response anymore haha. Well, we don't.

This seems to highlight the major roadblock to everyone moving on. I get the impression /u/kyhadley and many other /r/cfcuk members have missed the point in that this whole debacle broke trust the /r/chelseafc community has with anyone associated with /r/cfcuk, regardless of anyone's initial intentions.

I believe we (/r/chelseafc and /r/cfcuk) all want this behind us, and many /r/chelseafc people have come to the understanding none of this was intended as malicious. A bad joke happened and it was in spectacular fashion. Anecdotally, had I been in any of the /r/cfcuk members' shoes, I'd probably made the same mistake - it would have been hard to predict it turning as bad as it did. However, the damage has been done and we've had plenty of time to throw a fit. There will continue to be some sore people, but they'll get over it.

However an accusatory post like I quoted above won't help the healing process at all. The /r/cfcuk people need to understand this now boils down to a trust issue which cannot be solved by saying, ""Trust us!"" The best course of action is to continue being civil and let time heal things. /u/RelaxedCease's distrust is warranted, however unfair it may be, but everyone at /r/cfcuk can regain that in time - just like in any other relationship.

/u/ScreamingGerman, thank you for this whole thread. I think this was good timing for a revisit.

/u/EnglishMD, I hope you come back in time, too.

The UK has some wonderful things about it (free banking) and some less-than-desirable things about it (public transport is a misery).

But it isn't just transport - even if you have the money there are money things you simply can't get when you want in London.

What about peace and quiet? There's a peace poverty in London - with nobody affording an entire house to themselves they are all crammed into bedrooms and flats with no sound insulation between them. Who ever got a decent night's sleep in London?

What about the right to walk the streets without harassment from a beggar or anti-social London gang member? There's arguably respect poverty in London.

How about the right to have the man or woman behind you in the crowded streets not coughing right into you without covering their mouth? I'd say there's health poverty in London.

You focus on cycling - good for you - but there are a lot of pressing issues in London.

Russell should stick to the drugs thing imo.  It's something he knows about, and so he doesn't have to prevaricate like he does when asked about this 'revolution'.  To change things you need to have a very clear idea about what it is you want, otherwise it will become just an exercise in destruction, and therefore attract no support.  If he sticks to this one issue he has a good chance of actually being a catalyst for positive change.

He wants the people to have more power through referenda, but when faced with the example of the million march against the Iraq war having no effect, he just said something like 'they should be more vehement' and when pushed said this should not include violence.  So what did he mean?

You have, unfortunately, also made the common mistake of thinking that anecdotal evidence has no validity.  I'm afraid that is completely untrue.  Anecdotal evidence is the bread and butter of rational thought.  If anecdotal evidence had no validity, as you claim, it would be impossible to act or think rationally in any area in the absence of comprehensive polling data, which it manifestly is not.  Anecdotal evidence is far weaker than evidence that draws on a larger sample size but it is not without value.

Your Dad supported QPR? Was he from West London? I wonder if he went to Chiswick school. Pls ask him.

As WacticalTank has said, QPR is no longer liked by other fans as much as we used to be. We used to be regarded as a plucky little club, overshadowed by much larger London teams. It's often said we were commonly the 2nd team London football fans supported.

When Flavio Briatore and BErnie Ecclestone took over the club, we became another club owned by sugar daddies. You have to watch ""The 4 Year plan"" Documentary: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDEwNjE3ODky.html

Football fans like to think that their teams and clubs are unique in some way, that they win games due to bravery, effort and the sheer honour their players feel playing for the shirt. Yet, in the modern game, money has become the driving force and to many QPR represent much of what has changed in the game.

Significant players in our past include Stan Bowles &amp; Gerry Francis (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgPNPpEeQvw) - a great vid about the year we almost won the old League One (now the PL)

Les Ferdinand http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4ucPL_ZhVA

If our home form is anything to go by we will take points from these games and most importantly, make them drop points. 

Next season we will have much, much more competition and the style of football we are playing now could be figured out. United will only strengthen next year, so will City and Chelsea and not to mention Arsenal as well. Next year we will have a harder time for 4th, let alone for the title.

So that's the point. This season may be be the truest year for next 3 to 4 years to challenge for the title and we have to both as supporters and the players, give it our fucking all and die out there on the field, so come the end of the season we can say ""we gave it our all"".

Which means that if you demand an equal gender ratio in comedy, a woman is 4-5x more likely to be picked than a man. Which feminists believe is what women deserve, because they are 'equal'.

Except it's not.  Scotland has absolutely no right to expect a currency union.  You keep talking about sharing the currency but that's just metaphorical language that doesn't describe the actual mechanisms involved.  A currency is not something that can be shared in the same way that a unit of currency can be shared.

true,Yaverland,null,null,"Here are some things I have noticed about Americans students' expectations in UK higher education.

1. They have higher expectations about the quality of what they are provided. Universities there have to work harder to prove they are worth attending. The amount US students are used to paying, and the size of their market, means university is much more of a service there. University education in the UK remains, just about, a privilege rather than a service, though that may change more as fees become a greater burden on students. 

2. University lecturers in the UK tend not to use visual aids as much (particularly true in arts and humanities). The way American students tell it, the idea that someone would stand up and talk, at length, about something boring, with no slides or anything, is a weird European thing. ""Surely they could just write it down"", they say. They expect their speakers to go to more effort and make the lecture an engaging event. In the UK, don't expect you lecturers to think as hard about your engagement and your entertainment when they speak.

3. Connected to this - don't think you can get by on your course if you just ""have the slides"". The slides in isolation are normally useless on UK courses. 

4. A connected point: you will need to plan your own learning and do the reading before and after to get anything out of the course. This is especially true of graduate courses. If you are in the arts or humanities, your seminars will probably be longer and less frequent than you are used to. You will be expected to use your time around these events productively. Look into your course packs for reading and ask yourself what you can be doing now to get more out of your seminars and prepare for your assessments. The Americans I have studied with feel like they have nothing to do for six weeks and then wonder why the assessments are so hard at the end of term. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't studying either, but at least it wasn't a surprise when I had to learn everything from scratch a week before my deadline.

5. Your education will be much less varied because in the UK we specialise from a much earlier age. You will be doing your major exclusively from the outset, none of this ""four years of taking courses in a variety of things to get a well rounded education"" bullshit. There may well still be opportunities to broaden your education and they will probably be very poorly signposted.

As for the health aspect, cycling is a good way of keeping fit - you're doing 2 things at once (no having to visit the gym after work). This really is appealing because I have no patience for the gym. But I don't really care about my health. 

But I'm in no way saying that cycling isn't a good method of urban travel. If you can deal with the fucking weather, it's a cheap and fast way of getting around. What I'm saying is it's not for everyone - where this article seems to say everyone should stop what they are doing and buy a bike.

Caernarfon has the [Welsh Highland Railway](http://www.festrail.co.uk/main.shtml) and some nice views across the Menai.

Both towns have interesting hinterlands - /u/metalmorgan mentioned Llandudno and the Great Orme, but there's also the rest of the Conwy valley, all of which can be reached by train. Caernarfon, on the other hand, is on Snowdonia's doorstep - there are even [buses](http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/gwy_doc.asp?doc=25961&amp;Language=1&amp;p=1&amp;c=1) that will take you right to the base of Snowdon if you fancy climbing the mountain.

Why don't we have that? Or at certain junctions allowing cyclists to treat stop lines as give way lines (thus making the traffic light an indicator of priority, rather than an instruction).

I think it does need to be drastic. Those ideas you've cited are pretty good. But cycling has a less than 1% modal share in America, so they're obviously not doing much.

Things like reducing residential street speed limits and adding bollards to prevent them being used for through traffic would have a pretty big impact.

&gt; Apart from making cycling easier and less unpleasant, you'd have to improve driver education to get me to cycle.

I agree. I think the driving test is too easy in the UK and our judiciary seem very reluctant to hand out bans for bad driving. It's as though driving is seen as a right, rather than a privilege.

Relevant points:

&gt;Among political sources, Labour and Conservatives dominate coverage accounting for 86% of source appearances in 2007 and 79.7% in 2012. Our data also show that Conservatives get more airtime than Labour. **Bearing in mind that incumbents always receive more coverage than opposition politicians, the ratio was much more pronounced when the Conservatives were in power in 2012.**

...

&gt;In 2012 David Cameron outnumbered Ed Milliband by a factor of nearly four to one (53 vs 15). Labour cabinet members and ministers outnumbered Conservative shadow cabinet and ministers by approximately **two to one (90 vs 46) in 2007****; in 2012, Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15).**

...

&gt;In both 2007 and 2012, across all programming, **business representatives received substantially more airtime on BBC network news (7.5% and 11.1% of source appearances) than they did on either ITV (5.9% and 3.8%) or Channel 4 News (2.4% and 2.2%)**. When we compare the representation of business with that of organised labour, the findings are even more striking.

&gt;On BBC News at Six, **business representatives outnumbered trade union spokespersons by more than five to one (11 vs 2) in 2007 and by 19 to one in 2012. On the issues of immigration and the EU in 2012, out of 806 source appearances, not one was allocated to a representative of organised labour.** Considering the impact of the issues on the UK workforce, and the fact that trade unions represent the largest mass democratic organisations in civil society, such invisibility raises troubling questions for a public service broadcaster committed to impartial and balanced coverage.",0,1392466117,null,0,false,0,cffwz2q,t3_1xz5n0,t1_cffwz2q,t3_1xz5n0,null,1432407589,92,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,92

Cached version of http://www.newsforscotland.com/news/students-steal-portrait-for-internship as of 15 Feb 2014 reads:



*Students steal portrait for internship. A group of six students are believed to have stolen a painting from the Scottish National Gallery in an attempt to gain an internship. A video sent to the Student from the group shows two students dressed in black removing “The Portrait of Cecilia Margaret” from its display and walking out of the gallery uncontested.* 
 
*The portrait dates back to 1826 and was painted by the artist Christen Købke. A spokesperson for the group told the Student: “At first the plan was to fake the heist, but whilst gathering research and planning we decided it would be much more effective and ‘notorious, ’ to actually be ‘the group of students that stole the painting’. “We did not believe that we would ever be able to leave the gallery with the painting and expected to be stopped before reaching the exit. The. security expressed concern but reactions were slow and indecisive, leaving us with a clear exit. ”.* 
 
*The theft took place as part of a competition to gain a summer internship with “creative communications agency” KesselKramer. The competition briefing, shown to the Student, read: “Within your groups you have 30 hours to visually communicate the word ‘Notoriety’ in any form you wish [... ]. “Conceptual thinking will be applauded. Sitting on your ass. [sic] will not. So be reckless. be [sic] ambitious and make it heard. ”.* 
 
*It remains unclear what the group now plans to do with the portrait. At the time of publication, KesselKramer and the Scottish National Gallery could not be reached for comment.*",0,1392466172,null,0,1392466459,0,cffwzch,t3_1xwbgf,t1_cffwzch,t3_1xwbgf,null,1435500638,1,false,Edinburgh_University,t5_2tgwd,1

Just had a quick look, in USA that would be illegal: [link](http://woman.thenest.com/boss-telling-not-speak-native-language-workplace-16395.html). I know it's USA so it may very well be different but shows I'm not so out of touch here.

I was mostly downvoted as you guys look from only one point of view, which very often leads to assumption that immigrants get on your heads and want to force their right onto you. Some immigrant groups actually do it but I'm talking about that particular example.

It's not really fair to forbid someone talking his native language, just because an employer wants to. If that makes real sense then it's good. Otherwise it's pretty discriminatory.

I was giving an example of chatting at work and even then was downvoted, nice. But seriously, wouldn't you be pissed off when boss told you not to chat (even though your work done isn't at all affected by that)? The guy above said it would be fair but have anybody actually experienced it? I really don't think so.

The same applies to language. If two guys talk in their native language as they work for example in pairs or next to each other and there isn't even anybody else around, would banning them to talk made sense? Just as a principle?

If Brits bothered reading a little about Russification and Germanisation, they would know it can be a very sensitive issue. After all, Poland was not a country for more than 100 years, due to being divided among other nations. It's not fun when someone bans you blank from talking your own native language.

As much as the system is a disgrace, those Job Centre staff are employees, earning a wage to keep their homes warm and their families fed. Basically the same as everyone else, but with a job, targets and a boss breathing down their necks.

Job hunting is stressful and really gets morale down. Receiving rejection after rejection, or worse no answer at all drags the soul down faster than anything I've ever experienced. When I was homeless I was more positive than when I was jobseeking. I even had the benefit of an existing job!

Personally I'd like to see counselling as part of the job seeking process, especially now when it's more competitive, job centres have tougher targets and applications and rejections are thrown around far too much. This counselling should be available to anyone even if they've been declined a claim or had a claim stopped. The counselling should also be separate from job hunting, it should not be the counsellor's job to help a person into employment, but just to help get over all the negativity surrounding jobseeking and the media.",0,1392467221,null,0,1392470415,0,cffx4pn,t3_1xz283,t1_cffx4pn,t3_1xz283,null,1432407733,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; A vanishingly rare example of the BBC propaganda system being blasted open was the special edition of the Radio 4 Today programme edited by the English musician PJ Harvey on January 2, 2014. In her opening statement, Harvey explained that she wanted to 'do something unusual with the format and content of the programme.' She invited people whom she considers 'to be highly articulate, stimulating and extremely interesting to listen to - people who challenge us and move us to examine our deepest beliefs and feelings.'

&gt; Harvey's guests included John Pilger talking about the propaganda role of the corporate media; Denis Halliday, former UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, on the urgent need to democratise the warmongering UN Security Council (here at around 49 mins); Ian Cobain and Phil Shiner on torture committed by UK forces (here at around 2 hrs : 34 mins); and Mark Curtis on how Britain's arms trade fuels oppression around the world. 

&gt; Harvey wanted her contributors to be unrestricted in what they could say, and she had asked the Today programme to agree to this before accepting the invitation to be a guest editor. She rightly noted that 'a great deal' of her edition of the programme was 'about censorship in one way or another.'

&gt; Predictably, reactionary voices bewailed afterwards that the BBC had broadcast 'left-wing tosh' and 'liberal drivel'. Nick Robinson, the BBC's 'impartial' political editor, took particular exception to the contribution by John Pilger, while the pro-war Murdoch employee David Aaronovitch, a Times columnist with a penchant for wagging a warning finger at Glenn Greenwald, objected to being 'lectured at in a news programme'.

&gt; By contrast, Paul Mason, a former BBC Newsnight correspondent and now the digital editor at Channel 4 News, better captured the public response: *'Brilliant @PJHarveyUK edition of @BBCr4today demonstrating difference between ""truth"" and ""editorial policy"" - amazing how weird it feels'*

The income of the Prince of Wales from sources other than the Duchy of Cornwall is subject to tax in the normal way.[22] 

Remember that neither William nor Harry had to do any of that, but it is regarded as something you should do. William would never be a career soldier though. Hell The Queen contributed in WWII when she was still Princesses, Philip has a pretty impressive service record. 

Fact is I can't see any reason that a 4 year cycle elected bureaucrat would actually do any better or be more positive for the country. Just look at the turnout for the Jubilee, the Wedding and everything. Taking away all of that would really take something away from the country. And at the end of the day the cost is negligible if there even is a cost. 

In terms of a level playing field, consider if we had the technology so everyone could have anything, or there was never anyone who could have more, humanity would stagnate as there would be nothing to strive for. Strife encourages innovation, look at the huge technological leaps that occurred during WWI and WWII. Though this is just my thinking. But I would given a chance happily find a way to get rid of poverty and make sure everyone had a base minimum of food, shelter,  healthcare and education.

There are definitely some players I would like to see on the out. More so the mercenaries like Schwarzer and Eto'o, though the latter's form has been bristling as of late.

I really think we should tap our potential in our youth set-up to plug holes.

Mangala would cost another €20+ million. You're seriously undervaluing each player you've mentioned. Porto always drives a hard bargain. Mikel is needed for backup incase MvG doesn't quite recover or If we need a defensive sub during a match. Selling all three strikers in one window is pure foolishness even if we happen to buy either of the two you mentioned. They've both had 1 1/2 good seasons in leagues that aren't the prem. Lukaku hasn't fully proven himself either so it would be a mistake to have such an inexperienced Strikeforce. The total cost of all those players would be MUCH higher than you listed, and selling all the others leaves us with little to no depth in deeper positions.

Getting rid of mikel AND Lampard is stupid. Also benching Cech and using him as backup is stupid. Getting Costa is reliant on us giving courtois to atletico, thus making your benching Cech point irrelevant.

* 500g self raising flour (white/wholemeal whatever you want..)

* 1 x 500ml bottle of beer

* optional salt/sugar/fruit/nuts to flavour

1. Sieve flour and mix all ingredients to homogeneous gloop - will be a very wet dough/batter

3. Bake at 180 deg. C for 90-120 mins - until it sounds hollow when tapped and a skewer comes out clean

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"But the BBC are not 'parroting' the coalition's narrative on the economic crisis. They are reporting it. The BBC did exactly the same thing when the Labour government were giving almost exactly the same narrative on the economic crisis between 2007 and 2010. And when Labour, in the run-up to the last general election, were also campaigning on the basis of having to introduce drastic spending cuts.

Since the last election, the Labour Party has been in the process of rebranding and reinventing itself in the post Blair/Brown years, with Ed Milliband trying to establish his own leadership credentials, while at the same time trying to find ways to reposition his party. This has constituted much of the media's coverage of Labour, just in the same way it did when the Conservatives lost the 1997 election. And the 2001 election. And the 2005 election. It's a little unfair to accuse the BBC of bias in not reporting the policies or the positions of the opposition party while that party is still in the process of deciding what its policies and positions are. There is nothing unusual in this.

I read and watch BBC news at *least* once a day, and while there has been much commentary about public spending cuts (which one would expect), I have yet to read or hear a single item from the BBC that even *hints* at support for the policy. Most of its coverage includes 'expert' opinion that is highly critical of *any* spending cut. And much of the BBC's own narrative is about the 'damage' of spending cuts.

Reporting and supporting are not the same thing.",0,1392472456,null,0,1392483696,0,cffy30r,t3_1xz5n0,t1_cffy30r,t1_cffxjpk,null,1432408182,48,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,48

The difference is the BBC's bias comes from the political leanings of their staff which one would expect, due to the requirements of employment (high level of education in the arts), to be socially liberal and economically centrist. Whereas, the Independent is biased because it is trying to sell itself to people who have a left leaning viewpoint and like to have it echoed back to them.

The point of all newspapers - left or right - is to *confirm the bias* of the reader. It's to report the news without challenging the world view of the person buying it. Because if you do then people won't buy your newspaper anymore. They'll buy a different rag that panders to them better.

The point of the bbc is to operate in a way that doesn't infuriate the captive, paying audience that they have.

We're talking here of public services; those especially, should be open to criticism. After all, what are they afraid of? Are they so incompetent that they fear being held to account? Can only inflict that stupidity on us and not accept then any fair criticism for their failings?

Where someone is slandering or create liable then that should be resisted by evidencing what is the reality.

Being shy of arguement does no-one any good. If you follow your line to its absurd conclusion, then you end up where public services are not accountable; like the NSA+ lauding it over the world and not understanding even what the problem is.

Government and public services should represent the People's interests widely. Challenging them makes them stronger. Perhaps in the case of the NSA+, they have a lot to be ashamed of and past actions that they must hide for fear of ever being held to account; perhaps for those we can just overhaul them but for other services like the police and the NHS, it is important that they are seen to be open; held to account; and then representing our interests.

Companies would do well to learn that lesson to; being challenged makes them stronger and more robust; and being engaged with consumers is a key way to progress against competition.

You know: by facts. 

In the absence of facts, the conservative strategy is to ""frame the debate"". Repeat a lie enough times, it'll be accepted as a valid alternative to the truth. Even if there's no evidence to prove it. Even if the evidence shows it's a bare-faced fib. 

This is hardly new. Thatcher came to power in 1979 on [a Saatchi &amp;amp;amp; Saatchi poster campaign saying Labour Isn't Working.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Isn't_Working) Then the Tories [raised unemployment from around 5% to over 10% for a decade.](http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/08/a-look-back-at-margaret-thatchers-economic-record/)

Fuck: even Spitting Image had a sketch where Thatcher repeatedly said ""if you say something enough, people believe it"", and her cabinet slowly changed from not believing it into believing it. 

The numbers don't lie ...the Conservatives know their ideas lead to these bad results, so they're reduced to playing to the refs (and in this analogy, the voters are the referees) instead. The political equivalent of diving in the penalty box. 

Problem for them is: they've been diving in the box for 35 years now. And they do it every chance they get. The only way you'll be fooled is if you haven't been paying attention al all. Or you're not an unbiased ref. ",0,1392472761,null,0,false,0,cffy5gl,t3_1xz5n0,t1_cffy5gl,t1_cffxv4c,null,1432408214,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

500g of potatoes

6 cloves of garlic (you can use less)

a 500ml pot of double cream

120g Gruyere cheese

Salt and pepper.

1. Thinly slice the spuds with a mandolin, the slicing parts of a cheese grater or if you want a very sharp knife. Then rinse in cold water.

2. Chop/grate/mince/put through a garlic press the garlic and leave to one side.

3. Take an oven proof dish and butter it. Then add a layer of potato season with salt an pepper and add some of the garlic and a little of the cheese grated. Keep doing this until you have one last layer to make and you can try to do that one tidier so it looks good. You then take the cream and pour over the potatoes until it reaches the top. Sprinkle over the last of the cheese and cover in foil.

4. Place in an oven heated to 160 degrees and cook for 30-35 minutes. After this take off the foil and cook until golden on top and the spuds are tender (about another 15 mins it depends how thick the spuds are).

The conservatives generally tend to be the sole proponent of their position, whereas academics, labour and lib dem tend to hold the opposite position- so you're picking labour from a group whereas conservative is the group. Secondly, the people who go on the BBC are people who volunteer- if the conservatives have a more media centered strategy then that would make alot of sense, especially in 2007-2010 when Labour new they were in trouble and very few labour politicians wanted to be branded as the force of the old new labour government.

He engages in politics whilst arguing politics doesn't work. He critiques celebrity culture whilst engaging in fame and self-promotion. He rails against the indulgences of the rich whilst being a multimillionaire and leading a lavish lifestyle. He's against voting, but for signing petitions (=voting).

Quite a while now he's espoused several self-contradictory views and gotten away with the caveat ""I'm a comedian"" followed by a cheeky grin at the camera. 

The best comedians share many qualities of a good politician. They all know how to frame an issue, manipulate the audience - and they're masterful at side-stepping questions and spinning them around.

We all agree with his platitudes. At any given time at any given society things are not working. There's inequality, there's hunger, there's war, there's a drug problem. There *should* be solidarity and joy all around (plus some new agey spiritual englightment according to Russell). I'm baffled how people label this stuff as Brand being a great thinker and thinking outside the current paradigm.

As Slavoj Žižek has said, the instictive response is to demand action: ""We need to ACT now!"".

For those whose commutes are below the 2003 average, sure, cycling might be suitable. But those travelling above average distances will find cycling to work simply not practical due to the amount of time it takes. Adding an hour each way to your commute means you've got two hours less free time to relax, cook dinner, spend time with loved ones, read, play computer games, etc. And that's not something that will affect a ""tiny minority"" of the population - it's something that'll affect half of all commuters, if not more.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice to have better infrastructure and enable more people to cycle to their workplaces, to the shops, to the cinema etc. But saying that ""it's not hard"" to cycle to work is demonstrably not the case for the majority of commuters. Saying cycling in general is ""not hard"" is also not true when you take geography into account. Maybe you live in a flat place like Cambridgeshire or Leicestershrie, but not everyone does.

I know a mate of mine was hiring two minimum wage employees. He advertised online and got 50 or so applicants within the first day. Around 10 of them were serious applications. The other 40 probably hitting quotas for their JSA. Next day he had over 100 email applications, with the same proportion of real vs quota-type applications.

So my conclusion is that a lot of the things reported are misleading. You found 330 job adverts. That's not the same as 330 actual jobs available.

I'm genuinely pissed off we didn't go all out for this game. We could have rested players for the league, the worst that's gonna happen is we finish 9th. No need to rest players for this.

Now I didn't watch all the game and wasn't totally concentrating when I did, but from what I saw I thought Shaw actually had a poor game defensively. Got forward a few times but not as much as I'd like to see and defensively gave away too many free kicks. 

Yoshida similar. Gave the ball away too much and jumped into a few challenges when he didn't need to, giving free kicks away. 

Lambert looks unfit. Has done for a while and I can't wait to see Gallagher back to give him a rest.

Lallana looked tired today, he shows flashes of creativity and was good at times but was sloppy at others.

But, he is also somewhat inconsistent, sometimes he looks downright bad and most of all: He has yet to prove himself in a Chelsea shirt.

Two seasons in a row now there were talks of him playing but he was instead loaned out, to some fans dismay. This season the loan was also last minute and came rather sudden despite assurances from both Mourinho and Lukaku that he would not be loaned out again.

Personally, i think the ""if's"" and ""but's"" and ""maybe's"" need to be put to the test this coming season. He has played premiere league football a few years now, he has had time to get used to it, mature into the role and now it is time to see if he really has what it takes to be a striker in Chelsea. I hope he will be given a role as rotational/backup striker and if he can deliver decent results throughout the season he should be of enough quality to remain at Chelsea and hopefully grow even more into a contender for first choice striker.

[are] by far the #1 problem with convicting actual rape and sex crimes … 

Since you asked me to look at your other comments, may I say that I don't know what's worst about this statement.

Is it worse that you're wrong and wilfully ignoring the facts, or is it worse that only something horrific will [change your mind](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xg2bc/my_wages_continue_to_go_down_while_the_price_of/cfbn4hl)?

It is fascinating that you can pretend to be an intelligent person - do you believe this yourself? - when you ignore statistics and research by academic professionals. Evidence seems irrelevant when you want to advance your preconceived worldview, so  you [change your opinions as soon soon as you experience the actual reality](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xg2bc/my_wages_continue_to_go_down_while_the_price_of/cfbn4hl) of the things you talk about. 

I can only imagine that some beloved ex-boyfriend of yours has told you the accusations against him were false. Maybe they were, but you should not base your opinions on a single anecdote, or even a handful of them.

The fact is that rape is inherently a difficult crime to prosecute, and that the problem of false accusations pales into insignificance compared to lacks of independent witnesses and to survivors' struggle to come forward and barristers casting doubt on their morality and promiscuity.

It's also worth bearing in mind that the BBC puts out far more news than its ITV and Channel 4 rivals (internet, BBC 1 and 2, local and national, World Service, Rolling News Channel, and local and national radio stations). So to compare *bias* with its rivals is potentially disingenuous.

You could but it isn't believable without evidence. Not that picking postcards means much as a statistical relevancy in itself but the following shows the dregs royal propagandists are working with when they try and promote the link to tourism:

&gt; [Then potential tourists were also asked to choose from 15 postcards that they would send to communicate that they were in Britain. They ranged from The London Eye, Tea to  Red Phone Boxes. The icon picked by the most respondents was a red double decker bus (24%) followed by a stone castle by the sea (20%). But the third most popular choice, at 11% of respondents, was Queen Elizabeth II, well ahead of fish and chips or draught beer.](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx)

Pitching finishing third behind London buses as a triumph is laughable. Visit Britain is ran by Knights and Dames; if you want to check look at the executives. Before you get the wrong impression the 500m£ is a figure plucked from nowhere. The argument for royal tourism is as credible as reading passages from the bible and no one ever has met the burden of proof. Tourism is statistically proven to be driven by family/friends and business.

&gt; Do you feel the Queen has thus done a bad job at representing us?

She does represent ""us"". She represents business, the military, and most importantly, she represents herself. She is an actress/business woman with billions in shares and land assets. While ""her people"" are homeless she lives in palaces. While ""her people"" work 40-45 hours a week she has a fleet of servants. While her birthday is celebrated with grotesque national propaganda ""her people"" are [bussed in to be crowd stewards on zero pay](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/04/jubilee-pageant-unemployed). She's not done a days work in her life; work is something you do as a necessity to live.

&gt; I watched a documentary a while back that had an interview with George Bush Jr, and he was nervous and excited to meet the Queen. Gave some interesting perspective. 

The only angle of interest is someone giving any value to the word of a war criminal.

&gt; I just feel tradition is important, and when it works well and doesn't cost us anything there isn't much of a reason to change it. 

If appealing to traditionalism is legitimate then the tactic applies any where, even to things you don't like: slavery and giving women the vote were both resisted using the same reasoning. A bully also builds a tradition of taking lunch money. You have to choose all or none to be consistent.

There are plenty of reasons to abolish it:

* the monarchy actually decides when we go to war, it can ignore parliament on any issue;
* the monarchy squats on a great deal of land in the UK (and the world) making land, rents and housing more expensive for everyone else but that is not the end. The monarchy get a great deal of secret subsidy from CAP (Common Agricultural Policy); 
* the monarchy is the original creator of the national debt costing ""us"" billions in interest repayments;
* the monarchy has pre-approval of all legislation, no law can be passed if it upsets their business interests;
* the monarchy is obscenely wealthy which allows abuses of power;
* while the queen and her children had and have unlimited protection from secret service and military, her people's children were left to be abused by a child abuser with close royal connections (Jimmy Savile);
* the monarchy and the queen appoint religious bigots to parliament—what year is this?
* the monarchy is privy to legislation and insider knowledge, which gives them unfair accountable advantage during;
* the monarchy doesn't pay inheritance tax, Charles Windsor doesn't pay business tax, he actually pays income tax after his spending. He buys his food, pays his servants, pays for the upkeep of his house, cars and so on, then Windsor pays a discretionary income tax, sometimes;
* through the monarchy Charles Windsor misuses his power to promote non-scientific and false medicine;
* and there are many more reasons.

This is all corrupt behaviour indistinguishable from some of the actions of dictators like Gaddafi in other regimes. If the Windsor's were a family in Sicily, perhaps the Windsoronis, they'd be called a mafia operation and despised. Even if 500m£ was correct I don't think it's much value for money, and perpetuating the idea that there is a man in the sky that decides which family is going to be the supreme beings of a country is literally a retarding force on intellectualism. I can imagine they don't really believe it, but it's very helpful if they have idiot sycophants that do.

&gt; Also yeah people shouldn't downvote just for your opinion, though support for the Royal Family is very high. 

Support for a ""god"" that could send you to hell was popular at one time.

From a consistency standpoint, there's your answer right there. I don't know if you watched much last season, but Hazard was incredibly inconsistent. He was a great influence on the pitch and could change games, but then would lose the ball 5 times in a row trying to some fancy flick or just disappear altogether. I imagine you give Mourinho a chance to work with Lukaku for a whole season and his mental toughness and consistency will greatly improve. Same goes for his technical abilities, too. He's so young he has time to work on all these traits. 

I think if we sell him over the summer we are making a massive mistake. If in three or four years he's still having trouble improving, then it'd be more reasonable to sell him. Selling him now would be very, very shortsighted. I think he'll wind up as our second striker next year and we will see that he *can* be a good striker for us.

The DNA of a mothers egg cell is inserted into a hollowed out donor egg cell containing the donors mitochondria ^((tiny organelles that provide fuel to every cell in the body)^)

The newly modified egg cell is fertilized by the males sperm and inserted into the womb where the pregnancy carries on as normal.

.

The reason to do this is so that the child does not inherit faulty mitochondria from the mother's egg cell which can cause disabling and often fatal diseases in the child which are completely untreatable in the child.

.

The ""frankenstein"" issue comes from the fact that mitochondria contain tiny amounts of their own DNA so the child will inherit some DNA from the donor, the mitochondrial DNA only affect the mitochondria and will not change how the child develops in anyway other than having hopefully healthy mitochondria.

It is possible to argue that the child will have 3 biological parents having received DNA from 3 sources the Mother, the Father and the Donor ^((the father cannot be the donor as he does not produce egg cells)^)",0,1392483660,null,0,false,0,cfg1e03,t3_1xzkbx,t1_cfg1e03,t3_1xzkbx,null,1432409740,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,miomike,null,null,"I'm pretty sad that we went out, pretty sad about the way we went out, pretty sad about the performances, and generally pretty sad that we didn't make more of our chance. It really would have been one of our best chances to get a decent cup run on the go, and with Europe unlikely (Don't care what Pochetinno says, I'd love us to have another go in Europe regardless of what level) from the League, the cup was our best chance at that too. 


The team never looked to have got going today at all, passes constantly astray, people caught in possession, out of position, and just out of sync. Bless his cottons, Lambert was awful, which entirely culminated in that painful miss with 10 minutes to go. He just looks tired. He's been integral to our performances, last season took it out of him I think, and having to carry the attack this season hasn't helped, with Osvaldo being the piece of crap he was (on and off the pitch). He just needs a rest for a few weeks in my opinion (I hope that's all he needs).


I'm sad that Gallagher has been out on bereavement, because I think that game would have been perfect for him. It's a cup match, so not a be all and end all, but it's premier league opposition, and he did well against Arsenal. So it's unfortunate for him to have missed it, though obviously everyone understands why, just bad timing.


I agree with /u/GoodBananaPancakes though, we can't say our players looked tired, then blame Poch for resting some, because we do play an extremely high tempo game that will sap players, so resting them when we have the chance is sometimes necessary. Disappointing as it is that we went out, the players on the pitch should have been good enough to get a win, or even a draw, out of that game, and they just didn't.

The work is, of course, piss easy. A monkey could do it, and I'd say I spend just as much time sat in the van waiting to go to lunch/the tip as I do actually wandering around and doing my job. Workplace politics and sodding whinging all the time, people feel it's unfair to be expected to do what they're paid to do...every bastard morning I report to the manager, I have to remind him who the fuck I am, telling him my name and he reacts like it's the first time he's ever heard of anybody called by my name! It's not an exotic name, mate, you see me every day, my name's always the same place on your list...

There's no real redemption of this job, tbh, as the work is so easy it offers not enough fulfilment or satisfaction to compensate for the negatives. Walking around country roads is nice though, and there's a lot to be said for working outdoors. It's still an upgrade on what I was doing before!

TL;DR: basically no values shared between my co-workers and I, precious little in common and the working environment already feels stagnant and tepid. Work is pathetically easy, and boring but less so than my colleagues so I'm glad to spend my time out on the streets and doing my job. Unlike the colleagues who would rather do a bit then fuck off and sit somewhere warm.

Most of the shows you mention only have 3 or 4 guests, and if the ratio of male and female comedians is ~4-to-1 (admittedly not the best statistic, since who knows what fraction of each gender comedians is actually good enough to be a guest on these types of shows), then women would be getting disproportionately represented.

The other problem that I have with this viewpoint is that level of consistency (one female guest every episode) seems unrealistic to me.  Between scheduling issues and finding appropriate guest for certain topics, there are very easily situations where it would make sense to have an all male cast.  There are also instances where it would make sense to have 2 or 3 guests that are women.  There could also be cases where the entirety of the guest cast is female.

This proved to be well placed as all the punishing new policies meant that we had to be stricter and stricter with vulnerable unemployed people living in poverty. I gather there's a lot of variability between offices, but I can tell you that in my office the staff universally hated the changes coming through.

We all stared open-jawed at the documents explaining the three-strike system which could lead to claimants being sanctioned for *three years*. I personally suggested to a few claimants that they might have been ill when they missed an appointment so that they could sign a sickness form and avoid a sanction. If I'd been caught being too blatant about things like this then I could've lost my job.

I have absolute sympathy for people being churned through the system - especially as it is now. I've been there myself - though not under the current rules. I did however encounter nearly daily aggression and fairly frequent threats of violence and death. I had someone wait outside for me in the car park because their ESA had been stopped and as far as they were concerned I - as a Jobcentre staff member - was responsible.

While obviously Jobcentre staff don't have it as bad as the people who have to sign on, they are in my experience as annoyed by the current situation as any right-minded person would be and they do have to suffer the consequences too without any power to change things.

Strife encourages innovation, look at the huge technological leaps that occurred during WWI and WWII.

Correlation doesn't not mean causation but if you want insults you are a fucking moron. Strife doesn't encourage innovation, it encourages suffering and short sighted decision making. Look at Hiroshima, Dresden, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. All the tech that you think came out of WW2 already existed it was just optimised for maximising suffering. Innovation comes about when people have time to think, create, and share; that requires freedom from misinformation like religious, royal or political propaganda, intellectual property restrictions, and freedom from worrying where the next meal comes from. 

Universal education also correlates with the 1940s.

When it comes time to bake, knock the air out of it, fold it a few times to get it an even consistency, and either stick in a loaf tin or form into rolls. Turn the oven on as hot as you can, add a pan of water on the bottom to fill it with steam (heat and stream give it more oven spring and a better crust), and stick the bread in. If rolls, take out after 15 mins when they're golden brown, if a loaf, turn it down after 10 mins and leave until cooked through. You might need to add tin foil to make sure it doesn't burn.

 [**FIFA eligibility rules**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA%20eligibility%20rules): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;As the governing body of [association football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), [FIFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) is responsible for maintaining and implementing the rules that determine whether an association football player is eligible to represent a particular country in officially recognised international competitions and [friendly matches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_match). In the 20th century, FIFA allowed a player to represent any national team, as long as the player held citizenship of that country. In 2004, in reaction to the growing trend towards naturalisation of foreign players in some countries, FIFA implemented a significant new ruling that requires a player to demonstrate a ""clear connection"" to any country they wish to represent. FIFA has used its authority to overturn results of competitive international matches that feature ineligible players.

Skrtel also seems to trust their judgment more. When he plays against a physical striker or with a weaker partner, like Kolo, I feel that Skrtel thinks their best chances are to win the first ball, despite the fact that that is the situation when its hardest to do so, and he seems to take it upon himself to prevent the ball from entering our final third, and thus makes silly judgment calls or someone gets in behind him.

City away in the cup, *only* your strongest team will do, and even then it might not. Tuesday-Saturday is fairly decent rest time, anyway.

I don't have a problem with /r/cfcuk. I do have a problem with the bullying though. Being a smaller, gated community allows them the freedom to be content-rich. It also doesn't hurt that a lot of the subscribers have a lot in common, especially in terms of ideas and ideologies.

As a 10000-strong sub, this community is never going to have a content-rich discussion but I have never seen good discussions being ignored here, either. Sure, a lot of fluff does get entangled but a large community tends to have a lot of disparate views and it became painfully clear with the controversial post and its aftermath.

The post wasn't a pain-point as much as the feeling of having been taken for a ride purely to serve someone else's interests. It feels bad when you are made the butt of a joke that weren't let in on. These are all markers of classic bullying, IMHO.

What the denizens of /r/cfcuk do behind their closed doors is of no importance to me (or even to /r/chelseafc) but when you (as in /r/cfcuk) choose to wash your dirty linen in /r/chelseafc, you better be ready to face whatever comes in the aftermath. If you make someone the butt of a joke and you get outed, you better be ready to face the consequences, whatever they are.

I think he knew with the team he was putting out today that we would still be on the back foot but the last thing he wanted was not to concede 4-5 goals by putting on a new team and completely lose momentum we had built up and start falling in the league.

He also was taking pressure off Willian and Hazard by playing so many defensive players so they don't have to run around and put a foot in every challenge to tire even more or get injured. It's quite clear how much he really thinks of our title chances after this game. He was more than happy at Dave just clearing his lines and pretty much shook the hand of every guy on City's wage bill before leaving the stadium. I just hope they can slip up enough to outdo our slip ups because the title can go anywhere between us at them.

If on such a bad performance we lose to the best title contender apart from us with a 2-0 in the FACUP then I'm strangely okay with it.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; When I mentioned the left what I really was talking about is collective ideologies that impose on individual liberties.

There's nothing left- or right-wing about that. The association of ""collective"" with the left wing is a fantasy of certain right wing elements. Collectivist ideologies are just as prevalent on the right. 

And consider that most anti-authoritarian, anti-collectivist ideologists, like anarchism and other libertarian forms of socialism such as left-communism (anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marx' teachings) originated firmly on the left wing, by definition: Left- and right-wing originated as a distinction between those in the French parliament who supported the monarchy - the right - or opposed it, on the left; the right by it's original definition excluded anyone supporting anti-authoritarian ideologies because they would only be possible by opposing the monarchy. 

As as marxist (one of those Lenin would have written off as an ""infantile left communist""), Panarchism is pretty close to what I'd advocate. But as typical of right wing ideologies, it appears to fall down on property rights (and so, the combination of ideas of government and economy falls firmly in the ""utopian"" category).

And this is pretty much always the great discord between left-wing libertarian and right-wing libertarian ideologies: Left-wing libertarian ideologies almost never see property rights as anything special - they too must be enforced under the principle of minimizing the restrictions of others freedoms, and expansive property rights is incompatible with this. While right wing libertarian ideologies almost always treat property rights as an extension of the self. 

I'm with Proudhon there: Property is theft.

Property rights inherently reduces the freedom of others to access or use shared resources. Recognising some property rights is necessary because not doing so creates worse restrictions of others freedoms with marginal increases in yours; but expansive property rights are inherently oppressive.

Another thing that bothers me is how late this post is.

*Seriously*?

They repeatedly turned some obscure bishop, judge or backbench MP saying they were against SSM into their top news story (including on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day the year before last, which led to some fun family arguments between my more homophobic relatives who I'm not out to and my less homophobic ones who know I'm gay).  You'd never have guessed from much of their coverage that it was supported by all the main parties, an overwhelming majority of both Houses of Parliament, and a huge majority of the population.  Or, you know, that there is a consensus in this country that people shouldn't be treated differently based on their gender or sexual orientation, and an international consensus that everyone has a right to marriage and a right to equal treatment by their government regardless of what the majority think.

It didn't help that they frequently framed the whole thing as a religious debate and left much of the coverage to religious correspondent Robert Piggot (who is quite clearly a bit of a homophobe and is always strongly biased towards the mainstream Christian leaders).

Can you even begin to imagine what it's like to have a huge national debate on whether you should be allowed to get married?

&gt; We’re really more interested in seeing stuff that is meaningful to us rather than ticking some popular sight off the list.

This is a good way to travel. I do that too during my travelling, and often I end up dragging the girlfriend to a totally off-the-grid place not in a typical tourist's tick list. Since you mention you're both into engineering / biology, here's a selection of some of the places I've visited throughout the UK, based on the book above -- divided into two categories, one for your husband (engineering-related) and for you (bio-related):

**For the husband**

* [Maxwell's home, Edinburgh, Scotland](http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/birthplace.html)
* [National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park](http://www.tnmoc.org/)
* [Alan Turing's memorial in Manchester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Memorial)
* [Einstein's blackboard in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford](http://geekatlas.com/photo/einsteins-blackboard-at?context=latest)
* [Westminster Abbey in London](http://www.westminster-abbey.org/) holds the graves of tons of famous scientists: Newton, Dirac, Maxwell, Rutherford, Kelvin, Darwin, etc.

**For you**

* [Darwin's home, Downe](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/home-of-charles-darwin-down-house/)
* [Dolly the sheep at the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh](http://www.nms.ac.uk/highlights/objects_in_focus/dolly_the_sheep.aspx)
* [Flemming's Lab, London](http://www.medicalmuseums.org/Alexander-Fleming-Laboratory-Museum/)
* [The Eagle Pub, Cambridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eagle_(pub) &lt;-- Watson &amp; Crick announced the DNA here. You microbiologist ? You'd love this pub. Decent fish &amp; chips too. 

I'm sure that's enough to whet your appetite. More in the book, but these are what I consider the highlights for UK.

And I'm sure you two would enjoy the Natural History Museum in London too, and the Science Museum which is just next door. The British Museum is huge and can easily take up the whole day. In London, I found that I had the most fun just hanging around and doing people watching, instead of rushing from one attraction to another.

And please, please spend more time in Edinburgh, as mentioned in other posts. It's a really beautiful city. I might even cut out York from your itineraries, just to let you spend more time in Edinburgh, if at all possible. Also, consider spending some time in Oxford &amp; Cambridge too.

Alright, so they have a similar name to another show.  So what?  *Doctors* started in 2000.  I think *Doctor Who* had the name first since they started it in 1963!

**And furthermore I feel the age rating should be much higher at 15/18 because this programme promotes racism, and has a negative nature.**
Alright, so they put some adult content into the show, but they approach it in such a way that audiences can understand it!  I fail to see any instances of ""racism"" in the show or any negative nature.  Sure it is dark in the later seasons, but that hardly qualifies as being negative.

**Therefore I believe it should be taken off BBC television, it is a WASTE OF MY TV LICENSE**
How is it a waste of your license?  If you don't like, then change the channel or turn off your TV!  The license fee goes to putting the channels on there so that you can watch all of them!

**, and most other people will agree.**
This is your opinion, don't assume that everyone thinks the same that you do.

&gt;

&gt;Red is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts. It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity. 

&gt;Red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away.  Monarchs, wives of Presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.

&gt;Because red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.

**Red revival has roots in philosophy of Brendan Rodgers**
  
Anfield manager is enjoying a remarkable revival, while David Moyes struggles with a difficult inheritance at Old Trafford, writes Oliver Kay
  
  
This time last year Brendan Rodgers was struggling to explain a 2-0 defeat at home by West Bromwich Albion that left Liverpool ninth in the Barclays Premier League, 29 points behind Manchester United. “There might not be any trophies to show for this season and we might not finish in the top four,” he said, “but we have taken strides”.
  
  
A few days later Liverpool lost 2-0 to Zenit St Petersburg in the first leg of a Europa League tie, their fifth match without victory in a sequence that began with an embarrassing FA Cup fourth-round defeat by Oldham Athletic. “It’s not over by any means,” Rodgers said at a time when his public 
  
  
pronouncements, combining folksy philosophy with what seemed like unrelenting, misplaced optimism, were attracting comparisons in some quarters with the contrasting figures of David Brent and Comical Ali.
  
  
A year on, Rodgers’ team are just four points off the top of the table, 11 points ahead of United, scoring goals at a remarkable rate and not only playing some wonderfully fluent football but, as they showed in coming from behind twice to beat Fulham on Wednesday, demonstrating the kind of belief that Liverpool teams have shown only at their highest peaks during the Premier League era.
  
  
Liverpool’s progress under Rodgers is a reminder of the difference a year can make and, as such, it could bring some crumbs of unlikely comfort for David Moyes, whose problems during an arduous first season at United have been compounded — symbolically, as well as competitively — by the resurgence of their rivals from Merseyside.
  
  
The difference is that, this time last year, Rodgers had at least made clear what he was trying to do at Liverpool. On the day he was interviewed by Fenway Sports Group, he produced a 180-page document of what he called “my culture, philosophy and gameplan . . . a shortcut of how I work, the kind of players I want tactically and the personality traits of those players”.
  
  
Liverpool have evolved into a faster and, at times, more direct team than was implied by the “death by football” approach that Rodgers preached initially, but the philosophy can be seen in the way that they pass the ball, press their opponents and in the enlightened mood that has enabled Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and most notably Luis Suárez to flourish.
  
  
What is the Moyes philosophy at United, though? What is the vision? When Moyes was appointed last May, Sir Alex Ferguson, having handpicked his successor, spoke of “a work ethic”, “integrity”, “a serious football man”, “perseverance”, “these are the qualities he’s going to need”. Moyes has these human values by the bucketload — and he certainly is having to show them — but much of his appeal to Ferguson seems to be based on personality rather than the type of philosophy preached by Pep Guardiola, Roberto Martínez, Rodgers and so many of the new wave of coaches.
  
  
When Rodgers took over at Liverpool, he pledged to modify their approach. In 2011/12, under Kenny Dalglish, they dominated matches and delivered more crosses than any other team in the Premier League, an average of 29 per game, and had an average of 17.6 shots per match, which was only marginally lower than United’s figure, but, possibly in part due to the nature of the chances, proved highly erratic in front of goal.
  
  
Surprisingly, perhaps, Liverpool average less possession under Rodgers this season than under Dalglish two seasons ago but have moved towards a quicker, high-octane approach that sees them top of the Opta charts for through-balls and dribbling and second, behind Crystal Palace, for tackling as well as, rather more pertinently, second for goals scored and fourth in the Premier League table.
  
  
Significantly, Liverpool have gone from the top of the crossing charts to the bottom, from 29 crosses per game two seasons ago to 21 per game last term and only 18 per game this campaign. Guess who is now at the top with 29 crosses per game? That’s right. High-class wing play has always been fundamental to United’s philosophy, but it has been little in evidence over the past few years, let alone months, as Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young and Nani have all struggled to find consistency.
  
  
In the 2-2 draw with Fulham at Old Trafford last weekend, United crossed the ball 82 times, the highest such figure in the Premier League since Opta’s records began in 2006. In some ways it was, as Moyes said, a “travesty” that they drew, but it was a flawed performance damned, unwittingly, by Dan Burn, the young Fulham defender, when he said that he had not headed so many balls since playing non-League football for Darlington.
  
  
Some say that Moyes is merely reproducing the type of football his Everton team played. If anything, this is an insult to his latter-day Everton team, who tended to show more resilience and indeed more purpose in just about everything they did. Moyes’s Everton always had — if not a “philosophy” as Rodgers advocates — a clear identity. His United team, so far, has shown alarmingly little of that.",0,1392505450,null,0,1392505666,0,cfg9pkh,t3_1y0bug,t1_cfg9pkh,t3_1y0bug,null,1432413727,91,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,91

My only thought is that maybe he does want to go on loan, but RM wants to send him to a side he thinks he's too good for, eg in league 1 or something.

What years roughly did you work from-til? Did the culture/atmosphere change? Why did you move on? 

Were you a union member, i hear they were informing advisers as to their rights on what was and was *not* mandatory, basically to be helpful to their customers (which i thought was really cool). 

What pressures were you under and what 'sanctions' of your own would a JC+ worker face themselves for not meeting their duties? 

Were there ""targets"" (such as [this](https://pay.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1xz283/jobcentre_staff_report_experiencing_a_rise_in/cffyhal)) e.g. re: sanctioning people, if not what if any targets did you have to aim for?

Were you instructed to misinform customers as to what with Universal Jobmatch was mandatory (anecdotally, people were being told they have to check the box for instance, or have to use the site without mentioning the required jobseeker direction letter).

His proven track record in the premiership and somewhat effective style notwithstanding, the Fat Man plays fucking awful football and has a long standing reputation for this. As a result, players like Morrison, that have excellent technical ability and a large ego to go with it, will not want to play under him, as they see themselves as above a team that hoofs it to a target man and, lets be honest, a creative playmaker will be utterly wasted in a team built around crossing and knockdowns.

Furthermore, with regards to Morrison specifically, his position is attacking midfield. Guess who else plays there? Nolan; club captain and the Fat Man's long term romantic partner. Unless injured or, as the case has been this season, suspended, Nolan will start without fail, and therefore under the Fat Man Morrison will be either warming the bench, or (like Diame this season) be forced to play out wide and therefore out of position.

So, to summarise this ramble, I would be not be surprised if we lose Morrison (the only player in our entire squad with a shred of actual footballing talen) to old melty face Redknapp. At least we will have the satisfaction of knowing that his agent will milk that gullible fuckwit Tony Fernandes for every penny he can.",0,1392509987,null,0,1392561819,0,cfgbduj,t3_1y0op7,t1_cfgbduj,t3_1y0op7,null,1432414516,5,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,5

From the arse perspective I think this guy is right in a lot of ways but he is leaving out some major aspects

1) Wenger knows his players, if he thinks Giroud can lead the line for a season then he can probably do a fair job.

2) he points out himself that Giroud has played more than any other striker in the League, he's exhausted! 

3) he does seem to help the team knit together well, that's his major problem, too much linking not enough striking. I don't think a Benteke or even an Aguero/Sturridge would allow those midfielders to flourish in the final third as much.
