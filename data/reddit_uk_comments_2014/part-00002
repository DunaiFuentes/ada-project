First off, you're really skilled when it comes to painting clothes. The folds in River's denim jacket, and the texture on Matt Smith's, are really well-done. Also, you've good at how light falls on skin; the colors are mottled and quite dynamic.

However, I think you need to practice more on facial proportions, especially in the mouth area. In the River painting, her mouth and nose looks like she has a bit of a harelip. You might want to not use black for the insides of the mouth; River and Smith's mouths appear toothless for being too dark (the area around Smith's eyes look too deep).

&gt; Barbican does not have terraced gardens - It has a couple of grass areas with trees.

&gt; A guy sitting in a green council sweatshirt behind a reception desk a is not a concierge in any terms I'd describe. And that's only in the three tower blocks - for the rest it's 24/7 car park security.

&gt; The big conservatory is not in the centre of the estate and it's not open to the public or residents - it was put there to cover up the highest fly tower of any theatre in Europe and remains a private area to hire out by the corporate wing of the arts centre. Nothing their for residents.

&gt; There's one newsagent on the estate and no offices other than for the running of the arts centre, there's one private school nothing to do with the residents and certainly it's no paradise! Always slightly shabby in fact.
High house values of course attract rich people but that doesn't make somewhere posh of luxurious. And this has only happened in the last 5 years or so - in fact there are many original council tennants still living there.
So, this is an article deliberately trying to aggrandise the estate in order to add fuel to this argument.

&gt; As I say, in my view, Scargill is just a 'victim' of circumstance - the inflation of his rent is due to massively inflated prices, much due to mortgage fraud enriching bankers via mortgage derivatives - which he of course would otherwise benefit from if he wasn't stuck renting.

&gt; Hey, why don't the NUM ask the rip-off landlord to reduce the rent back to 80's prices? Would that be considered to be unfair to take away the massive profits from a private individual? After all, it is the landlord and their agent who are profiting from all this, not Scargill.

Well, clearly I'd dispute that 'pure' capitalism earns all the plaudits for the Internet.  As you rightly hint at, its birth was steeped in collectivism, State and public works - from DARPA, through JANET, to the development of HTML and the WWW at CERN, and much of the sever base today remains open source (Apache).  There have been huge subsidies to most of the major private players in Silicon Valley and beyond (from Micosoft on), the Military Industrial Complex has had a substantial role in technological development at many levels including encryption, telephony, cabling, software development, etc.  A goodly number of software and game design start ups are run along implicitly socialist and quasi-socialist lines (low to zero hierarchy cooperatives).

&gt;And while it has caused problems for some in the developing world, it is worth noticing that China has taken 30-40 years to go from a largely agrarian society to heavily industrialized with a nascent workers rights movement, something that took us the best part of 2 centuries to do.

A large chunk of the rapid development of both Russia and China was down to a brutal form of State-planned socialism/capitalism, which took them from feudal agrarian manorialism to being major industrial powers in record time, certainly orders of magnitude less time than the more traditional capitalist path of Western nations.  Of course, the costs of this transition, we can both agree, were far too high in terms of human misery (which is not to say the Western path was without such misery, and the deaths caused both domestically and certainly internationally by capitalism were substantial).",0,1388738910,null,0,1388739094,0,ceg6yww,t3_1u8yr6,t1_ceg6yww,t1_cefwkh6,null,1431779159,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Sorry to disagree but I definitely wouldn't be suggesting any of these areas to an early 20's couple looking for an apartment near the city center. These are family suburbs and social housing areas (Totterdown, Knowle) and inner city industrial/commercial hotspots (Sandy Park &amp; St Annes). None of which are comfortable walking distance from the centre and have almost zero night life of their own.

Personally I would look in the center its self and would absolutely stay north of the River. Top places for young couples looking to integrate into City life will almost certainly be Clifton, Clifton Wood, Redland, Cotham and Hotwells. People will tell you these places are expensive to live but they really are not, you will find loads of young people renting and sharing flats and really enjoying city life here. However, even if they are too expensive for you still look try and stay North of the River.

Try one of [these](http://www.pololu.com/product/1392) controllers hooked to a spare gear motor or actuator with position feedback (can even be a potentiometer you install separately). Now, you have full acceleration control with a PID loop for feedback which will give you nice fluid movement. Hook that controller up to either serial (into a computer), analog (voltage sweep from a pot), RC signal (PWM from off-the-shelf RC car hardware) or a few other control methods to have a fully controllable Dalek head.

I use those controllers to handle the steering in my robot platforms. I use a 12V linear actuator with a built in pot to give position feedback, all hooked into one of the Pololu JRK controllers. For smaller main locomotion motors (10-20A or so) you can use the Simple Motor Controllers to get a really nice motor control experience. The start/stop acceleration limiter feature is really nice to keep from blowing up a weak gearbox (ask me how I figured that out) or it can keep your creations from starting with too much of a jolt.

You obviously need a play maker in there somewhere, or else we're back playing like we were under AVB. So if Eriksen gets injured, Holtby is the most like-for-like replacement. Siggy is an auxiliary midfield striker. His passing is decent, but his real strength is those shots and free kicks just outside the box. There have been some really good descriptions on this sub that outline this in detail.

That being said, with the other two slots filled with box-to-box/holding midfielders, the only position left is the one slot on the midfield, whether it be on the right or left (Eriksen is two footed :D). Now, you could put Siggy there. But do you really want to sacrifice the ability to play Lennon or Lamela (when he's playing at Roma level)?

The question is how would a private company go about changing the T's &amp; C's without your consent? The answer - with difficulty.

The likelihood is that private companies will collect on those who have tried to avoid paying their loans back by moving abroad / self employed / etc. the point is that these debts are written off by the government anyway, so they sell them at pennies on the pound to debt recovery companies who are then far more aggressive (e.g. actively tracing you down).

Personally I only use it where smoking a cigarette is allowed, but I never had a problem with not being able to smoke everywhere either.

I'm not going to claim they are good for me, but as harm-reduction goes they are a hell of a lot less bad for me than cigarettes. By all means limit sales to adults (isn't that already the case?), limit advertising, etc., but don't impose restrictions that prevent me from using them, and driving me back to tobacco.

I'm sick of the uneducated and biased arguments surrounding their use. Children might use them? True, but they also might experiment with cigarettes, alcohol, and worse. Sweet flavours are marketed at children? I'm 41, and much prefer vaping apple or chocolate fudge brownie, than tobacco; clearly adults quite like sweet flavours too! They are addictive? So? I'm happy with my nicotine addiction, and can you imagine a world where everything that can be addictive is banned? Nicotine is ""bad"" for you - I'm not going to deny that it isn't good for you, but it's about as bad for you as caffeine (also used as a pesticide), and a hell of a lot less ""bad"" for you than alcohol, tobacco, and countless other things we ingest in some form every day.

My biggest gripe is the call to ban them for ""the public health"". If this was anything other than government/big tobacco/big pharma panicking about the amount of revenue they are losing, then they would be looking to ban tobacco cigarettes first, after all smoking is much more common than vaping and poses a much clearer risk to health.

It is biased, just not so openly as other papers.

I'm a frequent reader, but I've never forgiven them for their warmongering in the run-up to the Iraq War. Especially since:

a) These are *clever* people (and boy, don't they know it!). It was quite cringeworthy to see them fall for and parrot the transparent lies served by Bush and Blair.

b) After the fact, they've quite stealthily gone from their previous support to ""Boy, that was stupid, wasn't it!"", without acknowledging their mistakes for an instant, never mind asking forgiveness for them. A bit of atonement wouldn't have hurt. It doesn't help that this has also been their approach to global warming, which they strenuously denied until facts became too outrageously clear. Furthermore, this sweeping of past mistakes under the carpet clearly contrasts with their pride (not to say haughtiness) about their record: this is after all the same paper which, after more than a century and a half, still trumpets how right it was to oppose the Corn Laws.

The other thing I dislike about the ""Economist"" is how incredibly parochial it can be for a supposedly global paper.

1. in the beginning, god gave each nation an quality. Some got intelligence, some got stubbornness etc. but he forgot about the dear Moldavians. When he finally remembered about them, there were only a couple of qualities left for them to chose. he said: 
-My dear Moldavians, i'm sorry i forgot about you, and now i can only give you either beauty or stupidity, which one do you want? 
-well, our dear Lord, everybody knows that beauty fades away with time, so, we'll take the latter.




2. At a custom house, there was a Moldavian riding a bike, wanting to pass. He had a sand bag on his bike. The custom-house officer sees him, he says:
-You are Moldavian, i know you want to smuggle something in. He then takes the sand bag, rips it open,searches through it, but he can find nothing but sand. The Moldavian takes a sip of țuică, and passes through. 
Next time, same thing passes. 
-You are Moldavian, I know you want to smuggle something in. He then takes the bag of sands, and sends sand samples to laboratory, but they can find nothing but sand in there. The Moldavian, takes a sip of țuică, and passes through. 
Next time the Moldavian was already drunk. The custom house officer was really frustrated. He takes the bag of sand and throws it on the ground, and yells: 
-what the hell are you smuggling in,  I know you're smuggling something. To which, the Moldavian replies:
-(hic) bikes.

It's called the 'first fireman principle' or, in the states, 'Washington Monument Syndrome'.

Basically, government agencies when facing budget cuts say they will target the most visible and appreciated services first in order to effectively extort more money rather than compromise over areas where the taxpayer can get better value for money.

There is a reason why the spokesman talked about it on that day. Government departments are measured by how many people they employ, how high their budgets are, and how much administration accompanies those budgets.

This might be it. I worked as a nurse for a bit. The number of young poles with liver issues was ridiculous. There was one English guy once. Not many old people though. I don't think they live long enough to get old.

I think the Romanians are going to take the Poles jobs. And steal from them. The Poles are not going to like this. And then fighting.

true,The_Disco_Spider_,null,null,"I think we'll stay with the 4-3-3/4-5-1 we've been playing with, it's led to some very good football.

I know Sturridge wants to play up front, but honestly if he comes in for Sterling and makes similar runs he'll have so many chances when Suarez and Coutinho drop deeper and play through balls to him. Look how often Walcott scores even though he's a striker stationed on the right because he's put clean through. Also when Sturridge cuts in from the right onto his left foot, there'll be more room for Henderson and Johnson to overlap. Also, the fluidity of our attacks usually stop a player being pinned down into one position.

I do think it's kinda silly, when picking best XI's, to worry about new signings or any other good players not being mentioned. When City play their 4-4-2 they don't ask where Dzeko, Silva, Kolarov, Javi Garcia are  they're just better prepared if any players miss games.

It's about building a winning squad, not team. The lineup and formation might need to be completely changed or just tweaked depending on availability; suspensions, injuries, being rested, personal reasons, bad/good run of form, specific tactics for certain opposition. These can all mean a player is in or out of the starting XI, so it's important to remember that everyone in the squad will get an opportunity to impress at some point.

You sort of want a lucky dip type deal when it comes to your full squad, being able to randomly pick players from a little group and always being happy with lineup would show where you in terms of preparedness for a season when your taking multiple competitions seriously.

Looking to next season, say Liverpool have 55 games. Pick a team from these options...

The mines were nationalised and the miners themselves had a very strong union. So strong, in fact, that it was their strike action in the 1970s that led to power blackouts, the three day week - all round chaos. Arguably, it was one of the reasons Labour lost the general election in 1979.

Thatcher had already decided that there was absolutely No Fucking Chance any industry was ever going to have that sort of power over her government, TYVM. So as soon as she came to power, she started stockpiling vast amounts of coal, looked into reducing our dependency on coal and buying it in from other countries.

Now, our mines weren't particularly efficient. To give you some idea of how inefficient they were - it was just as cheap to ship coal over from Australia as it was to mine our own. Which meant that - no matter what the miners thought of it - some serious changes were absolutely necessary.

However, it seems nobody thought to explain these facts to the head of the miners' union, Arthur Scargill. Or if they did, he didn't accept them. So when the National Union of Miners called for strike action in 1984, Thatcher was able to say ""Fine. Go on strike. We'll see who breaks first"".",0,1388748919,null,0,false,0,ceg8nvr,t3_1ualrr,t1_ceg8nvr,t3_1ualrr,null,1431779957,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

* No bid for Higuain. Player we can not get.


* Mata trained fantastically. Mourinho told Mata he doesn't want him to leave, doesn't want club to sell him and he trained fantastically. No interest from other clubs.


* (KdB) Is a time for agents to do their business. Its a time when agents like to talk about their players. Kevin didn't adapt very well to the life a Chelsea player has. A difficult life, beautiful life that one has to give up a lot for. First time at a big club with big competition. He fancies a move but is a fantastic player and fantastic players are expensive. Jose doesn't want him to leave but other clubs have made contact.


* Squad is same with one in, one out.


* Go out with best possible team. Basic structure is the same, not going to give break to some and opportunity to others. Don't want to play second game so want to win.


* No striker in January. ""We have three.""


* Squad is good enough for his first season and objectives of first season.


* Bertrand is fit but Kalas provides better options.


* Philosophy is wanting to be favourites for their next game.


* Fans had enjoyable decade, enjoyed team. A team with a spine of the same players season after season. Building a new team with some of the old players. Fans trust him. Building a team for next 7-8 years.


* Doesn't agree that most clubs could do without FA cup. Replace Europe for most clubs.


* There are many ways to fight diving. The main thing is culturally you have to persuade people its bad for the game. Blatter should tour places where it is the culture. Last place for him to tour is England because the football is pure.


* Asked again about strikers or signing anyone. 100% no striker, doesn't specify others.


* Managers should be punished but shouldn't be portrayed as strange, weird or impolite in the eyes of their players.


* Almost managed England after he left Chelsea but hasn't been close since.

New York Times, May 15, 2005.


""Imagine for a moment that you are the manager of a day-care center. You have a clearly stated policy that children are supposed to be picked up by 4 p.m. But very often parents are late. The result: at day's end, you have some anxious children and at least one teacher who must wait around for the parents to arrive. What to do?

A pair of economists who heard of this dilemma - it turned out to be a rather common one - offered a solution: fine the tardy parents. Why, after all, should the day-care center take care of these kids for free?

The economists decided to test their solution by conducting a study of ten day-care centers in Haifa, Israel. The study lasted twenty weeks, but the fine was not introduced immediately. For the first four weeks, the economists simply kept track of the number of parents who came late; there were, on average, eight late pickups per week per day-care center. In the fifth week, the fine was enacted. It was announced that any parent arriving more than ten minutes late would pay $3 per child for each incident. The fee would be added to the parents' monthly bill, which was roughly $380.

After the fine was enacted, the number of late pickups promptly went ... up. Before long there were twenty late pickups per week, more than double the original average. The incentive had plainly backfired.

Economics is, at root, the study of incentives: how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. Economists love incentives. They love to dream them up and enact them, study them and tinker with them. The typical economist believes the world has not yet invented a problem that he cannot fix if given a free hand to design the proper incentive scheme. His solution may not always be pretty - it may involve coercion or exorbitant penalties or the violation of civil liberties - but the original problem, rest assured, will be fixed. An incentive is a bullet, a lever, a key: an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.

We all learn to respond to incentives, negative and positive, from the outset of life. If you toddle over to the hot stove and touch it, you burn a finger. But if you bring home straight A's from school, you get a new bike. If you are spotted picking your nose in class, you get ridiculed. But if you make the basketball team, you move up the social ladder. If you break curfew, you get grounded. But if you ace your SATs, you get to go to a good college. If you flunk out of law school, you have to go to work at your father's insurance company. But if you perform so well that a rival company comes calling, you become a vice president and no longer have to work for your father. If you become so excited about your new vice president job that you drive home at eighty mph, you get pulled over by the police and fined $100. But if you hit your sales projections and collect a year-end bonus, you not only aren't worried about the $100 ticket but can also afford to buy that Viking range you've always wanted - and on which your toddler can now burn her own finger.

An incentive is simply a means of urging people to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing. But most incentives don't come about organically. Someone - an economist or a politician or a parent - has to invent them. Your three-year-old eats all her vegetables for a week? She wins a trip to the toy store. A big steelmaker belches too much smoke into the air? The company is fined for each cubic foot of pollutants over the legal limit. Too many Americans aren't paying their share of income tax? It was the economist Milton Friedman who helped come up with a solution to this one: automatic tax withholding from employees' paychecks.

There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack ""sin tax"" is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.

Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question - why is there so much crime in modern society? - and stand it on its head: why isn't there a lot more crime?

After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail - thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties - is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don't want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don't want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne's scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a ""shaming"" offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on""",0,1388750972,null,0,1388756209,0,ceg8z1w,t3_1ub0w4,t1_ceg8z1w,t3_1ub0w4,null,1435539166,43,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,43

true,HungrySamurai,null,null,"From 1950 to 1970 saw policies of full employment pursued by western govenments, strong international capital controls, and an oil production boom from 10 to 60 million barrels a day.
In the US an affluent middle class emerges during the 50s. In the UK the 50s remain austere, not picking up until the late 60s.
There is a general shortage of labour, addressed by mass immigration, initially Poles in the post-war years followed by members of the Commonwealth. Work is generally easy to find, and trade unions are strong.

1970 to 1980 sees oil production rise and fall, but remain in the region of 60 million barrels, with shortages and elevated prices. In Britain the coal miners take this as an opportunity to readdress their wages which have stagnated for a decade. Their strike brings down the conservative government in 1974, something the conservatives never forgive them for. Subsequent crises lead to the 'Winter of Discontent'. Never the less, the 1970s see the rise of affluence for the general population. While some sectors begin to decline, work remains relatively easy to find, and one sector in particular begins to expand. Finance and Banking see huge increases in international capital flows, exchange rate speculation and retail banking.

1980 to 1990 sees oil production steadily rise again. By the mid 80s there's a surplus of cheap energy and easy credit, but the intervening years sees the dismantling of heavy industry and a deep recession that punishes Northern Britain. The service-sector South by contrast is barely touched by the recession.
Polices of full-employment are abandoned by governments. The Trade Unions fight this, but unrestricted international capital flows and technology allow employers to simply walk away. Power itself, shifts from the political sphere to finance, with markets able to punish any policy they deem unsuitable.
At work a new generation of management graduates start sprouting jargon such as 'pro-active' and 'synergise', employees collectively roll eyes or stare blankly.
House prices rise, wages stagnant, but general affluence rises as cheaper consumer goods appear, and energy is cheap.

1990 to 2005 oil production continues to steadily increase. Formerly leftist political parties adopt neo-liberal policies, in the face of market pressures. There's a minor recession and house price crash early on, but otherwise times are optimistic. Having made more money than they know what to do with, finance splurges on information technology and persuades governments to borrow more. Increased public spending helps revitalise The North.
The rise of dual-income families and couples, and easy credit keeps consumerism ticking along in the face of stagnant wages and increasing housing costs. Young professionals start living in shared housing until they can afford to put down a deposit.
At work perfectly normal people start saying 'pro-active' *without any hint of irony*, while working longer hours in a more stressful goal-orientated environment. The new generation entering the work place accept it as the norm. 

2005 to 2014 sees global oil production plateau at around 80 million barrels, while demand continues to grow. Energy prices and all goods dependent upon energy prices increase. The Banking Crisis triggers a global depression. In Britain a few million people turn into lazy scroungers over night if you read the Daily Mail. Like the 1980s, The North is hit hardest, but the The South is not left unscathed this time. In 2010 the coalition government implements a set of austerity measures that slow the economy down even further.
Work at this point is harder to find and more insecure than at any point since the 1930s, with a long term prospect of further deterioration.

You see, that post-war growth was fueled by a quite massive increase in energy production. That's how the affluence was paid for regardless of political ideology. The politics just determines how the wealth is divided up.  ",0,1388751468,null,0,1388820179,0,ceg91yy,t3_1u89hr,t1_ceg91yy,t3_1u89hr,null,1431780142,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* The devices should be regulated as the consumer electronics they are: battery safety requirements, disposal rules, that kinda thing. This might already be the case, or maybe some manufacturers are just self-regulating - the ""MVP"" battery I'm using right now has a [CE mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_mark) and a [WEEE logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_Directive) on it, for instance.
* The liquids/cartridge contents, as something you ingest, should be regulated like foodstuffs: a list of ingredients, tests to ensure that list is accurate, no using ingredients known to be harmful when used as advertised (eg, no [diacetyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl#Safety)).
* The liquids should also be regulated like anything else that's poisonous to drink (consider lemon-scented bleach, for example): warning labels, child-proof caps, and so on. Again, this may already be the case, or self-regulation may be working here too - every bottle of e-juice I've seen already has such features.
* As nicotine is addictive, there should probably be an age limit on buying ecigs, and restrictions on advertising. I'm kinda on the fence about those ... I'd probably compare to energy drink regulation on such matters. I note once again that most ecig vendors self-regulate to not sell to minors anyway; but I agree with you about the ""aspirational"" style of some of the adverts I've seen.
* Ecigs in general should emphatically **not** be more regulated than tobacco, because to do so would completely undermine their value in harm reduction.
* Caveat to the previous point: more study is needed to work out exactly how harmful ecigs are. I'm really not worried about the juice ingredients, but I must admit to being slightly concerned as to the possible long-term effects of breathing vapour that's passed over hot [silica fibre wicks](http://www.ekowool.com/) and a heating coil that [contains chromium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanthal).

In conclusion: self-regulation seems to be mostly working AFAICT, but formalising some basic safety requirements in law would probably be worthwhile. However, heavy-handed legislation could do a lot more harm than good, at least when there's no conclusive evidence of any actual harm being caused.

Let me quote it for you.

&gt;**What is MIS?**

&gt;The Minimum Income Standard (MIS) is the income that people need in 
order to reach a minimum socially acceptable standard of living in the 
UK today, based on what members of the public think. It is calculated by 
specifying baskets of goods and services required by different types of 
household in order to meet these needs and to participate in society. 

&gt;**How is it arrived at?** 

&gt;A sequence of groups has detailed negotiations about the things a 
family would have to be able to afford in order to achieve an acceptable 
living standard. Experts check that these specifications meet basic 
criteria such as nutritional adequacy and, in some cases, feed back 
information to subsequent research groups that check and amend the 
budgets. Groups typically comprise six to eight people from a mixture 
of socio-economic backgrounds, but all participants within each group 
are from the category under discussion, i.e. pensioner groups decide the 
minimum for pensioners. The method is explained further in Bradshaw 
et al. (2008).

&gt;**What does it include?**

&gt;Groups in the original research defined MIS thus: ‘A minimum standard 
of living in Britain today includes, but is more than just, food, clothes 
and shelter. It is about having what you need in order to have the 
opportunities and choices necessary to participate in society.’
Thus, a minimum is about more than survival alone. However, it covers 
needs, not wants; necessities, not luxuries: items that the public think 
people need in order to be part of society. In identifying things that 
everyone should be able to afford, it does not attempt to specify extra 
requirements for particular individuals and groups – for example, those 
resulting from living in a remote location or having a disability. So, not 
everybody who has more than the minimum income can be guaranteed 
to achieve an acceptable living standard. However, someone falling 
below the minimum is unlikely to achieve such a standard. 

&gt;**To whom does it apply?**

&gt;MIS applies to ‘nuclear’ families and to childless adults, i.e. households 
that comprise a single adult or a couple, with or without dependent 
children. It covers most such households, with its level adjusted to 
reflect their makeup. It does not cover families living with other adults, 
such as households with grown-up children. 

&gt;**Where does it apply?**

&gt;MIS was originally calculated as a minimum for Britain; subsequent 
research in Northern Ireland in 2009 showed that the required budgets 
there are all close to those in the rest of the UK, so the national 
budget standard now applies to the whole of the UK. This standard was 
calculated based on the needs of people in urban areas. A further
project published in 2010 (Smith, Davis and Hirsch, 2010) looked 
at how requirements differ in rural areas. This information is also 
contained in the online Minimum Income Calculator (CRSP, 2013a) 
and can be obtained by clicking on the ‘rural’ option on the main results 
page. Another variation for remote rural Scotland is being published 
in 2013 (Hirsch et al., 2013, forthcoming). Outside the UK, the team 
responsible for the UK MIS has applied the method in Guernsey (Smith, 
Davis and Hirsch, 2011) and supported MIS projects employing the 
same method in Austria, France, Japan and Portugal (all in progress). An 
ongoing MIS programme in the Republic of Ireland uses methods based 
on the UK work (Collins et al., 2012).

&gt;**How is it related to the poverty line?** 

&gt;MIS is relevant to the discussion of poverty, but does not claim to be 
a poverty threshold. This is because participants in the research were 
not specifically asked to talk about what defines poverty. However, it is 
relevant to the poverty debate in that almost all households officially 
defined as being in income poverty (having below 60 per cent of median 
income) are also below MIS. Thus households classified as being in 
relative income poverty are generally unable to reach an acceptable 
standard of living as defined by members of the public. 

&gt;**Who produced it?**

&gt;The original research was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation 
(JRF). It was conducted by the Centre for Research in Social Policy 
(CRSP) at Loughborough University in partnership with the Family 
Budget Unit at the University of York. Updating is carried out by CRSP, 
again with JRF support. In 2011, the Family Budget Unit was wound up 
on the basis that the calculation of MIS takes forward its mission. 

&gt;**When was it produced and how is it updated?**

&gt;The original research was carried out in 2007 and the findings 
presented in 2008 were costed using April 2008 prices. Every July, 
new MIS figures are published, updated to April of the same year. The 
updates take on board inflation and changes in minimum needs as set 
out in Figure 1.

The primary cause of the poor condition in the Netherlands is 1. the modified nature of most of the waterbodies. 2. The deteriorated ecological conditions cause by pollution load. 3. Pollution caused by priority substances. 4. Pollution caused by upstream countries (countries further up the Rhine and other rivers).

To summarise, there are almost no surface waterbodies (only 0.4%) in the Netherlands which were at 'good' or better status in 2009 (good has a special legal meaning under the WFD), p.21, [same source](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/pdf/CWD-2012-379_EN-Vol3_NL.pdf).

Secondly, Agbonlahor can and has played as an out and out striker, and Weimann's natural position is striker. Seriously. It's where he has played his entire career until Lambert put him on the wing (presumably because he can, and Bent/Benteke was in the middle). Benteke's poor form is likely the result of injury trouble, nothing more. He's still easily our best striker, and looked threatening against Sunderland, imo. As for the speculation... well, if he does go in summer, it will be for a large fee, so replacing him long term can also wait. So yeah... three decent strikers, like I said. Why buy another one now when prices are inflated, and the arrival of yet another striker will just help unsettle the ones we have? It makes no sense.

Finally, signing a new striker won't help us concede less, and might not even help us score more. As it stands, without better defending and someone to create chances for our forwards (who are definitely capable of scoring enough goals to keep us up), we might actually go down. Hence why a new striker is NOT on my list of priorities.

Going out and buying another striker (because our *4th choice forward* got injured makes absolutely no sense in the January transfer window.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"Here's my issue. Well, issues. 

I don't know too much about people going to A&amp;E for menial stuff. However, I know a bit about people phoning for an ambulance for menial stuff. You have plenty of people phoning up with ridiculous complaints, such as tummy ache, or paper cuts, or people getting drunk on a Friday and thinking ambulances are taxis. You get plenty of arseholes who think, because they pay their taxes, or are British, they deserve an ambulance in five minutes and if the ambulance doesn't come in two they'll phone up again swearing down the phone. For these sort of people, I would have no issue charging for their rubbish calls. 

However, there are plenty of people who call up with legitimate issues. People who are courteous and don't swear down the phone. People who might think their issue is menial, but phone up just in case. These are the sort of people I wouldn't charge. However, I could see a charge system deterring people with legitimate complaints, just in case they are making too much of a fuss and will end up getting charged for nothing. I would rather lots of arseholes have the service for free than people avoided the service just in case. This carries over to A&amp;E, perhaps more so, as A&amp;E can treat a wider range of ailments than 999 can. 

Secondly, as someone pointed out in another comment, suddenly A&amp;E would become a paid service. Because people would be paying directly in some cases, they would expect faster treatment, or better facilities, which before they would not have had or wanted. 

Thirdly, how do you differentiate between timewasters and people with legitimate ailments? I'll use my great nan as an example. It seemed there was a point that every other week she was calling up the doctor in the middle of the night, or taking an ambulance to A&amp;E, due to something like breathlessness or panic attacks. There was nothing physically wrong with her, however she felt the need to call 999 or the GP. It seemed like more of a mental thing than a physical one. Would she be counted as a timewaster? Would she be charged for what she saw, and what could end up as a legitimate problem? Will there be increased care for people like her with more mental issues, who have in the past required hospital treatment? I fear the answered would be yes, yes and no. 

I'd rather have a system that acted to make sure everyone was OK, rather than allowing these gaps to pop up. ",0,1388753606,null,0,false,0,ceg9epb,t3_1ub0w4,t1_ceg9epb,t3_1ub0w4,null,1431780310,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The DJ was basically saying if the youth ""cannot be bothered to work"" why not give the jobs to those who will - To which I was in total agreement, until...

Old ranty guy phones in. In among the typical ranty racist bullshit he made a very valid point...

""His"" generation had effectively fought (im paraphrasing) for a standard of living (40 hour week, overtime pay etc) that had become the norm. And now ""the immigrants"" are placing those standards and expectations in danger.

The long and the short of it is, do we want to be expected to work for minimum wage, doing 60-70 hour weeks, with little or no overtime. Do we want the standard of living that we enjoy to be devalued?

And I think looking past his racist rant he probably has a point.

Of course this is not the fault of any immigrant, and im not sure who would be to blame. But I think it is something of an issue.

true,DrProfCapt,null,null,"I'm going to format my list a bit differently from yours, in two ways. First, I'm going to assume it starts right now. 2014. First episode airs in an hour. I don't want to try to remember what was cool in the nineties. Second, I'm going to assume none of the actors I list dramatically change (or die) before they get cast. Alright, here we go:

First Doctor (Seasons 1-2): Robin Williams.

First Companion (Seasons 1-3, 5): Allison Brie. In a role similar to Susan, she would be the Doctors niece. She leaves after the second Doctors first season, and makes a single appearance in the first episode of season five, at which point she regenerates.

Second Doctor (Seasons 3-4): Neil Patrick Harris. 

Second Companion (Seasons 4-8): Martin Freeman.

First Master (Season 4): Jack Nicholson. 

Third Doctor (Season 5): Morgan Freeman.

Third Companion (Seasons 5-8): Mila Kunis. She reprises the role of ""Susan"", after Allison Brie regenerates.

Fourth Companion (Season 9): Sofia Vergara. Not a ""proper"" companion, who always follows him around. More like someone he keeps bumping into, like Jack or River. Her roll would be sort of like Rivers. Also, she is a Time Lord. So far everyone I've introduced has been either a Time Lord or Martin Freeman. I promise that will stop soon.

Fifth Companion (Seasons 9-10): Zooey Deschanel

Fourth Doctor (Seasons 6-9): Zachary Quinto.

Fifth Doctor (Seasons 10-15): Nathan Fillion.

Tenth Anniversary Special: All previous Doctors, Susans Jack Nicholson, and Sofia Vergara return for this extravaganza! This also features the regeneration of Sofia Vergara.

Sixth Companion (Seasons 10-12): Eva Mendes. The second ""River"".

Seventh Companion (Seasons 10-17): Mary Elizabeth Winstead

Second Master (Seasons 10-17): Samuel L. Jackson.

Sixth Doctor (Seasons 16-18): Leonardo Dicaprio.

Eighth Companion (Seasons 18-22): Aubrey Plaza. The dramatic return of ""Susan"", this time in her slightly more emo phase.

Seventh Doctor: (Seasons 19-20): Emma Watson.

Eighth Doctor (Season 20): Nicolas Cage. 

Third Master (Seasons 20-25): Helena Bonham Carter.

Ninth Companion (Seasons 20-21): Jennifer Lopez. The third ""River.""

Twentieth Anniversary Special: The only appearance on Nick Cage as the Doctor (just so everyone has to deal with the fact that Nick Cage was the Doctor.) It also features the first appearance of the first female Master, the return of ""River"" (now with a new actress), and an appearance from each previous Doctor and Susan. It also prominently features the Ninth Doctor and Tenth Doctors, since this is all decided beforehand.

Ninth Doctor (Seasons 21-22): Rosario Dawson.

Tenth Doctor (Seasons 23-30): Rupert Grint.

Tenth companion (Seasons 23-24): Kristen Schaal.

Fourth Master (Seasons 24-29): Brian Cranston. And no, that's not a mistake. I do intend for the series to briefly have two Masters, due to wibbly wobbly time wimey stuff.

Eleventh Companion (Seasons 25-26): Tina Fey. The fourth ""Susan"".

Twelfth Companion (Seasons 25-26): Amy Pohlner.

Thirteenth Companion (Seasons 25-27) Sarah Silverman. The fourth ""River.""

Fourteenth Companion (Seasons 27-30): Ellen Page. The fifth ""Susan.""

Fifteenth Companion (Seasons 28-30) Gemma Arterton. The fifth ""River.""

Thirtieth Anniversary Special: A bunch of old actors return, and mos of the main cast regenerates at the end, except Susan, who dies.

Eleventh Doctor: John Hurt. Yeah, I know it's cheating.

Sixteenth Companion (Seasons 30-31): Amy Adams. The sixth ""River"", finally joins as his main companion. 

Seventeenth Companion (Seasons 32-35): Natalie Portman. The seventh River. During season 33, she goes back to travelling independently.

Eighteenth Companion (Seasons 33-35): Jennifer Lawrence.

Twelfth Doctor (Seasons 33-36): Steven Yeun

Fifth Master (Seasons 34-36): Bill Murray

Ninteenth Companion (Seasons 36-38): Benedict Cumberbatch.

Thirteenth Doctor (Seasons 37-40): Peter Dinklage.

Twentieth Companion (Seasons 39-40): Helen Hunt. The eighth River, back permanently.

Sixth Master (Season 40): Alan Rickman.

Fortieth Anniversary Special: The series finale, featuring as many old cast members as possible, and the only appearance of the sixth master.

It sounds like a good idea because we all knew twats who would abuse the system (my favourite was an alcoholic who had had several episodes of withdrawal seizures. When he realised he'd get a free ride in an ambulance, he would go out drinking, fake a seizure wherever he was and get a ride back to St. George's, as he lived around the corner. Did this many times, hard for a paramedic crew to say no to someone 'fitting'. He was horrified once when the paramedics told him they were on the way to King's and he promptly recovered and jumped out).

Elderly people are overwhelmingly those in most need of healthcare and also those for whom money is most tight. They think about money quite irrationally, it may seem to us, but it comes from their frugal upbringing. If you're an elderly man with an ailing wife, you might ignore that chest pain if you felt £10 of heating might be taken away. It doesn't matter that there would be assurances it would get paid back, as it is old people ignore symptoms as they don't want to cause a fuss.

Imposing an age limit (ie over 60s don't pay) might help, but even then there might be those under that age who feel the same way.

The fact is, it's not this post by itself that's a problem, it's a mild annoyance at best but what annoys me is that's it's a symptom of a much bigger issue with the Doctor Who fandom, not so much on /r/gallifrey as /r/doctorwho but people seem to think that Doctor Who is this incredibly deep inter weaved show, a false assumption not helped by Moffat's constant lying about plot elements 'There's something everybody missed in The Eleventh Hour' What? The huge crack? That was a huge part of series 5?

But there are many reasons this isn't a reference to Tennant. For one it would be a huge insult to Smith to have a reference to his predecessor is his finale episode. For two those hats are a tradition for crackers in England, it was scene setting.

Considering it was his first premier league start (in a pretty difficult game for a centre back away at Stoke up against someone like Peter Crouch) and considering he's only 19 which is ridiculously young for a central defender I was EXTREMELY impressed with him. I seriously think this guy is gonna be sheer class. Defo agree with you that he won't be challenging jags anytime soon but I think we will see him replace Distin as he is gettin on a bit now in terms of age (although we've been saying that for years and he keeps gettin better!). The future looks fantastic for this lad at Everton. He is without a doubt one of the best centre backs for his age I have ever seen in the premier league. And of course lets not forget, he is much more of a Martinez stlye player than jags or distin are which can only bode well for the future. His distribution and ability to bring the ball out of defence are qualities this lad has in abundance.

Marin was purchased to be a first team player when the team was struggling and he looked like a bargain option when we weren't going to qualify for the Champions League.  Winning the Champions League gave us the revenue to purchase Hazard making Marin irrelevant and he seems to be a bust due to injury anyways.  Piazon and Troure are both young extremely exciting prospects that could find themselves in the Chelsea first team someday.  They're age staggers nicely to have them entering their prime at the same time we will see Mata and Willian exiting theirs.  Troure may seem like a strange buy but he has been on trial at Chelsea for a long time and just needed to wait to sign a professional deal.

Kakuta has been with us for a while and was a bust, he no longer should factor in the conversation.

Atsu feels like a buy for Vitesse to me.  He isn't young enough to be an elite prospect and he isn't good enough for the first team.  He is a great fit for Vitesse and in my opinion was a purchase for them because we can.

Thorgan is a strange one as when he was purchased many believed his future was playing a little deeper on the pitch but so far he has excelled in a more forward role.  We won't really know much about him until he moves to a more challenging league.

TL;DR Moses, Kakuta, and Marin are low budget busts when we weren't sure about financials, Atsu was bought for Vitesse, Piazon and Troure are the potential stars we are looking for and will reach prime as Mata/Willian exit theirs

Thats very young for any premier league footballer but is pretty much unheard of for a centre back. Let's not forget he was in an untried partnership with somebody who has only started once for the club. His composure on the ball is what impressed me the most, the run he went on made him look like Beckenbauer!!! In all honesty though, we have (yet another) INCREDIBLY talented youngster who is going to be one of the best players in the league in his position - I have absolutely no doubt about that whatsoever.

They didn't just stick their head in the sand and throw money at the problem as most western countries have done:

Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance - 2 years in jail

CEO of Glitnir - 9 months 

President of MP Bank - 1 year

President of Kaupthing Bank - 5 years 

Chairman of Kaupthing Bank - 5 years 

President of Kaupthing Bank in Luxembourg - 3 years 


It has had two years of economic growth and unemployment is down to 6.3% and is regarded as an economic success story out of the financial crisis. Maybe doing exactly what Iceland did wouldn't work the same way for the UK but I like that they actually tried to address the problem instead of being afraid to upset the banksters.

I did between Christmas and new year (I was looking at things that might need different types of visualisations and this seemed ripe for it - I haven't completed that bit yet: I was looking at ways of producing proper histograms, not the crappy ones that Excel offers).

The ONS produces data on full time wages for each percentile (it's based on survey data rather than tax data, so it has some inherent flaws in it).  If you drew a graph of what you would think it would look like (with percentile on the y axis and full time wage on the x axis) then you would expect to be looking at an 'r' shaped curve*, whereby the higher up you go in the percentiles the more the increases in wages are (or at least that's how I expected it) with a had stop at the bottom on minimum wage.  That reflects that the jobs at the lower end of the pay scale have a greater supply of people willing and able to do them, whereas those at the top are for the experienced and skilled.

What you actually see is that for the 10th percentile to the 70th percentile is a more or less straight line, before turning into a curve above that.  Like this (bear in mind that I haven't put any figures for the wages into this because I don't have them to hand):

http://imgur.com/ew6dmvz

This can mean either one of two things:

1. The people between the 10th and the 70th percentiles are being paid more than they should be (a shortage of supply)
2. From the 70th percentile downwards people are getting incrementally paid less than they should be for a proper curve (a shortage of demand)

Either way, what this does show is that the curve for anything over the 70th percentile is about right - people over about (don't quote me on this figure) £35k a year earnings are on what we would expect to be a normal curve.

* Obviously if you include part time wages then you'll end up with the traditional s shaped model, although usually the bottom of the s is only for the bottom 10% - 20%

Comforting like that should give enough confidence for him not to be stressed at least about the language.

Poland was quite homophobic (when compared to the west) but it changes every year and the whole country becomes more liberal. I think whole homophobia comes from being afraid of people who may appear different than others and as only very few officially were ""different"" people didn't personally know them. The first time you meet different people, like foreigners or with other sexual orientation and see they are exactly the same then all that stuff of being afraid slowly moves away. Education and other things are obviously important as well.

I think I was less tolerant when in Poland (I mean I was pretty tolerant and liberal then anyway) but became even more liberal after the stay here. This was simply because we weren't thought enough and told off about tolerance - partly because of the Church.

true,LazyGit,null,null,"Correct me if I'm wrong but an awful lot more than 51 people were in receipt of more than the cap amount, that's just the number actually affected by the cap because they had no job. There are still more people right now who have jobs and are still receiving ludicrous amounts in benefit.

I think most people also understood that the vast majority of it was in the form of housing benefit but also understood that it made no difference. They have to pay what they can afford for the place where they live while others are having a house in London paid for from their tax money. As I pointed out to someone else at the time, I don't 'see' my rent money either but I don't caim that I earn thousands of pounds less a year because of it.

And that's not demonisation. When some people were receiving an effective salary of over £35k a year to live in London, others are working full time for less than half that so they can live in a shitty flat in a shitty town in the middle of nowhere. That's just a fact. Demonisation would be claiming that they're all like Mick Philpott.

Yet the workers were expected by some to stand arm-in-arm with their benefits-laden comrades because most of the money goes to a landlord. How does that make it better? Doesn't it make it worse? And isn't it actually a clear argument to reduce the cap even further? As it stands we're talking about people not getting more than £400 a week for a property. In the majority of the UK £400 a month would get you a decent place to live and I'm supposed to feel sorry for people only getting £1600 a month? If the government weren't underwriting slum -landlords we would be in a much better situation than we are now.

It might be a tiny number of people affected but for people who work and know there are people who don't work and are living a better lifestyle than them, it's demoralising. So at a time when people had to knuckle down to keep their crap jobs and keep the economy on the road they knew some people were receiving much more than them in benefits.

The benefits system should ensure that people can stay on their feet between jobs, not keep them in the manner they're accustomed or guild the nests of landlords. The cap could easily be halved.",0,1388759992,null,0,false,0,cegauxc,t3_1u8yr6,t1_cegauxc,t1_ceg0ecy,null,1431780992,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"There needs to be some way of reducing the ridiculous level of demand for A&amp;E.  


Look at it this way - if a service is ""free"" at the point of delivery, then demand will be limitless.  It follows that an unlimited service will be then viewed as worthless by some of those who use it, hence the reason we have people turning up to A&amp;E at 4am with nonspecific low back pain they have had for several months ""just to get it checked out"".  A great many of these people, in my own experience, just didn't want to wait the 48-72h to see a GP, or weren't prepared to wait for ""their"" GP to be available.


Co-payments is one way of doing this, but £10 probably isn't high enough to deter people who are attending inappropriately.  Also, how do you decide who pays?  It's not fair for those on limited income, on state support, children or the elderly, or those with a chronic illness.  And as another user said, patients will *expect* investigation or treatment if they have to pay to attend.  People who *can* pay will also just attend even more frequently.


Personally, I think the best way of reducing these inappropriate attendances is a much more robust system of triage which actually turns people away, rather than just letting everybody in no matter what their problem is.  This would of course have to be met with better GP availability.  In my days in A&amp;E I lost count of the number of times I had to look at someone's stubbed toe or longstanding lower back pain when the department was filling up with genuinely sick people with serious medical problems.  These patients all have to be seen within four hours and although they are easy to deal with, it's not the sort of thing A&amp;E should necessarily be sorting out.

that it meet the needs of everyone
that it be free at the point of delivery
that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay
I don't think those 3 principles should change.  This isn't about reducing the time wasters at a&amp;e it's about introducing charging into the NHS.  It's an ideologically driven.  Rather than update thinking around access methods it's better to dismantle the whole thing and stick it in private hands. As someone who has had cancer and treatment on the NHS I am very glad I didn't have to choose if I could afford it or if I had to die. 
Introducing a £10 would be just the start of it. The NHS is a badly run, inefficient beast and does need to be better controlled but when it's in private hands and run for profit it will be far worse.

A back-up DM is needed, but since we score so freely maybe a top DM to scare the shit out of Lucas is an option? Enrique is turning into an injury prone player so does he need competion from the bench or from ahead of him? Moses and Aspas have been disappointing, are they to be given chances? Or do we buy replacements? We have one fit striker and one injured, do we need a thrid? Aren't good ones in short supply and expensive?

2) Attacking midfield. N'Zogbia is injured/bomb squaded. That means we have Albrighton and Tonev. And that's it. 2 attacking midfielders in the entire squad and neither have an assist or goal to their name. Weimann and Gabby can fill in wide, but they are strikers and we will need them through the middle with Kozak out. We desperately need any player that get the ball and do something with it in the final third.


3) Central midfield. We've got enough bodies in there, but nobody that can really hurt teams. Additional quality to go alongside Westwood and Delph is very important. Someone who can dictate play and contribute going forward.

No it isn't - its akin to punishing the guys who pay the robber to rob. We (myself included) create the demand for dealers, and we offer financial reward for the risk they take.

No one wants to enter a business where your target market is shrinking and are more anxious.

Firstly, we don't determine what's mass-produced arbitrarily. The item shown here is a [Doctor Who Her Universe Dalek Dress](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Doctor+Who+Her+Universe+Dalek+Dress-301335.jsp), available at most Hot Topic stores. It's not *really* a costume, just a cool shirt to wear with a Dalek design on it.

Now there are a lot of people who wear Doctor Who t-shirts, dresses, and other apparel, as these items are both widely available and relatively inexpensive to own. 

Now /r/DoctorWho is designed primarily for fans to show off artwork (like cosplay) that they themselves made. As you ask here, if she had indeed made this herself, it would be just fine. We try to encourage users to both submit and create new Doctor Who art that's wholly unique.

However, it's not as if this content has nowhere to go on our subreddit. We understand that a lot of users love to share the mass-produced merchandise they've bought with other Whovians.

For posts such as this one, we have the [Merchandise Monday Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1u0j05/merchandise_monday_for_the_week_of_20131230/), where userscanshare Doctor Who products they've bought that week.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is all very confusing from a legal stand point and the judges decision and the crediting party's action make zero sense, other than to take a very expensive minor political snipe at Nick Griffin. The bankruptcy claim was brought about by a legal firm called Gilbert Davies &amp; Partners of Severn Street which represented Mr Griffin in a legal battle that he won. He dismissed his representation and went ahead and represented himself winning the trial.

His legal fee's for some unknown reason were not paid by the losing side, I don't know why, can some one explain?

Later this year Nick Griffin is taking this legal firm to court to have the fee's quashed for incompetency in a case he is likely to win as he won the previous case while going against this firms advice.

He had asked for this bankruptcy case to be delayed until later that ruling, why did the Judge not do this as it seem the sensible thing to do? He had also offered to pay 1/2 the fee owed over 5 years in case he loses the judgment which the legal firm declined and instead will not see a penny.

It seems both the Judge at this hearing and the legal firm simply wanted to tarnish his name with a bankruptcy slew that will last 12 months max but most likely be quashed in 3 months after he takes his previous legal team to court to have their fee's quashed for incompetence.

Either way Gilbert Davies &amp; Partners of Severn Street have come out of this looking like incompetent fools but well you have to be pretty ballsy to represent the BNP and be so bad at it they sack you and win on their own.

The Judge Fox, I think his name is, also looks a bit silly for not deferring the case until after the superior judgment, he will gain popular credit for dissing one to the BNP but professionally people are going to be left asking.

It's presently an isolated bubble economy that has abandoned the rest of the world and will suffer a bit of a crash when it rejoins.

true,artfully_riced,null,null,"&gt;I'm sorry, but leaflet dropping is part and parcel of political campaigning. If that's the smoking gun people are using to link the uup/dup with last year's flag violence they need to scrape another barrel.

I don't claim to be an expert in how aggressive political leaflets are, but the ones distributed re: the flag were extremely inflammatory and a few months ago a bit pof DUP party literature got dropped around East Belfast (maybe elsewhere) that, commenting on the flag issue as it stood, used language like;

*  “…Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance for **colluding** to disrupt the status quo.” Bolding mine, and; 

* ""Scores of police officers have been injured and many of the young people involved in the violence will emerge…with nothing to show…but a criminal record. All of this because of an unwanted and unnecessary decision of Sinn Fein, SDLP and Alliance.”

Robinson obviously condemned the violence on TV, but his party literature is directly blaming them'uns for it (as well as continuing to add the centerist party to them'uns - the party that could've *actually* voted with SF/SDLP and had the flag totally removed, but didn't).

They made a big, emotionally driven, they're-trying-to-steal-your-culture deal of the issue - obviously discreditting the party that stole Robinson's seat is a side motive to the ideological ones - and members of Unionist parties attended flag protests. I'm not - and I'd be surprised if anyone else was - saying that unionist parties are linked to the violence in that they literally spoke out encouraging it or were personally throwing bricks, but they fanned flames rather than attempting to douse them in a lot of ways.

&gt;So why on earth would victims of violence want another 'agreement' that lead to more freedom for killers while offering nothing in return in terms of peace and stability?

I was trying to examine in my post whether or not adherence to the proposed agreement would or wouldn't add peace/stability. As you say, the extremes on either side are unlikely to change because of such an agreement, but as I said, ~50% of unionists already wanted the protests to stop by Jan 2013, and if every single politician here was actively advising their constituents against illegal protesting...seems difficult to imagine this would have literally *no* effect - and this is just the first issue I pulled out of the proposed agreement.

Whether or not killers who have not managed to be convicted already are more or less free with an information amnesty is a whole other topic, one that you can't assert in a sentence must be one way or the other - generally, your posts look to me to be declaring things right/wrong without anything like enough examination of the complex issues.

I think the point though which is what you may have missed is that there is a demand for foodbanks. And the demand is rising. In three years the number of foodbanks has increased by 10 times.

I think it can be dangerous to get too snarled, of course.  But the issues with the Doctor Who Christmas special weren't that they had to deal with wrapping up mythology.  It was a regeneration episode for Matt Smith - *of course* there would be things that had to do with the wider plot.  The problems with that episode were down to much more basic problems, like pacing, odd aging choices, etc.

But it's ludicrous to demand that the showrunners hook people who have never seen Doctor Who during a regeneration episode.  That's like asking someone to get into Breaking Bad by watching ""Felina"".  Lolwhut?

Also, the example given for Doctor Who's fanservicey-ness was the whole 12 regenerations conundrum.  As a personal anecdote, I was surprised when my mother asked about the 12 regenerations last week - she's never seen a single minute of Doctor Who.  So I'm fairly sure it isn't a thing that would baffle the more casual viewer.

There are many issues with Moffat's showrunning in Doctor Who.  But going too far into fanservicey-ness isn't really one of them.

true,BareRuinedChoirs,null,null,"&gt; This argument would only work with systematic discrimination against migrants. If firms offered a higher wage, even more migrants would be attracted to the UK.

That is essentially what I said above, repeated in the form of misdirected criticism. Toynbee's argument rests on the questionable assumption that employers would exert a preference for British workers over migrants. Whether this would be on grounds of employability or xenophobia is a small detail. But if one were to accept this assumption as true, then her argument is entirely consistent with the basic idea that higher wages lead to higher labour market participation, while also offering the possibility of reduced immigration. 

&gt; ""encourage British people to participate in the labour market, and thus discourage migration""

Another straw man, as I didn't write that. 

&gt;This is what I hate about being an economist.

The fact is that your original post completely misunderstood the argument that Toynbee is making. And even then there is the issue of whether your simplistic economic theorising is actually appropriate in this case. What credentials you claim to have is really not a concern of mine.

No one in the UK is really campaigning for selective administration of the law.

What we want is either significant treaty reform, or we want out entirely (depending on who you speak to).

Wikipedia the history of the EU and Charles de Gaulle. This isn't some historical footnote - it dominated European politics for nearly 2 decades. Here is a wikipedia citation: http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2001/uk_and_europe/1958_1969.stm

I don't want to get bogged down on technical definitions of financial transactions taxes -your missing my point, which is that Brussels passes into law measures that specifically harm the UK without really considering their impact, because the best wishes of the UK are not institutionally enshrined in the EU to the same extent as for example the French (e.g. Common Agricultural Policy) is.

Ultimately, the UK is a nation of financial services. So measures that harm financial services are going to disproportionately affect our economy.  ",0,1388769821,null,0,false,0,cegejbe,t3_1u39ji,t1_cegejbe,t1_cefwb40,null,1431782791,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A&amp;E is incredibly expensive, which is why the government spends such a lot of money trying to get people to consider alternatives (like the 111 number). Personally, however, I think the Levitt article is right on point - if I could pay £10 to see a doctor the minute I felt a little unwell (well, within four hours) I would jump straight on that.

I might have more sympathy with fining people who go to A&amp;E who clearly shouldn't be there - I've seen a couple of ingrown toenails turn up on the books - but even then you run the risk of some people (particularly the elderly) dismissing tightness in the chest (a potential heart attack) or blood in the stool (a potential haemorrhage) or blood in the sputum (a potential infectious disease) as 'just one of those things' and turning a disease which would cost £300+£500 to treat at A&amp;E into a life threatening surgical intervention with a lifetime cost of £40,000 per patient.

Ultimately I think the economics of this plan are very dodgy; I'd be surprised if A&amp;E doctors actually support this exact plan, and are trying to indicate that they feel overworked or trivialised.

&gt;In the offseason before 2002, when I was 26, I played a flag football tournament that I participated in annually. Granted, it was physical, but I was used to bouncing back the next day and hitting and throwing in preparation for the upcoming season. But this time, instead of my usual seamless physical recovery, I was extraordinarily stiff for several days.

&gt;This was the first sign that I was in physical decline. From that point on, my body cooperated less and less. When I got to camp in 2002, I noticed that the ball wasn’t exploding off my bat quite as much as it had been the previous year. In fact, in one spring training game in Port Charlotte, I hit a walk-off home run that I confidently anticipated would land in the water beyond the left-field fence and was shocked to see it narrowly sneak out of the park, crashing against the second wooden wall.

&gt;...

&gt;My body was producing less testosterone. I was very slowly and quite naturally shrinking. Every year after that, I carried less and less muscle mass while working just as hard in the weight room and continually improving my eating habits. Each year I came into camp a little lighter: 208, then 205, then 202. By my last year in Tampa I was having trouble maintaining 198. My body without weight training naturally carries a lean 175 or 180, as it did when I graduated from high school. So the progression was natural for a guy who wasn’t getting fatter.

I know it's a different sport but the principle is the same.  So a player's physical peak is probably around 24-26.  A keeper's peak is probably around their early 30s since they obviously depend less on their physicality.",0,1388772742,null,0,1388773209,0,cegfu52,t3_1uau36,t1_cegfu52,t1_cegeqwd,null,1431783410,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

A librarians is not being directed by the government in what to filter, an individual ISP could block what they wanted of their own volition. That's different to the government pushing them to implement things.

This is a dangerous precedent that shouldn't exist because it opens the door mandatory filtering, if they had started out doing that there might have been some public backlash, if they move to it after a few years of this filter system there probably wouldn't be much resistance.

Pepe couldn't stop a shot to save his life, and he looked completely bereft of any confidence. Simon is young, he's assured in what he's doing, and he's got a real professional attitude. Remember his short game used to be dismal, but you can tell he's been working his ass off building up the confidence to pass on the ground and keep possession. With the work he puts in, he's going to be a great keeper. 

Did you watch him against Everton? He got big enough to scare off Delofeou and block Lukaku on two clear chances. 

Pepe shouted a whole bunch, but he was already established at LFC. I think you'll notice that Simon has gradually become more and more vocal. Leadership comes with respect. You can't walk into a club and start commanding and yelling at two Veteran CB's who you just met. As he gets older and more comfortable in the team, he will talk more and take more control. He's already starting to do so.

edit: i just watched your example..that doesn't mean shit. no goalie would have expected that.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"£60 budget. I'm going to simply do it on calories because that's easiest. 

For a month the average woman needs ~2000 calories x 28 days. 56,000 calories total is what we're looking at. This won't be exciting, but it will be enough. Protein is the hardest macro to get on a budget so it's the one I'll be listing. I don't have time to do them all. Protein is by far the most important. 

700g Peanut butter = £2.37 = 4,228 calories, 168g protein. 

1600g bread = £2 = 3,760 calories, 128g protein.

4KG rice = £4.78 = 14,320 calories, 260g protein.

3KG mixed veg = £2.25 = 1,860 calories, 87g protein.

5 * Mixed beans in tomato sauce = £3.10 = 1,940 calories, 100g protein.

1KG mince beef = £4 = 2,520 calories, 176g protein.

1KG Frozen chicken breast = £3.99 = 820 calories, 197g protein.

1KG Frozen Fish fillets = £4 = 720 calories, 166g protein.

750ml Olive oil = £2.50 = 6,750 calories.

4 * 4 pints whole milk = £4 = 5,720 calories, 300g protein.

1kg sweet potatos = £1.31 = 1200 calories.

And I'm afraid I'm frightfully bored at this point. I've spent £34.30 and amassed 43,838 healthy calories. The other 12K calories shouldn't be hard to come by with ~£30 to spend. She could spend it on luxury stuff if she wanted and still make up that 12K. She'd probably want to buy some spices to make more out of those rice + meat dishes. Paprika, curry powder, jerk spices, etc. They're about £1 each. 

It's a piece of piss, I just got bored doing it. Btw, I reached her daily protein requirements in that first £34.30 so she can go crazy with fats or carbs if she wants. A few bags of pasta and some cheese, maybe?

She'd also need to shell out a few quid in the first weeks for some tupperware so she can take meals to work and such. ",1,1388777010,null,0,false,0,ceghtay,t3_1ubcp1,t1_ceghtay,t1_cegeux5,null,1431784338,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Since Sherwood's come in, they've beaten Southampton unconvincingly, drawn WBA, beaten Stoke, and beaten Manchester United.  None of those is a particularly noteworthy result, except for the last, and I've already explained that I watched that game and didn't find them convincing.

Because Romania and Bulgaria have been in the EU for a while and had opportunities to move to other countries. The Romanians have mostly gone to Spain, and the Bulgarians elsewhere.

Of course it probably shouldn't be as simple as that. We already give kids child benefit, which is a basic income of sorts, and this could be kept at the current level. We probably want some sort of disability benefit. We might want to claw back the basic income from higher earners via tax. 

My gut feeling is that a basic income could start out at about the same as average JSA+HB or state pension, in the region of £7000/year. 

The big question is: do we make basic income regional? On one hand it's much more expensive to live in the South East. On the other hand a consistent basic income would work to redistribute wealth from the south east to the rest of the UK, which might be a good thing.

Yet people clearly weren't aware of them. Clear free market failure here.

&gt; When the government starts pushing ISP's to block content by default that you have to actively opt out

You don't have to actively opt out. You have to make a choice.

&gt; you have to wonder what are the long term motives. 

Winning votes seems the simplest explanation. This explanation covers all known facts, and doesn't require the additional complication of an elaborate conspiracy to censor the internet for some undefined long term motive.

&gt; A librarians is not being directed by the government in what to filter,

ISPs get to choose what to filter.

&gt; This is a dangerous precedent that shouldn't exist because it opens the door mandatory filtering,

I'd say it does quite the opposite. There's no ""think of the children"" argument. Everyone is now aware that ISPs offer these filters. What would be the argument for mandatory filtering?

Nobody wants to get loaned out. Nobody. Sure, a year out might be fine. But, any half decent parent or agent is not going to want their kid be loaned out for 2,3,4 years straight, worse of all, to different clubs each year. 

The point is, it is just not sustainable. There are too many clubs out there that can provide the same, if not better facilities to these kids. And, they would actually have some sort of familiarity/security without having to wonder, if they will get loaned out/sold/ or make it.

true,freerangetrousers,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"no there isn't.
Immigrants flock to cities like london, where there is serious issues with over crowding and homelessness. A majority of the homeless in london are eastern european. 

Large businesses love lax immigration laws, because to them it provides cheap labour.
Dominoes for example, according to their ex CEO, have over 1000 jobs available in their company alone, but british people won't take them.

This is because the work is shitty, at minimum wage and I'm pretty sure the delivery drivers have to pay their own petrol.  Its not enough to live a happy life on. It is in other countries.
So people come in, earn their money then send it home. They are miserable because they work in a shitty job, have no life and never see their family. 

Immigration benefits large businesses, and the families who receive the money that immigrants earn, and the British economy, but not the British people. 

There's nothing wrong with the *people* coming here, but mass immigration does not have many benefits for the current British citizens. 

nb. I don't honestly feel the current bulgarian immigrants will have a large effect on the country, but I'm just saying in general we don't really need more people in the country",0,1388779722,null,0,1388779957,0,cegj3eo,t3_1u5wql,t1_cegj3eo,t1_cef58gi,null,1431784945,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Time Lords try to help, but they're having problems with their time travel and can only bring their fleets to help a week or so too late.

So the War Doctor goes to the empire's high command and forms a plan - he'll go to some small outpost and divert the Daleks' attentions from the main attack. He'll announce himself, deliberately appearing vulnerable, and the Daleks will have to go down to the planet itself to get a confirmed kill - if they try to bomb it, he'll just use the TARDIS to escape. So this leaves the Doctor to try and find a way to hold off the Daleks until the Time Lord fleet arrives at the most dramatic moment, and the Daleks have to retreat.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"&gt; Disclaimer: I'm from the U.S.A. I'm not familiar with Brighthouse.

Its a high street store that screws the stupid by offering low weekly repayments for stuff. Sadly there appears to be a lot of stupid people on low incomes in this country. 

They take a TV that normally retails for £500, charge £1800 for it and then add interest on at 64.5% APR. 

Here's an example, a LG 42LA740 which currently retails for £699 at Currys, a normal retail outlet.

[Here is how Brighthouse sells it:](http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/televisions/lg-full-hd-42-led-smart-cinema-3d-tv/)

Weekly payment £17  (this is in big red letters at the top of the page but they don't tell you how many weeks its over, thats at the bottom along with all the following information)

Cash price: £1381.75 (this bit is at the very bottom of the page)

Number of weeks: 156

Annual fixed interest rate: 64.7%

Total repayable £2652. (at the very very bottom of the page)

So they take a telly that is £699 and you end up paying £1953 more for it. There are a lot of fuckwits in this country who use that store because all they see is the £17 a week.

I bet most people were aware of it, I've seen many ISP adverts where filters were part of the sales pitch and if you actually wanted one it's not to hard to ask if you didn't know.

&gt;You don't have to actively opt out. You have to make a choice.

[BT at least are making it opt out for new customers. If you do nothing it will be automatically on.](http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2013/12/16/bt-opt-out/1) 

&gt;Winning votes seems the simplest explanation.

Where was the outcry for a government mandated filter when there was already ISP filters available for those that wanted them? This will win them no votes and is not even on the list of the publics concerns. 

&gt;ISPs get to choose what to filter.

Where are you getting the information that the ISP's are soley deciding what get's blocked? I've seen articles saying the government has been having negotioations with the ISP's to decide what to filter. 

There is already a filter system called cleenfeed which the public cannot turn off and is continually expanding in what it blocks. 

&gt;Everyone is now aware that ISPs offer these filters

They could have just had a educational campaign if they wanted to inform people about the filters that already exist.

&gt;What would be the argument for mandatory filtering?

For the same reason they have D notices to block certain stories getting out. The government would love to block sites that exposed certain information. They've already added 'esoteric' sites to the list of what will be block, who knows what that will include. 

&gt;What is the evil scheme they are plotting?

You act like the government is always so benign, as if there would be no desire for the state to have more control over the flow of information.

&gt; Wikipedia the history of the EU and Charles de Gaulle. This isn't some historical footnote - it dominated European politics for nearly 2 decades.

Considering that de Gaulle only held the French presidency from 1959 to 1969, I don't see how. In any case, Gaullism, with its fierce nationalism, never was the dominant political current in the EEC, never mind the EU. Both center-right ""Rhenanian"" Christian Democracy, which utterly dominated politics in all other five founding states (Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg) into the 1970s and 80s, and center-left Social Democracy left a much deeper imprint than de Gaulle, whose attitude towards the EEC was even more hostile than Thatcher's.

&gt; Brussels passes into law measures that specifically harm the UK without really considering their impact

Please educate yourself about EU lawmaking and stop antropomorphicising ""Brussels"". All EU directives and regulations are passed not by ""Brussels"", but by the European Council, and eventually the European Parliament. The Council is formed by the governments of all member states, and each country's vote is weighed accordingly to its size. As representative of one of the EU's most populous countries', the UK's vote thus carries particular weight. The UK is also accordingly represented at the European Parliament. If ""measures that specifically harm the UK"" are passed ""without really considering their impact"", then you should blame your own government and MEPs, not ""Brussels"".

However, I do think that you'd be hard pressed to find any specific examples of such measures in actual, standing EU directives and regulations (rather than the scare stories cooked up by Paul Dacre &amp; co). The Commission's proposal for a EU FTT, for instance, has been effectively vetoed by the British government (much to the displeasure of most other governments and a large majority of the European population). As for the CAP, much as successive British governments like to use it as a punching ball, in truth the Tories at least are not bloody likely to support slashing agricultural subsidies that greatly benefit some of their core constituents in the shires...

Police came to Doherty’s house at dawn, to arrest him for harassing the police secretary. Shortly after his arrest, he learnt the investigation into his daughter’s grooming had been dropped by police. Records show they had not looked at any of the evidence.

The police secretary has since admitted she has a hazy recollection of the telephone calls she said upset her so much – but only when presented with tapes of the conversations Doherty had wisely recorded. The officers involved in his arrest were found to be at fault and sent on a retraining course. But Doherty believes that is not enough.""

Or the UK unilaterally leaves the EU - which is in itself a fairly significant bargaining chip. On the one hand other members might be glad to be rid of a generally euroskeptical UK... but it also sets a nasty precedent that countries can actually leave the EU, and the ground won't open up and swallow them into a pit of hellfire. There would be a danger that if the UK was successful post-EU exit countries like Greece and Portugal might have a tricky future ahead of them in the EU.

&gt; Please educate yourself about EU lawmaking

You don't need to speak down to me, or write off my opinion as uneducated. You have no idea what my background is or what I know.

As I said, I don't need to look far for examples of what I'm talking about - and the fact that the EU **still** revolves around the common agricultural policy which is vastly beneficial to the french economy is incredible. The Germans similarly benefit from the fact their disproportionately successful currency is bundled in with the hugely unsuccessful Greek economy - effectively allowing them to trade at rates they could never achieve in their own separate currency.

A lot of people in the UK feel like we participate in Europe, but don't particularly benefit form it - or get much say in its strategic direction. You might argue that's fair, but as one of its biggest financial contributors, the 2nd or 3rd largest economy in the EU and 7/8th in the world, depending on measure, a lot of people here would argue the EU should be more UK focused than it is. Particularly given the immense power wielded by Angela Merkel. Ironically we spent most of the 20th century specifically trying to prevent the Germans having that level of control over the continent, and they've somehow managed to achieve it by the backdoor.

Priorities for us are the success of our huge financial services industry, which dwarfs anything on the continent - and by extension **every** single economic decision that goes through the EU should seriously consider how the blocs largest financial center, London, is going to be affected. The EU would be economically stronger if it supported London more aggressively and moved its own trading centers to the UK... but their relentless obsession with a bloc wide single currency has meant their own hubris prevents them from accepting the logical financial center for Europe is London.

It just strikes me, that at a deeply ideological level, the nature of the EU towards the UK is to try and erode our success and prosperity - or at the very least remodel it in such a way that suits the views of our neighbors. You also have to remember that to some extent, it is in the subconscious political psych of the British to ""divide and conquer"" in Europe.

We are in the group of elite academies in Europe, and are successfully competing with historically strong ones like Barca and Arsenal. 


So say you're a top 10 young talent and you have your pick of clubs. We tick all of the boxes. Our youth setup (in terms of talent) is now among the best. Our facilities and coaching staff are in fact matched by only a few (like Manchester City). We can pay high wages. We are located in an attractive city. Our first team is successful. All of these factors have contributed to an dramatic increase in the quality of our academy in recent seasons. Players like Borini and Sinclair are better than any players we produced before them since Terry. Likewise, the players in our setup now are better than Borini and Sinclair and have massive potential. And the truth is that nowhere in football would they have ""security"".

true,throwawaylifad,null,null,"I told myself to give you a proper reply once you posted that and I ended up leaving it for a few days. That pretty much sums it up, I have done nothing but sit around but it's taken me this long just to reply to a post.

I'll try to keep it short. I'm on a placement year for my Computer Science degree. Finally got an interview for a place in Canada during the summer but because of their error I couldn't get a visa to go over there. Thought ""I'll just have to find another relevant job for the placement year"" and here I am, January of the year after. Got one interview, which went well but they didn't want temporary staff, and I have another one (for an actual placement till September) in a week. That's all I've had so far. 

My marks were generally always just above the pass mark and I have an exam resit in a week that I still have not studied for. I've done nothing since the end of the uni year and I still have not started revision for it. The thought of most exams makes me think about the course in general and the fear that I'm not gonna make it through the final year. What kind of person would rather play games and post on Reddit than just revise and get it over with? It's shameful but it only makes me feel worse and I continue to avoid.


 The exam was a whole year ago but I thought I'd be in Canada so didn't apply for the summer resit. Thinking about Canada almost reduces me to tears because everything was looking so perfect, I had a house lined up, nearby family to see, Facebook friends to meet in real life. I thought that I would finally break out of the shell and come back a better person.

It's hard to find a job that's relevant to the degree but is also temporary. Sitting around for six months, which is what I do every summer anyway, seems to have only made me fallen further into this cycle of being a shut-in. Never had many friends and never got out much to begin with. Sometimes I think that my anxiety and depression, which I've had counselling for, is just an excuse to myself to not work on anything and continue this unending avoidance.

It bothers me because I'm only getting worse and my social skills are still a mess are the age of 22. I want to get this job interview in a week and work till September, then rejoin my degree. I've heard that you need to have gained experience during the year and none my uni friend group found a placement by last summer, nor are they working at one now. That scares me because I'll have to make friends with the people we avoided for three years instead of my comfort zone of three other slackers but that's another story.

I'm pretty introverted and being in this NEET stage is fine for me, but that's the problem. I don't want to be like this but it keeps happening and I'll always sort myself everything out ""Tomorrow"". I haven't ever had a job and I feel like a disappointment to my family, a shut-in who has no job and is about to run out of his savings. My brother left NI for England to go to uni, he's joined more clubs and made more friends in an 8 week period than I have made in my whole life. The contrast makes me feel more shameful about it all, as if this is the kind of person I'm becoming rather than just a bad year.

Rakitic - Sometimes i don't even see him play on the field, and other times he looks great.  I'd rather pass on that.

Now unless SportsDirect have a contract involved stating they cannot use Third Party channels, then it would be different, but it would be pretty fucking hard to track all traces of Chelsea Kits when you're dealing with tens of thousands (maybe more) from multiple shipments.

Even further, they could be mixing up shipments, taking official channels off the SportsDirect chain, selling elsewhere for a higher price, and introducing fakes at a lowered price - If asked about the channel if a Contract is in place, they have an offical shipment on the books.

Considering Adidas are looking to restrict the future sales of the kit, this doesn't look so farfetched to me now I've looked into it (they'd know the suppliers, and they'd be the only ones selling it, no grey markets involved).

So why was the media being so hysterical about it?

&gt; BT at least are making it opt out for new customers. If you do nothing it will be automatically on. 

Nope. That's bollocks. [This is the screen you get on setup](http://i.imgur.com/0d0vOiv.png). Clearly bit-tech.net is making guesses and feeding the hysteria.

&gt; Where are you getting the information that the ISP's are soley deciding what get's blocked? I've seen articles saying the government has been having negotioations with the ISP's to decide what to filter. 

Given that different ISPs categorise different sites differently it's pretty obvious. Since bit-tech.net is an example of these articles, I wouldn;t rely too much on the media.

&gt; There is already a filter system called cleenfeed which the public cannot turn off and is continually expanding in what it blocks. 

Yes. This is a completely different thing which is a genuine problem that people seem to be ignoring, focussing instead on a voluntary ISP implemented filter.

&gt; They could have just had a educational campaign if they wanted to inform people about the filters that already exist.

Of for god's sake! Having to click on a ""No Thanks"" button is hardly the end of the world!

&gt; For the same reason they have D notices to block certain stories getting out. The government would love to block sites that exposed certain information. They've already added 'esoteric' sites to the list of what will be block, who knows what that will include. 

They already have D notices. New legislation would seem to be redundant and a waste of time. 

&gt; You act like the government is always so benign, as if there would be no desire for the state to have more control over the flow of information. 

I act as though the state isn't a single entity.

Why does David Cameron want to give Ed Milliband control over the flow of information? Because it's pretty likely that's what he'll be doing and he knows it. 

Why do you think the rest of the government will vote to give a single person so much power?

Supposing Cameron hasn't considered the possibility that he'll lose the election, and somehow gets mandatory filtering legislation passed, what information does he want to control, and how will he justify categorising it as pornography? 

Once he has control over all the information, what do you think he'll do with this power?

Are you seriously saying that the David Cameron is some sort of evil mastermind, who is plotting to use a voluntary porn filtering system to turn the UK into some sort of Orwellian police state?",0,1388787652,null,0,false,0,cegmox7,t3_1ub1hc,t1_cegmox7,t1_cegl1m4,null,1431786760,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It doesn't make any sense to spend that much on a position where we already have enough players and prospects to last us for the next seven years. We're hitting a point of diminishing returns with our CAMs. Even if Reus does fit the system, so what? Hazard, Oscar, and Willian all seem to fit it too. Let's say we get some insane deal for him at 20m. He's not going to displace Oscar or Hazard so he's taking Willian's spot in the team. The question becomes, is he worth 20m more than Willian, probably not.

Outside of some insane deal for Ronaldo (like 10 million) I don't think we should even be looking at buying a CAM no matter who they are (Also, you could argue Ronaldo isn't a CAM).

For one thing, it's not something we really see in this country - this isn't North Korea and nobody with half a brain expects it to be - so what anti-filter argument is left?

IMV, once the censorship argument is dropped, you're left with this:


**PRO-FILTER**

 - More and more devices that you can't install filtering software on are found in the home. Some form of central filtering is necessary.
 - The ISP industry has done very little about this. They've paid lip-service by recommending third party filtering software - but as already discussed, that's not terribly useful when we're talking about things like games consoles and iPads.
 - This leaves very little a concerned parent can do. Few domestic ISPs ever tried ""We offer filtered internet!"" as a selling point, and while you can set up your router to use something like OpenDNS' filtered DNS servers or buy a router that has some rudimentary filtering, this is so far beyond the scope of what most people are capable of it can, for all practical purposes, be ignored.
 - Not to mention, most ISPs supply their own (usually locked-down) routers.
 - The worry isn't horny teenagers masturbating - it's innocent younger kids typing ""boobs"" or ""sex"" into Google and getting bombarded with porn. 

**ANTI-FILTER**

 - There's no such thing as a perfect filter - you're guaranteed to wind up with collateral damage.
   - Pro-filter counterargument: So? Nothing in life is perfect, does that mean we should do nothing?",1,1388788710,null,0,false,0,cegn60d,t3_1ub1hc,t1_cegn60d,t1_ceg9og7,null,1431786985,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

What has that got to do with the public knowing there were already filters? The media could have a whole range of motives.

&gt;Nope. That's bollocks. This is the screen you get on setup. Clearly bit-tech.net is making guesses and feeding the hysteria.

That picture shows it starts of on by default, by pressing continue it stays on, you have to say you don't want it. 

&gt;Given that different ISPs categorise different sites differently it's pretty obvious.

You're suggesting there is no minimum requirement of stuff they must filter that they've negotiated with the government. They can all filter whatever they like? 

&gt;Of for god's sake! Having to click on a ""No Thanks"" button is hardly the end of the world!

I don't think you understand my point. It doesn't matter how easy pressing no is, there was absolutely no need to do this when filters already exist. They could have simply produced a national campaign like they've done for other issues explain how to get your ISP to filter content. 

&gt;They already have D notices. New legislation would seem to be redundant and a waste of time.

D notices aren't mandatory and are only followed because the newspapers are basically an old boys club where everyone agrees to follow the rules. That doesn't apply to the internet.

&gt;Why does David Cameron want to give Ed Milliband control over the flow of information?

Different governments constantly try to gain more power for themselves, they know they'll be back in power again even if they loose the next election. 

&gt;Why do you think the rest of the government will vote to give a single person so much power?

This isn't about giving a single person power, both Labour and the conservatives have supported the idea of an internet filter. Both parties want the ability to control the internet. 

&gt;what information does he want to control

As I said similar stuff to what covers in D notices. Ken Clarke was recently accused of groping someone who worked in the houses of parliament, they sent letters to sites trying to get them to take down the accusation. If they could just block those sites you can bet they would. 

&gt;and how will he justify categorising it as pornography?

It's not just pornography that's being blocked, the list is constantly expanding. 'Esoteric' sites, gambing, smoking/drink advertising etc. Porn is the superficial reason to justify it to the public, it's already expanded from there. 

&gt;Are you seriously saying that the David Cameron is some sort of evil mastermind, who is plotting to use a voluntary porn filtering system to turn the UK into some sort of Orwellian police state?

I'm suggesting controlling the flow of information is in the interest of a lot of people, be they corporations who could lobby to get sites blocked, politicans who want to destroy damaging information etc.

The writing has way more to do with quality than the actor. Matt Smith's acting annoyed me and I was never a huge fan, but what I enjoyed least about his run was how cinematic the show became.

**ANTI-FILTER**

- There's no such thing as a perfect filter - you're guaranteed to wind up with collateral damage dependant on the system used.

- There will now exist lists with several line owners choices on. If you apply for certain jobs, especially in the public limelight, your choices on this list become financially valuable. Imagine if Rolf Harris had opted out - that's a whole new Daily Express front page story.

- One of the many complaints from ISPs against the Draft Communications Bill was the cost of installing monitoring equipment, of which the legislation paid only lip-service in terms of funding. Now that monitoring equipment is already there, they will have less legs to stand on.

- Who is administering the block lists? Which companies are involved? Which politicians, and vested interests have money in ISPs, filtering companies, or blocklist management? Have the BPI had any involvement?

- The blocking systems used have not been disclosed. For all we know all traffic could be going through this system. Not only adding latency, but possibly giving latent ability to switch to a logging mode at any time.

- Use of filtering systems gives parents a false sense of security. They will be less engaged and less proactive in their monitoring which ultimately leads to poorer child rearing.

- Blocks forced on end users only serve to educate a generation on how to evade them. If I was the opposite of /u/ruizscar I would say this is some grand masterplan to educate the population on how to evade Government surveillance against future Orwellian states.

- Every filter is different. One ISPs blocks may not be the same as anothers.

- There is few remaining national ISPs that you can capitalistically choose which do not have filtering systems.",0,1388790891,null,0,false,0,cego45x,t3_1ub1hc,t1_cego45x,t1_cegn60d,null,1431787432,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

2) J Edgar Hoover's term and the US are also not really comparable to MI5 in modern Britain. The difference in budgets, requirements, environment, political stability, degree of transparency and restraining legislation and oversight is simply too great.

The need for an organisation like MI5 is obvious in modern Britain, and the largely opaque nature of such an organisation is again an obvious need. This guy seems to have the idea that MI5 is an ill-disciplined paramilitary organisation operating outside all government control. CIA - well maybe, but MI5 has a too limited budget to do that (a shared budget with mi6 and GCHQ of £1.9 billion for 2014/15) as opposed to the purely CIA budget of $14 billion for 2013. 

Furthermore, even if Mi5 was a organisation that shouldn't exist, his solution of essentially incorporating MI5 in to the police hardly solves the problem. It would either weaken the newly formed Police Intelligence Unit or whatever to the point of impotence, where any action would have to be brought before jury thereby making operations extremely difficult to actually enact, or it would have to be under the same rules MI5 is now and therefore not solve this apparent problem. 

I respect the guy's abilities in cryptography, but this just smacks of attention seeking. Leave commenting on security and defence to the plethora of academics and practitioners of all political backgrounds who work in the sector.

Not really. Right now, opinion polls in several European countries show that a majority of people there would actually welcome it.. This is only likely to increase with a British government that pretty much everybody, its own supporters included, sees as beholden to a profoundly corrupt caste of bankers.

&gt;  it also sets a nasty precedent

An even nastier precedent would be to give up such a fundamental and hard-fought right as freedom of movement on the face of blackmail.

But you are frankly delusional. Not just on how decision making works in ""Brussels"", but also because you close the eyes to the fact that the EU, with ten times more population and a much more diverse economy, is far more important to the UK and its banking monoculture than vice versa. Without access to the EU market, your beloved financial services industry would crumble within weeks, and there are plenty of people in Frankfurt and Amsterdam who would be ready to take its place. Not to mention that some version of the EU FTT would be much more likely to be passed which would be *really* noxious to the City.

&gt; You also have to remember that to some extent, it is in the subconscious political psych of the British to ""divide and conquer"" in Europe.

I quite frankly have a better opinion of Britons than that, but if you want to personally adhere to the ""perfidious Albion"" stereotype yourself, you're welcome to do so. Just don't be surprised if your particular point of view doesn't meet much sympathy over the Channel.

All that, is completely besides the point. Obviously, youth talent is there. 

Deulofeu is no longer a prospect. He is now a known commodity. He is getting loaned out because he is too good for barca b, while needing more time to break into the first team. (ie Lukaku)

Chelsea loans out players to have that club develop the player. Training staff and facilities? When? The couple of months he is back from loan? Attractive city? see above. It still does not change the fact that they will probably be spending the majority of their development and time somewhere else, most likely in a different country. Again, what parent or agent in their right mind push their kid to this situation if they have a choice?

The dramatic increase in quality with the academy is all about one thing. Money. Buying lots of prospects, some of them are bound be decent. Hopefully.

If you vote yes on long standing issues and a general belief of it helping, then I understand, but if you vote based on the problem of not enough power going to Scottish  government, then shut up. You are lucky to have a Scottish  government that cares for every town and city in Scotland. South of the border, excluding Wales, the British  government governs us, and they only care for themselves and London, the North and Midlands have been neglected and have no power at all as the  government pushes money and attention to London and the home counties. I would say, Manchester, Liverpool, The Black Country and Newcastle, are severely worse off, Coventry is the worst city I've seen in Europe, and I live here, and the only reason Warwickshire and Gloucestershire are in good shape is because they are full of the rich folk the Tories only look out for. The North and Midlands, have a lower budget and less people caring about them than the Scottish, so man up, be Scottish and focus on the whole picture in the United Kingdom and realise how lucky your Government position is, and if you wish to vote Yes based on long term or short term economic benefit, your being an idiot as the English tend to resent the Scottish as much as you hate us, and history says we do everything in our power to mess you up and vice versa, and independence will screw both over in the short and long term. So think about the vote you make this year and don't use a whim, think about it and make sure you are certain on the benefits, do not use stupid outdated ideas like those in the McCrone report and understand that your vote will effect the global economy for the next 100 years, so be sure on what you do and be sure that you know that you're making the correct choice.",0,1388794518,null,0,false,0,cegpofs,t3_1u8ulr,t1_cegpofs,t3_1u8ulr,null,1431788189,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The US and the UK  basically guarantee the security of Scandinavia through NATO because it's such a useful strategic area for us. For weather stations, communications, transport links (think Arctic convoys) etc. Basing any of our security policy on Scandinavian models is very dumb because their over all security model is based on the premise that we and the US are heavily invested in their safety. If we scaled down our military and intelligence might they would respond by beefing up theirs.

And also yes, nothing is going to be achieved by a re branding exercise or merging agencies. English and UK governments have operated spy-networks at least since the reign of Henry VII, they are not about to stop doing that. If anyone thinks 'abolishing' GCHQ or MI5/6/7/8 will mean an end to spying I have a London bridge to sell them.....

I prefer him than Rakitic. From youtube I've seen (the only source I had), he's more all rounders (Rakitic better attacking) and plays more robust than Lucas (he's calm). Would be a really good addition to the team.

Going to the moon was impractical - but when you have ambitious goals like ridding the world of drug abuse you can't let things like a budget get in the way of success. Otherwise you may aswell not even try.

So the fact that our system at the moment is ""practical"" and ""cheap"" doesn't mean anything because it fails so badly. I'm pointing out the flaw in logic which has made it fail from the very beginning. If you understand how people respond to incentives you can see how a system which makes dealers richer makes no sense at all.

Except it wasn't because Singapore gives out harsher sentences for dealers. In my model, the dealers wouldn't even necessarily get arrested (like users are treated now), but users would take a huge risk. If you say to a user that getting caught with that joint will get you 5 years minimum, but the guy your buying off will will get a year maximum - then it doesn't make much sense to risk it, especially if the guy you're paying will get off scot free. Dealing pays only because they take the risk.

true,m0rris0n_hotel,null,null,"&gt;Abby not only didn't have a power, but every storyline that would've given her character some depth was completely dropped by the next episode. I dare say the use of Abby (or lack thereof) was a far greater travesty than any failure to use powers.

True. But I took that as part of her being an imaginary character brought to real life. Her interactions were often very simple and child like. She wasn't a child as such. She just had that open eyed view of the world. Which makes sense. If you were an imaginary person and then came to life as an adult you'd be a little superficial and random too. Kids don't tend to dream up people with a lot of depth. Everything from her interest in the turtle guy to her choice of job interests reflected that type of view point. 

Abby, for all her faults, was one of my favorites. Assuming the movie ever happens I would *love* for her to interact with Nathan somehow. I would almost like that as much as a Rudy/Nathan pairing. I think those two characters could get in to some real fun situations. 

&gt;I chuckled at her comment about using the powers more--it's like the writers got to the finale, realized that only Alex did anything the entire season and decided that self-deprecating was the only way to make up for it.

I remember reading reviews and online comments continually observing that they hadn't used their powers much. And then at the end of season four Abby and Finn have that little aside about using powers. It was almost like Howard Overman was priming us for that joke.

&gt; After the war Kelly disagreed with Joe Mercer. Kelly accused Mercer of not trying in an international against Scotland, but in reality Mercer had sustained a severe cartilage injury. Even after consulting an orthopaedic specialist, Kelly refused to believe him and Mercer had to pay for the surgery himself (after 14 years with the club). Understandably upset, Mercer moved in 1946 for £9,000 to Arsenal, although he commuted from Liverpool. Theo Kelly brought Mercer's boots to the transfer negotiations to prevent Mercer having a reason to go back to say goodbye to the other players at Everton.
Kelly was also unable to persuade Tommy Lawton to stay and he attempted to sell T. G. Jones to A.S. Roma to raise £15,000, but exchange control prevented the transfer. Many players saw Kelly as a remote, autocratic and petty figure. Dixie Dean said that the main reason for leaving Everton in 1937 was Theo Kelly. Kelly distrusted players bought on the transfer market and so the playing resources were quickly depleted.

  Really, it seems to be not a parallel, but an alternate existence where time has no meaning, created around a still point in time, yet to be made into a fixed point in time. when River fully discharged her weapon.

true,[deleted],null,null,"i see, seems to me that if you got that placement most of those concerns would likely vanish quite quickly, before i got that job by volunteering i felt prettymuch the same about myself, like i had no social skills, a dissapointment, lowlife shut in with no friends who would never get any better because i didnt have it in myself to work or stick at anything. then a few months into my job i was working quite hard but finding it manageable, felt quite socially competent because i had a good relationship with my colleagues and talked to a lot of people every day some of whom i got to know quite well as they were regulars (was working with customers). felt good about myself and a lot of the things that would give me anxiety just werent a big deal anymore.

so i guess what you wanna do is just pour all your effort into getting that or another placement, my general strategy for getting things done (as a neet, i have much experience :P) is, writing it all down on paper, make yourself a long term goal, then break it up into medium term goals, then further break them up into short term goals, just keep breaking it down into smaller goals until you have things that you could easily do. a bit like the mission system you see in computer games, you want to beat the main bad guy, but you cant just walk up and do that, you have to split it up into missions where you do things to increase your chances, these missions have objectives which you just go through one by one, systematically, can do the same thing with most problems i think, every big goal is just a set of small tasks at the end of the day.

if someone asked you to get 70 big bricks across the road by next week, you might think ""oh fuck"" at the prospect of having to lug all these blocks because it's a lot of blocks and thats hard work for the average person, a lot of people would just think fuck that because they would think of it as one big problem they couldnt beat, but imagine you break it up into 10 blocks a day, suddenly doesnt seem so intimidating, not the sort of thing that will occupy a fair chunk of your day and leave you feeling quite knackered at the end, as a whole it makes you dread it and become avoidant, in little peices, it's no big deal.

there are a lot of goals/problems that can be dealt with this way, depression say, write down everything you feel contributes to your depression, identify the cause(s) of that contributing factor, think of things you could do to alleviate those problems, if those things are a bit of a tall order, again just break them down till you are left with a lot of little problems that can be dealt with one at a time.

which it sounds like you are already doing though maybe you didnt see it that way, you have this job interview coming up, lack of a placement seems to be at the root of a lot of whats making you feel bad right now, so i would say that though its only a week away, make that your current mission. mission objectives are preperations (what will i wear, what can i say about myself etc), now just think how you can accomplish each objective, eg for ""what can i say about myself"", research the role, the company, anything you think is relevant so that you can show them you seriously prepared and are interested. find out things that the company's done, (i know nothing about comp science but-) programs they've worked on, familiarise yourself with their work. if you dont get the placement, straight away just set yourself a new mission of getting an interview at other places and then get to work at setting your new tasks which will get you there.

ofcourse it's easy enough for me to give all this advice that works for me when everyone has such different experiences and mindsets, but who knows maybe it will strike a chord with you and/or others.",0,1388801746,null,0,false,0,cegsm8o,t3_1u6y0a,t1_cegsm8o,t1_cegmm5q,null,1431789630,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We are strong in ""soft power"" and were recently ranked as the most influential country in the world in this regard. We have strong national culture and identity, native English language, incredible university education, great science and innovation, tons of media exports (music, artists, actors) and creative output, the royal family, olympic success, premiership football... and so on. And all of that with a pretty welcoming and tolerant society which welcome tourists and foreign workers. 

Then we have our economy which still punches well above our weight. London ranked as 2nd most important global city. Our permanent seat on the UN security council. Our armed forces and out standout special forces. Our nuclear weapon capabilities. Our wartime experience. Still pretty influential in those aspects too.

We definitely have our problems but IMO, a lot of the American attitude is arrogance. They are certainly bigger and louder but they have enormous problems too. In fact, so does every single country in the world - especially the powerful ones. Ask germans, swedes, norwegians, swiss, australians or any other country typically thought of as ""good"" and they will all complain about stuff just like we do.

There was a guide posted here that was given to US soldiers during WW2 when they came to fight along side the British. I remember one line that said ""By nature the British are quieter and more reserved. But do not mistake this for weakness. The English language did not spread to the farthest reaches of the globe because their people are soft."" And I think that's a great summary. I don't think we've declined. I think we've got on with things, worked through problems and we are continuing to make our country a good place to be.

We do absolutely love to moan, but really the UK is a totally awesome place to be imo.

true,tclayson,english,Cambs,"If you want us to weigh up whether it's worth the annoyance of attending the job centre, then here is some maths. 

A 20 mile trip once a week is nothing. You get £25 just for doing it. I assume bus fare to get there will be around £3, so that's £22 profit just for getting on a bus for 30 mins. So it seems worth it financially - it's more than you're getting paid to go to your current job, *plus* whilst you're there you are (or you should be) spending that time wisely looking for jobs, applying etc which can only be a positive benefit to you. 

Looking from a purely economic standpoint, the only reasonable alternative is to spend the time trying to make bigger gains for yourself. At the moment the best you can do is £22 for 30 mins on a bus and some effort at the job centre. If you think you can improve on that (I.e. Without the job centre you think you'll be able to find a job quicker, which will ultimately pay you more than you lose by quitting the jc) then definitely go for it. 

My question then would be: you only go to the job centre once a week, so you have 6 days every week to look for employment independently, why do you think that extra time will make any difference? 

Please note I haven't taken into consideration psychological factors. It's obviously demoralising being in this situation, however - constructively - giving up help (and they do help because they got you the only job you have currently) isn't going to improve your situation. You'll have less money which will cause you more stress, plus you won't have any support and you might lose motivation due to the lack of encouragement.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Rodgers wasn't given more time than AVB; his club just showed much more improvement and his superiors set more realistic expectations for him. 

I also think it's a bit too early to say that BR's ""project"" has been a resounding success. A lot will depend on where he finishes this season. A 7th place finish last season was more disappointing than their fans will admit. 

He's still largely relying on players that he didn't buy, and though he's certainly getting the best out of them, I think the extent to which he's revolutionized the club has been overstated to a cringe-inducing degree. We underwent a similarly drastic transition the season BR came in, but no one ever talked about it because we didn't underachieve enough to warrant excuses. 

I'm 100% with Sherwood. In **this** era of football I think  ""project"" is a vacuous buzzword that exists only to craft an aura of gravitas around a manager. ""Project"" and ""Philosophy"" are the biggest reasons  AVB and particularly BR have reputations that vastly exceed their actual accomplishments. 

It's true that LFC's playstyle under BR has become more specific and refined, but this atmosphere where he's framed as some Cruyyfian figure who brought split central defenders and short passing to the barbaric hoofball shores of England is preposterous. 

He's a good manager IMO and honestly was my first choice when Redknapp was canned. I just think the extent to which his success is based on some transcendent philosophy or ""project"" is overblown.

First, they hyped it up way too much with talking about all the different alien races that would be featured. That was the first big disappointment since it played out like a ripoff of the Cantina scene from Star Wars. The only aliens that we actually ended up caring about was the Queen of Years and the other singing guardian. The rest was just showing off the increased art budget they received for the new season.

Second, the oft-cited monologue that everyone loves was actually pointless in the story itself. It accomplished nothing. And what exactly did he sacrifice? Unlike the other sacrifices to the Old God, he kept all his memories. Clara's leaf was 'sacrificed' so that at least had some gravitas to it. But his speech did nothing and for all the emotional build-up, it fell completely flat and lost all impact. Even the all-our-powers-combined singing from all the different alien races to proved to be completely useless, so what was the point? When Clara pulled out the leaf and gave her last speech, I stopped caring because it felt like a ham-fisted attempt to emotionally jerk around the audience.

In the end it came across as way too preachy and cheesy. There were good moments, but many of them (the origin of life monologue, the doctor's life monologue) felt like they were written out of script and shoe-horned in. The only actual character development was the Queen of Years overcoming her fear of failure and inspiring the others to sing too... which, as I mentioned, utterly failed.

true,potatopeeler101,null,null,"hi, for paper you really want a hot pressed cartridge paper, smooth finish, about 70-100g per sheet.  dont be tempted to get watercolour paper, it looks nice when you buy it but because of the bumps makes stencils look like shit. smooth. dont ever get bleached paper- off white just looks more expensive. for me, when working on paper you want to go bigger. keep the image the same size but big paper, the artwork looks stronger if it can command a large area, plus its an instant boarder.. 
for positioning the image... you want the bottom gap to be a little bit bigger than the top gap, so the image is just that little bit lifted, for some strange visual psychology reason. 

editioning is basically a way of increasing value to a work which is easy to reproduce. I am an artist, working with printmaking. for an etching. you do a few practice prints to get the image just right... these are called Artist proofs, basically a visual record of how to do it when you do the finals. artist proofs are for the artist. once you have your method worked out you make a series of identical prints...a manageable number etching :5-25 Screenprinting: 50-100 (because your work is visually like a cross between the two id say 30 was a good number) when the prints are madethey are signed and editioned 1, 2, 3 etc (1 being more valuable for prints because in old technology like woodcut or etching the plates would ware over time, ergo the first print is the highest possible quality) 
editioning is a way of measuring the quality of the work. once you make the 30, as sad as it may be, you have to destroy the stencil, woodblock, plate whatever or at least lock it away. this way you know that those 30 are the only ones in existance...in turn heightening their value.
