I'm sure common cloning solutions would work with your setup. Ideally like you say however, you simplify your system. Data and configuration to be stored separately to operating system / programs. This makes restoration quicker.

Well there probably is. But have you considered buying another 6TB unit and storing it at a friends/family house? After the initial backup, you need only transfer differences (which you can do over the internet). You could implement a security level appropriate to the value of the data.

But this should seriously be a wake up call for Lambert and the board. This club seriously has to step up and make some changes somewhere. This will be our 5th relegation battle in a row and it makes it difficult to attract players to the club and keep key players.

Instead of snuggling or flirting, they bicker affectionately, which is about as far as you can get from ""flirty"" while still depicting a healthy loving relationship (while remaining on the vanilla side of things at least). 

And really it's not even fair to compare the flirty sexual domination of River and Missy! River brings out the ""Hello, Sweety"" a lot, but also has quite a few moments of tender conversation with the Doctor on a very non-dominating level; just the first episode with her depicts a range from flirty teasing to very seriously whispering the Doctor's name into his ear. Missy, on the other hand, just *oozes* flirty domination of a much more sinister tone, and never really turns it off-- even when she's acting like a robot it turns sexual and dominating when she grabs the Doctor and kisses him against his will. And despite all her flirting, she's still far more rigid than River-- her posture is quite stiff, and of course the Victorian clothes reinforce that limited movement while River always wears very practical clothes and moves quite a lot and quite freely. The flirting seems more like a part of her desire to dominate and control others in every conceivable way, rather than a natural expression of an outgoing personality as River's is. 

So really, even though Moffet *does* write a lot of flirty, sexually-dominating women, they're unique enough that there's hardly anything to complain about!

Check out [TheTrainLine](http://www.thetrainline.com/) and play around with your dates and times and see where the cheapest tickets are.

A cheaper option would be to get a [National Express](http://coach.nationalexpress.com/) (or [Megabus](http://uk.megabus.com/) if they're still a thing) from Victoria coach/bus station.

Think of a whiny Malcolm who doesn't possess the berries to tell Clara to fezz herself off with a crowbar sideways when she's throwing one of her [constant] little snits. That's how Moffat portrays Capaldi as the Doctor. Capaldi's Doctor throws tantrums. Smith's Doctor threw tantrums. That's all well and good, in character, and usually quite amusing, but the problem is that Capaldi is throwing Smith's tantrums, and failing miserably.

Worst. Writing. Ever.

Not even Cybermen and the Master together can save this Doctor's reign - heck, they could toss Daleks and TimeLords in the mix and it still wouldn't help - it's well past that point now. Big guns like that are just not brought out this early with a new Doctor unless it's to desperately try to save something. That happens very rarely, and it's happening with Capaldi. Sure, at the end of the season maybe, but now? Nope, they're in serious trouble, they know it, and this proves it. They're even bringing out every past companion they can find in the next episode to help alleviate this latest scripting debacle and hopefully keep waning viewers interested enough to return for the season's 2nd half. That's how bad it's gotten.

Moffat's done. It's time to take him off the barbie.

It's either that or get rid of Capaldi, because his and Moffat's styles compliment each other like a mix of oil and water, and the show's overall quality is taking a hit because of that.

Vorm's looking really good, from his minimal time on the pitch. I like his distribution - looking to get the ball out of his hands quickly and directly. I can't help but worry that one of his tight passes is going to get intercepted, but hey, Lloris can be a heart attack too.

Fazio I'm liking more and more. He was solid today (the penalty was bullshit of course), and he's obviously got the aerial threat but seems good at cutting balls out in general. He's also more comfortable with the ball at his feet than I was expecting.

- Stambouli: Was pretty good. Not much more, not much less. Lost the ball a couple times but nothing really egregious. Decently solid midfield play, but overshadowed by Dembele.

- Lamela: Confined to the wing, he wasn't able to do much. Not a whole lot of touches, and not a whole lot of time on the ball when he did get it. I feel like Asteras was focused on shutting him down after his barnburner two weeks ago.

- Fazio: I liked him a lot this match. He's solid in defense (and obviously has the height on his side) but also showed that he was confident with the ball at his feet. Could get away from pressure pretty well. He's also prone to a quick dart into the midfield to win an aerial ball or provide a tackle, well timed though as it never seemed to leave us exposed at the back. Oh, and he got red carded on a bullshit penalty call. Can't hold it against him.

- Davies: He was the weak point of our defense, I thought. He ventured upfield more than Dier and did contribute but he never seemed to quite have the skill to make things happen. Plus he was the only one of the back four who really made mistakes (that I noticed/remember). For the ""defensive"" option at LB, his defending wasn't quite up to snuff. (I'm not sure if this is coming off too negative, he didn't have a disastrous game, but it left me wanting)

Edit: After rewatching some of the game, I'd like to amend Fazio a little bit. He's good at clearing out crosses or long balls, but his one on one I'm not as confident in. Should have gotten the yellow that Mason got, and gave a player a good look on goal at least once. And Davies wasn't as bad as I had remembered.

Agreed, but then I never said that - that's called a straw man argument.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

You're right that text can be misinterpreted, but you have to be careful that you're not falling for the trap of making these unqualified misinterpretations and dismissing other people's arguments, then when they refute what you're saying you switch tone and start playing the ""Hey man, I'm not looking for an confrontation here.  Why are you being confrontational?"" card - which seems more than a little disingenuous and passive-aggressive!    

In general the UK *is* progressive compared with the US, which is the context in which we're talking.  UKIP and the Daily Mail don't represent anything beyond the fifth/quarter we were talking about.  The Daily Mail circulation is about 1.7 million - out of 64 million!

Despite the rise of UKIP in the short term, the general trend in the UK is towards the more secular and more progressive:

I've commented on this before, but not so long ago UKIP were getting a lot of media time with some braying xenophobia, and Cameron &amp; others were hand-wringing about what it means to be British in some kind of effort to be more jingoistic than UKIP but without appearing racist. I was so optimistic that Milliband would stand up and shout them all down with a proud 'I'm the son of immigrants and I'm not scared of you' stance.

Ten - would find somewhere rainy and look tormented.  

Nine - post *Fathers Day*? Not a chance.  

War - sigh, thump the console and then probably do it anyway. Hell can't be worse that what he's seen.  

Eight - would do it, and explain that he's already actually been to 17 different Hells - well 18 if you count the one in Norway, where they do the most wonderful teacakes...  

Seven - probably had Danny killed in the first place.  

Six - Hell, Hm? Or Heaven? Yes, well, as it happens I would quite like a word about how thing are being run at the moment. I have some ideas that I'm sure would be an improvement...

Five - Um... Brave heart, Clara. &lt;awkward pause&gt; I could get you some tea, perhaps.

Four - Yeees!, Yeees! I don't see why not. Theoretically, you know, it should be quite possible... Of course, I've never actually tried it...

-- Borini should not be starting ahead of Balotelli. Borini works hard and runs all game, but is largely ineffective and often pure invisible. He holds the ball up, doesn't have the confidence and/or the means to try to take someone on, and often looks bewildered. I like his dedication to the side but I think he'd be much more effective when used with Balo rather than against him. 

-- Toure was perfect against Real and I honestly believe he's cemented his place against Chelsea. He provided everything we've been missing so far this season in our defence; calmness, great pressing and not rushing out of position (I'm looking at you, Lovren). As far as I'm concerned the couple of mistakes that he made last season do not go against his great performance this year. 

-- Lucas is the best DM we have. Gerrard isn't a true DM and that shows, and Can has major ability but is still too raw at the moment.

false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; The difference is he is likely left wing himself and has a bias to wanting more left policy. If Labour swing further left the best result they can hope for is a shoring up of their grass roots and stopping some leakage to greens, this will not translate into enough seats for them to win the election, at the same time they will likely lose a chunk of the center to the Tories in the crucial swing seats.

There's a huge amount of left wing voters around for Labour to pick up, enough for them to win a majority without winning a single vote from the Tories. There's the 15% of voters that voted Lib-Dem last time and no don't plan to, plus the 4% of new Green voters. Add this to the 29% that voted Labour last time, and that's 48% of the population, if Labour won that they'd win by a landslide. 

In reality they'r never going to pick up 100% of these votes. But they would be doing much better as a party that was strongly and confidently left wing, and offering a real alternative to the Tories. At the moment they're losing votes to both sides because no one really knows what they stand for. They need to make a decision, and if they decide to just become Tory-lite then again I think they will lose, people will just vote for the Tories already in power instead.

&gt; Re policies - freezing energy prices: interventionist, anti free market, will hit their stock prices, they will likely rise prices massively before policy passes and blame Ed for it.

The energy market isn't a free market, it's a cartel. That's why they plan to freeze prices while they reform the market. People always forgot about the latter half of that sentence, but that's what they have promised. If the energy companies do raise their prices before the election, Labour have said they will freeze them back at the lower rate. It would actually be a gift to Labour, it would prove their point that the energy market was an Oligopoly where the consumers had no power and that the government needed to step in. And of course, once the energy companies raised their prices, there's no chance they would lower them again unless they were forced to. So even if they claimed it was Ed Millibands mess, they'd also be making it clear that he was the only one that could clear it up, there's no chance the Tories would interfere with this ""free market""

&gt; Mansion tax and top rate tax: make U.K less attractive for world class talent and very rich, could see top talent leaving as a result.

I disagree. We've already had the 50p rate of tax for two years, there's no evidence that anyone left the country as a result. There aren't many places for them to go, and I don't believe people choose which country to live in based purely on the top rate of tax, there's a lot more Britain has to offer it doesn't have to be shy about making the rich pay their way.

As for the mansion tax, it's one of the least damaging taxes to tax property (or better yet land). It doesn't punish high earners necessarily, a lot of people who own such property will have inherited it or bought it as an investment. We don't want houses to be used as investments, they needed to be used as primarily as places to live, this is the best way the property market can work for ordinary people and for the economy as a whole. 

Most importantly, these two measures raise a significant amount of money, that would otherwise have to be cut from budgets providing welfare and public services. These cuts make our country worse for everyone who lives here, and damage the economy too. I think there is now a clear choice in the next election between a party that wants to cut taxes, and cut services and help to the poor to pay for them, and a party that want's to raise taxes on the richest so the cuts aren't so bad.

&gt; NHS and bedroom tax: Both cost more money.

Repealing the bedroom tax would cost little to no money. Even the most optimistic estimates say it would cost the £500 million the government said it would save. But they have admitted that didn't take into account the extra costs of helping people who became homeless, paying for people who moved to smaller but more expensive private property, and the costs to local councils chasing up and evicting people who were in rent arrears. It's a hugely controversial measure that can be repealed with little cost, any left of center opposition party would be planning to repeal it, if they didn't they wouldn't deserve to win the election.

The extra funding for the NHS is not optional. All parties have pledged a real terms increase in NHS funding. They have said they need an extra £8 billion just to stay afloat and deal with the extra costs of an ageing population. Labour have come closest to raising this amount, while the Tories have just said there will be a real terms increase (could be just £1!). I think people in this country do still want to keep the NHS and keep it free at the point of use, when they look at the threats it is facing, only voting Labour can secure it's future.

&gt; She speaks confidently and has a charisma that the public would relate to. The public are crying out for someone who is themselves and not a rich, white, male who is micro managed to fit what a spin doctor thinks we want. Boris and Farage are examples who have success with this ""not a typical politician"" image. Being, black, female and from a working class background she would be a perfect figure head for Labour ideals of equality and aspiration for all.

Maybe I've just be spending too much time around /r/ukpolitics but it seems the UKIP/socially conservative types hate her. They say it's because she's a racist, because she's makes negative generalizations about white people e.g. ""white people love to play divide and rule"". Also her working class credentials are harmed as she has sent her kids to a private school. It's possible they are just looking for any excuse to attack her, but I think either way the reality is Labour would lose more votes to UKIP under her leadership.

The best way Labour can show their ideals for equality is actually having measures that deal with inequality, such as introducing taxes on the richest and reducing/repealing things that hurt the poorest such as the bedroom tax. If they abandoned all that as you seem to want, and instead thought they could show there were a party of equality and aspiration because they had a black leader, I think they'd come across as a hollow party more focused on presentation than content.

&gt; She wouldn't pander to the anti-immigration brigade and would likely be bold enough to call them out on their bullshit without tiptoeing around it.

Labour are already doing this to a large extent and should continue to. But it seems the anti-immigration brigade aren't interested in counter arguments or facts that go against their world view.

Lamela was invisible. he cuts inside soooo much that it sucked up all of the space for Kane/Eriksen. Perhaps a 4-3-3 would suit him better and solve our issue with spacing in the final third.

Fazio was a rock at the back for 88 mins. Got beat by a great ball and a well timed run in the final minutes, I thought he did well to get back and disrupt the shot, but he was probably incorrectly judged to have hip-checked the attacker who looked like he just dove as soon as he felt Fazio catch up to him.

Davies... well. Um. He's there. Out on the left. He passes sometimes. He doesn't really make many tackles or interceptions, but he's pretty good at keeping crosses from coming in.

Cameron is not under any illusions that he can dodge the payment forever, but he is within his right to postpone it. If you've been following his behaviour the last year or so, you'll notice more and more it is calculated to appease Ukip supporters.

Schurrle was supposed to provide a more attacking option to Willian, but is currently being a little crazy. With Salah on the bench, and a bunch of wingers on loan, this is what i think.



Personally: 
Salah was never a winger, he was a forward. A person to run with the ball at the defense. Thats what he did vs us and he scored a handsome goal doing it. I feel like he opens up our formation options, albeit we never use them.


Schurrle-Poor form is all, but I feel like Mourinho needs to calm him down and make him look at that Burnley goal. Why did it happen? You moved. You didnt wait for a ball outside the 18, you made runs and opened the defense. He's fairly good at that, and having him and Hazard on either sides both doing this could provide too much for even the best defenders.


Moses- Honestly, I loved the kid when we got him. I thought he had a spot on our team, then BAM! He was loaned to L'Pool (then L'Pool proceed to use him poorly). But given our overstock of wingers, I wouldn't mind seeing Moses go GIVEN that we see Schurrle pick it up or Thorgan come back.

TL:DR-Salah is in the wrong position imo, Schurrle needs to be calmed down by Jose, Moses could have a spot if Salah, Schurrle dont step up or Thorgan doesn't come back. ",0,1415350629,null,0,false,0,clvl47p,t3_2lgxfa,t1_clvl47p,t3_2lgxfa,null,1426147321,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

It is protected in law.

It would be so obvious there would be huge public outrage.  

The internet is such a hidden mystery to so many people they just ignore the massive invasions of privacy which are currently happening.

The fact is they already can access those services.  Through courts, with valid warrants, they can identify people online very easily.  More easily now than ever before in fact, even with out these additional powers or destroying privacy.  They just don't want to have to do it properly they want to skip all the checks so they answer to no one and have no questions to answer.

Are they allowed to monitor online activity, with no warrants checks or appeal and everything you do is logged encase in the future you do something they don't particularly like but there is no law against, and they just charge you with something else because they already have the evidence of a minor transgression?

Beware the promise of high returns. 2% return may seem pathetic but it is risk-free. Equities may have made 10% but they may equally lose 10% in a short time.

Don't let the promise of superior returns tempt you into making bad financial decisions. Start from the ground and work your way up.

Make sure you have a sensible level of emergency funds, do some research into the world of investments and how it works, and don't go for the latest ""hot topic"" in the hope of chasing impressive past returns. 

Read through the FAQ and learn how investing works (preferably by picking up a couple of the ""recommended reading"" books), and invest based on sensible decisions which will over time enhance your wealth.

If Miliband wins capital flight out of the UK will accelerate dramatically as it already has done since he unveiled his leftist manifesto at the conference. With foreign investment declining by such a significant amount the budget deficit will become a very real problem and the cost of servicing our debt will rise dramatically.

Unemployment will spike and we'll have another recession if not depression. House prices will crash worsening the economic environment further.

This will be good for me because I'll be able to buy a house in central London on the cheap. my job is not at all affected by the economy. In fact I've directly profited from the decline in the pound since Milibands socialist conference.

It all ends with Labour poll ratings in the single digits and Scotland leaving. The North and Scotland will be the worst affected by the capital flight that would occur under a Miliband government.

In Blair's time it was somewhat different. Partially because there were other characters in Labour. I mean Labour were the party of the Iron Chancellor, Red Ken, The Dark Lord Mandelson and Two Jabs Prescott. There was a lot of stuff for the media to talk about, none of which stuck to Tony Blair (hence Teflon Tony). In comparison all the current Labour people are boring, not just Miliband.

I think for a Miliband like character to work today you need larger characters in and around them. I think that is actually the situation Cameron is in. He's more presentable than Miliband but he's hardly Napoleon. He's insulated from criticism because:

1. There is George Osborne who is all that is toxic about Cameron but worse.

2. The buffoon as mayor of London to put a smiley face on the politics.

3. Other very visible characters of different kinds such as Hague, IDS, Gove, Pickles, etc

What they are saying at the moment is tinkering at best and doesn't give a positive narrative for the future to most people. 

If I was a Labour strategist I would firstly call out the Tories on making the Job Center a humiliating and backwards institution and pledge to localize budgets and completely re brand the centers, with an aim to have the best skills training, employer networks, business set-up support, networking and consultants in the world. Left leaning policy, yet good for both country and economy.  

Secondly I would create an skilled internship service, which supports people claiming whilst undertaking them and ban the unpaid exploitative ones around now, which are probably the biggest cause of class based advantage in our system. 

Targeting money towards mental health services would be another massive vote winner across the board. As would something along the lines of funding for youth clubs within every large metropolitan area, a sensible drugs policy, increased science and technology investments and a significantly larger than proposed social housing and infrastructure platform.

On the other hand, the method for calculating this bill is not clear to most people. Why do countries like Germany have to pay less, has their economy not been so successful? Why do countries like Greece and Italy have to pay more, haven't their economies suffered and their financial standings decreased?

Why haven't auditors been able to sign off on the financial statements from the EU commission for several years running?

Yes, it is, as they represent threats that would have installed without user prompt had the AV not blocked them. Nice attempt at a climb-down, though.

&gt; My original point is that 'expert' computer users do not need AV.

Yes ... you could certainly replace an AV with airgapping, sandboxing and constant state refreshes to stop the virtual instance being a honeypot itself, at which point I would have to ask what you achieve by not using an AV.

Percentage of blocked threats is not the same as percentage of trojans which can automatic install, they're very different things.

What would they achieve by using AV? The point is, it very much depends on the individual system and what it is for.

&gt;Actual genuine 'experts' will always incorporate AV into their security procedures, it's only wanna-bes that will spend countless hours replicating a similar level of protection by other means.

Now although that's not the be all and end all, I'm taking a friend to the Man City game on the 30th, and the tickets in block 4 where I usually sit are £46. That is enough to make me think twice even though I can afford it right now. I'm saving money for the year and having to basically pay £50 to get to 1 game is still something I see as excessive. It cost £42 a ticket when I took my GF to QPR, and they're the lowest category game in the PL. 

I'm pretty sure we have sold out games before though. Because of the way we separate home from away fans there are always some seats not taken, and even when all tickets are sold there's always a percentage of season ticket holders or even ticket holders that don't turn up, but we've had some attendances close to our full capacity before (Coventry at the end of our Championship promotion season).  

I also don't remember the numbers of season ticket holders we've been getting, but it's probably not as many as you think. Season tickets are expensive and people's schedules don't always allow for that whole portion of every other Saturday to be given over to football.  

Edit: I should also mention that I'm pretty sure Saints' facebook and twitter constantly post about ticket availability (though not necessarily always price!) right up to the match. I may just be imagining that but I definitely feel like it happens. It may just be on their website that it always states availability - and if so then yes, they need to get on that social media advertising!

(a) the average tenure of a Premier League manager is 18mths.

(b) if managers only worked with ""their"" players Aguero and Toure would have up sticks and left after Mancini departed or more closer to home Bale would have left after Jol or Ramos.

The aim of a chairman (or in our case, recruitment committee) is to agree:

(i) position to be filled (weakness)

(ii) type of player suitable (age, experience, skill set)

(iii) budget (how much is appropriate in that position)


At the end of the meeting a shortlist should be agreed and any of the players purchased from that list is the 'managers/clubs choice'.

Now ignoring Sherwood's silly - I didn't have the right tools in the toolbox rant - the squad we currently have is a universally recognised talented squad (with 2 high quality players in nearly every position).

In answer to the question, why aren't we playing amazing football right now? There just isn't the same amount of time with the players at a club with the profile of Spurs than at a club like Southampton. Take this week as an example:
Sunday - Game at Villa finishes at around 18:00. After warm down and media commitments team doesn't leave until 21:00

Monday is a rest day (for squad involved in Villa game), rest of squad will train but obviously not full squad

Tuesday - training day (any specific prep for EL game)

Wednesday - travel day (Greece) - maybe light session in stadium

Thursday - Europa game (some train, most don't) - this is a long day as many clubs try to get back same day.

Friday - rest day for Europa squad / training for players left behind.

Saturday - Training / Pre Game Prep

Sunday - Early Game

In 1996-1998, there were huge and detailed investigations in Leeds, Exeter and Belfast by totally independent international teams of trained fraud investigators. Thousands of homes were visited, thousands of interviews took place. Millions of payments were checked. 

The rates of fraud and error were huge: 25% - 38%. The worst was Widows benefit. Pretty much every 'little old lady' claimant in Bournemouth was cheating. The consequent knock on into Housing Benefit took the value into the £40bn a year range. 

Frank Field MP saw the report, wanted to take action, Tony Blair, personally buried the whole project. The Widows Benefit was politically toxic.

Since then, DWP took control as ""poacher turned gamekeeper"" and simply redefined ""fraud"", burying the issue forever.

At a guess, fraud &amp; error still run at 20-25% of total payments made, and Housing Benefit is about the same.

The problem though is that he *doesn't* have substance. If he did have substance he probably wouldn't have had to bang on about him being a politician of substance, the voters would already have known it and he could use that time to actually tell us some policies.

For a long time I really wanted to like Ed Miliband because he seemed to actually want to take Labour back to the left, but he just seems to be completely out of his depth. I still have no fucking clue what Labour stands for other than criticising the Tories and being a little to the left of them.

There is no information in the report which actually summarizes costs currently it is split into each departments cost not an overall and I don't have time to read the report in enough detail right now, but its going to be higher than 2003 for sure.

I actually cannot find a cost-per-person for the welfare system, since it's so complicated between tax credits, NHS costs welfare costs etc and since some of the costs will be included in all 3.  NHS for example, but I'm pretty sure you'll need less NHS help if you have a roof over your head and food to eat.  You'll take up less police resources.

Not to mention all the other societal issues that homeless ness propagates.


... I find it very unlikely it costs us MORE to provide benefits, then to deal with the obvious repercussions.

The level of the cap (total benefits you can receive) is:

£500 a week for couples (with or without children living with them)

£500 a week for single parents whose children live with them

£350 a week for single adults who don’t have children, or whose children don’t live with them

Taking the £350, since we are all dealing with single people here not families we get - £18200
--

... I find it very unlikely it costs us MORE to provide benefits, then to deal with the obvious repercussions.

So we have

Cost on benefits - £18,200

Cost in Prison - £33,632

Cost in homelessness (in 2003) - £24,500

As an aside, the true cost of a multi-manager fund is far higher than the headline cost.

Hargreaves Lansdown are telling you that their Annual Management Charge is 0.75%, and their ""additional expenses"" are 0.63%, a total stated cost of 1.38%. 

What this doesn't tell you, is that each of the investment funds they are buying each have their own costs, that aren't shown there.

Take their largest holding, Woodford Equity Income. They pay Woodford 0.60% per year to hold the fund, which doesn't get picked up by the stated costs.

Tot it all up and you're paying upwards of 2.0% PA to hold the fund, which is the upper end of costs usually associated with dealing with a fianancial adviser who buys actively managed funds.

For comparison's sake, most actively managed funds have total costs of 0.6% - 1.2%, and most index trackers have total costs of 0.05% - 0.5%.

ISTR if you don't acknowledge the debt, it effectively ceases to exist after six years. But paying it is acknowledging it.

The mortgage thing is subtly different. A lot of people were sold interest-only mortgages - where your repayments only cover the interest on the loan, not the capital. You then pay into a fund which you hope will be sufficient to pay off the mortgage when it matures.

You pay less money overall but there is a keyword here - ""hope"". If the fund manager happens to make poor investments - or something goes wrong (such as tying much of it up in the stock market which then collapses 2 years before you're due to pay off the mortgage) - it's the homeowner who's in trouble.

Downing - Went to Liverpool and failed miserably, ended up having to resurrect his career at West Ham and he is doing great there

Young - Big flop at Man Utd, has won the Premier League but hated by Utd fans, doesn't really play, most known for being a diver

Barry - Won the league with City, unfairly pushed out (same with Nigel DeJong) and now defensive midfield is their weakest point in their squad. Now doing well at Eveton

Milner - Won the league with City twice, plays in most games (probably should play more). He is unable to be 'the man' there, can't run a game the way he did in 09/10 because they have Silva/Nasri/Toure etc

I'm sure Milner/Barry/Young are happy they've gone and won the league, but none of them have been able to be 'The guy' and none have had the freedom they have had at Villa.

I look to the way he portrays all the supporting men on the show, especially the boyfriends. Up until Danny Pink they were all (on the surface) dimwitted, foolish, and unsure (often cowardly.) I realize that's necessary for characters to have such dichotomy in order to organically generate interpersonal conflict. But I think it was an intentional choice to counteract the failures of the original series' companions... I may be wrong on that point, my impression is that they were generally stronger female characters than you could usually find in pop culture of the day; that they were one of the show's strongest and enduring values. 

Kill the Moon and Robot in Sherwood were poorer episodes. It's when the quality drops, you begin to most clearly notice his voice preaching to his critics.

But you completely discount the fact that there could be people who, having researched the facts on immigration themselves, happen to have a different viewpoint than yourself. Are those people thick as pig shit or do they just have a different opinion?

""Reasons for coming to the UK"" is not exactly a cast-iron measurable variable.

You'll probably tell them it's because you want to work, which is seen as a fair reason to let people move to the UK as they will be contributing directly to the economy.

My point is that although 70% of those polled said immigrants probably come here *mainly* for the well-established welfare system, it is difficult to prove them wrong.

Recruiters work on behalf of their clients who set the specs.

I can only speak for my clients, mainly large IT service companies/engineering firms, but they give me very precise specs for the person they are looking for.  They will ask for certain qualifications and experience.  

THEY WILL NOT consider people who don't meet that spec.  It's quite wrong to give people expectations that they can somehow buck this.  Don't blame the recruiters; blame the companies who hire in this way.

If as a recruitment company we based our business model on taking punts on people who ""might be able to do the job""- we'd be out of business in 3 months.

false,2localboi,eng-GreaterLondon,"Pecknarm ","&gt;However I think the debate on UKIP has unnecessarily focused on a minority of individuals.

This country doesn't do policy debates, politics has always been through the prism of politicians not policy. Look at how the press writes about how policy in the frame of helping or hindering an individual politicians chances at electoral success/popularity, rather than whether or not that policy will be good or not.

And when a party only has one real spokesman put forward, is it any surprise that when low level candidates are called out for chatting shit?

&gt;Ukips critics haven't won the Europe debate or the immigration debate because they have refused to take on the policy. Instead they focus on the character of a minority of individuals that are about to get kicked out or be marginalised by the party. It comes across more as a smear campaign that a true debate of ideas.

Are you kidding me? There have been loads of studies about the benefits (with specific drawbacks) of being in the EU. The Pro-EU argument hasn't won because the only person, electorally speaking, standing up for the EU is Nick Clegg, a man who has been pummeled for ""lying"" and not keeping to his promises (in my opinion this is a bullshit reason to be against the LibDems, its a coalition and the only crime the LibDems have committed is not playing the game of politics correctly, that AV Vote turned into a poll on the Libs than anything else)

Anti-EU sentiment has the support of most of the press and having the privileged position of being a ""common sense"" position to take. Its also difficult to have a true debate, as you say, when debates with UKIP and their supporters are based on emotion and feelings than anything else

&gt;My other point of departure is that the mindset of ""dismiss a whole group of people based on the actions of a few"" shouldn't be encouraged as an acceptable thinking strategy even when it's applied to white, middle-aged, middle-class men. I would maintain that from my experience the greatest predictor of ""prejudice"" against a group ( in the absence of top down societal encouragement ) - whether it's against racial groups or belief groups is
A) Did the person suffer a impacting negative experience from a person/persons within that group, without having at least an equal number of impacting positive experiences of people from the same group ?
B) Did the person then start pre-judging people, applying their negative expectations to all people in the group, completely ignoring ""good"" members.

This is the most roundabout description of prejudice I have ever seen in my life. Political parties are ""prejudiced"" (a better word would be stereotyped) all the time. Tories are toffs, Labour are lairs, LibDems are limp wristed, Greens are muesli munching hippies.  Each descriptor is obviously an exaggeration, but it is based on a few examples. I'm sure old, white, middle aged, middle class men face prejudice in extremely limited ways, but if you are seriously saying that its a form of prejudice, you need to live in Zimbabwe and experience actual discrimination against whites. 

The country is run by old white men. The banks are run by old white men. The Press is run by old white men. If you are old and white, you are in the most protected class of people in the country, so spare me if people judging the party you support/are a member of because it hurts your feelings. I have to tick the [Other] box on every form i fill in, I get stopped and searched for being a 'suspicious individual', I have to speak so differently around old white men at work so i won't get pre judged (AKA prejudiced) about the kind of person I am.

You are just pissed off because people are calling out UKIP and you think its them being mean. I get ripped from everyone I know for still being broadly pro LibDem. Am I pissed off? No, cos its politics and thats the way the game is played.

The reason being, at 2% interest, your savings are currently growing at around the rate of inflation. To say it another way, your money isn't working for you as it stands. It's static.

Yes, S&amp;S are much more risky in the short-term, but over the long-term (say 5-10 year timeframe) the annualised returns come in at something around 10%. Some years will be more like 30%, others -20%, but the general trend seems to be it will average out at around 10% long-term. This is highly generalised, and i'm sure they'll be comments about this, but this is the way I simplify and frame it in my own head.

So, the key to successful long-term S&amp;S trading - short of becoming a day trader and absolutely immersing yourself in the minutia - is to think long-term. Keep your cool during the bear markets and buy up the cheap stock, then ride the bull markets.

The dynamics of the market are such that, amongst other things, the activities of the day-traders are enough to move markets drastically as they try and bolster their quarterly results and hit their ""number"". These swings can be nerve-wracking, but as long as you keep in mind that as a personal long-term trader with no one to answer to - you aren't bound by these same restrictions. You can ride it out. There's a big advantage in that if you have the time to spare to wait it out.

Now, for me, I can't be bothered to keep adjusting my allocations between bonds/equities/cash, re-allocating my dividends, etc. so I use a managed service called nutmeg.com. Really easy to use.

&gt;draw benefits of any kind from the country they move to

Depends on what you regard as a benefit. Pensioners most likely don't get typical benefits, like the income support or similar, although I know of something called pension top-up, but I can't explain it as I don't remember it now in details. Much depends on the healthcare solution, which I'm fairly sure they don't have to pay for but am not 100% sure. Even if they pay though, do you think it covers the needs they have as it's obvious older people on average visit doctors more often and require most expensive treatments.

&gt; It's like apples and oranges to compare them with economic migrants coming here.

Exactly but you are missing some very important points here.

- immigrant in UK usually work, so pay for their used services via taxes and NIN;
- pensioners spend their money abroad, immigrants in UK;
- not all British expats are pensioners! Plenty of them migrate to work and study, just like immigrant in UK;
- more British pensioners in a country, means more roads are required, more hospital staff, more houses etc, exactly the same extra resources required for immigrants in UK.... while immigrants in UK actually fulfil part of those resources, being themselves doctors or even builders, so they make a pressure but at the same time release it. A pensioner does NOT release the pension, especially that he doesn't add anything in income tax or nin - only via VAT;
- why do you think plenty of Spanish and Portugese houses are now empty? Partially because of those pensioners who first created a demand but later sharply decreased it due to financial crisis;
- plenty of other points....",0,1415363685,null,0,false,0,clvnmei,t3_2lcoms,t1_clvnmei,t1_clurjwe,null,1426146152,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When Andrea Dossena was a little boy growing up in Lodi, northern Italy, he would spend hours sat cross legged outside the cathedral on the historic Piazza della Vittoria, telling strangers how he would change the world one day, many miles away from where he now sat, in March 2009. Of course, the strangers laughed at the claims of the little boy and told him to go to school. “A correre e cagare ci si immerda i garretti,” the young Andrea would snap back. ‘By running and ************ at the same time will result in a mess.’ The strangers grew tired of the boy’s insolence and started telling him in no uncertain terms that he was deluded. “Can che abbaia non morde,” the old man who sold rosaries outside the catherdral told him. ‘The dog that barks doesn’t bite.’ Quick as a flash, Andrea would shout: “Fatti i cazzi tuoi vecchi testicoli, ca campi cent’anni.” ‘Mind your own business old ******** and you’ll live 100 years.’ Growing tired of being called ‘old bollocks’ by the young man, even the rosary seller stopped talking to him. Andrea was left alone with his thoughts.


On July 2008, Dossena arrived at Anfield for £7m and a plan a lifetime in the making was beginning to come together. The first part was to make everyone think he was *****. It was at this that he truly excelled, managing to look like a plumber who had won a competition to be a Premier League player for the day. ***** first touch. ***** passing range. ***** at tackling. Dossena managed to make Paul Konchesky look good. Well maybe not, but you get the idea. He was just really ******* ***** all the time and of course he became a bit of a joke for being so *****. And this is what a lot of people, nay, everyone (except me and Andrea Dossena) don’t appreciate; he was trying to look ***** on PURPOSE. For a laugh. He told me as much when I travelled to Naples to talk to him but I’ll get to that later.

March 2009. You may remember it for China’s first lunar probe impacting the moon. I don’t. I remember it for a ******* bat**** mental week when Liverpool beat Real Madrid 4-0 and Man United 4-1. But above and beyond this, I remember it for Andrea Dossena. For a week, he was the best player in the world. He was doing Cruyff turns and ******* Lionel Messi dribbles past World Cup winners Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro. At one point he attempted an overhead kick from HIS OWN HALF, which flashed inches past Iker Casillas’ goal. He then scored a beauty in the 87th minute. One touch. Bang. Pick that out Casillas you ****, it seemed to say. And here’s the thing. He had predicted this TWENTY years ago. On the steps of the cathedral on the Piazza della Vittoria. When he lobbed Edwin Van Der Sar in the 90th minute with a swish of that wand of a left foot, you can clearly see Dossena mouth to the camera “that one’s for you old bollocks”. I remember crying when he scored. Because Dossena had purposefully hoodwinked everyone into thinking he was absolutely ***** when in fact he was the best player in the world and by some margin. I cried at the remarkable beauty of it.


June 2011. Naples. When I travelled to the Avvocato district to research this piece, everyone I met had something to say about Dossena. Most often, I would hear him described as a ‘visionario’. In a little coffee shop on the Piazza Dante, Professor Paolo Vittorio explained to me the impact of Dossena’s conscious choice to showcase his sublime skills for just 36 minutes, over two substitute appearances against two of the biggest clubs in the world. “Andrea knew from a very early age he was blessed with a God-given talent,” Vittorio told me in impeccable English. “But he was very modest. Too modest. Rather than play beautiful football week in, week out, he decided that the best thing he could do was to condense all of his skills into essentially what was a 36-minute cameo, spread over two matches.”

When I finally met Dossena, at Napoli’s training ground, I was tense. Who wouldn’t be. I had been told by the Napoli press officer that I was to have no more than two minutes with the Italian and there was so much I wanted to ask him. When he arrived, Dossena was intense and enigmatic. He told me he still watched English football when he could and that he missed the atmosphere in the English grounds. He joked that he even missed being called a “*****, bald ******”. But when I asked him about his premonition, his face turned very serious and he held me with a powerful gaze.


“I’m from a large Catholic family. My mother and father, they worked very hard so that I could have football boots and kit. They worked from seven in the morning until eight at night. I respect them for their sacrifice. When my father saw the talent I had in my left foot, he told me that it would be wrong to humiliate the other players. He said I should let myself have one week where I show my talent but no more than this. This is why I chose the week we played Real Madrid and United. But seriously, I had always known that March 2009 would be the time. To coincide with the first Chinese lunar probe landing on the moon.” With that, Dossena shook my hand and left. I knew I’d been in the presence of greatness. And the best part is, now that I can tell his story, maybe people will finally realise what a very special talent Andrea Dossena was.

false,Grimalkine,null,null,"Indeed I would agree with the above comment and would also like to add my own experience from living in a medium sized northern English town. Over the last 10 years (since I returned from living abroad) I have seen my town change significantly. It always since the end of the second world war had a small population of eastern European migrants who integrated successfully into the community. the current difference is the size of that population has grown exponentially. In some ways it has benefited the place, Polish shops everywhere taking up otherwise empty retail space for example but in other ways it has forced up house rental prices and literally excluded the indigenous population from certain low skilled occupations. Where previously companies hired their own staff with the rights and opportunities that come with that now they get their staff from the many agencies that have sprung up.  These agencies prefer the low skilled but young and hard working poles, which is fine but they provide intermittent work. A young Polish migrant may share a house with 4 or 5 others and they support each other during the times they are not working. One may have a car and ferry a group to an employer, they spend very little money in the community and have created their own house culture. Their needs are very different to the indigenous peoples needs and wants for constant work and to build a life where they were born. Over the last 10 years as this social change has taken place I have seen a change also gradually appearing (my work deals with a wide variance of the local demographic) of some of the migrants gaining permanent work and as they marry and their children are sent to local schools they become more integrated into the community, they learn English and put down roots therefore their needs become similar to the rest of the communities.
What is happening though is as they do this a constant trickle of new migrants again take on the low skilled work keeping wages low and house rents high. The town may be getting fuller but not richer, opportunities for young people who may not have thrived in school are limited. I'm pretty convinced that some college courses provided just groom young girls for single parenthood and young men for a life of low expectations.
Overall I'm happy that my home town has had an influx of new people that have given life to a decaying area that was neglected by labour probably because it was a ""safe"" seat and ignored by the conservatives as a ""lost cause"" to them. I am unhappy that the constant influx of low skilled labour has turned the place into a low income box filling canton with an underclass with low expectations.

1. 2010 and 1997 were the only two in the list of 6 that came at the end of a 5 year term
2. 1992 was called a few months before it needed to be by Major
3. 1987, 2001 and 2005 were called a year early

This is the only election where we've known since day 1 when the next election was going to be - normally an opposition party would have to be rolling out policies all the way from year 3 to year 5 just in case there is an early election called and they get caught with their pants down.  Now the opposition party can spend all its money in the months before hand, just as the incumbent party(ies) do.

In 1987 Labour and the Conservatives got 73% of the vote (95% if you include the SDP/Liberal alliance) and all but 45 of the seats (and at 23 of those were in NI).  In 1997 that was 76 seats, in 2005 it was 93 seats and in 2010 it was 86 seats with the top 3 only getting 88% of the vote.  We've got a recent history of it becoming less of a two party system than more of one.  This complicates matters significantly as there are going to be several three way seats where there haven't really been in the past.

Plus we know fro constituency level polling that Labour are picking up Lib Dem/Lab marginals whereas the Conservatives are not picking up Con/Lib Dem.  We also know that Labour are picking up Lab/Con marginals (Ashcroft's polling this week shows that), but that they are losing Lab/SNP marginals.  

We could easily see Labour pick up 60 seats from Lib Dems and Con, but lose 30 to the SNP and leave us with Con on 260, Lab on 280, Lib on 30, SNP on 30 and the rest having 10 or so (plus NI).  What happens then?  The SNP are politically closer to Labour than the Conservatives but the vote in Scotland is between Labour and the SNP so would they want to form a coalition with Labour and get concessions or with the Tories to get votes?  What about the Lib Dems?  Do they form a coalition with Labour and potentially start losing support in the Lib/Con marginals as well?  Do they drop out of Government to get some more money?  Do Labour decide to form a minority?  

What happens if Labour manage to get a majority by winning 150 seats by 1% or 2% but only get 32% of the vote?

The problem lies in the fact that many British people aren't interested in the freedom of movement and don't see it as an opportunity for them. It does allow us to freely travel to other EU countries for breaks and holidays, something many people take advantage of, but we are used to that anyway as the British passport is one of the best in the world for freedom of movement. There are [many countries outside the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens.png) that we can enter freely without a visa, at least for long enough a duration for business visits or holidays. But the concept of moving elsewhere in the EU for work isn't something that seems a realistic possibility for many British people.

Language is the biggest issue. We don't promote foreign languages very well at all and we should at least be improving our teaching of french and german. But even then, they only grant access to work in EU countries that speak those languages. Conversely, English is one of the world's most widely spoken languages and many people in every EU country speak it as an additional language, allowing them to find opportunities here. English is a very accessible languae to learn given the prevalence of English-language culture on TV and the internet.

Freedom of movement is very important for countries in the EU that have close relationships with their neigbours, and that they all share borders makes cross-border interaction very commonplace. The scandinavian countries share a lot in terms of culture and history, and their languages are very similar so communication isn't an issue. It is easy to see why freedom of movement is important for them. They probably don't care that much about movement within the wider EU but free movement with their immediate neighbours is essential.

On the other hand, we in Britain live on islands away from everyone else, so our interaction with our neighbours is far less frequent. There are a limited number of specific access points to other EU countries and most british people would have to travel quite far to reach them. We share a lot of culture and history with the republic of Ireland, and speak a common language, thus freedom of movement between our two countries is very important and something that would be maintained no matter what.

Ultimately, even if there is a definite benefit brought to us by freedom of movement, this is not apparent to many British people who do not see it as offering any opportunities to them. The nature of our country means that we don't have many close neighbours with whom freedom of movement is essential, and for many british people the opportunities available in other EU countries are no more enticing or accessible than those offered elsewhere in the world.",0,1415366586,null,0,false,0,clvofk2,t3_2lki5l,t1_clvofk2,t3_2lki5l,null,1426145774,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

&gt;It was reasonable till you said 'the problems were nothing like what we see today. The place is a no-go zone after dark.' I'm sorry but I don't' believe that.

Why would I lie? I simply don't feel safe walking down the lane at night knowing there are unregulated drinking dens with NO security, NO licensing conditions, regular fights/violence etc. and many of my friends/neighbours in the area feel the same.

In fact there was a story last week about our local church bringing forward their evening service by two hours because the congregation felt unsafe walking the lane at night. Look at some of the comments from local residents at the bottom of the article;

&gt;**Church moves evening Mass as Moston streets are 'too dangerous' for parishioners**
&gt;
&gt;St Dunstan’s Church, on Moston Lane, has shifted its Saturday service from 7pm to 5pm over fears for the safety of the congregation after dark.
&gt;
&gt;A newsletter sent out to worshippers said: ""Moston at night has become a much more dangerous place in recent years and it is ‘very unfair to ask people to be out and about in such circumstances.""
&gt;
&gt;Father Martin Saunders, who was born and raised in Moston, returned in July after 13 years at another parish and said he was shocked by the crime levels and economy of Moston Lane.
&gt;
&gt;During a consultation, parishioners overwhelmingly agreed they would prefer mass to be moved to the afternoon because of fears over crime. 
&gt;
&gt;“Even when I was talking to a police officer I was told ‘you don’t really want to be out here late at night’.
&gt;
&gt;Karen Wakefield, owner of Wishy Washy launderette, on the Lane said: “We see it all, beyond the filth and waste left lying around we’ve got the music at all hours, drug dealing, prostitution, it’s not safe.

Manchester City will consider selling Yaya Touré, their Ivory Coast midfielder, next summer. As they wrestle with a worsening crisis in the wake of their woeful 2-1 defeat by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, it has emerged that City would be open to parting company with Touré if a suitable offer is forthcoming.

The news comes as they face up to the growing prospect of a third Champions League group stage elimination in four seasons, although senior officials of the Barclays Premier League champions insisted last night that Manuel Pellegrini, the manager, retains the support of the club’s owners.
Khaldoon al-Mubarak was at the Etihad Stadium to watch the CSKA match, in which Touré and Fernandinho were sent off, but the City chairman is said to be “calm” about the present predicament, in which the club have lost three of their past four matches and claimed only seven victories in 16 games this season.

City are bottom of Champions League group E after taking only two points from four matches and will be eliminated if they lose at home to Bayern Munich on November 25 and either CSKA or Roma win their match in Moscow.

Touré, who turns 32 in May, will enter the final two years of his £210,000-a-week contract next summer and is likely to be in demand, despite his troubling form this season.
City are not actively seeking to offload Touré — at least not at this stage — but there are mounting concerns that he may struggle to recapture the outstanding form that helped to deliver the championship in two of the past three campaigns.

A prolonged slump in form would make any decision to sell easier and free up funds to invest in new players. City are monitoring Paul Pogba and Ross Barkley, the highly regarded Juventus and Everton midfielders respectively, as potential targets and Marco Reus is also under consideration.

The Borussia Dortmund and Germany attacking midfielder has a reputed €25 million (£19.6 million) release clause that triggers next year, but City would face stiff competition for the 25-year-old from Barcelona, Bayern Munich and a host of English suitors, including Manchester United.
Touré, who cost City about £24 million when he signed from Barcelona in 2010, had appeared to be making attempts to engineer a move away from the Etihad in the summer.
In addition to flirting publicly with Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, he invited widespread ridicule for complaining that City had not made enough fuss of his 31st birthday, then upset the club by claiming that they had refused a request for compassionate leave to visit his ill younger brother, Ibrahim, before the start of the World Cup finals. Touré was in Brazil when Ibrahim died, aged 28, in June after a battle with cancer.
Pellegrini suggested in September that those personal troubles were partly to blame for Touré’s poor form and the player has also been unable to escape the spectre of racial abuse.
Nonetheless, his on-pitch struggles have continued and his season went from bad to worse on Wednesday when he was sent off for violent conduct after shoving Roman Eremenko, the CSKA midfielder, to the ground.

Touré and Fernandinho, who was sent off for two bookable offences, will miss the crucial game against Bayern, the runaway group leaders. Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body will meet on Thursday to determine whether Touré’s ban should be extended to include City’s final group game against Roma in Italy on December 10.

The Ivorian’s goal against CSKA was only his third in 15 matches this season, compared with seven at the same stage last term, although his all-round contribution has dropped off markedly and there has been criticism about his perceived lack of defensive work.

City’s hierarchy want to see progress each season. Although Roberto Mancini was sacked in May last year in part because of his combustible style of management, the feeble defence of the title and a poorer Champions League campaign than the previous season were central to his downfall.

Pellegrini’s second season is in danger of following a similar trajectory to Mancini’s fourth, with City’s Champions League woes well documented and the team — who face Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road tomorrow evening six points adrift of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League.

The Chilean’s reluctance to tweak tactics to compensate for City’s susceptibility to the counterattack, open midfield and porous defence have been criticised and Pontus Wernbloom, the CSKA defender, has claimed that the English champions are too predictable.

Yet Vincent Kompany, the City captain, said that the focus should be on the underperforming players. “It’s always a team issue, we are the ones out there playing,” he said.
“Everyone will jump on the bandwagon, but I still believe in my team and still back everyone at this club 100 per cent to turn it around.”",0,1415368658,null,0,false,0,clvp4us,t3_2lkueo,t1_clvp4us,t3_2lkueo,null,1426145446,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

They are limited by the type of people applying. That's my point. Forward thinking intelligent people just do not fit into the Police. They won't apply and if they do, they soon get switched off by the culture. Instead you get what are fairly low level people entering low level jobs. As I say, they do a very tough job, I'm not saying it's easy. I'm just saying they ain't the brightest people. Police are struggling to get good quality candidates. They have to fast track people with degrees into inspector positions (much to the chagrin of the regulars who've been constables for years) because the throughput from lower ranks is so low.

Ok that's maybe not much help. To start put a teaspoon of whisky and an equal amount of water and try that. Then you've only got a small drink if it's too weak. If it is too weak then go to a 2 or 3:1 ratio next. If that still tastes like it wants a bit more oomph in it then pour a good dram and just put a few drops of water in, taste and repeat until you have a drink you're happy with.

I tend to pour a dram taste it and then add a few drops to splash of water depending on how much I think it needs. Some whiskies are helped by water, some just become a bit insipid if you add water. 

A lot of this will depend on the whisky you buy. Probably best to try a light unpeated one first like a Glenfiddich or Balvenie and then work from there.

If you have thermostatic valves, you can control the temperature of each radiator, meaning you can switch it very low/off in unoccupied rooms.  This means you don't have to worry about heating up the whole house when it's not required.

If you have a thermostat with a timer, you can program in a temperature profile depending on occupancy.

Like, my heating comes on for a couple of hours in the morning while everyone is getting showered and dressed etc and keeps the house at 21degrees.

Then in the daytime it keeps the house at a minimum of 5degrees... which basically means it only comes on if it's bloody freezing and that's only to protect the pipes.  Mostly, it won't ever come on.  

It goes back to aiming for 21.5degrees at shortly before I get home and stays that way until 10pm, when it drops down to 16degrees (just incase it's an especially chilly night), mostly this never comes on at night.

On January 22, 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour. After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three cages and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the cages have remained into the 21st century.

What the Tories wanted to talk about was their record on the economy where they're perceived as strong and to get UKIP talking about their policies other than immigration.

Firstly I'd consider any differences in your diet particularly - since you are wearing sunscreen daily - are you eating plenty of oily fish for bioavailable vitamin D and long chain omega-3s. Check out our sidebar for the official UK guidelines on sunscreen use when the UV index is low.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/sunprotection

You'd be best patch testing products (can do products on different parts of the face to make that faster) and introducing them one at a time. If you are familiar with Nivea creme and not had any problems, IMO stick with that for now. It's well priced in Bodycare and Home Bargains usually. Boots is not terribly cheap, unless something is on a half price offer.

Wipes are really not the best for removing sunscreen and make up. Try to keep shampoo and other hair products off your face, these can cause negative reactions as can dental products. Even the bubbles and even well rinsed.

If your skin is normal to dry I would use a lotion, cream or oil type cleanser not a foaming one. At least three of us here really like the **Superdrug Vitamin E hot cloth cleanser £5** which comes with a muslin cloth. That whole Vitamin E line is on a BOGOHP right now, along with some of their other own brand products. I haven't tried it yet but their Vitamin E body cream gets good reviews from bloggers and comes in a HUGE tub, also at least one of their their Vitamin E face creams look decent from the ingredients. Be careful with the Superdrug Naturally Radiant line, a couple of us reacted badly to the hot cloth cleanser.

If you want a toner several of us here rate the **Simple Kind To Skin Soothing Facial Toner £3.30.** This has niacinamide which is anti inflammatory, great for hyperpigmentation, a healthy skin barrier, acne and even anti ageing. The toner is almost always on an offer at one of the supermarkets, or you can find it at Bodycare or Home Bargains. I use this toner for a quick cleanse, in the morning or if I got sweaty.

If you also want moisturiser or sunscreen recommendations say and I will do another post. A mega review thread on AHA/ BHA exfoliants is due in the next few days, so it seems wise to start test patching a cleanser and/ or toner whilst you wait for that.

As well as our review threads we have our ingredients Wiki, with products available in the UK at the end. Still a work in progress and I am personally testing at least some of the products from each category.

The reason for the bill was the change in the way GDP is calculated across the EU. The new system includes things like drugs and prostitution. Including these things has lead to many EU economies seeing their GDP rise a sizeable amount overnight.

There is actually a very good reason why many EU countries would want their GDP to look bigger than it actually is.

Governments of European Union members are not supposed to let their annual deficits exceed 3 percent of [GDP](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/corrective_arm/index_en.htm)	 or accumulated debt exceed 60 percent of GDP. They can suffer fines and penalties if they do.

This is the real reason black market economies are now being included, there are many EU countries in dire financial situations, and they want their economies to look bigger to avoid these penalties. 

The inclusion of unregulated economies makes the GDP of many European nations look higher, and makes Europe look like it is in a better financial position than it actually is.

Firstly, I want to say I agree with most everything you said. I think the only things I don't fully agree with is the Doctor distancing himself from humanity, and just the overall scariness of them. (admittedly, I have not listened to the audio series Cyberman). Also, that the Doctor will always save the day with the Daleks, there's been at least one episode where I actually didn't know what was going to happen (and was pretty unimpressed how it ended, I think the one where the Daleks had stolen timelord technology to survive the grey area of space and when it was opened it spilled forth like millions of daleks onto earth.)

Other than that, spot on. I'd just like to say it's my opinion on the Cybermen being lackluster, as a Who villain, taken strictly in the context of new Who since that's what I've been exposed to. I think that the writers of New Who have done a really great job explaining pieces of the mythos of the Daleks and explaining why they and the Doctor are mortal enemies, etc etc. But I had no idea the Cybermen were humans that robo-tized themselves for the sake of survival. The only thing that doesn't make sense is if they were human (or close enough) why would they come to Earth and upgrade humans. Or try to take control of Earth, etc. Because in a couple episodes at least the Daleks and the Cybermen have squared off, and the Cybermen want to upgrade the Daleks, implying they think the Daleks are a lesser race, implying pride.

But I mean, that's just my take and my opinion on it, with a far less amounts of research than you to boot. 

Also, I'll just say about humanity and the Doctor. Yes, in *Kill the Moon* the Doctor distances himself from Clara in the situation to make her, humanity, the astronaut woman figure out what to do without him. I think this is much less about Humanity protecting themselves (see Torchwood and the Doctors' opinions on that...), and more about realizing that Clara will not be with him much longer and that she won't be able to turn to him for help like she can now. Clara and the Doctor have a very unique relationship, just like every companion and Doctor. I think Clara is a good mix of Amy and Donna, very independent, smart, and quick witted and I think the Doctor is just trying to make that shine so she realizes that she can be all those things without him. 

That's my take on it anyway. I guess simply because the very first episode of Matt Smith's tenure, he tells the Atraxi that the Earth is protected. Which is one of the few scenes in Doctor Who that's actually given me shivers. Several have made me cry, most have made me laugh, but not many send shivers through my body.

Anyways, I lost my point too, but I guess all in all, everyone has their own opinions, and things can be looked at a multitude of ways. haha",0,1415371963,null,0,false,0,clvqhk8,t3_2li1fy,t1_clvqhk8,t1_clv64pt,null,1426144815,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

For our *best* XI I think Kane is a nobrainer, simply because he's the only one of our strikers who has performed. Sure, Bobby's passing is great, but at the end of the day a striker is supposed to score goals, and Kane has done just that. However, I agree with /u/gonredditin when he says that leaving him for the EL is the wise move; even if he in my mind is part of our best XI I probably wouldn't play him in the PL. 

Townsend has been looking great the past few games, and Lamela hasn't, but I still reckon Lamela is the better player of the two. Eriksen and Chadli are both obvious choices as well, though Eriksen and Lamela need to work on their play together. Chadli has performed admirably and since the alternative seems to be Lennon... Well.

Capoue has had a mediocre few games, but other than that he has been absolutely immense, and Stambouli really hasn't proven why he should be starting instead. As for Mason, he would be up against Dembele and while there's no denying Dembele's strength and dribbling abilities, I feel that Mason contributes more to our team.

As for our back four, Rose and Vertonghen are both obvious choices. Poch seems to have favoured Dier over Naughton, but I can't really decide. Walker is obviously the preferred option as soon as he returns from injury. The big one here is Kaboul or Fazio. Kaboul has looked shaky for large parts of this season, but he was amazing against the scum. Fazio has managed to get two red cards in less than three weeks; the one last night was weak to say the least, but it's still a worrying sign.

I'm undecided on globalisation as whole. On the one hand it brings a lot of money into other countries - albeit somewhat destructively. On the other hand it can be pretty bad for the environment. Plenty of ways to criticise it and praise it...

&gt;I'd just rather more time and energy was put into closing the tax loopholes we have than this outrage at teh evil rich people.

I would rather think people are criticising the output of the system we have in place as immoral. If I built a computer and 80% of the power usage was going towards head production and cooling then people might criticise it as inefficient. I shouldn't take that as a personal attack on me as an engineer - or maybe the rich people are the user in this scenario. That is a fact of physics but pointing that out doesn't make my CPU any less inefficient.

Once that happens, consumers who still buy most of their electricity from big generators will have to pay higher and higher prices - as the generators try to cover their costs from fewer &amp; fewer customers... a deadly feedback loop that will drive more and more people to renewables.

The market as it is currently formulated just can't cope with that.

Clearly non of my original response was intended to be taken very seriously at all.  

However, when it comes to this particular situation with Clara, I personally wouldn't expect *any* of them - other than the First Doctor up to around the time when he left Susan - kicking Clara out as a result of this ""betrayal"". All of them would understand that her actions were due to grief, and that she was not acting from rational motivations. To abandon her when she is absorbed by grief like that after having travelled with her for this long would be shallow and fickle beyond (my) belief. This is not a betrayal: this a part of the grieving process.

If this was someone that they had had no previous relationship with, or if her actions had no obvious motivation, then certainly I could see that qualities such as forgiveness (or lack of it), cruelty, and unwillingness to give second chances would come into play, but in this situation, I don't even feel that such qualities would be involved in reaching the decision.  

For me, the only question would be would they ""go to Hell"" to bring him back, would they try to find some other way around this, or would they simply say no and move on - allowing Clara to continue or not, of her own choice. Disregarding narrative reasons, I actually expect all of them would say no, based on what we have seen in the past.  

Since Clara would very probably leave as a result, the nest question would be: Which Doctors, if any, would then visit her again once she had moved further through her grieving and invite her once more?

In essence:

* In May of every year the EU Commission is required to meet with representatives of each state to estimate what their Gross National Income will be for the coming year.  
* Every autumn they meet again to see if there are any revisions to the numbers.  This is a purely mathematical revision.
* It enables the Commission to set the revised figures in stone on 1 December of each year, as it is required to do.

This year, the Governments insisted that the calculation must be done in exactly the same way for every country, so everything is above board, 1995 was the benchmark year. This ""One off - out of the blue"" bill is an adjustment revision, in the UK it shows that we have underpaid over the past 11 years. 

This isn't Junker and Barosso doing a cash grab, in fact the EU would probably be worse off.

false,arrowtoknees,lfc50,,"And Gerrard slips again. This is what the Chelsea squad had been practising for. In a well practised manager Cesc stepped to the loose ball and his teammates all pressed forward, playing their part in the secret move that the Special One called his blitzkrieg. 
""everything is going as planned"" thought Mourinho to himself. He even allowed himself one of his trademark smirks. But just as quickly as it had begun his plan started to fall apart. 
""it was so obvious"" onlookers would proclaim after the game. But for the 11 players representing Chelshit FC on the pitch, it couldn't have been any less obvious. In what was a pre-planned trap, Gerrard had baited them into stepping forward. In a masterstroke, he had made the entire team abandon their positions. Greed they say, can breakdown even the most well oiled machines. As Cesc stepped in to steal the ball, his foot found air where teh ball had just been a second ago. By the time he realized what had happened, he was look at the back of a red shirt that had the writing ""Gerrard"" and ""8"" on its back.
Having sidestepped Cecs, Gerrard booted the ball forward with a slight left bias. He did not need to look up. The team had been practicing this for the better part of the week and right on cue, Raheem, who by now was yards in front of the aging Chlesea defense, had the ball at his feet and was headed towards Thiago in blistering speed. Having no choice, Thiago stepped forward to meet him outside the penalty area. Raheem’s inhuman pace had a shortcoming though. When one is travelling at that speed, simple tasks like changing directions are made exponentially more difficult. Thibaut allowed himself a sliver of confidence knowing that he had trapped Raheem in no man's land. There was nowhere to go. But in what was soon looking like teh day's theme for chelsea, that moment of relief was short lived. While Thiago was busy concentrating on the red blur in front of him, he had failed to notice Gerrard on his other side. Gerrard, who was determined to exact his revenge, had outsprinted younger and fitter players to get to the position he was in. Desire can indeed overshadow ability. 
With a barely noticable flick of his ankle, Raheem sent the ball Steven's way. Even an act of god couldn't prevent what was to happen next. Sprinting the ball to the goal line his stopped. Then in an incredulous display of contempt, he went to the ground and headed the dead ball in. Year later, that one moment would be recalled as the trigger. The trigger to the downfall of an empire built on oil and money. Money as they say, doesn't last forever. If only someone had bothered telling Roman and Jose. ",0,1415374834,null,0,false,0,clvrv63,t3_2lkjx2,t1_clvrv63,t3_2lkjx2,null,1426144102,24,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,24

The sad fact is his job creates wealth for him and other people who already have vast sums of wealth.  It just so happens that because money makes money people are happy to pay huge amounts of money to make more money.

Unlike, scientists who you know, made the computers he uses to make his vast sums of money which literally changed the world who we're paid annually less than he makes in a day.

In our current economy yes he'd just go else where, and yes the competition between these jobs drives the pay to obscene levels.

Doesn't make it any less obscene just because everyone is doing it all over the place.

A valid and oft brought up criticism however I don't think you can be so certain it would definitely happen. There are articles, papers and real life experiments that support the idea. 

A lot of people have a huge belief in the free market and this is an example where it could work to balance expected rising costs. The most common formulation of the argument is with things like rent. All rents suddenly rising in-line with BI. 

There is an FAQ in the /r/BasicIncome subreddit and it answers some of these concerns.

'The greatest wage effects are found for low-waged workers. Dustmann et al (2013) find that each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK-born working age population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers and to an increase in the wages of higher paid workers. Similarly, another study focusing on wage effects at the occupational level during 1992 and 2006, found that, in the unskilled and semi-skilled service sector, a 1% rise in the share of migrants reduced average wages in that occupation by 0.5% (Nickell and Salaheen 2008).'

The UK originally joined the EU when it was a trade treaty (despite France's veto... twice) because the economical benefits are huge for everyone when you introduce free and open trade across the EU members. However, more and more recently the trade treaty has become more of a extremely costly and bureaucratic government that dampens the benefits of the original treaty.

Not sure what will happen with Texiera- I think he's good enough to have an impact for us now, but not sure what the club thinks of him.  I suspect he'll possibly want to leave as well.

Ibe and Rossiter will come into the first team, albeit as subs.

Enrique has a year left in his contract, I think he'll hang out until 2016 and leave on a Bosman similar to Johnson this year.  Jones will be similar and will ride out his contract through 2016 as will Skrtel and Lambert.   

Lucas still has 2 years left, so he may push his way out to an Italian side rather than not play.

From the current first team, I could see us selling Allen in the summer as well as perhaps Balotelli and I wouldn't be surprised to see Manquillo head back home on a recall.

There weren't no X.. when I were  lad .. and this lot turned up.. so it must be them.

It's a basic logical fallacy. 

Why? 

Well:

a) you have to assume that there was no drinking -illegal or otherwise in Moston at any stage in the history of humanity 
b) that there's no record of illegal or legal drinking etc in the country in all of human history
c) that the isn't illegal or legal drinking etc in the surrounding areas in all of human history
d) that only African are partaking in drinking, prostitution etc
f) that only Africans do things illegal in Moston

and when you've got past that :

g) that there are no economic causes for illegal activity in Moston
h) that there are no social cause of illegal activity in Moston

and then when you go further

i) that the social causes are unique to Africans ,and don't happen in other communities
j) that the economic causes only happen in Africans and not in other communities.

false,Tallis-man,null,null,"If it ever happens, it will be restricted to cities with reasonable population density.  I suspect the most cost-efficient system will turn out to be a hybrid system.  Here is my prediction.

Routine deliveries are grouped by proximity into clusters, which are served by a single van; the van drives to some calculated central location, where a fleet of drones is launched.  They fly, simultaneously, radially outwards to their destination, where they drop their parcel into a secure drop-box.  (eg one that receives parcels vertically when the drone docks, and is opened by a secret combination texted/emailed to the consumer).  There would be banks of these secure boxes at central locations, for convenience, and people would perhaps subscribe to a Prime-like service to have one installed and maintained in their home or garden.

My speculation is based on the simple fact that the current system is actually very efficient, up to the final few miles -- where a delivery driver must search for and deliver to each individual house.  This conjectured system mimics the current one until this point, where the aerial delivery allows multiple parcels in the area to be delivered simultaneously.  The drop-boxes remove the tricky problem of final-stage piloting, which -- if delivery to normal postal addresses were allowed -- would require an individual pilot for each parcel.  Docking can easily be automated.

One main problem with the whole plan is weather.  If bad weather forced a return to the old-fashioned system, extended inclement periods could blow a hole in the budget.  This cost could be passed onto the consumer, perhaps.  Still a problem.

He adds width going forward and has the pace to track back quicker than Davies can. Rose has more pace than Davies and that suits Poch better than Davies. Poch wants an attacking full back and that's what Danny is. He is a former winger. 

On to Davies. He has been less than spectacular all season. He has not looked better than Danny going forward and even last night as not looked that great defensively. Davies is regarded as the more defensive option but in my opinion Rose has been great defensively this year and certainly better than Davies.

Rose should absolutely be in the starting X1. In fact he is been one the most consistently good performers on the team this season.

false,Iosif_ravenfire,null,null,"I'm not sure if you mean $8K each as in per person, or together.  The $8K would be the price for you both together.

Lets try and break it down, you may be able to find places to save money, and reduce the cost.

All the prices below are for both of you, as you will be together. I have tried to stick to middle of the road prices, for the accommodation for example some nights may be cheaper (down to £20/$32 or up to £80/$125). Same with the food, some nights will be more, other less. Also it depends on where your travelling, big cities like London will be vastly more expensive then a nice little Inn in a rural area.

You may also want to factor in an 'emergency fund' of say around £200/$320 just in case.

Also I haven't included travel insurance, as I could even guess how much that would be for you.

* Flights just googled it, cheapest return for 2 adults (JFK to Heathrow in London) is £1200 ($1900) with Aer Lingus.

* Britrail Pass - £375/$600 (your quote)

* Accommodation - Assume 30 days at £50/$80 (some places will be cheaper, some more - Total £1500/$2400 (most places charge per room, rather then per person)

* Food - Mid-day - around £15/$25. This is based off simple meal - baked potato/soup and a sandwich. 15 days Total = £225/$350 
15 days of self-catering £10: £150/$240. Total on Mid-day food = £375/$600.

* Food - Evening Meal - Start+Main/Main+Dessert £40/$65 for say 20 days = £800/$1250. 10 days take outs at around £20 = £200/$320

* Food - Breakfast - assume 15 days were breakfast isn't provided with your accommodation. £20 = £200/$320

* Tourist attractions - many free galleries/museums across the country, with hill walking, or visiting towns. Assume 15 visits to attractions at £30/$50 = £450/$715.

* Spends (gifts/trinkets/postcards) = if your back packing you probably won't buy something everyday. This is a stab in the dark, but assuming £10/$16 across 20 days = £200/$320

* Alcohol (separate in-case your light/heavy drinkers) = Pint around £3, Glass of wine £5. Assume 2 drinks each per night (wine + beer) = £16. Assume 20 nights with drinks £320/$510.


**TOTAL**

* Flights = £1200/$1900

* Trains = £375/$600

* Accommodation = £1500/$2400

* Food Breakfast = £200/$320

* Food Mid-day = £375/$600

* Food Evening = £1000/$1600

* Attractions = £450/$715

* Spends = £200/$320

* Alcohol = £320/$510

* **Grand Total** = £5620/$8900 

* **Grand Total Per Person** = £2810/$4500 (round up to the nearest thousand = £3000/$5000

The USA was a powerhouse in terms of economical might. Their power in 1870s was no where near the scale that they were about to reach. For example steel production went from 1 million tonnes in 1870 to 30 million by 1910, triple the amount Germany and Austria were producing. GNP grew by almost 10 times in the period 1880-1920. Their military was only weak because they did not have standing army, as seen in WW1 they were able to conscript huge amount of soldiers, with nearly 1,500,000 American troops in France by July 1918.

Germany boasted the world's strongest army, and a navy second only to the Royal Navy. They also had an incredibly powerful economy. The fact that Germany fought Russia, France, Britain, and held all 3 countries on two different fronts, whilst experiencing economic collapse due to the blockade shows how powerful she was.

""Here's why, prohibiting the use of a language..."" 

Just going to ask a question there - at what point in Irish history was the Irish language EVER legally prohibited?

Cite me the legal instrument that prohibited please. Because if it was ever legally prohibited, that should be an extremely easy request to fulfill.

But it never really was prohibited was it? (though its awfully convenient for the purposes of Irish Republican mythology to pretend it was).

The reality is the Irish language fell in to misuse for the same reasons that Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic, Breton and other minor languages did - it surpassed its usefulness as a means of a communication in a more global age (that nasty capitalism process raises its head again).

This lies at the heart of Irish over-sensitivity on the language issue - they won't admit this, prefer to invent an oppression myth, and hate it when any kind of joke suggests this.

&gt;Oh god no. I don't want them in charge.(http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2lgp9p/stewart_lee_the_imaginary_liberal_comedy_cabal/clv1s1v)

You are misrepresenting my viewpoint to make your point. When Critics talk about Labour people they talk about Milliband, Harman, Balls,Cooper because they could be in charge. When critics talk about Conservatives people they talk about Cameron, osbourne, Gove, Johsson, May because they are in charge. When critics talk about Lib dem people they talk about Clegg, Alexander, Cable because they are either in charge or will influence who's in charge. When critics talk about UKIP they talk about Farage and then a whole assortment of people who are quite rightly kicked out of the party.  It's not the same. If people were talking about some obscure ex-labour/tory/libdem council candidate then it would be the same but they are not. they are focusing on the main people for LIB/LAB/CON and obscure people in UKIP. 

&gt;There have been loads of studies about the benefits (with specific drawbacks) of being in the EU

Well maybe there are in the circles in which you mix or get your media from but I watch the ten o'clock news, newsnight and some RT and aljazeera haven't seen anything. I google it and found one survey by the CBI. That's not loads and as for immigration there is one recent study and that's it.  This is not taking on the arguments.  

&gt;This is the most roundabout description of prejudice

I'm not *describing* prejudice. I am saying **where it comes from** - as is very clear from my description. Prejudice is having insults mouth at just the right volume so that the person can deny they said anything, It's having to watch your back 24/t because people might want to do bad things to you.  Prejudice is having the ever present threat of aggression or discrimination. But **where do these prejudices come from?** Some-times they come from top down in a society. During WW2 prejudice against germans was encouraged. In the middle east preachers in important positions and laws enforce prejudice against religion. In the cold war politicians like Joseph McCarthy encourged prejudice against communism. But that is NOT what's happening today. Yes there is some fear of difference that a lot of people seem to have but overcome. But where is the rest of the prejudice coming from? Why in todays society are people still dissmising large groups based on a few individuals? All the evidence I have seen is that people who get round to hating a whole group start with a few members and build from there. That's what I've witness from racists time and again.  I have already said -

&gt;[ It can be anything from skin colour, to trivial choice of music, to area of your town, to accent. NOW I am NOT saying they are all equal in consequence, effect, pervasiveness or seriousness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2lgp9p/stewart_lee_the_imaginary_liberal_comedy_cabal/clv0s90)

You say:

&gt;You are just pissed off because people are calling out UKIP and you think its them being mean

What else do I think? Please tell me? Because obviously if I say ""people are focusing on a minority of personalities and not policy"". And that ""I don't support UKIP"" twice. Obviously what I am really saying is that ""I am a rich white old middle aged privileged man, who can't be trusted to be honest about my political affiliation and  who thinks political stereo types are as bad as racist violence"". 

I couldn't possibly be someone who is more interested in discussing policy. I couldn't possibly be someone who thinks that in two years time, two years of UKIP banging the anti-immigration and anti-EU-drum, that UKIP will have got rid of the nutters. I couldn't possibly think that the critics that have relied so much of focusing on the nutters will be two years behind in the argument. No because if you attack UKIPs critics for their tactics then you must be pro-UKIP and anti- whatever you like.  

I see the vox pops on the news, I've experienced the attitude and a lot of people don't care about the nutters so long as they are kept out of sight.  This is where I think UKIPs critics have got it very wrong.  UKIP are a 2 policy party "" immigration and EU"". Convince people of the benefit of both and UKIP have lost. Keep focusing on nutters and in a couple of years when we have referendum you may find yourself talking about two year old news.

**And please tell me when it's okay to dissmiss a large group of people based on the actions of the few?** Seriously when? When it's old white men? Maybe? Yes life is definitely better if you are white and male ( and again for the THIRD time I am not equating racism to the dismissal of ukip. They are not even nearly equal in prevalence, effect, seriousness and I NEVER said they were. other people decided that I said that. You have to remember that Social Media is riddled with activist and probably even more so now that labour have employed Obamas 2012 online campaigner Matthew McGregor - His team were responsible for turning Reddit/r/politics in to /r/obama ) I personally would rather find out what people are really like that dismissing them because the belong to a group.  When is it okay to dismiss a group based on a few bad members? WHEN? Please tell me, because everyone is giving me grief over this. 

inb4 you claim that because I get strong phrasing I think I'm persecuted much worse that people of colour then fail to address any of my points and then put words in my mouth to make it easier to attack me.

As to your points regarding the globality of the language, that is certainly true however other countries adapted to the rise of English by becoming bilingual to greater or lesser extents. Finnish is not a global language but it still exists. Irish declined to such an extent as its suppression was actively pursued. This is also true for celtic languages of Britain by the way.

I agree with a lot of what David Mitchell says in that video funny enough, I find it supports my position, did you pay attention to it???
Mitchell was stating that he appreciates scottish gaelic and supports the speakers of said language while being opposed to huge amounts of public money being spent on it. I agree, that is not the issue here however. Mitchell did not mock scottish gaelic. Irish is not a dead language...

&gt; The 2001 census in Northern Ireland showed that 167,487 people (10.4%) ""had some knowledge of Irish"" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland). At least one in three people (~1.8 million) on the island of Ireland can understand Irish to some extent. Estimates of fully native speakers range from 40,000 up to 80,000 people.[3][4][5][6] Areas in which the language remains a vernacular are referred to as Gaeltacht areas.

...and therefore deserves some recognition.

My department (conferences, functions, banquets) always had something on over the Christmas period, pretty much on every day. We were all asked at the start of December what days we could do, and what we couldn't for Christmas Day / Boxing Day.

Normally, shift lengths in that line of work were very variable, but this was the one time of the year where the shifts are kept to a strict 6 hours, for our own sake. For Christmas day, they'd ask you to do either the morning/early afternoon or afternoon/early evening. Same with Boxing Day. They did not consider anything after Boxing Day to be 'special' and thus treat anything on those days as normal.

The management were normally good about it. Our staff was made up of a lot of uni students that would be going home for the holidays, but a number of us were locals. Any deficiencies in staffing levels were typically made up with agency staff. This was just our department, though. Over in Restaurant side, the manager there was an absolute tit, threatening to sack anybody who didn't conform to his demands. Even going as far as docking pay without reasonable cause, refusing to acknowledge sick notes signed by doctors, etc. Customer satisfaction was low and turnover was high in that department. We typically got the good employees who really wanted to stay in the company but be away from that manager. In essence, there are ways to do things, and ways *not* to do things.

Personally, I once volunteered to do a double-shift on Christmas day so as to get out of Boxing Day since that was when my fiancee was flying in from the US. My family went out to a restaurant on Christmas Day to eat, and then we celebrated properly on Boxing Day. Since I was on good terms with my managers, and that I was also covering for someone else in one half of my double, they agreed. And that's kinda how we operated, contributed our best for the team's sake.

Believe it or not, the actual ""Christmas"" part of that season isn't that busy, just banquets for groups of old people that all swan off to bed at 8.30pm.

Devonshire Hall is known for having the best social atmosphere out of all the halls, it's like the party hall. 
It's just about 15 minutes away from the Uni.
It is catered but I believe they have kitchen facilities where you can cook your own stuff. 
I'm dating a girl in Dev and she absolutely loves it.

I was in Charles Morris for my first year, I think it's specifically for international students this year. (I don't know if that is something you want or not)
Again really nice, it's on campus but also a catered hall (It has kitchen facilities though)
What I would say about it is that it is not very social at all. Very closed off. 

Central village is another one to look at. It's the largest and is about 5 minutes away from Town and University. I've known people to have a really good time there, really nice rooms and has a kitchen.

Finally Opal, very similar to Central village.

I've never heard of Sentinel Towers, is that the expensive one in town?

Ones to avoid are:
Liberty Dock (MILES away from anything)
Boddington (Shit hole, may have been shut down actually)
Tannery (Boring)

My final point is don't just rely on your halls for a good time. Make sure you join a lot of societies of things that interested you, that is what will make you love your time in Leeds, not what halls you're in.

You really need to quit and stop making excuses, as hard as that sounds. Long term you will be better off by thousands of pounds and you'll be healthier and more productive. Short term it's going to suck, but put this into perspective: it'll take 2 weeks for your mind to be over them so you'll be better off before the month is over. Long term, if you want the rush of a cigarette, try strong coffee. Compared to ciggies, it's very cheap.

Irish speakers, like christianity, Islam or mormons, do NOT deserve special protection from nasty big boys who want to make a joke at your expense. Grow up or get out of the kitchen.

By the way, that's quite a subjective use of the word ""prohibit"" in your response. 

By the same extent Northern Ireland schools are being terrible in ""prohibiting"" the teaching of Gaulish. i.e. just not teaching it.

To prohibit something is not the same as ""not doing something"".

I don't teach basketball to my kids. It doesn't mean I ""prohibit"" them from learning. 

Dictionary definition of prohibit is to ""formally forbid (something)"". 

And on your closing line, elected representatives ARE allowed to be rude if they want (watch Taoiseach, Prime Minister and First Minister questions, Presidential debates, reference George Galloway, Nigel Farage). Its for the electorate to decide if they approve of it or not.

Trying to police ""politeness"" into elected representatives is ridiculous. They are represenatives of the people - and large parts of the electorate hold ""impolite"" views.

To paraphrase stonewall - ""Some politicians are rude. Get over it"".

If you want to stamp out littering you have to put the effort in to detect it and issue appropriate fines. Just catching someone out once in a while and issuing a huge fine is not the same thing. For one thing, people do sometimes drop litter by accident, and would be perfectly willing to pick it up if they knew.

A £20 fine would be enough without being a major injustice if someone is fined for an accident. £75 is getting to the level where there really should be a defence for genuine accidents, and from incidents I've read about I don't think there is.
