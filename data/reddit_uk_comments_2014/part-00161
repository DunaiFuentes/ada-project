&gt;So that's an anti corruption squad, that doesn't just deal with corruption but also terrorism. That must consist of a large number of MPs (to award those powers), police officers from departments like DPS, counter-terrorism command and secret service personnel.

Yes.  I'm talking about Grieve and Clark's Ghost Squad, established by Condon out of SO11 in the '90s using ex spooks and military to investigate corrupt police links to organised crime.  There was little to no political oversight, with a Home Office spokeswoman at the time saying: ""There is no role for ministers and the Home Office.  We haven't got the authority(!), therefore the Met has no need to approach the Home Office or explain what they did and why they did it ... They don't need our authority.""  They didn't even involve the CPS until very late in the day, claiming the chance of corruption meant they had to keep the operation to themselves, and when they eventually did, they mostly ignored their advice.  However, they apparently did recruit a lot of officers with dodgy histories ironically enough.

&gt;that's so super secret there is no actual name for it written down public

See above, they're known as the Ghost Squad or the Untouchables.

&gt;but which you were able to unearth.

Because there have been numerous [articles](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/04/4) and at least [one book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Untouchables-justice-racism-Scotland-Bloomsbury/dp/144820903X) written about them.

&gt;You realise that 1979 was 35 years ago, and the newest recruit at 18 years old (who then would have had no influence will have retired by now. 

Perhaps it would be fairer to say the same _type_ of people, but, nonetheless, many of the events I'm talking about happened in the '80s, '90s, and 'noughties, and they form a tarnished thread of corruption which links many stand-out incidents and scandals from those times Brinks Matt, Daniel Morgan, Lawrence, to more recent ones like Leveson.",0,1402077101,null,0,false,0,ci0unrt,t3_27f7ab,t1_ci0unrt,t1_ci0rnym,null,1434122892,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

My standout memory is not wanting him to start against Wigan in the FA Cup final due to his form and preferring Milner's qualities for that particular game. And he was dire in that game FWIW.

His inconsistency is not an irrelevance, how on earth could you deem one of the most important qualities for a player to be an irrelevance?!

My point, to reiterate, is that due to FFP, we can only have so many top earners at the club. Nasri is already one of the highest earners at the club, a contract extension would increase his wage further.

My question is merely does he represent value for money, and if not, would we be better placed looking elsewhere?

£170-£200k a week will get you a top player. Nasri, while a very good player, is he world class? Does he truly represent value on that kind of wage?

We can only have so many players in the squad earning that sum, would we be better placed bringing in another player as an alternative?

Isco for example, as of right now, never mind last summer, is a superior player to Nasri (IMO) and would demand a wage less than that.

Hazard earns less than that (not that we could sign him).

My point is, we play by a different set of rules now since we've been given FFP to consider.

We can't make these call s lightly.

And ultimately, if we were to decide Nasri didn't represent value for money (which I don't believe we will), I'd identify a replacement now, and sell Nasri this summer before his value dropped any further.

Another thing you have to consider is what on earth we'll do if Nasri does go back to his old ways after we've given him an increased wage and contract extension and we decide he doesn't make the grade anymore.

Who is going to come in for him when he'll be earning close to £200k a week?

If we get this wrong it could really hurt us.

""The law 
When you buy a used vehicle from a trader you are making a legally binding contract. You have legal rights against the trader under the Sale of Goods Act 1979.

The vehicle should be:

- Of a satisfactory quality - free from minor defects, safe and durable for a reasonable length of time. When assessing satisfactory quality you should take into account price, age, mileage and condition at the time of sale.

- Fit for its intended purpose or a purpose that you made known to the trader - fit to be driven on the road.

- As described - the vehicle should correspond with any description applied to it. In some circumstances, the trader may be liable for any statement made by the manufacturer of the goods.

If the vehicle was faulty at the time of sale, you are legally entitled to request one of the following remedies:

a full refund
compensation (damages)
repair or replacement
rescission or reduction in price""

This applies to the trader, not the manufacturer. The car had no DPF, meaning it falls under both point 2 and 3. ""Fit to be driven on road"" not legally, as the dpf is a legal requirement, meaning it was un-roadworthy. As described, the vehicle was described as being unmodified, but removing the dpf counts as a modification. Becoming a business gives you responsibilities, selling safe and road worthy cars is there business and responsibility.

If they used it even once then they are guilty of obfuscating basic protections for the citizens spied on, like actually having to have a reason why your spying on them. 

It might be true that there are rigorous safeguards to prevent this from being used against innocent people but how would we know? The government has been totally silent on the issue and has refused to show us exactly how the intelligence agencies are kept in check. 

Either way we must assume the worst because the government has one of the most totalitarian approaches to intelligence of any government; it just says it won't comment. There is no transparency whatsoever about any domestic security operations. We can talk all we like about the balance we need to strike between security and privacy being careful not to stray too far in one direction but if UK citizens know nothing about the security state how the hell are we supposed to make that decision? In reality the decision has been taken out of our hands - the balance between security and privacy is no longer a choice given to the people. The government decides that line for us - a government that is charged with the very difficult obligation of keeping us all safe and has no interest or investment in privacy. Take a guess which side of the security/privacy dichotomy they will take us!

The government must learn the lesson that if it wants the public to trust it then they have to be transparent and we need to know why we should trust it. The days are gone where we just take the word of a smartly dressed man that our boys are doing the best job they can - those days are gone precisely because the government has shown over and over again decade after decade that it can't be trusted.

Perhaps the current crop of people employed in these positions are fair, impartial, and unbiased.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Liberal Democrats. 

We had thought they wouldn't sell out principles for a chance at government but they did thus making them just the same as all the other parties but no worse. I don't know why people came down so hard on the Lib Dems for selling out. I guess they simply ignored the Tories declaring they were the party of the NHS before openly privatising parts of it. Or I suppose they ignored the promises in the past when they promised to increase the defence budget and then cut the army or when they were sure to abolish the human rights act but have kept it (mainly because of Lib Dem opposition BTW). Or maybe they simply missed when Tony Blair gutted the Labour party of any socialist principle whatsoever, lied his face off to the public and conducted two expensive war for little gain all in pursuit of his own personal ideology completely separated from his party's principle. Anybody who says they can't vote for the Lib Dems because they have no principles and yet also vote for a major party are hypocrites in my book. Decide on the policies not their faked public images.  

I want to be represented by people who are pro-EU. I like that they are pro-civil liberties and human rights on which both Labour and the Tories have truly atrocious records. They have introduced the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 which rolled back some of the Labour destruction and they opposed the Draft Communications Data Bill ('Snooper's Charter') which was drafted by Labour and introduced by the Tories despite widespread public opposition - and this was before the Snowden leaks in 2013. Under Blair the Labour government destroyed a raft of basic civil rights after 9/11 and the Tories are continuing that crusade so they can deport nasty brown people to countries that will torture them without any legal problems. I would vote Lib Dem on this issue alone even if I didn't agree with their other policies. 

They have the best digital rights agenda of any party and they have a pretty environmentally friendly manifesto but aren't opposed to GM crops or nuclear energy like the Greens and they are in favour of transport investment too. I also like their Mansion tax idea though it could do with some tweaking. The major problems of inequality are not fixed by meddling with income tax levels. The really rich have bonuses and capital gains and they avoid tax like the plague because income is a very liquid concept. Taxing accumulated wealth is more effective at tackling inequality and less easy to avoid if it's in the form of a huge house and/or stocks in a UK company than income tax. 

I don't agree with them entirely on nuclear weapons and defence spending but it not a huge issue for me. All in all I don't trust Labour with the economy, I don't trust the Tories with public services or civil liberties or the environment...or anything for that matter. UKIP are abhorrent and nothing makes me happier than voting for their polar opposite party and the people they hate the most.

From that point, the scammers basically faked a dial tone, waited until she'd typed in the number of Nationwide, and then pretended to be the bank. You can hardly fault her for thinking she was talking to a representative at her bank, given that she just dialled the number.

Also the scammers, if they were even more sophisticated, could have just decoded the numbers she was typing in and checked it against a list of bank card helpline numbers to figure out which one they were going to pose as. They didn't even need to know from her that she banks with Nationwide. The only thing this scam requires is for the person to phone their bank soon after the initial cold call.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt; So you're into red polish?

Yes, but I'm trying to get over it. When I got burgled five years ago, the thing I was most fuming about was that the fuckers stole my nail varnish box. I probably had £400 worth of YSL and Dior red polish in there, amongst others. 

&gt;You should wear the blue! It's perfect for warm weather. I'm all about brights and pastels now it's a bit sunnier.

I'll definitely wear the darker blue. I think the lighter one will make my hands look pale and washed out, in hindsight. 

&gt;I was in Boots once and walked up to the till with about the same amount of polish you have there and the girl behind the till just stared at them all and went ""So...I guess you like nail polish"". I figure I must have a problem if the amount I buy shocks the girls in Boots.

Oh why don't they just fuck off and back with their personal comments! It's not a problem, it's a hobby. 

&gt;Is MUA blush any good? 

Mixed. I have one cream and one powder. The cream is great, powder awful, possibly the worst I've ever owned. I'll try the new cream one out and report back. 

&gt;I only have a couple blushers, I should probably branch out eventually.

I probably have six, none of which I really adore. I suspect it's one of those things you really need to spend good money on. Except I didn't have a great time with Benetint (oh look, Benefit being shit again). However, I loved one of their powder blushes.

At some point I'm going to drag out all the lipsticks I dislike as lipsticks and do something blush-like with them. I reckon with a dab of vaseline and High Beam, some of them can be made into something useful, rather than just taking up space and making me to lemon faces every time I look at them.

The first time I crossed over one of these structures I was instantly thrown off my bike, onto the ground. My clothes and skin were damaged. The landing put a few scratches into my brake levers and frame. I was upset.

If you cross these crossings on the left hand side (as pictured) where the ridges are parallel to the direction of travel, your bike's wheels will fall between them. When a wheel falls into the ridge it turns your bicycle's steerer parallel to the direction of the ridges. This sudden turning force is sufficient to throw a cyclist off a bike. It feels like somebody grabbed and twisted your handlebar. The faster you go, the worse the effect.

The problem does not occur with thick-wheeled bikes (e.g. mountain bikes, Boris bikes), or if the cyclist crosses on the other side (where the ridges are perpendicular to the motion of the bike). Naturally it's also not a problem if you are moving very slowly. Below 5 mph, these crossings don't seem to be a problem no matter what kinds of wheels your bike has.

I've no idea what the architects had intended to achieve by this feature. It's clearly not intended to be a speed-bump, or else they would have put up signs warning cyclists to slow down.

Aww, that's really sweet. I wish you much luck and a lifetime of happiness. 

Speaking of marriage, I was trying to stalk my husband the other night to find out if he's dead yet. I didn't have much luck. How do I find out if a person is dead please? It'll just save me the chore and expense of getting a divorce. I know his full name, date of birth, parents names and last known location from approx. 7 years ago. If he's not dead, he may be in a mental institution. Anyone got access to those kinds of lists?

&gt;Successes

[Girl haul](http://i.imgur.com/bcrQxSu.jpg) + a new dress.

Managed to survive the working day without punching anyone, setting them on fire or sending aggressive emails, despite being up since 4.30am.

New coffee is GOOD coffee. 

Had a bitch/chinwag with my boss who asked me to analyse someone's management style, gave my verdict, she agreed, useless employee's not going to get away with this shit for very much longer, which is very good because she takes up far too much of my time and I'm sick of her being incompetent/not taking responsibility whilst earning four times more than me - also being a burden on everyone around her who also earn what she does too. Just.fuck.off. 

Did a lot of work, and still posted on here, didn't miss any deadlines, everyone's happy. 

Outfit looked decent. 

Enjoying some minor flirting currently happening.

Uh... I'm sure there's more, but I'm a bit brain dead.

&gt;Failures

The woman who made my bacon buttie sneezed on her hand before cutting it this morning. I asked her to wash her hands and re-make it because snot is not good. She insisted she snotted on her elbow. Even so, she only wiped her hand on a paper towel before starting again. So if I get the lurgy, I only have myself to blame for not insisting 'NO, WASH THEM.' Still, I'm friendly with the manager and may have a quiet word next week about their food hygiene. NB /u/Invader-Strange. 

Spent half an hour arguing with IT about why PCs are shit and Macs are not. Ending up coming home with some random employee's Windows tablet to work on this weekend. Fucking hate PCs, so I'll feel even more like I'm in the office than I would if they just had a virtual desktop solution. 

Bought approx. 10 hours worth of work home to do this weekend.

Despite a few days of dieting and counting calories in absolutely everything, have not lost weight. Don't think this diet plan thingy has my calorie intake right. Am moderately pissy about it. To be addressed this weekend.

More sad feelings for friend who was desperate for a baby and miscarried; she's 40 and single, found a donor, got pregnant, baby went wrong, and now, a week after miscarrying, her fucking pregnancy test is still showing up as pregnant. Now really, how cruel must life be? Give the girl a break. 

Former BFF has yet again let me down. I wouldn't quite call it a failure though, it's somewhat reassuring to come to the realisation that a friend who's a fucking pain in the arse is dead to you. He just doesn't know it yet.

&gt;and how pissed are you going to get tonight to celebrate/commiserate?

I was not a happy bunny. Unfortunately, because I'd moved into a really posh building, I was naive enough to believe that I didn't need to worry about contents insurance. What a fucking idiot. So, I lost just under 7k's worth of stuff, including a bracelet which was worth 3.5k. But yes, the real moment of absolute fury was when I went to change my nail varnish and realised the fuckers stole the box. The box, as lovely as it was, only cost me £12. Frankly, nobody wants to steal a bunch of half-used nail varnishes, you're never going to sell them. It was all about the box. Motherfuckers. All my Dior, my YSL, all my gorgeous shades of red :(

&gt;I can't get cream blush to look good on me. It's never subtle enough for my liking, it always looks super obvious.

Can't say I've found the perfect method either, but it seems to help if you put it on really quickly straight after foundation application without quite allowing the foundation to dry. Pat it on with fingertips and spread it a little whilst the foundation is still slightly wet. That said, getting blusher right is still on my to-do list. I never really perfect it. 

&gt;I always consider doing crafty things with my old stuff, but I never actually get round to it.

According to a friend of mine whose parents are farmers and who's spent all his adult life around farming communities, the big issue in recent years has been rape. It's cheap, easy to farm, in huge demand and it's extremely profitable, so there's loads of it around, and bees absolutely love the stuff. To them, a field is incredibly attractive, and once they're in it, it's pretty much a sort of bee-heaven. Trouble is, with that pesticide, it's absolutely lethal to them. A rape seed field with those pesticides, my friend explained, is akin to a bee holocaust. 

So, with that major, major issue more or less out of the way, it makes sense that there'd be a rapid recovery in populations. Who knows, with the amount of rape around, we might even see a population boom. But, yeah - a long term observation really is the way to go before we can call it for sure.

[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] 900 Free French [paratroopers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper) landed as part of the British [Special Air Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service) (SAS) Brigade; the [Free French 2nd Armored Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_2nd_Division_(World_War_II\))—under General Leclerc—landed at [Utah Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach) in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and eventually led the drive toward Paris, while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the [French First Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Army)—under General [Jean de Lattre de Tassigny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Lattre_de_Tassigny)—and joined the [US 7th Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_7th_Army) in [Operation Dragoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dragoon). This operation was the Allied invasion of [southern France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France). The Allied forces advanced up the line of the [Rhône River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh%C3%B4ne_River) to liberate the [Vosges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vosges) and southern [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace). The 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers-Marins Commandos formed from the Free French Navy Fusiliers-Marins landed on Sword Beach and were amongst the first members of the Free French forces to enter Paris.

No apologies expected, except to say that a) you really timed it well and b) it's still possible to have amazing sex AND be silent.

But frankly I don't blame you. Noisy, sweaty sex &gt; meeting with internet strangers.

There was a mouse study I remember where the offspring of parents with certain epigenetic markers (I think it was a histone methylation of some kind) ate significantly more than the control group without parents with the said marker. The marker was also shown to be present in the offsrping. I think they were in the region of 15-20% heavier. It is highly likely that similar patterns exist in humans (tbh some data has been collected from humans but I'm not up to date anymore).

Of course this doesn't excuse being morbidly obese (as in this case) however you should appreciate that achieving a ""normal"" weight may well be much more difficult (mentally NOT physically) for some rather than others, not due to Energy In vs Energy Out, but due to a predisposition to want to eat more.

(Note: I am American, so I can't guarantee that all these products are available in the UK).

1.  Loratadine pills (US brand name: Claritin; generic versions are available).  This is an oral antihistamine.   Don't get Claritin-D; it makes people feel really edgy, because it has an anticongestant in it.  This drug is available without a prescription in the US.

2.  Olopatadine eye drops (US brand name: Pataday).  These are antihistamine eye drops.  They have done more to stop my hayfever than anything else.  It basically eliminated all itchiness and swelling in my eyes.  It is applied once per day.  This drug requires a prescription in the US.

3.  Triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray (US brand name: Nasacort).  This is a corticosteroid spray that functions as an anti-inflammatory.  It is applied once per day.  This drug doesn't require a prescription in the US.

These drugs have no noticeably side effects for me.

If my symptoms somehow were to persist, I would take an ibuprofen tablet (e.g., Advil), because hayfever is an inflammatory disorder and ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory drug.

Also, try washing your face and hands and changing your shirt after you've been outside, keeping windows shut, avoiding rubbing your eyes, drinking caffeine, and drinking lots of water.  You can also use artificial tear drops to wash out your eyes and saline spray to wash out your sinuses.  Those contain no drugs.

Sometimes, they just outright deny everything even when the evidence is infront of them to see.

My comment was in response to your second sentence, not your first. ""Why would anyone be bothered by what *insert demographic here* say?"" implied to me a lack of empathy for various groups who are/have been subject to ostracism/stigmatisation/discrimination on a regular basis. Granted you're speaking specifically about breast feeding here, but I made the assumption that you're likely to think the same about other situations?

I guess as to your personal 'pigeon hole' because in my experience folk with those particular attributes are generally the ones who tell others to ""get over it"" when they feel they've been insulted or similar, mainly because young, white men have little to no experience as what it's like to have this sort of attention, derision or insults from people so often. 

For what it's worth, I too am young (just about), white and male and haven't been subject to social abuse. But I can recognise as to why it might be upsetting.

They're offering 11.9% on anything below this, so I'd avoid borrowing anything between ~£6600 and £7,500 as it'll be cheaper (total repayment on £6600 is £8,669.40 vs £8,745.60 for £7,500 borrowed. £7450 borrowed has a total of £9,786.00). 

This will result in a £145 a month repayment. You will need to repay this every month without fail. I suspect this is higher than your current loan repayment amount, but probably not by much. Make sure that  you don't end up going into your overdraft again as a result.

This assumes you have reasonable credit. You should also make sure that you can repay the loan early without penalty. You can probably find similar loans from elsewhere too.

true,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,"Simeone's style is highly tied to a freakish work rate, high pressing, insane fitness, tough tackling, and brutal counter attacks.  If you watched the CL final, you saw what happened to Atleti after 90, and what Mdrid did to them after not chasing the ball insanely for the whole game. Lukaku just does not have those qualities.  I'm not saying he's lazy, but last season at West Brom, he cameo n late in games, after Shane Long ran the defenses off their feet, and Lukaku swept in, fresh, and scored 17, remember, the three he scored against United were all past the hour mark. This year, playing 90 minutes under a possession based style where the work rate is less important, but still demanding, he was very clearly tired coming into January.  The injury layoff alleviated some of that, but he was clearly not the same player in April as he was in October.  His touch has also been erratic at best, and at this stage, it's not liable to improve much.  I like what he brings to the team, I'm simply unsure of whether or not he'll be worth the cost.

As for where he'll go, I'm assuming that if he stays in the PL, he'll go to a top six team, and City and Liverpool don't need him/Chelsea won't sell to a direct rival someone with that much potential, which leaves us, Arsenal, and Spurs.  After what arsenal dropped on Ozil last summer, Gazidis is probably not in the mood to drop the big buck agains, especially considering Lukaku will likely go for 10 mill over their previous transfer record.  Spurs, I'm less certain about, but they'll certainly be in for him

Let's assume that if he leaves the PL, he goes to a team in the CL. So, Germany: He's not going to Bayern, Leverkusen have Kiessling, and don't have the funds, and Schalke probably don't either, plus they have Huntelaar, and Szalai's got potential.  That leaves Dortmund as the only viable german team.

Italy: Juve have a glut of strikers already, He doesn't fit Roma's style either (which is apparently very important to Rudi Garcia), and they prefer Totti as a false-nine, anyway. Napoli have Higuain, so Lukaku would be a very expensive backup.

France: Anybody who can afford him already has a world class striker, and he wants to play.  At his age, wages aren't going to tempt him enough to warm the bench, so he's not going there.

Spain: We've already established he's not going to Atleti, Real and Barca have no need in the slightest, and Bilbao would never even look at him.

So: Spurs, Dortmund, and Everton seem the likely options.  My guess is that Everton is his preferred destination, but Dortmund can best afford him, and may have the biggest need for him.  Immobile alone will not replace Lewandowski.

Beyond narrowing it down to those three, i couldn't say. It really depends on how the books look for us.

Did you miss the bit where I said ""this happens far too often""? Here are three more high-profile examples.

* Norman Bettison (I refuse to call him Sir Norman), accused of lying during the original Hillsborough investigation, resigned when he came under IPCC investigation. [source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20067716).

* The Assistant Chief Officer of Cleveland police resigned while the IPCC were investigating her for bribery. [source](http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/ipcc-response-resignation-cleveland-police-assistant-chief-officer).

* A senior Met officer accused of gross misconduct for involvement in the News of the World phone hacking resigned as soon as the IPCC opened its investigation into him. [source](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/29/dick-fedorcio-resigns-metropolitan-police).

See what I mean? Police officers, often very senior police officers, are using their ability to resign and therefore fall out of the IPCC's jurisdiction to avoid what most people would consider justice.

Ofcourse fishing for such statements is better for sales than bringing actual facts.

Yes Lukaku probably had imagined his transfer to Chelsea diffrently (he now regrets leaving Belgium a little bit too early). Chelsea did a great deal on him, Chelsea was the only team he wanted to be transfered to and he didn't hide that. Ofcourse the competition is tough and over the years and loans, he has become a true professional player who thinks about his carreer aswell next to being ""just"" a fan. 
He was hoping to get his chance last year, and i think the fact that they bought eto'o was a slap in his face (but logical to let him go on a loan instead of for instance Torres with his pay), and so was yet another loan. He has proven himself at Everton (and Everton is no Chelsea i know that) and i understand that from his view he would like some reasurrance that he will get chances, more than anything. 

Now you generalize to all Belgian players. Courtois is understandable i think if you come from playing the Champions League finale, and winning la liga, you would rather not be a sub (again that is from his point, ofcourse for Chelsea it is a luxury problem having both Petr and Thibaut. 
I could continue my rant but i'll stop it here. But then again i'm Belgian so i probably am slightly biased. Altough i think it is more a problem with the quality of our press (wich than get's picked up by other press/reddit, and you all know how telling stories on goes) than with the players.

Imaginary internet points aren't that important to me. Finding out why people somehow think that the Police killing people is ok is.

Also, the down votes started after I had made the post, not after I had made the edits. It was the content they objected to.

But since you asked:

1) ""You're being downvoted because you show an utter disregard for the police.""

I am showing an utter disregard for these Police yes, they used excessive violence on a clearly mentally ill person, used a position known to be potentially fatal to restrain him for too long a period of time and then lied about it repeatedly, going as far as to lie to his family about how he had died. 

And again, this is an ad hominem attack. So rather than debating any of the points I raised, it is an attack on my supposed views on the Police as a whole, which were never raised in this post. 

2) ""I think it is obvious you're a closet racist ""

At no point did I mention race anywhere in here. It is a pure straw man and a totally false inference. It is also an ad hominem attack. The purpose of this is to detract from the actual argument and to try and make me look bad rather than to respond to any of my points.

&gt;David Lambie, 89, was a Labour MP for Ayrshire from 1970 until 1992 and told RIA Novosti that a member of the Conservative Government in the early 1980s leaked information to him about the oil discovery which, Lambie says, the Ministry of Defence, (MoD), has tried to cover-up.

Also BP did do a survey, so presumably lots of people would know about this 'large oil find' and yet none of them have ever said anything, now that really is curious.

And you very quickly see the real motivation for this 'story'

&gt;Lambie agreed that independence, and the resultant closure of Faslane and nuclear submarine operations, could open the door to exploration on the Firth of Clyde.

&gt;“You should be able, once we are independent and negotiating with Westminster, to demand a premium lease on the Faslane base until it leaves,” Sillars added.

&gt;Sillars said that a premium lease of Faslane to the UK Government by the Scottish Government should be made to reflect the oil revenues lost from the Clyde during the period oil exploration did not proceed.

Basically 'there's oil there I promise, we'll all be rich'.

- He made a meal of Chelsea fans bringing and tossing celery at games after which Celery was banned for our fans and never has been allowed again. Most of you wont even understand how big this is to our fans.


- We even have chants specifically calling him a cunt. Used to ring around the Bridge and Emirates, even took them to Spain.

As a lifelong Evertonian I am probably the worst person to ask. The wooden seats, the noise that stamping feet make on the rickety stands and the damp cold of the concourse areas are all part of the Everton experience for me. There is a lot of soul in that old place, a century of tears and ecstasy all bundled up between the terrace houses; but sentimentality doesn't get you anywhere really. 

You can see positives and negatives of moving from other sides- Arsenal being the obvious one, but also look at Southampton. They moved, and couldn't buy a win at their new place for a long time, it took them out of the top flights and into a real battle to survive- but now they are back on top, they have an amazing infrastructure behind them and a growth plan to match. 

If we were to move in the City, I would support the switch- the perfect situation would have been moving to the old Heritage Market site.

true,archon88,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt; Protest vote against the main three parties

If you wanted a protest vote, why not vote for the Greens, who are at any rate less offensive and ignorant? Whatever might be said of their energy policy, it's better than ""nuclear will solve everything"", combined with a nonexistent understanding of what nuclear power involves (this was David Coburn). Their understanding of economics comes straight out of an Ayn Rand novel: deregulate! privatise! government is always the wrong answer!

&gt; Demonstrate dissatisfaction with the EU

Again, there are far more intelligent ways of doing that than voting for a party of incompetent rightwing crackpots. As someone said on /r/scotland, it's a dirty protest, where people have smeared their cells in shite only to realise that they have to live in them.

&gt; Emphasise that uncontrolled immigration is not a sustainable policy

Which is irrelevant, since our country does not have uncontrolled immigration. We are a member of a bloc of states which acknowledges the right of its citizens to free movement between those states. By that logic, we have equally uncontrolled emigration, since British people are free to live and work elsewhere in the EU, and many do.

&gt; You actually agree with their policies / which UKIP policies do you disagree with?

I don't like the politics of division they play to, the politics of ""you know the difference"", which was the most fucking terrifying thing a UK politician has said in recent years. The immigrant-baiting and gay-bashing don't help either &amp;ndash; Farage's opinion on equal marriage in the Clegg debate was something unintelligible along the lines of ""blah blah blah EU evil blah blah force Christians to accept same sex marriage"" &amp;ndash; watch it if you don't believe me. It was a Chewbacca defence of an argument. He also, by the way, blamed the EU for Putin's aggression in the east. Perhaps they also wiped out the dinosaurs and abducted the crew of the Mary Celeste &amp;ndash; the jury is still out.

Their manifestos in the past have been to a large extent nonsense, and have been openly described as such by Farage. In terms of a credible model for how the country should be run, it's hard to maintain the view that they have many policies to speak of, beyond the sort of boilerplate pseudo-libertarian crap that a tenth-rate Randroid could churn out. Even Alan Sked, who founded the party back in the early 90s, wants nothing to do with them. In his view, they're just in it to milk the EU for as much as they can get, while maintaining the political posture of opposing its existence.

ON AVERAGE.

You get nine people on £20k and a banker on £300k.  Average salary among that lot?  £48k, therefore all Londoners are quite well paid and prices adjust accordingly.  See where I'm going with this?

There are still plenty of Londoners who are genuinely struggling.  If service workers (e.g. TfL, teachers, police officers, McDonald's till slaves etc.) are priced out of London and can't afford to live or work there... then what?  That's a disaster waiting to happen.

The UK urgently needs to decentralise away from London.  The US has corporate global HQs all over the country in places I've sometimes never even heard of, Germany has decentralised away from Berlin and has corporate HQs in places like Frankfurt and Munich.  Spain's core corporate infrastructure is actually in Barcelona, not Madrid.  Do these places have any issues?  No, not really.  New York City is more affordable on average than London is at this point.

What about parents who don't receive child benefits? What sort of sanctions will they receive?

If anything this seems like more of an attack on the poor, and pushing the Conservative ideology of doing that, than actually really trying to tackle bad behaviour in the classroom. It is not only demonising the poor by implying only those who's parents receive child benefits can be truants, but it is also further punishing children who may have been born into dysfunctional households, and perhaps starting a cycle of them becoming more disenfranchised with the state and the education system when it is actively making their live worse.

I'm probably on the other end of the spectrum to you, and I know this treacherous blasphemy, but I think having Welsh as a mandatory subject is ultimately detrimental to the Welsh population.. 

I think having Welsh as a mandatory subject is what is holding Welsh GCSE results back, compared to England's. I don't know how it was for you guys, but for me - years 7-9 had 3 welsh lessons a week, 10-11 short course it was 1 lesson a week (If you didn't opt to take Welsh as a GCSE you still had to do the short course which ground my gears quite a bit), all those lessons add up to a lot of time that could be dedicated elsewhere.

I found in secondary school my knowledge of the Welsh Language actually regressed from what I had known in primary school, I was in a class of kids who couldn't give a fuck about Welsh, and I was probably one of the most pretentious little twats when I was aged around 13-16; ""This is not relevant to my live, I will never need to speak Welsh, everyone speaks English, the Language is dying, you can only speak it here and in patagonia, what's the point?"". 

Looking back I realise how immature this was, but, at the time, given my life experiences I drew conclusions, formed my judgements &amp; saw no reason to learn the language, and thought the only reason it was being kept alive was for purely emotive reasons, which didn't compute with my overly rational brain at the time.

Now I'm 21 and I've worked as a teaching assistant &amp; cover supervisor, in both primary &amp; secondary schools, so I understand both sides of the coin, and it is **very** difficult to teach children something they don't want to learn, as well as it is difficult to teach something you don't feel passionate about (this has been more noticeable in primary schools from my experiences, they have to teach the bear minimum, so they learn the bare minimum).

Another issue I've found more prominent in secondary schools is that a lot of children won't have much respect for a Welsh teacher, assuming they got their job just because they could speak a language, but the truth is that they've slogged their bollocks off and worked damn hard for a degree and for their job too...

Tbh I think the whole educational system is pretty fucked up from the foundations to the roof, we keep kids of the same age together, so they're slower to mature because they're not interacting with older people as much. 

We have mixed ability classes, which frustrate children of all abilities because the harder workers/smarter kids feel held back, and the kids that have to really try hard to grasp something can't hold the pace and are left to feel less intelligent. We teach all the kids such a vast amount of information they don't care about, so they don't retain it, we have bulimia learning before exams (German expression, cram too much knowledge in at once and you'll be sick and won't digest it). Furthermore, we teach them how to pass exams, rather actually how to learn by themselves or how to expand on something they're really interested in.. And it really frustrates me, I think we'd be better off having an educational system tailored to children's wants and abilities rather than painting them all with the same brush, I think every child should have their subject times decided by themselves &amp; their parents.

I hope I've not come across as being holier-than-thou, or as having all the answers, or even fully understanding it.. I've talked a bit matter-of-fact-ishly about this, but this is just my opinion from my experiences.

Your problem is your own inability to understand the legitimacy of the other sides arguments. In your first paragraph you slate UKIP's energy policy and libertarian/objectivist economics. Yet UKIP's energy policy (regardless of the ideological reasoning behind it), is workable, will lead to greater energy security and provides the greenest solution to future UK energy needs. Similarly for economics, you mock deregulation and privatisation without any allowance that these may well be the best option; certainly markets provide efficiencies that the public sector doesn't and are a better option than state ownership for practically all non-essential infrastructure and services. 

Just because you disagree with UKIP doesn't make you right and them wrong. At the moment it makes the opposite look true as you clearly do not understand why UKIP hold the views they do. Misrepresenting their views, strawmanning and ad hominem attacks in arguments compound this and reinforce the ""The Left Are Stupid"" stereotypes.

All it does do is reveal that you let your own biases affect your objectivity and imply you are simply unable to engage in a constructive dialogue about the subject. This coupled with your apparent lack of awareness or deliberate ignoring of the political realities of the FPTP system and what this means for UKIP in terms of producing a 2015 general election manifesto reinforces that you are trying to prove you are right rather than to achieve an objective understanding.

You have a correlation. Logically you cannot claim there is causation on this basis, much less that you know the method of causation.

Assuming there was a causal link there would be at least two non-exclusive options, the government caused the unemployment or a rise in unemployment drove out the government. And we cannot prove these are the only options. The quasiperiodic industrial cycles of about 10 years will also come into play.

&gt;

&gt;Wilson began his political life as the [Democratic Unionist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party)'s Press Officer. He served as Press Officer from 1982–1996. In 1981, he was elected as a DUP councillor to [Belfast City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Council), a position that he held until March 2010. Through his membership of the city council, Wilson became the first person from the DUP to serve as [Lord Mayor of Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_Belfast) in 1986/1987. Sammy Wilson stood in East Belfast at the 1982 Assembly elections but was not elected.

&gt;In January 1994, the [Ulster Defence Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Association) (UDA) released a document calling for [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing) and [repartition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repartition_of_Ireland), with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant.   The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. The vastly Catholic and nationalist areas would be handed over to the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), and those left stranded in the ""Protestant state"" would be ""expelled, nullified, or interned"".  Controversially, Wilson called some parts of the plan a ""very valuable return to reality"". He added: ""[it] shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity"".

Energy policy &amp;ndash; let's look at the evidence. [Here](http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/energy-policy-2014-f-20-09-2013.pdf) is the current UKIP energy policy. There's quite a bit of pseudoscience in that document, to be blunt. Anyone who says things like ""there are increasing doubts about the theory of man-made climate change"" does not have much to contribute to a discussion of environmentally-friendly energy production. This isn't because of ""bias"" (that is a classic deflection strategy, and it's a bit tedious), it's because people can't contribute intelligently to a discussion they don't understand, or refuse to understand. The UKIP position does not reflect the consensus of climate scientists, to put it mildly. Their arguments about the economics of green energy are fallacious, because they simply ignore the negative externalities of climate change and other forms of ecological damage. I dispute that a position which wilfully ignores much of the environmentalist argument can be called ""the greenest solution"" to anything.

Libertarian arguments are similarly simplistic. I used to be quite a libertarian, and I even have the Rand novels to prove it. It's a seductive vision of a world in which the ""producers of value"" are esteemed above the lowly masses, who can only consume value produced by others; as a worldview it mostly appeals to disaffected young men (which I was when I identified most closely with libertarianism). It's also simplistic and wrong on many levels. How many functional objectivist societies has the world ever seen? All these policies do in the long run is eviscerate public services &amp;ndash; look at the infrastructure in the US, such as telecommunications, electricity, water, roads and railways &amp;ndash; a lot of it is sub-par for such a wealthy country, to a large extent because of the monopolies that deregulation and crony capitalism tend to produce. The fastest broadband in the US is found where the infrastructure is publicly maintained. In the aftermath of a financial crisis caused to no small extent by epic deregulation of a toxic culture of international finance (Greenspan, Rubin, repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, etc.) perhaps we can entertain doubts about the wisdom of libertarian deregulation without being branded ""stupid leftists"".

Libertarian (or neoliberal, if you will) policies also drive up inequality, which sociologists and psychologists tell us has many negative social consequences &amp;ndash; compare the USA and Sweden, for example. Hans Rosling's presentations are quite informative on this subject. Piketty has argued that, absent central planning and redistribution, the fact that returns on capital are consistently greater than the growth rate of the economy at large will cause inequality to grow with time, because the former benefits only the wealthiest minority; there is no evidence of a ""trickle-down effect"".

Please listen to real economists, sociologists and climate scientists, not these people.

&gt; presenting alternatives somehow undermines them

Presenting a better alternative can indeed undermine the rationale for backing a particular policy. If the alternative is a party which is unambiguously not racist or homophobic, and makes some sort of effort to listen to the consensus of climate scientists and other experts, then I'll take it.

Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselev, a former anchorman of the Channel One Russia is appointed as the president of the new information agency. It is unclear at the moment whether the new agency will include the TV network Russia Today.

&gt;sustaining citizenship and civil society
&gt;promoting education and learning

&gt;bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK

&gt;in promoting its other purposes, helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services and, in addition, taking a leading role in the switchover to digital television.

&gt;The Agreement accompanying the BBC Charter specifies that we should do all we can ""to ensure that controversial subjects are treated with due accuracy and impartiality"" in our news and other output dealing with matters of public policy or political or industrial controversy.  It also states that our output is forbidden from expressing the opinion of the BBC on current affairs or matters of public policy, other than broadcasting or the provision of online services.  The Accuracy, Impartiality and Politics, Public Policy and Polls sections of the Editorial Guidelines incorporate the BBC Trust's code as required under Paragraph 44 (5) of the Agreement, giving guidance as to the rules to be observed in connection with Paragraphs 44(1) to 44(4) of the Agreement.

&gt;Vodafone: Foreign governments use secret cables to tap phones in the countries in which they operate
&gt;Foreign Government Intelligence and Security agencies are able to listen to phone conversations live and even track the location of their citizens without warrants using secret cables connected directly to network equipment, admits Vodafone today 

&gt;The company said that the 29 countries it operates in have different laws that demand that they restrict or block certain access to customers, ***or allow governments to directly access information about them.*** Refusal to comply with those laws was “not an option”, it said, as those countries could then stop them from operating within its borders. 

The pertinent and most applicable part of the article is

&gt;In the UK it is thought that a ""direct access"" pipe ***would be illegal, as warrants must be issued prior to collecting any data.*** But various legislation can grant warrants to intercept data in the interests of national security, to prevent or detect crime or disorder, in the interests of the ""economic wellbeing"" of the UK, to protect public safety or to protect public health.

Well yeah, Spain has massive problems and upon visiting Barcelona in the last two weeks, the ""corporate infrastructure"" you mention is insanely small. If that's Spain corporate infrastructure I worry for their future even more....

The US is completely different, most states have large populations and many of said population lives in the largest state city/capital, which obviously contributes to their cities large growth rates. To ""decentralise"" in the way of the US would mean creating large, functional, corporate based cities all over the UK when our population is less than California and Texas combined, who have 2 large corporate cities, Dallas and LA. 

Germany was divided, as i'm sure you're aware, and Berlin was on the East side. Berlin was also divided by regions of control, us, the USA and the Soviets controlled certain areas. However, the soviets had control of the east (east berlin, dresden) whilst the british had the north west (dusseldorf), the USA had the south (Munich and Frankfurt) and the french had the south east (Mainz). Unsurprisingly, Berlin didn't have the best development, whilst Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt grew massively. After the Berlin wall was knocked down, Germany re-instated it's pre-war capital, despite the 3 british and american run cities being far ahead in their development. It's not that they purposely  ""decentralised"" on the basis of successful economic growth, they were very lucky. 

The UK has London as the main corporate city, backed up by Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds-Bradford.

I guarantee Sterling will leave if he doesn't get regular first team football, there will be huge clubs interested in him if he has another season like 13/14. It wouldn't surprise me if City come in for him this summer if he has a good World Cup due to their homegrown issue and they're lacking in the winger position atm.

If we buy Pedro then he's more of a Suarez replacement (and no I'm not saying Suarez is leaving zzz).

If we had ANY striker other than Aspas we would have beeen able to rest Suarez last season.. Borini and Lambert will let us rest Suarez/Sturridge more.

Right now, I wouldn't want to sell him unless I knew I could get a decent replacement, because although he doesnt rank among the top defensive midfielders in the world he would be a starter for us in our current roster next to Matic, which says more about our quality in that position more so than it says about him.

But it's not done willynilly like this, it's well thought out and takes things like habitat fragmentation and recovery times into account. 
Clearing can often do more harm than good, and it only takes very small amounts of disturbance for biodiversity to be significantly effected by habitat fragmentation, especially within invertebrate populations. 
Simply because this is a relatively small area doesn't necessarily mean it's not caused significant impact on the local habitat.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; I dispute that a position which wilfully ignores much of the environmentalist argument can be called ""the greenest solution"" to anything.

I tried to have a discussion about climate change in this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/27h6h7/five_myths_about_ukips_victory/

But got downvoted by zealots who ignored the questions and arguments I put forth because they weren't in keeping with the ""believer"" doctrine and simply downvoted for pointing out the inconsistencies of their position. Another reason to vote UKIP in case you were still looking for them.

I take the pragmatist perspective on climate change i.e. that green solutions are viable where they make a positive net difference. At present, nuclear represents the most effective means of delivering future UK energy needs in the greenest fashion. UKIP are the only party advocating the level of nuclear expansion required to meet anticipated future energy needs, so whether they believe in anthropogenic climate change or not is irrelevant to the outcome. 

As for your views on libertarianism, what do you think capitalism is? True there has never been and will never be a ""functional objectivist"" society, but the degree to which a society is libertarian has a general correlative association with its GDP, quality of life and other barometers of success.

And if you want to talk about inequality in the same breath you need only look at the quality of life indicators for the poorest in more libertarian societies (including both Sweden and the USA) against more authoritarian societies to see the shortfalls of relying on equality as the main indicator of social progress. Libertarianism is not the same thing as neo-liberalism.

&gt; If the alternative is a party which is unambiguously not racist or homophobic, and makes some sort of effort to listen to the consensus of climate scientists and other experts, then I'll take it.

Just because the media isn't focused on trying to find racism in other parties as much as it is with UKIP doesn't mean that other parties are unambiguously not racist. As for listening to the consensus of climate scientists, how do you square that with recommending Green as a protest vote with their stance on nuclear?

Your method for calculating standard of living makes no sense either, if all fixed costs are the same, and London is more expensive, then surely, standard of living should be *less* considering it means a) less green spaces (more demand usually fuels supply which has to come from somewhere) and b) less disposable income.

true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"&gt; And scientific research is the only available option to you? And it is the only thing you can do between now and the day you retire?

Obviously not. I did a PhD and am now working in industrial research and development. I obviously had the opportunity to *not* go to university. In that case, however, I would have been unemployable due to respiratory and musculoskeletal issues that rule me out for most unskilled jobs.

&gt; You could very easily gain some income elsewhere before becoming a scientist if it's what you want to do.

Actually, I did spend a year on an R&amp;D industrial internship before university. However, it paid £10500 (2004). Luckily, I was able to live with my parents and save up much of that towards my university course. But even on a much, much cheaper fees regime than currently in force, it was a massive struggle to pay for university.

&gt; Just because you can't become a scientist before age 25 doesn't mean you can't be a scientist.

Scientific researchers' best work is usually carried out before the age of approx. 35 (in Mathematics, a researcher's most groundbreaking ideas will usually be introduced before the age of 27-ish). This is because neuroplasticity decreases with age, reducing the ability of the brain to establish the kind of ""out-of-the-box"" cross-linking connections between concepts, memories and ideas.

So it's actually very important to efficiently get *young* people into science if we want the UK to continue to be at the forefront of global scientific research and development. But we also need to offer opportunities to the *right* young people. I'm really worried that the current tuition fees regime is scaring off a lot of very intelligent people from entering scientific research.

So, suppose that I want to enter scientific research. That means that *before* I can work on any of my own ideas, I need to spend 3 years on an undergraduate course (£27000 in fees alone), 1 year on a masters course (£10000 in fees alone), and 4 years on a PhD course (hopefully supported by a pitiful stipend from RCUK if I'm really lucky). On top of the £37000 in fees, I'd have to find 4 years worth of living expenses.

Find a job that an 18-year-old with only A-levels can get that will pay enough to house, feed and clothe her while allowing her enough disposable income to *ever* save up £60000.

So the problem with drugs is not the suppliers but the consumers? The reality is there is demands and wants for lots of things, doesn't mean there should be a supply for them (child porn for example). Not to mention the fact that in **most** cases it is the supply that creates the demand (or they have a somewhat dialectical relationship), hence why these businesses need to advertise etc. and persuade (though a multitude of psychological and social pressures employed by the advertising industry) people to purchase them

betting shops are disgusting enterprises, they precisely target the poorest areas with shops and advertising campaigns knowing they can offer a false consolation to the oppressed creature, as easy targets off which to profit. Of course the 'solution' to such betting is not bans etc., but an eradication of the causes upon which their demand is built, hence their solution is analogous in that respect to religion stated here in this ever misunderstood quote from Marx:

*Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.*

*The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.*

*Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower.*

The ones that were around our Victoria building were mostly eastern Europeans, one of the guys I worked with, being a polyglot decided to try and chat to two of them one day.  They arrived at the bus terminal (Victoria is a fairly major London bus terminus, it has coaches going all over Europe) and simply couldn't find work or housing, their friends who had promised to help them didn't, they get enough money begging / steeling to feed their addiction.

People forget that a *true* alcoholic would step over their own first born just for a sip.

&gt;The problem with these spikes are that they're setting a dangerous 'not on my doorstep' precedent, a way of seeing rough sleepers as vermin that need to be run out of town.

I don't think it's remotely unreasonable for someone to simply say *not my problem, move along* I know that is what I do, the most I've ever done to help would be some pittyful donation, normally feeding the addiction, rather than treating the cause.

I know I want to work in buildings that do not have secluded unsafe spots.

Realistically doing something helpful is so time consuming and thus expensive, I'm not going to do so, out of all the outraged people here, how many have even volunteered one shift in a soup kitchen, statistically we know this is going to be less than 1% of the general population!

The other problem is who realistically thinks the government can stop this.  Do we section someone who's drunk?  Lock them up against their will in a secured facility?  If they can't follow the rule of you must be sober to stay in the night shelter, what do you do?  Should we have night shelters that cater specially for the drunk.

Talking specifically about London, if anyone is feeling outraged about this, how about doing something directly, [have a chat with centre point](http://www.centrepoint.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer) some people desperately need mentoring, it will help more than donating hundred pounds.

The problem is many people don't take this help, an addict has to want to quit, you can't force them too.  Even if that means selling their body and sleeping in a puddle of piss, they have to want to change.  The reaction that some (well suited) friends of mine had, when being asked in Soho for some money for the shelter, I simply replied that I know some of the people who work at one, let's go, and I'll make sure you get breakfast (you often have to pay if you've been using the services for a long time) watch how quickly she left in hurry.  Her only concern was getting more &lt;whatever&gt;.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;  the problem is long-term and involves necessary lifestyle changes (eg getting off drugs).

this is just stupid and typical of the kind of notions of homeless people endlessly pumped out by the media and western culture in general to avoid actually trying to understand the problem and how *we* contribute to it, we just blame it on *them*. They aren’t part of *our* society, they are an *other* 

Being homeless is rarely to do with 'lifestyle choices', in cases of drug abuse it's a consequence not a cause of life on the streets. The 75% increase in homelessness in London in the last 3 years you would presumably blame on a concurrent 75% increase in drinking or bad 'lifestyle choices', which isn't true but even if it was it still wouldn’t be getting to the root of the problem (i.e. why people turn to drink anyway) – the cause of homelessness is always economics and one of the many products of capitalist society, its recent increase a result of the present economic difficulties

Like most phenomena the production of homelessness is also an act of reproduction (as it necessarily must be). Homeless people have no voice, there's pretty much no help available, in fact it's been recently outlawed and in most cities the police have been rounding up homeless residents as appendages to an aesthetically pleasing 'clean' city. It's pretty much impossible to get a job being homeless for legal (no house) and *de facto* reasons (you don't have a stable life for regular work), you have little or no rights (no right to vote etc.) and are looked down on by the whole of society and ignored, whilst the concerns in the media are about the trials and tribulations of 'home owners'. Even squatting - which is actually the historic basis for the majority of British property - has now been outlawed. Homeless people are rejected from society, not allowed to live in houses or on the street, they are products of this organisation of society and perhaps its most destitute 'members'.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"I don't want you to think I believe it wouldn't be a shame to lose the Welsh language and culture. I actually quite like the fact I can speak Welsh fluently as an Englishman, despite not often speaking it these days as I only live in Wales for a short part of the year.

Certainly not saying your worries, or the worries of other Welsh people are wrong, it stands to reason that as more non-Welsh move to Welsh areas, the Welsh language will get less and less use. 

Unfortunately I'm not sure I see what else can be done personally, the Welsh language gets a lot of help in my opinion (with it being compulsory in schools, documents/signs being in both languages and so on.) but realistically what else could be done, it's not like English people could be banned from moving to Wales.

Do you have any opinions on ways to prevent the further decline in the language and culture? I'd be interested to know more about your opinions.

tbh I don't think it's got anything to do with what rich people want, what about what homeless people need? It's this typical mentality of 'this city is for me, these streets of for me' in which any *other*, the poor and homeless are stains to be removed and cleansed. 

It's the same with projects of 'regeneration' and gentrification which is about removing poorer residents and 'undesirables'. The city isn't constructed as a place where people need to live, but an aesthetically pleasing image to consume and sell to the rich, creative class, capital and tourists. Poorer residents and the homeless are thus appendages to 'the city', which both in their own way need to be destroyed - on how for homelessness [here](http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2014/feb/homeless-charities-call-caution-over-police-crackdown-londons-rough-sleepers) and for poor residents [here](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/adam-robertson/politics-of-regeneration-in-euston#.U0-VJyyFkNs.twitter). The British are doing slowly what the French did fast, they are disposing the poor to outer suburbs out of sight and mind to wallow and decay in the banlieue's to reverse white flight, and to 'regenerate' a now cleansed city. That project is symbiotic with the removal of other 'undesirables' such as the homeless.

Of course perish the thought that we should ever actually aim to combat the reasons **why** homelessness exists at all. It's a reality of capitalist societies and the omnipotence of private property rights over human life. It is unthinkable to suggest that perhaps those living in these rich flats cause homelessness in their wealth accumulations. The rich caused the crash of 2008 since which homelessness has increased in London by 75% and then they complain when they get people living near them (or even seeing them). Similarly the land enclosures in Nigeria or India are privatising the commons for resource extraction thrusting millions into cycles of poverty and exploiting the land they once used. The state enters to mediate this negative consequence of capital accumulation, not to get to the root, but to negate the effect, the poor, who are displaced into massive shanty towns, disciplined and pacified of course but what they would really like to do it simply - like in the UK - kill them, eliminate them completely. The 'problem' is reproduced as long as its real cause goes unquestioned, as long as its real source reproduces itself, which is does without question.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Why should the terrible life of a homeless person be allowed to ruin someone else's quality of life?

this is exactly the kind of aloof mentality that makes it impossible to deal with the real causes of homelessness. The idea that the life of homeowners is worth more than that of the homeless. That the city and its streets are 'for us' not for *them*. So that homeowners inversely become the *victims* when force to look upon the filth of the homeless – those that have everything never have enough

So your life is ruined because you smell some piss and that justifies possibly killing a homeless person? (thousands of homeless die in the winter, shelters such as this save lives) – as a moral principle I would support extreme uses of violence to stop evictions into the streets of the homeless since their life is higher than anything argued against their shelter here, but it’s typical that you equate their life as as worthy as momentary disruptions in your sense of smell, the oppression of having to pass *them* in a hallway justifies a multitude of terrors from rape to death

The UK has the most billionaire's per head in the world - we should expropriate their wealth and redistribute it. There 'right' to wealth is not higher than the right to life or shelter (that's without questioning the origins of their wealth, i.e. exploitation). If you have two houses whilst people go without shelter then the homeless should be able to occupy 'your' house. Squatting - recently made illegal - is actually the basis of the majority of property in this country. Property rights should be based on occupancy and use (defined socially), if you don't use or occupy a piece of property someone else should have the right to it. The lack of that freedom is responsible for pretty much all the social ills, un-freedoms, exploitation and domination throughout the world causing wars, famines, racism, economic crisis’, states and so on.

&gt;It's not my fault their homeless

how do you know that? Of course the easy notion is 'it's their fault for being homeless blah'. The reality is the 75% increase in homelessness in London is a direct result of the economic crash. The homeless are the victims of the rich, the capital accumulators who's success come at the expense of others from the food bank uses to the homeless, whilst as we see [the rich have never been richer](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/10095574/Super-rich-get-richer-while-everyone-else-gets-poorer.html).

That's the issue isn't it.  To be honest, I'd like to have some kind of three strikes system for addicts.  No idea how it would be fairly and safely implemented.  You would then be shipped to a kind of open prison system, which would have varying stages of isolation, the highest level for those who are still using, the problem comes with human way of doing that, I would say you force cold turkey, similar to how many private firms operate facilities in Thailand.  Once clean, the person is tagged, allowed out during the day, but not evenings, mandatory testing.

How much would that cost!  The problem is most homeless people have no one who supports them, hence their predicament.  No one wants to pay for that.  We'd rather pay for more front line health or better funding for schools or anything else.

The rising population in London is a very difficult one, as many of them are recent migrants, migrants are often more likely to fall victim, because they lack local support.  I appreciate how useless observations of an affluent Londoner are, but all the homeless I interacted with around Victoria were not speaking English or rather not willing to.  [I don't think it can be ignored, we know that Romanians were responsible for a massively disproportionate amount of begging offences.](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-romanian-crimewave/18207) I'm dancing around the issue as best as I can, but even channel 4 fact check, which I don't think is unfairly biased on the matter, spells it out clearly, a massively, hugely disproportionate amount of such crime is connected directly to immigration we've seen.  So to be honest, I can very much sympathise with pushing the problem on elsewhere.

&gt; it won't be as easy to move them on. This isn't a problem that will just go away.

It is in a way, make London less attractive.  Try and have a scheme which better funds our homeless shelters, meanwhile crack down heavily on begging.  In London where a pint frequently costs £4.80, begging for loose change is going to be a lot easier than in many other cities.  I've been told that begging from drunk people is better, as often you get someone sympathetic enough to give you more money.

If you turn the question round on itself.  Why should a small area around Victoria, pay for the problems of Romania?  A lot of people gravitate to the city, homeless services prioritised for those that have lived there.  In a way I can see why, if I had to choose a UK city to be homeless in, it would certainly be London for me.  

This to me is the core of the issue, we simply don't care about the mentally ill, the addicts enough to do anything.

&gt;On the question of whether the UK uses direct-access pipes, Vodafone's Deadman said such a system would be illegal because Britain did not permit agencies to obtain information without a warrant. The law does, however, allow indiscriminate collection of information on an unidentified number of targets.

Note that this is not a denial, I don't suppose he even knows if the UK does use these cables without special clearance. 

To me those things, direct access cables and indiscriminate collection, sound like practically the same thing just done via different methods. Both allow indiscriminate spying with no limits on the number of targets. 

It like when they collected images from random people's webcams, [the legality was uncertain but they say that they'll deal with legality once the apparatus is developed.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo) 

Vodafone can't do anything if they are legally obligated so it's not them I'm blaming. 

It's not potential law breaking that should disturb people, GCHQ insists it never broke the law. What should disturb us is that they are able to use 'indiscriminate collection of information on an unidentified number of targets' and not in fact break any laws. Does anything scream 'lack of oversight' more than that? These people have no legal boundaries and they like it that way. If they do have any legal boundaries they use another 5 eyes country to make it legal in their country and soy on their citizens for them. Collection of webcam images illegal in the USA, no problem! Just get GCHQ to do it for you. If this is illegal they should be prosecuted. If it's not illegal then we should make it illegal.

In the case of Tasha Lem, when Ms. Kingston proved unavailable, did Moffat change the story and the character? No, all he did was add a line where she asked about Smith's new incarnation. Given that River is established as a regular liar when she has the advantage on information -- as when she pretended not to know her own parents -- this does nothing to weaken the case. 

Watch the episode, and the line of questioning naturally arises: who the hell is this lady, why is she so familiar with the Doctor, and why does the Doctor behave so out-of-character around her? 

If you answer that she's a new character, then this just leads to more questions. Especially given that this is Matt Smith's final episode, her presence doesn't really make any narrative sense.

I used to think we should always sell when our players are overvalued like this, but I've recently switched my thinking and believe it's better long-term financially to keep our top prospects and build the brand - we haven't had a ""talisman"" in years (perhaps Cahill?) who neutrals immediately identify with the club.  Liverpool have Gerrard/Suarez, Chelsea have Lampard/Terry, United have Rooney/Ferdinand, etc.  Maybe building our team around Barkley and turning him into a star on and off the field will result in more shirt sales, more advertisers, and (most importantly) more televised games.  

It's all well and good having a squad of team-players, professionals who quietly go about their game, but there's something to be said for having a superstar in the middle of it all to appear on all the highlights.

true,aderack,troughton,Troughton,"Alex Kingston wasn't available because she has been working on the show Arrow, in the US. 

This is less an issue of fact than of observation and reasoning, though. Regardless of the rationale for why the character was changed, you've got to be blind not to see the script hole for what it is. It's not just a similar character; functionally it's the same character with a different name. 

Aside from River, Tasha is a character unlike any other that has appeared in Doctor Who during its 50 years on TV -- one with a mysterious and complex backstory that Matt Smith's very final episode wastes half of its time dancing around, which just happens to be River's own backstory. One who is described in the exact same terms as River. Her relationship with the Doctor is unprecedented, with the exception of River -- who is written identically. 

If she was not written as River Song, then what are we to make of the Doctor's supposed long history with this character? What dramatic role is that supposed to serve? Or is it just supposed to be a bizarre alienating sequence, where as a final beat in Matt Smith's storyline the Doctor suddenly behaves in a way that nobody is meant to understand?

Why is she able to fly the TARDIS? Why does the Doctor spend so much of the episode impressing her, and being naked, and kissing her? If the character was written as River, we would need no explanation -- because these story elements would build on what was established. If she was never meant to be River, then the presence of these story elements raises many, many questions that distract from the rather important issue of the Doctor's regeneration story.

All of that dialogue about her life-long battle with her inner psychopath, what is the viewer supposed to take away from that? If she was written to be River, then moments like this are established character beats that the story can meaningfully use or build on. If she was written as a new character, then this is the first that we have heard of this background -- so instead of a meaningful riff on an established character beat, this becomes lengthy exposition about a one-off character in whom the audience has no emotional investment. If she was written as an original character, then just about every scene with Mel -- er, I mean Lem -- falls flat on a dramatic level and eats up precious screentime. 

Regardless of whether or not she can still be read as River in the end, her character, her presence, and her role in the story make no editorial sense unless she was written as River Song. Why else would the episode be written as it is? 

If there is a River Song shaped hole in a story, with a character who is River Song in all but name, in an episode where River Song would naturally have cause to appear, where the new character's presence raises untold distracting questions that would not exist if she were in fact River Song, and wastes a large amount of time that would not be wasted if she were River Song, where her presence distracts from the much more important issue of the Doctor yet River Song's presence would in fact add to the Doctor's story, and it is known that the actress who normally plays River Song had other high-profile commitments at the time that the episode went before cameras, the conclusion that the character was written as River Song is not just plausible; Occam's Razor makes it very difficult to argue against on a rational level. Though if you would like to attempt an argument, be my guest! Speak to me on the level of observation and reason, not what someone may or may not have stated in an interview. Base your conclusions on your own judgment, instead of passing off that responsibility to someone else.

The actual matter of debate here is, despite the change of actress and character name, whether or not the character can still be read as River. I say it's a very plausible reading, and for all of the reasons that I've stated it makes more sense of the story than if she weren't (and broadly speaking makes it more of an enjoyable experience, as opposed to the bewildering one that it becomes if we assume they're different entities)  -- though it's certainly inconclusive. 

As established on-screen, besides the change of actress and name is there a compelling argument for why Lem is unlikely to be River Song?",1,1402166114,null,0,false,0,ci1m7ee,t3_27js6q,t1_ci1m7ee,t1_ci1kf8c,null,1434136148,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
true,gavin19,newcr-1,,"No one disagrees on that. We all want Barkley to stay because he will almost certainly get better as the years roll on, and it'll be financially better for us. 

Most bookies have us pegged for 7th this coming season, and 6-7th I think is as good as we can do when up against the financial clout of Chelsea/Utd/City et al. That's for the forseeable future. The only times teams have been able to breach the top spots is when they got a rich backer, like Chelsea (Abramovich 2003), City (Mansour 2008) and Liverpool (Henry 2010)

The thing is, the gist of the article was also said of Rooney. Loves the club/local lad/build a team around him etc, but we all knew he was going to go.

We are in better shape now than 10 years ago, but financially we're in much the same position. In a few years, if a Bale-esque bid comes in for Barkely, there is simply no way he'll refuse it. The days of players going to clubs for considerably less money (or staying put) because they love them (Shearer/Le Tissier, even Gerrard), are all but gone. The elite players can simply make too much money to turn down.

Also, we relied quite a bit on the loan players we had last season. That was great, but loanees are no substitute for permanent players who're going to be around for a few years and know they're investing their efforts into potential benefits in seasons ahead.
