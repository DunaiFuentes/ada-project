The dealer said so in a statement when this first blew up.

&gt; Furthermore, do we know they were in the market for a 928, like you say?

Yes, because as I say they called the dealer to enquire about the car before knowing the numberplate.

Why do you keep talking about Falklanders getting mad? You seem to lack even a basic understanding of what is going on here and you just keep demanding others spoon feed you your facts.

&gt; As someone else has said, many of the cars with this number plate combo will have been scrapped as it is an old-style number plate. This only makes it even more likely that the car was selected deliberately, as even fewer were about, so the odds of coincidence drop further.

No it doesn't. The car exists and was for sale. The odds of it being bought are not high. The odds of it being bought by somwone looking for a 928 - again not high. The odds of top gear buying it when it was on sale and they were looking for a 928 - still not high.

&gt; Finally, my evidence is both more than the nothing (and insults to boot) that Morsrael provided, and the discussion was more constructive. Seeing as Top Gear are claiming they're innocent, if you're having problems with my claims, you either need to refute them or provide evidence in Top Gear's defence.

People need do no such thing. The arguments you bring up have been ripped to shreds multiple times in the past months, if some people are getting insulting after reading the same shit again and again it's hardly surprising. To them you just look like a troll or an Argentine sympathiser.

&gt; Or can let it out

Do you think council's will look fondly on people sub-letting their spare room to pay the difference?

&gt; relocate 

Actually people usually can't, there's something of a shortage of housing being built at the moment if you hadn't noticed and it's been that way for a couple of decades now. People have no where to go. This is demonstrated by the fact that in the first six months of the policy only 4.5% of people impacted downsized.

&gt; have family return home

I assume you mean move back in with the parents? What if that isn't an option for someone? The bedroom tax/removal of spare room subsidy (call it what you will) doesn't allow for individual circumstances, it assumes you are obstinately refusing to move as a matter of choice *despite not having anywhere to go.* 

Probably worth noting, you can get exemption if you're a pensioner or live in a caravan. So that's nice.

You can read a summary of the interim report from DWP [here].(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/329949/rr882-evaluation-of-removal-of-the-spare-room-subsidy-summary.pdf)",0,1417036199,null,0,false,0,cmdw1iu,t3_2nhtgt,t1_cmdw1iu,t1_cmdto8c,null,1425826643,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

When I last tried to use my data connection properly I found it a struggle to get a 4G signal in the major town I was in, and switching to 3G gave me a stronger signal but crap performance due to congestion. This was in one of the very first towns that 3 launched 4G in, and it's clear that they don't have as many cell sites as EE do

I had an EE SIM that had 15GB of data on it for free - same spot, instant blazing 4G signal and excellent performance.

3 are cheap, and they are the only main network to do unlimited data, and the network is likely to be much better than Vodafone or O2. That's about all they have going for them. But if the unlimited data went away I could see a mass exodus happening as people only put up with 3's many issues in return for that. I can see why they aren't investing - they are choosing to be cheap and the money isn't coming in for EE-style levels of quality - but it's good enough for now.

MBNL for 4G is simply a site/power/backhaul share with both companies contributing their own equipment and antennas. I believe Vodafone and O2 have a similar partnership now but nothing as close as MBNL is

This means that EE can spend megabucks and bathe areas in coverage whereas 3 can do one or two sites and call it a day. As I said, they clearly don't have piles of money to build aggressively like EE are (and the year or so that EE had as a headstart hasn't helped), but where EE is, 3 will probably follow.

3 are claiming that a ton of towns will have 4G by the end of the year, I'll be surprised if that really happens. At least in Cornwall both networks are as bad as each other, there's non existent 4G from both.

That one provision is for people who would have been here for 5 years, had they come here prior to the 1st of May 2006. That's why it states ""been"" and ""ending on or after"". 

It's the provision for those already in the country at the time of the law coming into effect, so the law change wouldn't affect them. It's very common place in law.

The law was changed to require them to be here 5 years, prior to the child's birth, for that child to gain citizenship. 

Your child, in your example, would be applicable, if born after the 5 years. If it was born during the 5 years, it is not entitled to British Citizenship. Had you been here, prior to the 1st of May 2006, and had your child then or after, whilst fulfilling the 5 years, your child may be entitled, as per the exception criteria.

Some of you may or may not be familiar with the concept of 'churnalism'. A term coined by Nick Davies, which effectively notes that this kind of content is passively created by the 'journalists' creating it, rather than actively doing so. In the case of the traditional printed press, this typically refers to things like re-hashed press releases, advertorials, and such like. 

In the case of the online media, this typically manifests itself with shitheaps of websites like the Daily Mail, Buzzfeed, and the Huffington Post re-hashing other peoples' content, and wrapping it up in SEO-heavy clickbait headlines to get people to come to them rather than the original authors.

But I digress. The event happening in Ferguson is creating acres of articles, press coverage, and hours and hours of footage from credible US organisations. All churnable. All can be used pretty much verbatim, because it is in English, and requires no translation. The US is a familiar culture and it's an interesting enough story to keep people's attention. More churn justified.

Meanwhile, our press and media is going to pot. Proper, unsexy investigative journalism, takes time, is not exciting, but can uncover genuine stories that are of genuine public interest. It saddens me that the Ferguson story is getting more column inches [than this kind of thing](http://www.exaronews.com/articles/5415/met-trawls-files-on-200-missing-boys-in-murder-probe-into-vips).

* Rogers is still ""ahead of schedule"" according to the plans that were agreed upon between him and FSG when he was signed. 

* Sure last year was a great teaser but Rogers had a much better team to work with: A fit sturridge, and on form Suarez, and teammates who were playing full of confidence. 

* We have none of that this year so it shouldn't be a huge shock that we are losing despite spending so much in the summer.

* We were never going to replace Suarez and we would say ""oh we know that"" but we seemingly hope that we would maintain form without our best two players (forwards at that)... 

I don't know... we should be beating teams like palace and ludo definitely, but our team is not very strong at the moment in any way so I guess our overall record isn't shocking. We are still going through a transitional period with rogers and you cannot say that one year with a world class player completely brought us out of the rebuilding phase.

That said, draw or win doesn't change a great deal. And there were some good performances from Lucas and Allen in midfield, Lambert was pretty good up front, Hemderson took his goal well and played intelligently, and Sterling came to life in the second half.

Tonight his decisions were awful. I didn't even really have a problem with the lineup other than somehow Johnson got in over Moreno. He insists on playing Gerrard when he's just a passenger now. Also he refuses to change his system other than two things and the diamond being the second he rarely plays anyway so tonight it was a huge surprise to see it and now it seems unless it's the 75th minute or later he refuses to make a substitution no matter how the game is going. Last thing also being Lallana and Coutinho never got in. You'd think you would want a little creativity but the last few games it seems Rodgers is having none of it. Can can't get a game since scoring against Chelsea is really annoying too.

I mean we're lucky there was 1 point. The first goal by Lambert was a complete fluke (2nd one was nice though) and yet again what the heck is Rodgers doing in training, there was 5 men around Terziev yet he still got the header for the goal as everyone else just watched. I mean after the Palace game it was annoying but drawing that was it is just becoming a joke. 

Only problem with sacking Rodgers is who is there out there now? Best option would probably be trying to bring Kenny back until the end of the year then try to bring in a better manager. I mean Rodgers spent so much money in the summer (A lot of it on guys with potential yet again) and about 86 million of it was on the bench or not even in the squad at all. If he doesn't have Suarez and Sturridge up top he's exposed as a manager who can not organize a defence to save his life and has his midfield get run over no matter how much he spends on CBs. I don't think he can save the club. I think he knows it, the players know it and the fans know it.",0,1417038473,null,0,false,0,cmdx8b8,t3_2nilmb,t1_cmdx8b8,t3_2nilmb,null,1425826089,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2

Lambert up top on his own rather than play Borini as well, which allowed us to get another midfielder and stop all their runners for the most part.

3. He can swap out players that does many individual errors? If you want to blame the players more than Rodgers, why aren't Can, Lallana, Coutinho, Borini etc even getting of the bench today? Maybe he could try to play other players when the XI he usually starts plays crap 95% of the time.

No, the cover up is continuing under this administration and the buck stops with Cameron.

1. Cameron was presented on live television with a list of the Elm Guest House ""patrons"" (which includes many documented paedophiles) and Cameron brazenly dismissed the list as a ""gay witch-hunt"".

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9663927/David-Cameron-ambushed-with-paedophile-list-by-Phillip-Schofield-on-This-Morning.html

2. The Government's first appointment to head up the Parliamentary Paedophile Enquiry, Lady Butler-Sloss had an obvious conflict of interest (her brother, a former attorney-general was a documented paedophile). She was forced to resign.

3. The Government's next appointment, Fiona Woolf was also conflicted (due to her close relationship with Leon Brittan against whom a number of paedophile/cover up accusations have been made). She also had to resign.

4. So after several months, this enquiry has yet to start because there's nobody in charge. How convenient.

5. The Wanless report into the missing ""Dickens"" paedophile dossier from when Leon Brittan was Home Secretary concluded that there was ""no evidence of a cover-up"". Right. What they didn't tell you was that the person leading the enquiry, **Peter Wanless did not have (DV) security vetting** and was therefore not allowed to read any relevant confidential Home Office and MI5 documents covered by the Official Secrets Act. In fact they would have been breaking the law by giving him the documents! Total whitewash.

Again, I should avoid talking about it to anyone, reading interesting things about it, sharing things I enjoy about it, commenting on it, discussing the nuances of it, and otherwise cut it out of my life rather than ask someone else if they could kindly not spoil things for me?

I mean, obviously if you put something in the title that tells me something in the thread is going to spoil a new development for me and I choose to go in the thread anyways, then I have no one to blame but myself.  However, I think I am fully within my right to come into this subreddit and discuss things that have already happened on the show and share my love of it with others.

Keep in mind, I am not saying no one can discuss this. Is it really that much problem to create a spoiler free title? I've already suggested one that would tell you a) what the thread contains and b) makes people who don't want to know the information aware they probably don't want to look inside. Is that really so difficult?

Also, I'm sorry if it comes across as complaining, but I have as much right to voice my opinion and make suggestions in this subreddit as someone who doesn't care if things get spoiled. Nowhere in the rules or description of this subreddit is it said that readers should expect spoilers. In fact, one of the rules of this subreddit is:

In order to compare apples with apples I want to know what the UK system could achieve for them if used correctly. I can then compare this to the Australian system.

It does lead onto whether people should be obliged to let out a room to a stranger and share their home in order to counter changed in state policy. Nevermind if there's anyone available to take the room to begin with. And let's remember, if you've got two teenage girls (say 14 and 15) they have to share a room now to make space for this lodger, as the logic of the policy proscribes same sex under 16s to share a room. Would you want to rent a room in that house?

In in terms of getting people to downsize, this is the whole rationale of the policy, so hadn't the policy been a failure in that case? Minimal seems like an understatement.

On the final point, two comments. Firstly, moving home can be a very expensive process - settling up utilities, any van hire costs, rental overlaps. Goes on and on. If you've suddenly lost £14 a week in real terms income and earn little enough to get housing benefits to begin with moving isn't going to be too viable an option.

Second, it's disingenuous to suggest that there is a wealth of housing stock available to these people.

A lot of people end up dropping out due to financial issues - many students are older, with children, and it makes everything that bit more expensive and complicated. It's hard enough as a single person just looking after myself. 

The huge need for nurses comes from a lack of ability to retain people in the profession as opposed to a lack of people wanting to join - I can attest that nursing degrees are incredibly competitive and you have to do loads of tests and interviews in order to get in. I would think it's a mixture of long, unsociable hours; relatively poor pay and a stressful/emotionally draining work environment. The regulators breathing down your neck and the looming threat of being sued or struck off if you make a mistake isn't exactly a bonus, either.

The same should apply to trainee teachers, I think - you are literally teaching a class full of children half the time, you should at least be getting what a TA is paid for that work.

Earl Silverman in Canada did set up a series of male safe houses and he received the death threats, public ridicule and received so little funding that he had to declare bankruptcy and ended up killing himself.

People have even lobbied the government to not fund campaigns against male victims of domestic violence as it risked taking the focus away from the ""real victims"".

It is one thing if someone posts ""X would be awesome for the next Doctor"" thread. Those pop up all the time, even when a regeneration is not known to be coming. And yes, sadly I do have to completely avoid the BBC site with regards to Doctor Who.

I would also argue that it is not the writer's intent, but rather Marketing's attempt to attract more viewers that lead to such things being teased. I doubt most writers have any input whatsoever into what goes into the teasers. 

Again, many of us *are* able to easily avoid this particular information. You may consider it a ""fool's errand"", but if the title of this thread was more carefully worded (which, to my knowledge, requires no extra effort on your part. If I'm somehow wrong here, let me know.), I would still be blissfully unaware of whether or not the Doctor may regenerate next season.

By the way (and this is totally just me being pedantic here), whether or not something is a spoiler has nothing to do with if you can avoid hearing about it or not. For example, I was not able to watch 6th Sense until after it was released on video. The spoiler ending, however, was the biggest thing being talked about in my social circles. This does not mean that when someone literally told me the ending that it wasn't a spoiler. It simply means that when I finally was able to watch the movie, it had significantly less impact to me when that was revealed. The genie cannot be put back into the bottle. Sure, the rest of the movie was enjoyable, but I lost out on what was arguably the best part of the movie simply because someone didn't take two seconds to say ""Hey, did you see 6th Sense yet?""

&gt;The __Heckler &amp; Koch G36__ is a [5.56×45mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO) [assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle), designed in the early 1990s by [Heckler &amp; Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch) (H&amp;K) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) as a replacement for the heavier [7.62mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO) [G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3) [battle rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rifle).  It was accepted into service with the *[Bundeswehr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeswehr)* in 1995, replacing the G3.  The G36 is [gas-operated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-operated_reloading) and feeds from a 30-round detachable box [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearm\)) or 100-round [C-Mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_C-Mag) [drum magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_magazine).

I found the dealer in question, but again, the burden of proof is on you, the person claiming these facts, so I shouldn't have had to. I didn't find anything about Top Gear enquiring about the dealer before knowing the number plate, and seeing as I proved, in my last post, that dealerships don't mind posting the plates of their car (so people can check insurance, I'd guess), and seeing as you haven't even mentioned that part of my post, I'm not going to just take your word for it here. Where did you get the idea that they went ahead with the dealer without knowing about the number plate?

&gt; The odds of it being bought are not high.

Exactly. I don't think you understand the importance of the statistics here: if the odds are not high, that plays into the hands of my theory, not yours, as it makes the odds of a coincidence occurring, as you said, ""not high"".

You've also ignored the entire section where I try and fathom the turn of events which would cause Top Gear to collectively buy this car, transport it to the islands, and only when they're attacked, realise the significance of the number plate. There is simply no way they didn't know beforehand - someone would have brought it up. How can you deny that?

This was the run up to Christmas and they had special cards that said you had to wait 48 hours and not 24 to go pick it up. Worse still, this meant that the 48hour period hit into bank holiday territory. Bit annoying.

What ultimately made matters worse, was when he said to me that I could pick up the item ""tomorrow"". I looked at the card confused and asked him, very politely (I felt at the time that I had the right to be pretty pissed off but having a go at him wasn't going to make the parcel magically appear) if I could pick it up tomorrow or if I had to wait until (I think) Friday.

His attitude took a nose dive. He said ""Look mate, I know you're pissed off..."" and I said ""I'm not, I just want to know when I can pick it up"". Like in OP's post, he then tried to snatch the card off me, except in my case he actually did get it. He then stormed off down the street shouting ""FINE! I'll just bring it tomorrow!"". I stood there stunned, I really wasn't that upset though I felt I had the right to be. It wasn't a big deal, the sorting office was just around the corner and the item wasn't needed for a couple of weeks. I didn't even raise my voice, I just asked him when was the best time to pick it up due to the confusion of him saying 24 hours, the card saying 48 and there being a couple of bloody bank holidays between the two.

But I always like to see a strong/ball-winning player alongside a more versatile player such as Mason or Bentaleb. Therefore, since Capoue is not playing that well recently, I would start Stambouli next to Mason. Then later in the game, sub in Bentaleb  (since he just recovered from injury I wouldn't give him a heavy load of minutes). 

**My thoughts on other midfield options:**

I really want Paulinho to succeed and I think he will do that if he gets more playing time. I think he should be starting in Europe and perhaps the cups.

On Dembele: I love him and he offers a lot in terms of keeping possession and dribbling past people but I just don't think he gives enough in terms of real attacking threat and chance creation. From what I can see, he offers as much overall benefit as Paulinho (perhaps a little more) but he gets way more playing time which could be a mistake I'm not entirely sure.

As a T1D i have spent far to much time over the last 35 years in GPs offices and ERs. Both here and in the US. 

Seriosly. For all its minor faults the NHS dose a fantastic job. 

I rarely deal with triage nurses for T1D. Im prolly unconscious at that point. 

But on those fe occation when I have been In an A&amp;E for other reasons. Triage has been fantastic. People often seem to fail to understand the difference between urgent seriose and emergency as terms. 

Something can require you to be in an ER but not need instant treatment. 

My GP is also pretty darn good. If you want an appointment you ring. He will call you back that day. You then speak to an actual GP about the issue. 

If he needs to see you he will then make an appointment. Basically doing his own balancing of importance. Very often he is able to resolve my issues on the phone call alone. Also as I know the issues can be solved eady without wateing his time on full apointments etc. It dose make him much more available.

The Lotus is mid-engine whereas the other two are front-engine, none share a country of origin, and their only shared characteristics seem to be that they're rear-wheel drive sports cars of a similar year of production.

So really, the joke can simply be based around just Jeremy's car, not the entire series. For the record, I believe the assertion about the numbers in the other cars' number plates being similar to that of the casualties by each belligerent is ludicrous, and I believe that really is a coincidence.

But anyway, only Jeremy's car bore the number plate, so only his car hinged on the joke. In the past, the cars have been bought based on bad reliability for laughs, so it's not outlandish to assert that Clarkson's car was bought for the number plate, and probably a bit of bad reliability too.

Again, I point to [the number plate gag](http://images.dailystar-uk.co.uk/dynamic/1/photos/854000/152854.jpg) they intended to use, to show they weren't above number plate based jokes, and the fact that [Clarkson has driven a 928 before](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/L9pPkq7LtpI/maxresdefault.jpg) (the one he turned into a blackboard), making this the first time Clarkson (or anyone) has driven the same car twice in a challenge or special.

I'm sure the special itself, once aired, will bring its own answers, but until then and unless anyone can bring any unique reasoning to the table, I' sticking to my guns on this one: Top Gear aren't above spending £1500 on a car for a number plate joke.

Rooney is much better defensively than Eriksen (most recent example is the shift he put in against Arsenal) and seems to have better decision making. The fact that you were ignorant of how well Fellaini has been playing for Utd and that you think Eriksen is better than Rooney tells me you don't watch United play. 

Back to the original point of who we think is going to win, you said that Utd have a lot of talent but don't look like a team. They look like more of a team than Spurs do at the moment and have better players, which is (apparently) debatable. So I'll stick with my 2-1 prediction.

Lady Butler-Sloss was made to resign because her brother was the attourney general at the time the initial report came out (the one that disappeared). That was a conflict of interest, and the only reason she resigned. There were no indications he was involved in any way, and for you to label him as a 'documented paedophile' is technically libel.

It's perfectly true that both Lady Butler-Sloss and Fiona Wolfe resigned due to conflict of interest, but we have to face the fact that, by the very nature of this enquiry, it is practically impossible to find somebody in a position to investigate who *doesn't* have a conflict of interest.

1- The abuses were across the board. There are MPs on both sides involved, as well as top Police, barristers, etc. This is not a Tory thing by any means. This is why it is so difficult to find somebody not linked to the establishment to head the enquiry.

2- The report itself is a red herring. You're acting as if this report is the holy grail. There is no evidence within the report itself, just accusations. What do you think will happen if it's found? There is nothing new to be revealed there. Everything it included has been repeated numerous times by the man who first produced it. The media frenzy is all about the report and the possible coverup of it, but nobody seems to be digging into the abuses themselves any more. It's all *'Who covered this report up?'*, when it should be *'Who abused all these children?'*. The whole report fiasco is a smokescreen to take our attention away from the real crime. Everybody wants to punish somebody for the cover-up of the report, but the abuses themselves seem to have been forgotten by the wayside.",0,1417047190,null,0,false,0,cme1ato,t3_2nhkjn,t1_cme1ato,t1_cmdybai,null,1425824119,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's based on averages: you take a (reasonably high) average walking speed, an average ratio of parcels to letters and an average ratio of houses per street and come up with what a postie is expected to do in a shift.  

If they don't meet these automatically generated targets then they are penalised: complete the rest of the round without pay or face missed targets (and therefore no bonus or promotion opportunities).  You could of course just bring back the parcels for delivery next day, but how's that going to help tomorrow's target?  And you get more penalties for bringing things back undelivered.

However, taking parcels back to the depot when there's been no answer at the door incurs no penalty.  Plenty of posties will write up the 'Sorry we missed you...' cards at the beginning of the day or at traffic lights to save time on delivery.  

There were strikes about this in 2007 that lasted two weeks.  I think it's got worse since then.

[""but you seem to live arguing, so have fun!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2nhbqs/ukip_says_babies_born_to_immigrants_in_the_uk/cmdu44b). Coming off the bat, and accusing the other with a 'love' to argue, is hardly polite, patient or courteous. Certainly as there was no mention of your characteristics prior, a sly instigation of ad hominem for the sake of tu quoque.

[Selectively quoting for own personal incredulity, with the hopes to obsficating the truth, is hardly courteous either](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2nhbqs/ukip_says_babies_born_to_immigrants_in_the_uk/cmdut14). Let's not play victim of ones own game. I would expect better from a 10p tabloid. 

&gt; Other people can read the text for themselves and decide which of us is capable of English comprehension.

How can that be truly achieved, when you've gone back to edit your comments? There is symbology representing so, with the time of last edit displayed. You're hardly making a polite or courteous gesture there.

&gt; Your fixation with this point of pedanticism is irrelevant to [the] whole subject of this thread and article, which is how kippers perceive Polish people, coming over here, having kids, and affecting the UK.

That's true. It's a good thing it was only just raised. Though I must say, neither is your following fixation. You shouldn't follow up a statement like this with hypocrisy. This whole chain is rather irrelevant to the fact, because of your consistent shifting of goal posts throughout. 

&gt; Grammar is different from spelling, but I wouldn't expect someone who puts a space in the middle of the word ""commonplace"" to know that.

Yes, that's very true, congratulations for making the difference known. Your sentence is at odds with grammatical ruling however, but I guess someone who doesn't understand grammar to be spelt with two A's to understand that. Nor will the education from myself, as you seem rather argumentative for the sake of adamant standing, rather than to achieve factuality through rational discussion. To think including a space between 'common' and 'place' makes the 'word' misspelled is jovial. [For example](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Common_Place_of_Law.html?id=H6Cil7eLCUcC), but I guess I just ""live"" arguing. 

I'll look forward to your hastily researched response, as you look into the matter for the first time, to try and find something at odds with the above. Going by past accounts, it will not take a second reading to find a contradictory statement with your selective quotations edited to distort the facts and to fit a predetermined mindset.

Dembele... He's always been a more laid-back and ""slower"" player; not a high-energy player. Good player, but doesn't fit what Poch wants us to do.

He wants to limit the amount of immigrants coming to Britain but UKIP is in favour of immigration in general.  Nothing he's ever said would reduce the rights of spouses of citizens to come here.

His substitutions are rubbish and are a large part of why we tend to play so poorly at the end of games and why we got scares from the rags and Swansea, we also start off games poorly at times, in fact, Arsenal were the better team at the Emirates until we scored.He doesn't give youth a go, even though he was supposed to be better than Mancini at bringing youth in. His team selections are often questionable and he's quite reluctant to drop players who have been playing poorly, although I'm going to hold my tongue on this one for now as his confidence in the players may pay off in the end. He also doesn't field a consistent back four and I think this has really impeded Mangala's adaptation to the English game.

However, despite these problems I'm still quite happy with him and it'd take an awful lot for me to start wanting him to be sacked.

Ludo were attacking a lot down the right side too, which further justifies Rodgers' choice for a defensive player to step in there, instead of an attacking player like coutinho or lallana that wouldn't track back and defend as much as moreno. 

It's basic game-management to try to see out a match. Think back to games last season like Palace where we just kept attacking and ended up conceding goals and drawing; everyone went crazy because Rodgers should have managed the game better by bringing on a defender and making sure we won!

Rather than helping the RN integrate its future naval aviation assets with its new carriers, the USMC will want to use its first production F35Bs for integration in their own fleet of Wasp Class light carriers, to establish their own F35B doctrine.

Or as someone else said Can on for Gerrard would have worked well too because he is more defensively minded than Coutinho would have been.

Danny blames the murder of the child in combat on his superior officer, secretly, as a defense mechanism. But what does a soldier usually aspire to be? A commander, in charge of an army. Throughout season 8, danny is facing the reality that it was actually his fault. You see this first in the classroom where the kid asks if he killed anyone, then he has that outburst at the doctor. In the finale, he meets the kid he killed and finally faces that memory, accepts it, and his ambition takes over and he commands the army of Cybermen to save earth.

Obviously hindsight is always 20/20, but I wasn't a fan of the decision then, and am still not now.

The difference with the way Poch has treated him compared to Sherwood is that Tim brought him in from the cold during a real low point, and showed faith in him.  That confidence, right when his career was petering out, was a big boost to him, and it only ever seems to be in those kinds of situations that he applies himself and makes a difference.  Poch inherited him on a bit of a mantle, and as the only striker over the past 12 months who seemed able to regularly score.  So the situation was different, and without Soldado really pushing him for a starting berth, he began to look lax again.  Plus, keeping him on the pitch when it was obvious he hadn't recovered from malaria fully was a bad move for both Ade and Soldado.

[And this one.](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-priorities-2020/court-auditors-warns-multi-billion-eu-budget-gap-310310) 

The actual report (this was mentioned in the second article) says that part of the reason for the shortfall was member states failing to co-fund projects with the EU because of their own national policies. 

&gt;Many activities and projects are financed from
both the EU and national budgets (‘co‑financed
expenditure’), on condition that both the EU budget
and national budget are available. Austerity measures
in Member States may result in national funds being
significantly reduced or not being available at all to
carry out the actions. Furthermore, the sustainability
of EU-funded actions may also be problematic once EU
funds are no longer available.

As far as I know the UK has not fallen through on the co-financing of any projects so it seems likely that this element of the shortfall is not the UK's obligation and as such it's not at all clear that it will be the UK that may be asked to contribute more. 

[Heres the actual report BTW.](http://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/LR14_02/QJ0614039ENN.pdf) **PDF**

&gt;calculated at the usual rate of Britain’s EU contributions.

Yeah exactly. This is assuming we specifically will be asked to contribute in the first place which is not at all clear (and no recommendations are given by the report) and it assumes we will pay the same proportion of this potential bill as we pay of the current budget which, as they point out, is impossible because there is a cap on EU contributions - this is what the report is worried about, the cap is too low to meet the payments agreed in future years. If we do hit the cap the Telegraph article says our contributions could go over 13 billion. In the absence of an accurate number, assuming the worst and it goes to 13.5 billion that will be about 1.2 billion extra a year for nearly 6 years which adds up, at the very very most to £7.2 billion not £34 billion. The cap could theoretically be increased by as the article helpfully point's out:

&gt; Britain has a veto on going above the maximum payment cap

So we don't face a bill at all. Actually it's the very fact that we don't face a bill and are not already legally obligated to contribute more that is worrying the auditors because the money won't be there to pay the future commitments. The EU may ask for more money, they may find ways to write of the contributions while cutting other budgets or they may go after specific member states who are not named in the report who have failed to meet their obligations on co-funded projects. Who knows? The one thing we do know is that we don't know where the money is coming from, still less that it's coming from the UK.

Either way the report does highlight the fact that the EU is spending too much money on staff and pensions and it's commitment are made years in advance and are increasing every year meaning a rise in the budget is required every year. Hopefully the Commission will take this seriously and start thinking about reducing commitments both to staff and member states and more actively seeking payment from states that fail to meet their obligations.

Negatives:

Mignolet is extremely poor and inspires no confidence;
Gerrard shouldn't really play 90 minutes, although he's much better when not at DM;

I think the same thing will happen now with what happened to Occupy.  The protest works when there is this nebulous faction of people who want something to change.  Some want police to wear body cameras, some want higher gun control, some want congress to change, some want some sort of whole new system that would magically work where everyone is happy and honest.  
However, once the protests begin to get more specific they will dwindle down because not everyone will agree on this one topic.

I think what we all want is accountability.  We want the police to held accountable for not doing their job correctly, we want politicians to be held accountable for taking money from companies in order to bend the law to help profits, we want criminals to be held accountable.

It's worth bearing in mind that some part of this is likely to be part of social hen pecking, rather than directly homophobic. What I mean by that is that people isolate and attack those who are different. It's the exact same thing kids do when they bully others at school, just a little refined. (Animals turn on the different too. As repugnant as out might be it's entirely normal.)

If it wasn't a quality homophobia could be attached to it would be the same behaviour attached to a different quality. A lot of it isn't even consciously spiteful.

&gt;tolerance is a difficult one to actually judge, due to the fact that how people behave and how people say they behave are very different things.

True, but prohibition genuinely does work. I was born in the seventies and what we now describe as casual racism at the time would be shocking in the modern setting. You don't change what's in people's heads, you just stop them opening their mouths and spreading it.

Most people under twenty won't have experienced the sort of causal racism or sexism that was entirely de rigueur when I was a kid. Subsequently they don't internalise and develop those attitudes in the same way.

Homophobia is lagging behind, but the same slow progress is happening. You can't fix disgust or revulsion inside someone's head. You shouldn't even try and frankly you have no right to.

&gt;___Tyranny___ is an American [drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_programming) and [political thriller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_thriller) [web series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_series) that premiered on March 11, 2010 on KoldCast TV.  Written and directed by [John Beck Hofmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beck_Hofmann), the series is centered on a man who, after volunteering for a neurological experiment at [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley) in 1999, finds himself having visions of a troubling future and must understand what the visions mean before that future comes to pass. 

&gt;Hofmann has said that the movies *[Twelve Monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Monkeys)*, *[The Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(1997_film\))*, *[Manchurian Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate_(2004_film\))*, and *Kafka* were influences on *Tyranny*.

For instance, if an Angel's quantum lock is based on sight rather than observation then Toph would have no chance. But then there's that scene with Amy in 'Flesh and Stone' where the Angels choose to be stone because they THINK Amy can see them even though her eyes are shut.  So it's possible that the Angels in the painting are choosing to be stone because they think Toph can see them.
On the other hand if Toph can see them with her stone sense and knows the Angels are a threat then why isn't she just crumbling them rather than taking bits off?  The Angels are stone so they're not bound by the same limitations as blood bending.  And Toph's senses only work if they're in contact with the ground.  If an Angel is fast enough to get to you while you're blinking, does it matter how quickly Toph reacts? Earth benders have to get into a stance to fight effectively.  Can an Angel get to her between steps?  If they know they're being observed through vibration, can they leap at her?

I'll give you another personal anecdote - In May, I had what I thought was a migraine and some of the symptoms didn't clear up so I made an appointment to see a GP via their new and improved telephone triage system (the old bat from reception with a NVQ level 2 in Surgery Management or something). 3 weeks later I saw a doctor and started an investigation to the cause of the migraine started.  Last week finally I got a diagnosis of a TIA (stroke) - 6 months after the incident and my blood pressure meds I was taking from the heart attack were changed.  6 fucking months.  I was repeatedly told by doctors along the way that I should have gone to A&amp;E as I would have been diagnosed in 6 to 8 hours and had my meds changed immediately.   The only faults I can see in the whole process was the strain the GP's service was under.  Due to cuts and budget restraints, it can't cope any more.

Sorry, but if I am ill - I will go to A&amp;E.  If my kids are ill, I will take them to A&amp;E.  Much as I love the GP service - I don't want to risk martyring myself and family for it.

So you are talking about [Dinner for One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One), which apparently was written by a British comedian but recorded in a German studio. It's really more like a New Year's Eve thing though. I don't think you'll find a German who hasn't seen it on New Year's Eve at least once in his/her life.

For many, it is an absolute staple in German New Year's celebration. We get together with friends and/or family and have dinner together, usually Fondue or Raclette. There might also be a slight increase in the consumption of alcohol as the evening progresses. All the while the TV will be running, showing one of those ""The year in retrospect"" shows. At one point or the other though, Dinner for One will get aired or someone will switch to a channel where it is currently running (at almost any given time, there will be a channel broadcasting it).

You get introduced to this as a child, and it appeals to you because you have already started learning English in school and you might just be able to understand a few words, which makes you feel on top of the world. Also, the slapstick transcends language and really appeals to children. I imagine it became popular back then due to the Germans admittedly weird obsession with anything English, and it has been ""passed down"" from parents to children ever since then.

Last but not least, there is only one proper version of this sketch, and it is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVd_VLO9xcc).

&gt;___Dinner for One___, also known as ___The 90th Birthday___, or by its corresponding German alternative title, ___Der 90. Geburtstag___, is a [two-hander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hander) comedy sketch written by [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) author [Lauri Wylie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Wylie) for the theatre in the 1920s. [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television) station [Norddeutscher Rundfunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Rundfunk) (NDR) recorded a performance of the piece in 1963, in its original English language, with a short introduction in German. This comedy sketch went on to become the most frequently repeated TV programme ever. 

&gt;The 18-minute [single take](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-take) [black-and-white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white) 1963 TV recording featuring British [comedians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian) [Freddie Frinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Frinton) and [May Warden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Warden) has become an integral component of the [New Year's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve) schedule of several German television stations. Versions of the sketch are also shown by [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danmarks_Radio), and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveriges_Television) channels, a December 23 staple on [Norwegian national television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Broadcasting_Corporation), and a [cult television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_television) classic in [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland), [Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia), [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania), the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands) and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria); on New Year's Eve 2003 alone, the sketch was broadcast 19 times (on various channels). As of 2005, the sketch has been repeated more than 230 times. It is famous in other countries as well — including German-speaking [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa). It is likewise broadcast on New Year in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) on [SBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service). 

&gt;In 2003 the Danish TV producer Paul Anthony Sørensen produced and directed a documentary about the sketch. The documentary contains interviews with relatives of Freddie Frinton and May Warden. The documentary was nominated for the [Rose d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_d%27Or) 2004.

This is the really stupid part of all of this. It shows that a government owned railway company is perfectly capable of running a rail franchise and providing a good service while making money for the treasury.

Of course the government should know this since so many of our other rail franchises are government owned. [It's just that they are owned by foreign governments instead of ours](http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2014/10/three-quarters-of-uk-rail-network-owned-by-foreign-governments-research-reveals/)

&gt; You got an answer from someone you weren't expecting.

This. Absolutely. But unfortunately you'll (/u/withabeard) continue to be downvoted to hell because often threads to do with driving/cycling here and in the more lighthearted British Problems sub descend into the exact scenario you described somewhere elsewhere - someone clearly to blame for something who won't accept responsibility and who for some odd reason will be backed by others. I suspect it's because not many people like cyclists with opinions! As it is, I cycle and drive - it sounds like this particular cyclist was a bit of a tool for not having a decent set of lights, but that doesn't lay blame on them immediately because they had a light, albeit a shit one. 

OP for what it's worth, I don't think you're aware of the severity of the situation at all. Had that cyclist been a pedestrian as I've said elsewhere, with no legal requirement for lighting/visibility, you'd be in a much different situation. As it is you just sound like a little boy (or girl) with a fast toy who wants to be able to go and play out again while someone else makes this whole horrible nasty thing go away.

No we shouldn't. Because there are other poor people who don't have enough space. We need to rotate the social housing to those that need it.

Sitting in a council house that is bigger than you need because your children have left home is selfish when there are families with several children living in 1 and 2 bedroom flats.

People should not be denied the right of social housing but they should not be given houses for life. When they no longer require a larger house they should be moved into a smaller one or pay the price.

Of course there are many exceptions to this rule, but on the whole we can't just let them get away with one measly spare room because as a country we cannot afford it and it is to the detriment of other poor families.

&gt;&gt;*The British Bulldog redirects here, for other uses, see [British Bulldog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Bulldog_(disambiguation\)).*

&gt;__David ""Davey"" Boy Smith__  ([November 27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_27), [1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962) – [May 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_18), [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002)) was a [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people) [professional wrestler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling). Born in [Golborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golborne), (now in the [Borough of Wigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Wigan)), Smith is best known for his appearances in the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) with the [World Wrestling Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment) under his own name and under the [ring name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_name) __The British Bulldog__.

&gt;Smith's middle name, Boy, was the result of one of his parents mistaking the name field on Smith's birth certificate for the [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) field.  He was trained by Ted Betley in [Winwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winwick,_Cheshire), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) before relocating to [Calgary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary), [Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) to further his training under [Stu Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stu_Hart). While training with Hart, Smith met Stu and Helen Hart's youngest daughter [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Hart), whom he married in 1984. One of their two children, [Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith_(wrestler\)), is also a professional wrestler.

OK so let me get this straight, the party that rails against fat cat Eurocats and the EU gravy train voted against a cut in MEPs wages and claimed 2 million in expenses, £205,000 of which was for an office Farage was using for free as a gift from a supporter, and you're telling this is a good thing? If this was any other party, Eurosceptic or not, would have the press and media come down like a tonne of bricks over this. If a Lib dem MEP or a Labour MEP claimed £2 million in benefits they'd be outrage, yet you seem to totally support this. UKIP is supposed to be the only party with leaving Europe as it's core issue. It's pretty much the only one of two things is talks about the most and the majority of the people voting for them will be voting for them about whether or not it's long term supporters like it or not. [UKIP even ran a fucking ad campaign complaining about it](http://blog.solopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ukip-election-poster-your-daily-grind.jpg)! **What the hell!**

&gt;He paints himself as ""man of the people"" (those with a memory will remember David Cameron did the same thing) despite being worth over £136 million and an ex city worker.

[Actually if you click the link I provided you I got my information from excite.](http://money.excite.co.uk/nigel-farage-net-worth-highest-paid-politician-in-the-world.html). The man has invested wisely and has made a lot of money however he's been projecting a ""Man of the people"" style image campaign (ala Cameron) with lots of photo ops of him in pubs talking to ""normal, hardworking **british** workers"" which plays to UKIP's newly found voter base, the ""disenfranchised working class voter"" as everyone seems to put it who, thankfully for Farage, seem disinclined to google anything that might challenge their prejudices. Talking of which...

&gt;He wants to limit the amount of immigrants coming to Britain but UKIP is in favour of immigration in general. Nothing he's ever said would reduce the rights of spouses of citizens to come here.

Well I'd wish he'd make that clear but he's lose a lot of his new, powerful ""disenfranchised angry working class"" voting base that seem to have the kneejerk view that all people they view to be immigrants are bad, and are cheating the system by doing things like marrying British citizens. UKIP may not be openly racist, but a lot of their voting base sure is. And as mr-strange said...

&gt;That's bollocks. My wife was only able to move here because of her status as an EU citizen. If Farage has his way, then future me will be prevented from having a family life.

 

&gt;Are you so bigoted that you think that people from one class or group can't represent the issues of people from another?

No, if that happened most politicians wouldn't bother looking out for the poorer in society, but the fact is that Nigel Farage has a PR image as a Man of the People (one you seem to deny exists) goes in dramatic opposition to the fact the man earns more than most will in a lifetime. David Cameron did a similar thing pre-number ten then dropped the bullshit the moment he got into power. The difference is it's semi believable with Farage, it certainly was not with Cameron.

[Join the peoples army!](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26857594)   

This is a quote from my favourite movie (Lord of War); I always think of it whenever they say ""People's Army"". 

&gt;Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names - Liberation this, Patriotic that, Democratic Republic of something-or-other... I guess they can't own up to what they usually are: the Federation of Worse Oppressors Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors. Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves Freedom Fighters.   


I'm not saying they're genocidal or anything, but I find it interesting how people think Farage is a cure to all ailments. He's a politician spouting views out of 1950 to appeal to old people who are scared of another German invasion, and the working classes who have been undercut on price by a Polish person.   

He is no better than any other, actually I think he's worse as he's using his charisma in a very destructive way, considering the net benefit that EU migrants give to the economy, not to mention attempting to end a free trade area, and an area we need no expensive visas for, and of course, wants to bring back neo-liberal economics here which would make the country a lot more like America.

If they aren't paying for that home themselves but rather it is being paid for by taxpayers, then yes it is perfectly reasonable to require them to let a room out if they have one spare and are unwilling or unable to move to a smaller property.

&gt; Nevermind if there's anyone available to take the room to begin with.

There is always a market if the price is right.

&gt; And let's remember, if you've got two teenage girls (say 14 and 15) they have to share a room now to make space for this lodger, as the logic of the policy proscribes same sex under 16s to share a room. Would you want to rent a room in that house?

Would I want to? No. Would I do it for £11 per week? Hell, yes!

&gt; In in terms of getting people to downsize, this is the whole rationale of the policy, so hadn't the policy been a failure in that case?

The rationale of the policy is to optimise usage of state housing via ensuring bedrooms are as close to fully utilised as possible. If this isn't happening it doesn't imply that the policy doesn't work, it implies the financial penalties aren't sever enough.

&gt; moving home can be a very expensive process - settling up utilities, any van hire costs, rental overlaps.

I've moved home nearly 40 times. It isn't expensive at all and I've addressed this in other threads on the topic. 

&gt; If you've suddenly lost £14 a week in real terms income and earn little enough to get housing benefits to begin with moving isn't going to be too viable an option.

That is making excuses. Moving is easy and inexpensive. Very large furniture is the only difficulty and if you can afford that then you shouldn't be in state housing anyway.

&gt; it's disingenuous to suggest that there is a wealth of housing stock available to these people.

Not really. Whilst you are correct that there may not be enough specific property of a given type in a given area to meet local needs for two bedroom housing meaning that families that only need two beds are in three bed properties this ignores the lodger issue already mentioned. In other words the shortage of smaller properties isn't an impediment to optimising bedroom allocation.

&gt;__BMC ADO17__ was the model code used by the [British Motor Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation) (BMC) for a range of cars produced from September 1964 to 1975 and sold initially under its [Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Motor_Company) marque as the __Austin 1800__. The car was also sold as the __[Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Motors) 1800__ and __[Wolseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolseley_Motors) 18/85__, and later as the __Austin 2200__, __Morris 2200__ and __Wolseley Six__. In Denmark it was sold as the Morris Monaco. Colloquially known as the ""Landcrab"", the 1800 was voted [Europe's Car of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Car_of_the_Year) for 1965 – the second year of the award, and a second successive contest win for the UK, the [Rover P6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_P6) having won the award a year earlier.

I can't really beat you, but yeah, I fucked up. A few weeks ago I bought a Vision Spinner II vaping kit on the recommendation of /u/samson-strange. Ordered some e-liquids (at £1 each!); they arrive; I've accidentally ordered triple the strength of the tobacco I normally smoke, can't really touch it unless I enjoy that choking feeling (which I do not). Oh dear. /u/samson-strange sorts me out with a package of half a dozen (or a dozen?) liquids he doesn't like/are half used, so that's great, because at this point I'm totes broke (as in, £1.52 in the bank). But due to fuckwittery on someone's part (either Samson's or my postie, we're not entirely sure), the package doesn't arrive. A week or so later I get money in my bank again and order some more liquids (£1 again! SO CHEAP) and they arrive; I fill it, spill the liquid all over the outside, think 'this smells nasty, it just won't do' and then... yeah, this won't be totally unexpected for most patrons in the pub: I washed it. That's right, I put an electronic battery that charges via USB under a fucking flannel wet with soapy water and washed it. TBF I did dry it immediately thinking 'oh, maybe I shouldn't....' Ah, fuck.

Guess what? IT THEN DIDN'T WORK. For two days.

I dried it out for a few days and it worked on Tuesday evening. Then it woke me up at four o'clock in the fucking morning - it turned itself on and started making the vaping noise. Scared the chuffing fuck out of me.

So yesterday I had to go out and buy another one because I had no idea if the Spinner was going to rectify itself or not. 

(I don't like it as much, but I think my uncle's going to have it).

Vision spinner is working again today and all is well with the world.

It should be noted that I've totally fucked two £60 wireless Apple keyboards in the past by cleaning them over-zealousy. 

Don't let me near your nice things, people.

false,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","The problem with the bedroom tax is not necessarily the concept (""make people pay for things they want but don't need""), it's the implementation details.

For example, in parts of the UK where the local authority built a mix of 1 bedroom flats and 4 bedroom houses for social housing, what are we supposed to do with people who need 2 or 3 bedrooms?

We can't put them in 1 bed flats - they need more space than that. With the bedroom tax, we can't put them in 4 bed houses; they can't afford to pay the extra, so they can't go in the 4 bed houses. Where do they go? Note that the local authority built the housing it did so that it had a uniform, easy to maintain housing stock that was suitable for the vast majority of applicants it received, and suitable for growing families without moving.

For a second example of implementation issues, why are people whose houses have been adapted by the local authority not excluded? If the cost of adapting a house is £50,000 (about right for adapting a typical council house so that you can live on the ground floor as a wheelchair user), it may be better value for the council to keep a disabled person in their 3 bed family home even though they now only need one bedroom than to move them on and adapt a smaller property. Again, bedroom tax gives perverse incentives - you want to move on to a smaller property, even though the council will have to pay to adapt it all over again.

If the goal was, as you say, to move people on who were sitting on big houses for life, why are the elderly excluded - what's special about making it to 65 that means that you're no longer sitting on a big house you don't need?

Had I been asked to implement it, I'd have not excluded the elderly at all; instead, I'd have made the change apply to all social housing residents who refuse an offer of moving to a more appropriately sized house (and put requirements on authorities to make such offers to all people who can be moved to a more appropriately sized home in the same geographic area given a moderate budget for adapting the house they're moving to). A place where social housing is either 1 bed or 4 bed can't make an offer to a family that needs 2 bed housing, so they'd be able to put a family that needs 2 bed housing in a four bed house without difficulty. Someone disabled doesn't have to be moved on, because the council can allow for the sheer cost of adapting a new house for them and say ""nope, cost of two wasted bedrooms is cheaper than nearly rebuilding a house so that they can live on the ground floor"".",0,1417083738,null,0,false,0,cmedrng,t3_2nhtgt,t1_cmedrng,t1_cmecrde,null,1425818187,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Where did I say that? But thanks for putting words in my mouth! I was merely agreeing with the other poster's comments that there's a general culture of 'I did this thing but I'm not in the wrong'. I mean, part of it is human nature - no one likes to take the blame. But when you involve cyclists they do, in general, get the short end of the stick. I've given you the benefit of the doubt throughout this in terms of agreeing that it sounded like the rider was a numpty for not having well-maintained equipment. But I do think you're shirking a lot of responsibility for your own actions. 

&gt; If a pedestrian walked out into the road in an unlit main road during the night the driver would not ""be fucked"" necessarily.

But it sounds like in your exact circumstances - which is what we've been referring to all along - there's a very high chance they would. You had to take a cyclist to hospital who you hit. It's not rocket science to assume that you could have done more damage if that had been a pedestrian and instead of knocking them off their transport you'd have hit them directly. 

Again, it comes down to due care and attention (you know, that phrase) based on conditions at the time.

On the tube this is done by having a separate public body collect fares and set standards, and then contract out the running of the trains for a fixed fee to a private company.  If the company doesn't perform to the agreed timetable and standard, it can be replaced by another one.

By contrast on the rail network, the private railway companies collect fares and so have an incentive to raise prices as much as they can get away.  Because they are not answerable to a single public body, just to the diffuse set of travellers who individually have little power, they can also reduce service as much as possible so they can maximize profits.

  I had planned a nice weekend in Prague, left it too late to book and ended up not getting anything that was all that affordable. Annoyingly, I couldn't afford to top up the extra because I'd spent excess cash on getting a shiny for the anniversary so that... you know.   
  
  Anyways, that didn't get delivered in time (still hasn't, as it goes.... yay), so that was fuck up number two, but only really a mild annoyance as plans had already been wrecked. So, I looked for other things for us to do, with time running out - tried to find a nice but cheesy expensive restaurant and ended up virtually being laughed off the phone when I spoke to [Clos Magiorre] (http://www.closmaggiore.com/) trying to get a booking, they had a single table for that weekend, about 36 hours before we planned on being there, so that didn't work out too well either, and we fucked it off.   
  
  Now, with less than a week to go, I had to re-do some things. So, I booked us into a nice romantic cinema in the arse end of Surrey in the evening (it's got couches/sofas little tables and they serve you wine) and then booked the day around that. Reserved a table in a nice Bistro, a chocolate making class and a stroll around a country estate.   
  
  All planned out. Yes? No.   
 
  So, the chocolate people cancelled a few days beforehand due to lack of interest (apparently my 100 quid for someone on a Sunday morning wasn't enough to justify getting out of bed, fuck you) the country estate closed for winter (who knew!) but we still had the cinema and the restaurant booked, so not bad.  
  
  Got up on Sunday, had a lazy one as the restaurant wasn't til 3 in the afternoon and slowly got ready. Got to the train platform, waited around for far  too long only to discover that trains to that part of Surrey on that day were cancelled. So, we had 15 minutes til we were supposed to be there, and were over an hour away. Not being an arsehole, I called the place and asked them if we could be a bit late; was given a less than encouraging 'we'll do our best we're rammed'. Thanks Gemma, know what, not gonna take the chance. So, we still had the cinema booked, right? Well, this was around the corner from the place that we were having lunch, which was fucking ages away, and at 7 in the evening, we'd not eaten and other than a 30/40 quid cab ride had no way of getting there. Know what we did? We said **fuck this** and went down the pub and sulked for 30 minutes and had a glass of wine while laughing at how badly wrong everything had gone, then firmed up and decided that it was only the afternoon and we could still make something out of it.   
  
  We went to Croydon, because it was at least a place to start. On a Sunday. En route her shoe broke, so we had to dash into a shoe shop, and now it was 5. Another glass of wine, in *wait for it* fucking Whetherspoons (seriously, that's your lot in Croydon, it's a shit tip) noticed the football was on so ended up across the road in *really wait for it, it get's worse* **YATES** watching fucking Arsenal. They lost to Swansea, so that was a result, but still.  
  
  Following that, we found a reasonable restaurant which didn't look like it came with a free side of food poisoning, polished off a bottle of wine with dinner and went home.  
 
  The food came with a free side of food poisoning and we ended up throwing up from about 3am, taking turns.

Maybe have a policy like the high-tackle one in rugby, ie anything that arrives above shoulder height is a no-ball (or counted as a wide).

The short pitched ball is legitimate but a much more dangerous delivery is the ball that leaps of a normal length due to vagaries in the pitch - there is no way of getting rid of this outside of banning fast bowling, which would be akin to having Formula 1 drivers race around in Ford Escorts after the injury to Jules Bianchi or the death of Ayrton Senna. 

The short pitched bowl is a deliberate attempt to intimidate but is also one of the few weapons left in the arsenal of bowlers in a batsman dominated game. The number you can bowl is already policed and the ""beamer"" the ball above waist height that doesn't hit the ground is rightly banned, the reason being that the bounce takes a lot of the sting out of the ball. Although the ball can be 90mph this is an average over the 22 yards and by the time it reaches the batsman it is actually going much slower than that, whereas when it leaves the bowlers hand it can be well above 100mph. 

Every batsmen knows there is a risk when playing cricket, that in itself is part of the thrill - if as a batsman you can stand against 90mph bowling and come out on top there is no better feeling. By all means helmets and other protection should be looked at again but in the whole time helmets weren't around there were no deaths in professional cricket from this type of incident, it's a complete freak occurrence, a one in a billion chance to quote a doctor who treated Phil Hughes.

This sub and ukdota in general could be a lot better if things like this didn't exist.
Look at the list of mods for this sub it looks like such a joke where some guy has made his friends mods, makes this subreddit a joke.
the only thing that happens is people posting lft and then there's this super secret elite list of players who get to pretend they're special and if they are lucky enough they'll become a mod of a shitty subreddit.
Has there ever been a real attempt to make some kind of community and not become massive egos who think they're competitive players? because atm it looks really unfriendly and obviously the mods don't give a shit.
why not have a permanently stickied post where people can post there steam id's or a google doc open to have people edit there names in and shit. Just little things like that can make things seem a bit friendly and not as small and enclosed as it is atm.

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. Classic Who was only ever defined by its serials, never by production blocks. It has no seasons. That's why you can buy a series five DVD but if you want Silver Nemesis and Remembrance of the Daleks, both from 'season' 26, you're going to need to buy them separately.

&gt; Wikipedia for some reason makes the distinction between seasons and series: 

The reason is that it's useful shorthand to describe the production blocks of classic Who as seasons, even if they've never been described that way in production. New Who does officially use the term series, as it follows an episodic format rather than the serialised nature of the classic show.

&gt;...which I don't understand. I had thought that ""series"" was just a Britishism for ""season.""

Large parts of healthcare in the UK are already provided by private companies - for instance those free drugs the NHS gives out are purchased from private companies. 


The idea is that rather than paying to run hospitals/CCGs the government would tender out treatment to private companies, the company which offers the best value would do the treatment. As Private companies have an incentive to compete on cost/care they would compete and end up reducing costs. Obviously this system has problems - one only has to look at the US. However some good innovations have come from private healthcare, such as the advancements in technology from the US and the 'mass production' healthcare techniques in India (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10837726). 

There are no wrong or right answers, certainly some element of private provision may be helpful, however things such as emergency care are unlikely to ever be open to competition - one would hardly quibble over price when having a heart attack! However for non essential care there might be a case for having a market based approach. 

Morals are an altogether more philosophical issue - I think that law/lawyers could provide a way forward. When taking legal aid the solicitor appointed to you is paid for the government, they are a private provider of legal assistance not employed by the state. You are both a client/product for them, however they have a legal obligation in the way they treat you that are very similar - such as privacy as you highlighted above.

* National Insurance Number (NINo) registrations to adult overseas nationals increased by 12% to 668,000 in the year ending September 2014 from the previous year. Romanian citizens had the highest number of registrations (104,000), followed by Polish citizens (98,000).

* 32,000 Romanian and Bulgarian (EU2) citizens immigrated to the UK in the year ending June 2014, a statistically significant increase from 18,000 in the previous 12 months.

There were 104,000 national insurance registrations for Romanian citizens between October 2013 - September 2014 but at the same time there were only 32,000 Romanian (and Bulgarian) immigrants to the UK between July 2013 - June 2014. And only 18,000 in the year before that.

Seems to suggest either there were a huge number of Romanians in the UK for more than 2 years who hadn't applied for NI numbers before or in July to September 2014 there were at least 64,000 immigrants (probably considerably more) from Romania arriving and applying for NI, which would be significantly more in 3 months than in the previous 2 years.

Feel like I am missing something obvious.

Edit1: Spelling and maths errors

Edit2: According to the 2011 census there were just under 74,000 Romanians in the UK. Which could make up some of the gap, although at least some of them probably had work visa's (and therefore already had a NI number) and a number of these and the immigrants since will be younger than working age.

I think all fans need to take a step back and think rationally in situations like this. It is very easy to be reactionary and heavily swayed by emotion which is almost always short-sighted.

Firstly, consider the implications of firing a manager. It is 'throwing everything out and starting again'. New managers have new philosophies, new teams and reset the adjustment period timer.

It is an expensive and, more importantly, risky process. You need to be very certain and careful when making such potentially destabilising decisions.

As a fan, I need to remind myself that bad spells do happen. Especially when encountering difficult circumstances (such as effectively losing your entire, potent strike-force). 

A decision as to whether BR should be sacked or not should not be based on short-term disappointment but rather on more fundamental questions. Do I believe the club will not bounce back? Do I believe there are fatal problems in the long-term vision and strategy? Do I believe BR lacks technical capability?

The contractual agreement is that after graduating, you work full time at the company for 3 years to ""pay back"" the company for stumping up the money for the degree. You are free to leave the company in that period but would have to pay back part of the degree depending on how long you worked their (each year completed makes it £9,000 cheaper to leave).

But last month, I ordered an iPad through one of my companies schemes. I got a text  saying that it would be delivered ""COP tomorrow"" by DPD. Went to online tracking, they were in *Leicester*. I live in London. Bullshit, I thought, but oh well, delivery companies, amirite?!

Next day shows up and I get a text saying that my item will be delivered at 1615. Went to the tracking website. And they had the works, seriously. On this site, I could *see* where the driver was on the map, how many deliveries he was doing, and where I was in the queue. I could even put in ""in flight"" requests and did so, asking him to call because my buzzer is broken. Mind that I made this request *while the driver was out with the parcel, four hours before delivery*.

1600 hours arrives, and on the map I can bloody well *see* the drivers icon on the map on my street. And at 1615 on the dot, I get a phonecall from the driver saying he's downstairs. I bound down and collect my iPad. What a great experience.

false,Frogs_are_Friends,null,null,"Here's a third option: ask your provider if you can have an **mortgage offset account**. Or look into moving to one when you next shop for a better mortgage (which you should from time to time)

Example:

- say you have 100k outstanding on your mortgage
- ...and you put 20k of cash into the offset account
- you'll only be charged interest on the 80k that isn't offset.

Advantages of offsetting:

- you have full control of this money. You can pull it out at any time, just like a savings account. You can deposit at any time. Like a deposit for the next house before you sell the current one? There it is!
- it's exactly like 'earning' the equivalent of your mortgage rate on that amount of money, without being charged interest on it (just like an ISA). So for you right now it performs like a 2.9% ISA. If your mortgage rate goes up to 3.9%, then it's like an ISA with 3.9% interest-free.
- it is safe, and not open to investment risk
- there is no £15k/year limit like ISAs

Disadvantages:

- not all providers offer this facility
- not all providers can offer this after the mortgage is set up

I know people who have 100% of their remaining mortgages offset with the cash they just have sitting around waiting for the next investment. It's better than paying off the mortgage as that money is 'locked in' to the bricks and mortar, whereas they can just move it into the bank account and slap it down as their next house deposit, and therefore removing 'chain' that most people on the property ladder have to wrangle with.

If you walk with a horse on a lead, the lead will normally be in your right hand.  If you have to cross paths with someone else, then you so that the people are between the horses (effectively: driving on the right).  Horses are much stronger than people, and if they get spooked controlling them is difficult - so this reduces the risk of two horses taking a dislike to each other [0].

If you're driving a wagon, then slightly different criteria apply.  If you have a large train, then the control of the train is dependant on the long whip - therefore the driver sits on the right hand side, so that the right hand is free to use the whip.  And when two wagons pass, they do so such that the drivers are on the inside (effectively: drive on the left).

For a smaller cart, with a single animal, the driver sits in the middle, and either way is as practical as the other.

Then there's about two thousand years of various political and historical shifts on top of that, of course.

In Britain, the first paved roads were build by the Romans, who drove chariots on the left (long whip), whereas the locals walked on mud paths (on the right).  It's not possible to _proove_ that this is why, of course, but it's the most likely explanation, as far as I can see.

&gt;I've been on a flight where the couple in front got nasty drunk about an hour into the flight. Seat of three in front and the drunk guy goes to the loo and leaves his gf sitting there. The other seat was occupied by a single guy just silently looking out of the window. Drunk guy comes back and confronts him ""Been chatting her up, have you?"" ""D'you wanna fuck her mate?"". Guy wisely continues to stare out of the window. It escalated really quickly and was terrifying. I called the flight attendant who loftily dismissed it and at that precise moment an empty litre bottle of vodka rolled to her feet from under their seat. By then our entire section of the plane was visibly frightened. This great big guy is pissed out of his head, angry, violent, abusive and we have nowhere to run, or even hide and nobody to help us/protect us.

&gt;More scary than you would imagine.


&gt;He got louder and more belligerant, at times standing up and just staring at people menacingly. The food came round and I asked if there were any spares could they chuck one my way (I am always hungry). When they brought one of the spare dinners over to me he reached back and snatched it. Neither the stewardess or I said a word. Then he fell into a kind of stupor. The girl was sobbing drunkenly. The rest of us spent the whole time making conspiratorial rueful British faces at each other (hard to describe, but the stiff upper lip was in full on mode). We bonded.

&gt;When we landed they asked everyone to remain seated and then came over and escorted them from the plane. The sigh of relief was drowned out by everyone excitedly regaling anecdotes and personal emotions in a light hearted way.

&gt;The tour operator refused to allow them to go on the coach to their hotel so I suppose they got a taxi.

&gt;This is the funniest bit though. The following week on our trip home obviously there were nearly all the same people. We all greeted each other excitedly and were disappointed not to see the shamed drunken couple at the airport as well. And then one of us spotted them. In disguise. They had literally disguised themselves and were seated in the most remote corner of the airport and keeping their heads down in their shared drunk on a plane shame.

&gt;How we all laughed. Never had a peep out of them on the way back.

false,Honey-Badger,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"[We believe that there are two main profiles of the on-street groomer. First, we have the white offenders, who typically offend alone. So far, nothing new: the lone white male is the norm for UK child sex offences. Second, however, there are Asian offenders, many of whom are of Pakistani origin. They seem much more likely to offend in groups, lending their abuse a curiously social dimension. In our research, which focuses on large offending groups, we analysed police data from five major on-street grooming investigations. Of the 52 suspects charged, 83% were Asian Pakistani, 11% Asian other and 6% white British. These are shocking statistics and the over-representation of Asian offenders within this dataset certainly merits attention. There may be important factors that explain why the bigger networks have been largely Asian. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that these cases do not paint a full picture of this crime. If on-street grooming continues to be reduced to the big Asian networks alone, a whole host of other offenders will get overlooked.](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/08/asian-sex-gangs-on-street-grooming)

false,blue_strat,null,null,"If you want an opinion about some basic kind of ""native"" British character, Anthony Burgess wrote a book about English Literature while he was in Malaya, and described the English (since it was a book about literature in English) as influenced by England's geography:

&gt; The landscape of England is varied - mountains and lakes and rivers - but the uniform effect is one of green gentleness - downs and farms and woods. The English landscape made Wordsworth; tropical jungles could never have produced a poet like him, and, often, when we read him in the tropics, we find it hard to accept his belief in a kindly, gentle power brooding over nature.

&gt; In the tropics there are no seasons except the rainy and the dry, but in England one is aware of the earth approaching and retreating from the sun - spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the festivals associated with these seasons. The longing for spring is a common theme with English poets, and Christmas, the winter festival, is the very essence of Charles Dickens.

&gt; [...] But it is the cold of England that is hardest for the dweller in the tropics to understand [...] It has been said that the English climate is responsible for the English character: the English are cold rather than hot-blooded, temperate rather than fiery, active because of the need to keep warm, philosophical under difficulties because if you can stand the English climate you can stand anything.

&gt; The English are also said to be conservative, disliking change (this is generally true of island-dwellers), but also, because the sea makes them a nation of sailors, adventurous and great travellers. The English have, for nearly a thousand years, been free of domination by foreign powers (an island is not easy to invade), and this has made them independent, jealous of their freedom, but also a little suspicious of foreigners.

&gt; The English are, in fact, a curious mixture, and their literature reflects the contradictions in their character. The English rebels and eccentrics - people like Shelley and Byron and Blake - are as typical as the rather dull die-hards who sit at home and never change their opinions in fifty years: the very fact of a conservative society - social stability, no foreign domination - explains the rebels and eccentrics, for only in a country where tradition is respected will you find men who say that tradition should not be respected. In other words, to have rebels you must have something to rebel against.

&gt; The English are sometimes said to be mad: this is certainly a tradition in some European countries. It is hard to say what this means, but possibly it refers to impatience with restrictions, dislike of anything which interferes with personal liberty. 'Englishmen will never be slaves,' said George Bernard Shaw. 'They are free to do whatever the Government and public opinion allow them to do.' But both these can restrict so far and no farther: the Englishman has always been able to change his Government and what an Englishman calls 'public opinion' is usually what he himself thinks.

&gt; The English love justice but hate laws, and it is this hatred of laws which makes so much English literature seem 'mad'. A French writer obeys the Academy rules which govern the employment of the French language, but a typically English writer like Shakespeare is always ready to make language do 'mad' things, to invent new words or use metaphors which take the breath away with their daring. And it follows that much English literature is 'formless'. Shakespeare breaks all the dramatic rules, Dickens's novels proceed, seemingly without rhyme or reason, not like a controlled and organised work of art, but like a river in full spate. The French and Italians have always liked traditional verse forms - the sonnet, the rondel, the line with a fixed number of syllables - but the English have usually preferred to invent their own forms and, eventually, to have as many syllables as they wished in a line of verse. English literature, in short, has a freedom, a willingness to experiment, a hatred of rules which has no parallel in any other literature.",0,1417093103,null,0,false,0,cmefhdo,t3_2nhbqs,t1_cmefhdo,t1_cmdxolu,null,1425817388,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

false,LickieRambert,lfc99,,"I think it's extremely harsh to blame Rodgers for the position were in. Lets just take a look at whats happened which imo he hasn't had much control over;

First of all Suarez left us. There was no way we were going to be able to keep him, he wanted his ""dream move"" to Barca, and he got it, and we got decent money for him. (I personally think we should have played hard ball with Barca that we would only accept a deal with Sanchez plus money and nothing else but thats not Rodgers fault either.)

Secondly, Sturridge has been out for 90% of the season  another world class player missing from the team.  If Rodgers had bought in another striker and Sturridge hadn't gotten injured the new striker would be sitting on the bench and we would all be questioning why we wasted money on him. And lets be honest, he did bring in three strikers this season anyway. 

So when you take away two world class players from any team its going to be a massive struggle. If you take away Ronaldo and Bale from Madrid they would struggle, Neymar and Messi from Barca, Costa and Hazard from Chelsea, I could list many more examples. 

Rodgers did try to get World Class players but FSG do not allow high wages, which is why we went for the potential to be world class bracket. We have great potential in the team we just have to give Rodgers and all the new players time. 

Personally I see this season as a transition season, a lot like Rodgers first season. In the next couple of windows I believe it is when we have the ability to bring in world class players because we don't need potential and squad players now, we already have them.

I hope you'll agree that education could have been useful in avoiding a horrific incident. 

The logic in educating women how to avoid attacks in dark areas (don't get drunk and walk home alone through areas you know to be 'dodgy', be careful accepting a drink from a stranger etc.) fall under the same heading. Be vigilant. That's not blaming the victim if something does happen - it's making sure people keep in mind how to be aware of their surroundings and any potential danger.

Is it any surprise given that just 150 years ago that was the case that whites ended up as the ruling class of America? 


But you might say 'Well, that was 150 years ago. They should have buckled down, worked hard to better themselves.'

But then you're ignoring that it wasn't over when slavery ended. There was still a huge amount of racism in the general population and an equal amount in law. That's right, properly institutionalized racism in the form of the [Jim Crow laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) which lasted all the way up until 1965. 

Less than 50 fucking years ago it was still illegal for Black men to use the same toilet as white men in some areas of the USA..

And you know what, despite legal separation, no vote and a bunch of other legal, social and economic disadvantage they STILL did actually sort their lives out under much harder constraints than their white countrymen. 

And what happened when black people created nice rich areas to live? [Well, the KKK flew in (literally) and bombed them. Burning the whole place to the ground.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot)

So sorry, but these particular citizens of the USA have been shat over consistently for almost 400 years now and everyone is acting fucking surprised that they're not just 'sorting themselves out'.. 

It's fucking bullshit, often under the guise of 'personal responsibility' when there was a concerted social effort to keep them down and empovrished.

Rodgers tried to adress the problem. He brought in 3 new defenders, 2 of which have let him down repeatedly. Lovren was expensive but it seems like a good aquisition and the type of player we were looking for. People were absolutely begging for us to just pay £20m for Moreno instead of chasing Bertrand for £8m and although we inky spent £12m in the end Bertrand has by far been the better of the 2.

You're comparing him to other managers and it seems you're coming from the angle of ""how can he keep his job when they lost theirs""

Moyes took a side that won the league by 11 points to 7th and broke all kind of losing records but still managed United for 34 league games before the owners decided enough was enough. Yes Rodgers is on a similar run to Moyes last season but he's currently only been in charge of 12 league matches this season. He should get until at least the halfway point before his future should even be considered.

Dalgish was sacked yes, but *barely*. He was essentially a goal-line decision away from keeping his job. The Carroll header vs Chelsea is counted and we have the momentum going into extra-time and very possibly an F.A. Cup. So, Dalglish's job was so in the balance that one game could have kept him his job.

It isn't the case, unless I'm incredibly uninformed, that the first money you make is taxed at 20% until, near the end of the year, after crossing the threshold, you suddenly pay 40% on the last couple of pay-checks. To even it out, somebody is making an estimate on your total earnings. And one of my questions is: Who is making this estimate? The employer? If so, is there a suggested framework for how to project in terms of commission and bonus pay?

&gt; Due to a house move for work during 2008 it became necessary to move, but selling the property was not an option, so the ( bad, and wrong, not looking for posts of disapproval) decision was taken to sublet it (against the terms of the agreement). 

&gt; The tenant has been in for some years now, but has now been made aware that the owners of the building are cracking down on subletting (apparently it is rife in the building).

&gt; Whilst there’s no suggestion that my friend is personally under suspicion, the agreement with the tenant is that to prevent any issues, he is going to find alternative accommodation within the month – all very amicable etc. Trouble is, friend now needs to get rid of the property as doesn’t live there and can’t afford / doesn’t want to be paying the mortgage and rent payments on an empty place.

&gt; The suggestion is that the valuation of the property now will be several thousand less than is still outstanding on the mortgage. The cost of covering the monthly minimum repayments is not going to be crippling whilst the property is unsold, but conversely it’s not going to reduce the negative equity by any estimable amount, given that half of it is dead money paying rent to the owner of the other 50%. 

&gt; What’s the best solution? Flog it ASAP for a several thousand pound loss seems to be the way to end the problem – much better to make up the shortfall (probably through a combination of scraping together savings and perhaps a short term unsecured loan) than hang on to a money-hole in the hope that the price suddenly skyrockets (seems unlikely) – I’ve read some posts suggesting that a chat with the (friend’s) mortgage provider and letting them know the situation will perhaps allow for a phased repayment of capital following the sale, or is it better to get the funds elsewhere and make a clean break?

....

I've not really got much sympathy with someone who was profiteering by owning a property aimed at people on low income by subletting it and screwing over those same people by doing so. The house move is a pretty poor cover seeing as that was six years ago. But I thought I'd at least make your post readable.

I think he should admit his guilt to the person who owns the other 50% and be prepared to lose a sizeable chunk of change for breach of contract.

That's why I've asked for evidence that white British people can be just as bad. The trouble is besides a couple of select groups - I'm just not seeing it. 

The next step for me is simply accepting that these immigrant groups have something fundamentally wrong with their culture and/or way of doing things and we either get them out of this country or severely re-educate in order to protect every law abiding, decent person living here. Unfortunately that groups me with the likes of the militant immigrant-out parties and I don't want to be there. 

I feel like there's no middle ground for me.

If you're not in the tournament, it's pretty much up to you to find people who are playing the games you like: you can do this by walking around and finding people and saying ""Hi you are playing dota let's be friends"" or looking around for relevant IRC rooms on the LAN servers, or teamspeaks, or in-game chat rooms.

I display a trust in this process that is based on an understanding of what has been done and the measures in place to get the rest done that you seem to remarkably ignorant of for someone making such a lot of noise about it.



The SNP saying they accept something and actually accepting it are two different things. Some SNP moron was in the Commons this morning banging on about the need for independence. There's a lot of members of the SNP who just don't get it. 



And frankly you're just being obtuse about semantics on the last point. Devolution isn't yet law. But the parties to the vow have delivered a structure and distinct milestones the inevitable endpoint of which is the passage of these measures, or a set of extremely similar measures, into law. For all intents and purposes, it is done. Now we just have to wait for the process to run for it to become official. That is how they have delivered. 


If you want to hold off until it's actually received royal assent before you stop sulking about Westminster oppression then fine.

- Build up an emergency fund; say 6 months of outgoings
- Clear debts. As you can repay chunks of your mortgage without penalty, go for it. You're earning 1.69% on your savings and paying 2.69% on your mortgage. That's daft.
- Insure yourself against accident or illness (Critical Illness and Income Protection Plans)
- Save for retirement (ISAs or pensions)

Once you have an emergency fund, I'd buy the insurance and then overpay the mortgage. Assuming overpayments of £500pm, this may take you as little as 10 years. Once you're debt-free, focus on retirement planning. But this is my personal opinion based on very limited information. For example, do you not have access to a workplace pension?

The argument is there to be had that if apprenticeships do not come at a low cost to businesses then there will not be apprenticeships.

2 years ago I had an apprentice work for me (I am not a business owner but I am a head of department). I knew they were on a low wage but not the exact amount he was on. He struggled on this wage for a year, but the training my department was able to offer him in the form of on the job training has allowed him to go on to a more senior job in the same field with a larger organisation. I hear he is doing very well now and if you ask him, he may well agree that it was worth the struggle. Does that make it fair or right?

Now the debate is there to be had that we should have paid him more. The reality was that if we were to pay more we would have either employed someone with more experienced and more qualified, or not at all. 

I would add to this that most full time students do not get paid at all for the training and education they receive. In fact they have the opposite experience of having to pay for their training.

false,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Firstly, that headline is bollocks.  If you're going to group renewables together, you might as well do the same with non-renewables.  By which measure non-renewable sources (coal, gas, nuclear) produced 14.8TWh, around 50% more than renewable sources.  Wind and hydro are entirely different things, grouping them together for a headline just muddies the waters.

Scotland is capable of producing a large amount of electricity from renewables though, to be fair.  Looking at the stats around 3GWh came from hydro in the first half of the year, and a little over 6GWh came from wind.  Both produced about twice as much power in the first quarter than the second, presumably due to worse weather.  Individually neither produced more output than nuclear.

Hydro is a lot better than wind, due to it largely being dispatchable, though Scottish hydro is more susceptible to rain than most, it seems.  load factor varies quite a lot.

The average load factor for Scottish wind over the last few years comes out at around 26%, which is entirely unimpressive.  I was expecting more, to be honest.  The wind will have the effect of occasionally creating huge energy surpluses, which are generally exported to England or Ireland.

They broke the terms of the contract. There does not have to be a monetary gain in order to end up paying damages, it could be written into the contract.

My placement was really good, but the industry/area is so detached from what the academic setting is like (and I basically didn't use any of my degree, so there's a lot of rust). Bigger sense of urgency in industry, more point to what I was doing, more hands on, the people around me were more driven, and there's a completely lax attitude to health and safety back at university which drives me insane after having the mentality drilled into me at work.

Again, they only let the better students on placements, although most of us feel a bit hard done by with our grades for placement year. The presentations, reports, and supervisor marks are all subjective - compared with students who were at university, who had exams (for three-quarters of their grade) they could theoretically 100%.

In the past I've even said ""I'm not in tomorrow, so don't bother lugging my post here!"" but he said he had to make an attempt. Always make sure they get some wine or chocolates around Christmas.

In my last place the postman always came as I was leaving, which worked great for both of us. For a while my leg was in a splint and one awful morning trying to put my gloves on whilst balancing coffee and crutches he took the time out to come back and help me, when he could have easily carried on his route.

I work in a recruitment agency. We got a Muslim lady a job offer and she was a fantastic fit for the job – very technically capable. The only problem was that whilst she was seeing the office she caught on that some of the employees were going to a bar that night to celebrate – they had some bubbly on one of their office desks I think - and asked if they did that often. They said they did go out to pubs and bars and enjoyed having a good time. 

She said that she couldn’t work in an environment where people would be doing that. She simply would not do it. 

They weren’t about to change the entire companies culture for her, so she turned them down on that principle. Just incredible. It would’ve been a great job for her. 

I respect other people’s right not to drink or eat whatever they don’t want to – but don’t hold those beliefs then complain when people don’t conform to suit you. That’s making choices for them that you have no right to make.

I typically like to look at it as who I'd like to see(within reason) at the club come January 31st. and who is expendable/whose talent is not at the level we need it to be right now.

First I'm going to start with the people who I think the club won't let anyone touch this window: Eriksen, Chadli, Kane, Lamela, Vertonghen, Mason, Stambouli, Dier and Bentaleb(unless on Loan). Lloris isn't here because I feel as if a big enough bid comes in, they'll sell him to the people who want him, as long as they aren't a PL team. 

Expendables/Potential Outs: Adebayor, Soldado, Paulinho, Dembele, Kaboul, Chiriches, Lennon, Townsend, Naughton. I think one of the 2 strikers will be going, Paulinho or Dembele will be headed out and Naughton might be gone with the addition of Yedlin. 

Ins: Striker: If we sell Adebayor, we go for Benteke. If Soldado is sold, I'd like to see us pursue Lacazette. Rodriguez apparently is Poch's target so I'm not going to question that. But Paulinho and/or Dembele might be sold. If he sells one, they won't replace him, but if both are sold, expect Schneiderlin's name to be mentioned a lot. As for a defender, I think we retry the Musacchio bid, if not perhaps Shawcross, Howedes, Nastasic. But in all honesty I'd like to see Veljkovic called up before we make any purchase. 

 
Edit: BAE not mentioned because I think its a given that he's out this window. Fazio annd Capoue I can't really say anything about. Fazio won't be sold because he's new and I think that Capoue is going to be given the second half of the season to turn his form around.

If the Welsh managed to retain a distinct language, religious and cultural identity even after specific programmes were designed and deployed to eradicate Welsh language and culture I'm sure the English - the dominant and ruling culture in Britain - can do the same.

Immigration isn't the problem. If you want to teach people about British and English culture and history in England then just fucking do it - we do it in Wales and nobody complains that it isn't fair to immigrants etc. I think the narrative surrounding immigration in England is more to blame than anything else, honestly.

As a student in Wales I learnt about Welsh history, Welsh politics and all that stuff. From primary school right through to my history A-level.

As someone who is not mechanically minded either (everyone just expects you to be if you ride though for some reason) I just had to bite the bullet and go with my gut at first (tyre kicking ensued...). After a few years you do build up an awareness of what to watch out for. Some of the non mechanical clues I use to help my overall picture of the bike are:

- Mileage: 2000 a year is around average, so aim for under this for a bike that's had an easy life
- Cosmetics: Always a good sign it's been looked after if it's pristine (no scratches, broken plastics, dings in the tank etc)
- Storage: Make sure it's been kept in a garage
- Service history: Check the stamps, full service history is needed
- Reason for sale: Best case is a something very shiny in the garage next to it
- Starting: If it's running when you get there be very wary. Touch the exhaust before they start it, should be stone cold. If not they have warmed it up before you got there so it starts better. If they rev the hell out of it to get it started also avoid.
- The seller: Go with your gut on this one. Shitty seller = Shitty bike
- MOT: If this is within a month then you can pretty much guarantee it won't pass without work. You can do it in your lunch break and it costs a tenner, so why wouldn't they renew it when it would put ££ on the value of the bike

So far I have had 5 companies contact me trying to offer me apprentices.

I have told all of them to fuck off.

Here is one of the emails I received:

&gt; Good Afternoon
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this finds you well.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand you are looking for a XXX and wondered if you may possibly consider one of our apprentices for this post please?
&gt; Here’s further details regarding our company, the programme we deliver and the potential grant available.
&gt; 
&gt; **Company**

&gt; Our company, XXX are one of the leading Learning Providers in the UK with offices in XXX.  We cover Yorkshire as well as having Southern offices.  
&gt; We work with Apprentices in a variety of occupational areas including; Business Administration, Sales, Customer Service, Retail and Warehousing. We are Government funded, therefore charge no fees.
&gt; We are currently working with a number of high calibre 16 to 24 year olds who are seeking employment with local businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; **How it works**

&gt; We screen each of our candidates to check their academic ability, attitude and work ethic prior to sending out any CV’s.
&gt; Any potentials you are interested in, we arrange for you to interview then the successful candidate would be signed up to the course and become your employee.
&gt; They are paid £2.73 ph (min.) whilst on the apprenticeship programme, working a min. of 30 hours per week.  The programme is for a 12 month period after which time you can either recruit, progress to a Level 3 Apprenticeship, or simply part company. 
&gt; With your input we would devise a structured programme for the apprentice to work to which best suits your company and the role.  Our Assessors would then simply visit monthly (with minimal disruption) to witness these tasks being undertaken.
&gt; 
&gt; **4-week trial**

&gt; Please note we can also offer the option of a 4 week trial period prior to the apprenticeship programme starting which provides you the chance to assess the capabilities of the learner and ensure you’re both happy.  This applies to 16-18 year olds who have no previous work experience.
&gt; The trial is at no cost to you and we pay for their travel expenses.  Once the apprenticeship programme starts they then become your employee and the details above apply.
&gt; 
&gt; **£1500 Grant**

&gt; You may also be entitled to a £1500 grant (per apprentice), providing you have not employed an apprentice in the last 12 months and have less than 1000 employees.  The apprentices would need to be signed up at the same time to be eligible for multiple awards.  Therefore if you have any other opportunities this could be particularly beneficial.
&gt; 
&gt; If you would like any additional information regarding this or our (potentially free) NVQ development training opportunities for your existing staff, please drop me a line on XXX or return email.  
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks and I hope to hear from you.

-What the fuck was he was thinking in playing a makeshift defence in the League Cup against Newcastle but a stellar midfield only ? Our best player who didn't need to be on the pitch- to was injured after 9 minutes with disastrous consequences.

-I don't mind losing- at all- I fucking HATE losing because of a lack of effort or urgency. The team are often static in the phase-changes and that's why we get caught out in defence and why other teams regain shape making them really hard to break down in attack.

-Why all the green lads ? It's not fucking table football, you can move forward into the gaping hole past the opposing team's midfield when you've released the ball. Don't fucking trot back two yards unless you're a defensive player.

Unless the laws are intricately crafted by people who have the best intentions for society (i.e not the politicians or the courts) we end up with the original intention being perverted and expanded.

So we repatriate these shitheads, and that's all good. Everyone agrees and all is fine and dandy. Now a few years later, the case law for this event is used to support deporting some other scumbags, and we are all happy too. However, the crime in this case was different but equally deplorable.

Now we have expanded the definition for the law already - one can be deported for 'heinous' crimes. That's all good still, we are all happy. A few more sick fucks get the boot too. great!

But who defined 'heinous' as a legal term? Some might argue crimes against the state also count, which seems ok on the surface but suddenly whistleblowers are deemed 'spies' and booted out even though the crime is nonviolent. So now you have speech chilled for foreigners living in the UK.

Now UKIP get in power (or another nationalist slanted party), and start expanding that law piece by piece. Now you can be deported for any crime considered serious. Just so happens that includes possession with intent to supply. Don't like a pakki? see him smoke a joint, call the police and get him deported.

They're an improvement on the existing Scotland Act 2012 - and not without limitations - but to describe them as ""we've over-delivered on it - it's 'Vow Max' if you like"", as Nick Clegg did today, is simply untrue.

The second biggest problem of course is that these are simply recommendations, and which get implemented and in what form is still very much TBD (and entirely at the discretion of whoever forms the next government).

Even in their limited form it would be good if they were ""implemented in full"", as David Cameron has promised, but he does have some precedent on watering down previous promises.

To [quote JK Rowling](http://hackinginquiry.org/mediareleases/j-k-rowlings-statement-on-david-camerons-response-to-leveson/):

There are two plausible explanations for how Danny died: a) random accident, b) missy planned it and made it look like a random accident. The first is probably what happened, but neither explanation demands further screen time.

&gt;the entire mystery of the Impossible Girl

That mystery was solved in Series 7. Clara jumped into the Doctor's timestream, splintering herself across time.

&gt;why did the Master say he found Gallifrey

She said she knows where it is, not that she found it. She was almost certainly on Gallifrey when it was frozen in another dimension by the Doctor. Since she clearly escaped from it, all she has to know is where she escaped from. And she gets to tease the Doctor about it.

&gt;who is the sister that appeared from the magic trees. There are too many unanswered questions.

She's Maebh's sister, Annabel. She went missing last year (perhaps she ran away; it doesn't matter) and now she's back. She's a plot device, not a person. Her existence, her disappearance, and her reappearance are included only because they add to Maebh's story.

It depends on one's views of house buying. If one were going down the buy-to-let route, then I would whole-heartedly agree with you: one has capital risk, risk of void periods, liquidity risk, etc. The whole enterprise would be massively laden with many risks. Buying a house to live in however may not necessarily be seen as an investment by the purchaser - we all need to live somewhere after all! Arguably it offers more security than renting, especially if the LTV is low and reducing.

If you are going to look at investing, it would be best to use tax wrappers first, such as ISAs and (depending upon term) pensions.

I'm not angry, I was just asking you to stop going on at me about something I didn't say.

&gt; It is strange though that you think its so very important to teach something which, you seem to be implying, shouldnt be taught as true.

I think it should be taught as impartially as possible in order to give people an understanding of other people's beliefs. For example, I know someone who didn't know what an ash cross represented and wiped someones forehead because they thought it was dirt. Obviously not a major thing but understanding people's religious beliefs is a good thing even if you don't believe them yourself in order to understand people.

&gt; I get that you think its ""massively"" important to our society

Are you suggesting understanding it isn't? I didn't say religion was, that's another debate, but that seems to be your main issue here. All I said was that it's important to understand it because of the huge implications it has for our society and the world at large.

I think he is just jaded, I think he as a incarnation of a old person looks at the world and realises he can not save it from its self.

&gt;Why is the Doctor suddenly in so much self-doubt about his status as a ""good man""? Where did that come from? And why does he suddenly dislike soldiers?

he always struck those cords, he never liked UNIT and he always acted with the fear of a self aware bull in a china shop, knowing that he can be the killer of worlds the second he lets go and lets his anger dominate him.

&gt;The Doctor disappearing from the Moon, for example, was completely out of character but it gave Clara a convenient reason to be upset at him.

actually it is in his caracter, he often let races decide their own fate, now I give you that the ending was retardedly anticlimactic but I rewriten the end in mind and consider that clara saved humanity's colective soul at the price of a moon.

I think Moffat was told to press on the female viewers ego to keep them watching despite not having a young hot doctor(the first hint of a death of the love affair was very cringe worthy right at the first episode, almost infantile). I think the show was barely saved by the last episodes because Coleman can not be a leading lady, she has some chops for drama and comedy but she can't carry a show especially when it's dumped on her like the writers did this season.

&gt;Do Clara and the Doctor seem like real three-dimension people you feel like you understand and empathise with?

They do, they just aren't allowed to wear the character naturally, they are pigeonholed in bullshit typecasts and they need to be a certain type of ""companion"" or ""doctor"". When the writers let Capaldi be ruthless, smart and officer like, it fit him like a glove and added something new to the caracter. When clara was allowed to be a scared insecure girl, you felt her fear, you lived trough her you felt the danger. When the writers reversed roles and made the doctor ""human"" and clara more ""time lord"" it fell flat, even stank of bad casting.

false,collinsl02,null,null,"I can give you a bit of advice on the ATC side - I did a placement in NATS, the UK's Air Navigation Services Provider.

NATS provides the facilities and equipment for the RAF's Air Controllers based in the UK, and is the only Air Navigation Service Provider in the UK, so whichever route you decided to take you will come into contact with them.

To be a controller, in any company, you must have a very specific mindset and group of skills. You must be able to think rapidly in three dimensions whilst talking to people, working out a constantly changing plan of events, processing other information, and take decisions that could affect the lives of thousands of people. You must be prepared to respond rapidly to your plan going awry, and you must be able to handle periods of high stress without losing clarity of thought.

I have to say now though that 98% of the people who apply to the course fail - a lot of them don't make the grade at the application stage, and a lot more wash out during training. The reason is, as I said above, the mindset and skillset is so specific that most people can't do it.

Have a look at the webpage for NATS - they have some skill test games on there which should give a good indication of what skills you need to apply.

It is often said that an air traffic controller is someone who will sit down in a restaurant, and will look at the menu and say ""I want that, that and that"" very quickly, and they will choose completely different things each time. 

It is also said of a controller that they have three brains - a normal workload for a controller will be talking to a flight that they can hear through their right ear, whilst another controller gives them a handover on the phone in their left ear, and whilst they are reading the weather off a screen and talking to their manager stood behind them.
