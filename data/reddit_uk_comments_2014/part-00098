As the vomiting took place, the patient was made to associate that pain with the eroticism of that gay imagery.  The process I think was an hour or something, but the goal was that to feel absolute humiliation, sickness and pain associated with being homosexual.

Truly shocking that sort of treatment was prescribed by a doctor or psychologist many years ago.  They had a doctor on the show that did all that and even said that it didn't cure any homosexuality in his patients.

Back during the Cold War, you could call your opponent 'communist' and it would actually have some connotations with the public. 'Communism' was the USSR, it was the main threat to world peace nuclear, it was a removal of democracy and rights, it was everything nobody wanted. Of course the USSR didn't represent Marxism or Leninism, but that didn't matter, because the only real communism during the Cold War was the type the USSR had. 

Nowadays, what does 'communism' connote? There's no USSR left, and although China is communist, with a lack of rights and poor living standards, nobody wants to attack them (verbally) because everyone wants a slice of their economy. 'Communism' is no longer a threat, really, and someone using it to attack anyone sounds even more ridiculous than it would have done during the Cold War.

Also, even in the classic series, the Time Lords were rarely even mentioned, yet alone had any relevance to the plot. They were always a part of the Doctor's history even when they weren't on screen.

It's not like RTD said ""the time lords? never heard of them, that was just a gag, it's not part of the show any more, we've eliminated that crap"". Instead, there was a chance to talk about what they had been without an ability to bring them on-screen. As we've seen from the regular appearance of the daleks, sometimes it's best to have things not being the focus of the show.

He didn't remove part of the Doctor's past. He made that part something that wasn't going to be damaged by constantly saying ""hey, I know what can solve this problem, let's make the time lords show up and fix everything"".

Also, the 50th anniversary was Moffat proving that he's a genuinely brilliant writer.

The new spousal visa system is a rort - basically if your spouse isn't from the EU the UK passport holder needs to have a job in the UK with a minimum income of however much for six months *before you can apply*.  Meaning that the UK passport holder needs to move to the UK and work for six months, *then* apply for their spouse to move over.  Regardless of whether or not spouse is the breadwinner, you have children, etc. etc.

The alternative is called Surinder Singh - you move to the EU for three months, exercise EU treaty rights (i.e. you work somewhere for three-six months) and show that your new European country is your 'center of life' (volunteer, get involved in clubs etc.).

Now whilst I have some sympathy with the younger segment of UK society (I would not want to be 'starting out' as an 18yo in today's job market) if more people under the age of 40 actually gave a shit, or bothered to overcome their apathy toward the  political system and their place within it, this kind of pitching might actually be aimed at issues or policies that mattered to them.

How do we kick-start this engagement given the 4-year cycles of statecraft  and solving complex, long-term, almost intractable global issues, from younger folk when they (we?) are all used to quick-hit instant endorphin-driving gratification from our media, using our purchasing 'power' and our technology?

Perhaps we need to drive politics in this direction? No system is perfect, but the current crop of meglomaniac, ex-SPAD career politicians who roam the halls of westminster whose only interest is preserving the status quo and the block-vote wielding parties they represent, who no longer exist for any other purpose than getting re-elected seems untenable.

In some situations yes we should, it's the cheaper option.  Take for example a DM story from 2 - 4 years ago about a benefits cheat.  He'd taken the system for £50k.   Woooo big money mention in large text.

Buried in the actual text of the article was a throwaway line that he'd been at it for 15 years or so.   That's not £50 grand a year for 15+ years, that's £50k TOTAL. 

Assuming the figure was reported correctly it works out at somewhere around £170 a fortnight or £3k - £4k a year.  The DWP spends more than that on coffee a year.  In the grand scheme of their budget it's not even a noticeable expenditure. 

Besides which I'm not convinced all the ""benefits cheats"" actually are.  One of my relatives applied only for things the DWP staff said he should, when he died they were throwing ""benefits fraud"" around in their communications with the estate.   I honestly think if he'd of made it another year he'd of been on the front of the DM being portrayed as some evil scheming leech of the system... which wasn't the case.

true,Motholax,Christs,Christ's,"1. Lots of people get in via the IB, it's becoming more popular in the UK and a lot of international students do it as well.
2. The university has guidelines about how they compare foreign grades to British ones, I'm not sure what they think of Chilean qualifications but doing IB is probably a plus. The best way to find out is to email an admissions tutor (any college would be fine at this point, the admissions tutor's job is to help as many people to apply as possible).
3. In the UK offers are usually made to be conditional on getting certain grades before your final exams, though early January is usually when offers are made so you would know pretty quickly if you got in or not.
4. No college has a particular reputation for medicine, the vast majority of your teaching is run by the university anyway. The pool system means everyone who applies should have an equal chance of getting a place at a college, even if it's not the one you applied to. You should just apply to the college you like best. As you can't make it to an open day I would rather biasedly recommend Christ's as it is wonderful.
5. I don't think I've met any Chileans but I've definitely met people from other South American countries and all over the world. There is a University Chilean society with a Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/420252121345287/ , you might want to ask them some questions.
6. Some colleges have a reputation for poor food but generally it's alright, though cooking facilities are limited at most colleges. If you're really bothered about food Pembroke has a Michelin starred chef.
7. You don't have to work all the time. Medics have a pretty heavy workload but there's lots of time to do other things (stereotypically drinking for medics).
8. IGCSE grades are potentially helpful but not hugely important if you didn't do many because of your country's education system. For foreign qualifications, it's really best to ask an admissions tutor.
9. They won't expect you to come to Cambridge from Chile just for an interview. You can do Skype interviews or there will probably be interviews run somewhere in the USA if it's affordable for you to get there. Again, ask an admissions tutor.
10. Yes. Generally medicine applicants are expected to have some experience in a hospital or clinic.
11. They're looking for people who have already got some good grades and have the potential to excel. They won't look for specific extracurricular activities but they like to see evidence of commitment to things and time management ability.

We knew the director at Coventry football club when they were in the prem and he got us tickets to the Liverpool match. It was the one Harkness broke his leg in.

Well anyway me and my dad went suited and booted. I was a full kit hero, scarf, rosette and hat plus about 9 years old. Suffice to say we ended up in the home Coventry stand. No one was out of order, but we got our fair share of grief.

After the match the fella who got us the tickets spotted us and must have realised what happened. He felt awful so he got us in the players lounge.

My dad gave my a big talk about not being star stuck and treating them like normal people and we walk in.

Well I see Collymore, Fowler and Macca! I absolutely lose my shit, tears in eyes the lot. My dad starts to get frustrated and embarrassed a bit. 

So someone walks over to cheer me up and get me a pop from the bar. ITS IAN FUCKING RUSH, at the age I wasn't really aware of Rush and chilled out. My dad could hardly breathe and dropped his pint and it went on to smash all over the floor. 

A couple of awkward laughs were shared and we found a table in the corner, everyone was so sound all day after that. Had a Photo with Collymore at the bar (but lost it years ago). Was genuinely one of the best/worst days of my life. 

On the way home I got a huge lecture on how Rush is King and Fowler/Collymore aren't a patch on him. From that day on I was a huge Rush fan and Fowler went on to become God! Collymore didn't go on to be as successful though hahaha

Chelsea to get 85 points, winning all their remaining games with a draw at Liverpool.



----

I think Liverpool's defence is poor and when they come up against decent attacks they will ship goals. They're conceding 2.5 goals a game for the last month - and that's against relegation and mid-table teams. Chelsea's defence is solid, they've had a few cock-ups last week which might have cost them the title, but I think it will sharpen them up for the rest of the run-in. Mourinho's record vs. top 4 teams this season speaks for itself, he'll get himself a draw.

As for our game against them - Im terrified of Sterling and SAS running in behind Demichelis, I hope Nasty is fit because it is against pacy teams Demi has struggled all season and liverpool are rapid. If we can stay half sharp though we should score enough to keep it to a draw.

---

Other than that I'd love Everton to get 4th place but I think losing to us would rule that out - Arsenal have easier remaining games and Ramsey looked like he made a big difference despite only playing 20 mins. Arsenal 4th.

Leeds is also another place to consider. By starting up north it could enable you to have a better quality of life until you can afford one of the more expensive places in your list. Also if it's a few years you are considering staying then look into how you will travel.  Your list of places are somewhat off the beaten track in terms of train travel, I doubt you could afford a car as insurance would be prohibitively expensive at your age. Bus travel is not the best, do able, but trains are better on most trips (cost v time saving)

York has a very large student population coupled with a lot of tourists, it's very friendly and given the info you have provided would probably meet the majority of your needs and provide you with a good base to explore the uk.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"I agree, the defenders were on their game yesterday. MS^2 (Skrtel and Sakho) did their job really really well, both had interventions that showed a lot of concentration, awareness and anticipation. It was good to see, especially when one considers some questionable in-play decisions DA had made, in some of the matches he started, in the previous weeks. The decisions Martin and Mamadou made were, as a whole, significantly better.

West Ham set out to use their physicality and pure strength to keep us at bay and it worked very well against our attackers. How often this season was a team able to keep Raheem Sterling as quiet as WHU did yesterday? Sturridge wasn't able to be as effective due to our lack of penetration, from the flanks, as well as through the middle. Suarez had a tough time as well, most of his chances he created himself. Allardyce prepared a really good game plan for them. Coutinho and Flano were both muscled off the ball a few times. I was briefly worried West Hams physicality will win them at least a point. It was a very tough away game and the tactics West Ham employed yesterday will have worked so often. Thankfully we were able to edge them enough to score two goals.

However, I feel BR was the man who delivered us the win yesterday. He recognized his team was being out-muscled, at times even out-outmaneuvered. Rodgers corrected that with the introduction of Lucas for the second half. While in the first half Liverpool were caught in possession very often and, on occasion, bullied off the ball, LL added a lot of steel, strength and stamina to our midfield, as well as more passing angles. That resulted in LFC matching West Ham, while retaining a lot of our skill and penetrating ability.

I'd have a very difficult time choosing our best unit on the pitch. Between our defense (a very good game overall, but we did concede, even if there was a foul in the build-up) and the midfield (second half performance was very very good and that really tipped the scales in our favor). Our attack was, literally, blunted very effectively, but there are probably no other teams that could do it as well as the Hammers yesterday. For me the key factor was the decision Brendan Rodgers made as well as the timing of it.

What value is there in rising house prices if people aren't taking the capital out of it? None. It's the same as a high share price, you don't have any money until you sell. It makes people *feel* good to see the numbers going up but in practical terms it does nothing but slow the economy down. Workers have to make sub-optimal decisions on where to live which reduces their happiness (Longer Commute vs. Spending more on housing vs. Living in a 'bad' area). London is trading on it's credentials as a Global City which acts as a magnet for jobs and wealth, we need to do a better job of extracting wealth from foreign investment.

&gt;Ideally improve standards at the same time too. The state of some new build timber framed rabbit hutches that are apparently houses, is pretty shocking (and I don't buy the ""no land' nonsense that people typically argue, there's plenty of it even in the South East)

Check out the blog I linked to. One of the posts is talking about increasing the least dense parts of London up to the average density levels. That alone will yield housing for *millions* of people.

The issue of space and housing standards is somewhat separate. There is guidance issued by the Mayor's office in London which talks about design and space of new residential dwellings. If we're going to build upwards, we ought to justify that by increasing square metreage at the same time.",0,1396865794,null,0,false,0,cgm4ypz,t3_22cdjc,t1_cgm4ypz,t1_cgm3g6m,null,1433245334,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Well I didn't say that, so you can laugh all you want but don't put words in my mouth. I said 'Religious Evangelical' not zealots. My point is people don't like to be preached at by either side.

However what is laughable is the assertion that militant atheists are some hotbed of *""well-educated, secular scholars""*.

* Pull old, slightly-cracked mug out of cupboard
* Chuck in a teabag of whichever generic brand you prefer, usually one of PG Tips, Tetley, Yorkshire, or even a supermarket own-brand
* When the kettle boils, pour it over the teabag in the mug
* Let it sit for a little while, usually a minute or so is plenty, basically you just wait till it looks ""ready""
* Stir, squeeze the teabag, remove it from the mug, add milk

London's great if you know people and have some money but if you're on a limited budget probably best to treat it as a weekend visit sometime until you've found your feet.  That's not to say you couldn't make it work, but I'd say it'd be a slightly even bigger leap into the unknown.

Manchester and Bristol are great cities, I'd throw in Leeds too near Manchester.  All have different feels, Bristol being more Bohemian, leafy, chilled, but you better like walking up hills.  Manchester being more grey, cold, traditionally industrious, but with more of a persoanl culture/identity - to my mind anyway.

If you know what time-window you're going to be arriving I'd say start looking into the different festivals and annual events the city holds.  If music is your thing check out then check out the annual music concert/festival scene.  Time a visit if you can when the city is showcasing itself.

For my money, for what it is worth, if you're thinking Liverpool then I'd say look instead at Chester.  Smaller, but slightly larger than Nottingham.  Studenty feel, green, up and coming, and within easy traveling distance of Liverpool city centre.  Let's put it this way, Chester FC being supporter owned and all the way down in the Conference league, is going to be a cheap day out (£15), but when you do want to splash out on a big premiership game you've got Everton and Liverpool on your doorstep.

Smaller than Nottingham still is Norwich which isn't on your list, but a great little sunny city/town and a short trip from the Norfolk Broads for lazy-boozy summer weekends.

OP said they wanted to try British tea. Seriously, we nowhere near put that amount of thought into a cuppa. There's not some big mystical ritual around it, nor do we generally give a toss about exotic brands or loose leaf (unless you're extremely upper middle class).

1) Get tea bag - just plain old black tea, none of this darjeeling business.

2) Put in mug - not some fancy bone china or expensive frippery. A plain old mug, sometimes chipped, sometimes with some form of slogan or humerous animal on it.

3) Pour in water from kettle - if it's finished boiling within the last few minutes it'll still be fine, none of this ""must be boiling"" bollocks. If it's hot enough to be steaming then it's absolutely fine.

4) Stir and let sit for a bit. If you're timing how long you wait then you are doing this so badly wrong that I can't even express it. Varies on your taste, from a few seconds to a few minutes.

5) Add milk/sugar to your tastes. My SO thinks sugar in tea is vile. I think no sugar in tea is disgusting. There are no rules here.

6) Drink. Whilst doing something else though - you don't just sit and have a cup of tea, you have one whilst chatting, watching the TV, reading the news, doing some work, etc... I'm having a cuppa as I write this.

Pricing depends on each college - i.e Christ Church will usually let you stay for 9th week, but after that they'll start getting conference bookings, so they'll chuck you out of your room (or at best, they'll offer you another less desirable room, often out of college). Some colleges i.e Wolfson or some of the further out colleges are more relaxed about it as demand might not be so high.

Assuming undergraduate, usually (depending on college again) you'll have rooms/accommodation offered for your 1st year as a minimum: a lot of colleges then encourage 2nd &amp; 3rd years to live out - but it all depends what they've got available. The bigger colleges such as CHCH and (I think Magdalen) can technically offer college accommodation over the three years.",0,1396869975,null,0,false,0,cgm5nvy,t3_22ewcm,t1_cgm5nvy,t3_22ewcm,null,1433245664,3,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,3

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_337459.pdf Is the full report from ONS about the seasonal mortality rate, you'll see from the facts and figures that over the course of the last hundred years less and less people have died during the winter, we had a cold winter at the end of 2012-2013 which accounted for more deaths through illness, end of life conditions. I won't disagree that some of those deaths can be linked to poor insulation of peoples homes but this isn't entirely the governments responsibility to resolve. 

The report even documents that despite a lower number of influenza rates, because of the colder weather more people died from it. 

Go back five years and you'll find the figures of mortality in the year 2007/8 match 2012/13 with only 2011/12 having less than 2012/13's deaths.

Bah - fuzzing the discussion with semantics isn't the way forward, but to clear things up, zealot and evangelist are basically synonyms to non-religious people.  If you have enough zeal to be evangelical, you're a zealot.  

 The country needs more people like Dawkins and Hitchens, not fewer.  Let's have some time for fucking common sense instead of kowtowing to 2000 year old bullshit in the name of political correctness. 

&gt;militant atheists are some hotbed of ""well-educated, secular scholars"".

Ignoring 'militant' which you seem to think is a perjorative when it comes to atheism (no problem with evangelicals asserting themselves from pulpits apparently though), you're conceptually muddled.  Atheism isn't full of well-educated secular scholars; groups of well-educated people are full of atheists.

&gt;Well-educated, secular scholars can be found in all walks of life and from all faiths

They're not secular if they're of a faith.  By definition.  Just because their day jobs aren't theological doesn't mean that these are inherently secular people.  If they believe in fairies in the sky then frankly I'd be questioning the value of whatever expensive education they may have had.

true,gasdf13211324,null,null,"I doubt it.. there is clearly some reason, but it may well be unwritten and only known to a couple of people. If asked to speculate, I think it is basically because the UK inter bank payment systems (BACS, FP) are dangerously insecure (too many entities have complete access to debit and credit other people's accounts). Normally this isn't a problem because the transfers can be reversed, but if that were to happen on a bitcoin exchange it would collapse the exchange and result in an mtgox situation where many people would be missing money.

Now.. that shouldn't necessarilly be an insurmountable issue.. if the exchanges properly identify all their customers then if a payment gets reversed out of one of their accounts at least in theory that customer can be taken to court to retreive the money.. the question is can that actually happen? What if the customer's exchange account and bank accounts were hacked or the account was setup using a stolen identity? or even if the customer just can't be forced to pay up? The exchange would have to eat that loss.. most exchanges so far are run on a shoestring buget and wouldn't be able to cope with that.

Mastercard/Visa don't seem to have any problem with processing bitcoin payments.. I don't know if there are any UK based card processors who would take this on, but it doesn't really matter what jurisdiction the card payments processing happens in. It is already possible to use a cashplus (or I suppose Think Money) account to buy BTC using the credit card side of the account - through liqpay (a russian/ukranian payment intermediary) at relatively low markups. Similarly such a payment company could be encouraged to enable inexpensive SWIFT transfers.. perhaps with similar backend settlement agreements to allow for cheaper transfers to banks commonly used by bitcoin exchanges.

UK Banks also have no issues sending SWIFT or SEPA payments to bitcoin exchanges so I think it's safe to say that the banks themselves are not against bitcoin.. the problems are related to BACS/FP specifically.

It could also be that direct debits (rather than customer initiated payments) might be preferable to banks.. a bitcoin exchange could setup a direct debit relationship with their customers and withdraw money rather than getting the customer to send it.. on the surface this seems even more insecure.. but it does nicely limit each customer to withdrawing from one (hopefully their) bank account.

They are simply not allowed to do that as stated in the Sales of Goods Act. Statutory rights cannot be negated or ignored - as this statement does.

Pretty much irrelevant. The race was the product, and it wasn't delivered.

&gt; If you pay for something, show up and use the rest of the facilities (except a bottle of water) that it provided then complain then you're still getting your run and demanding it for free. That seems daft.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Excerpt from a book by George Best:

&gt; In 1967, we arrived at Anfield to play Liverpool and as I glanced out of the window of the coach I saw Bill Shankly standing at the main entrance. I was the first player to alight from the coach and when I reached the entrance Bill shook my hand warmly. 'Good to see you again, George,' he said. 'You're looking well, son.'

&gt; This was unusual for him, and knowing Shanks to be a wily old fox, I decided to hang around to try to find out what he was up to. As each of the United players entered Anfield, Shanks shook his hand, welcomed him and told him how good he looked. Eventually, Bobby Charlton, a born worrier, came up to Shanks.

&gt; 'Bobby, son. Good to see you,' Shanks said, shaking his hand. 'But by God, if ever there was a man who looked ill, it's you, Bobby!'

&gt; Bobby's face went as colourless as an icicle. 'Ill? I look ill?' he repeated, running the fingers of his right hand over his forehead and down his right cheek. He was visibly shaken, * *'Aye, Bobby, son. You look like you're sickening for something. If I were you I'd see a doctor as soon as you set foot back in Manchester.' Shanks patted Bobby on the back and took off down the corridor, leaving him trembling in the foyer.

&gt; In the dressing room, Bobby was conspicious by his absence and, ominously, there was a delay in announcing the team. We sat around kicking our heels, no one daring to get changed in case Matt Busby had a tactical plan which meant leaving one of us out. The thought of getting changed only to be told to put your clothes back on because you're not in the team is a player's nightmare.

&gt; Eventually Matt Busby entered the dressing room with Jimmy Murphy and told us they had reshuffled the team which had beaten West Ham the previous week. Bobby Charlton was unavailable.

We'd also need to pay maintenance, plus fairly extensive replacement and decorating costs on at least a 5 year basis, similarly to how private landlords do (or should morally, but often don't). In addition, we would need a pretty extensive machinery to manage this, on a par with a medium sized property management company. If we didn't want to run this ourselves, we'd have to pay someone like countrywide to do it - but they would want paying per house and for each call out for maintenance.

**In an extract from the explosive new book, The Special One, Real Madrid players are accused of betraying team secrets by a raging José Mourinho**

The presence of a mole at Real Madrid worried Mourinho so much that between 2011 and 2012 he ordered two sweeps of the hotel where the team stayed to search for hidden microphones. The investigations were unsuccessful. The Sheraton Mirasierra was apparently clean.

The control of information was another thing that deeply exercised Mourinho; he assigned a group of people to carry out a daily analysis of everything that the media said about him. Every morning Mourinho received a package containing the summary. His day began at 8am in his office at Valdebebas, studying videos, articles and broadcasts. He realised that he and his colleagues were not the only sources of the content, and that certain things that were being published did not exactly project an image of infallibility.

He began to suspect that there were leaks in his organisation. The proximity of the Clásico ramped up his sense of suspicion. According to club sources, the growing fear of leaks made Mourinho ask the directors to set up a study of the phone records of players and club employees. Some players were warned about this informally, as it was in their interest to be careful about whom they spoke to on their mobiles. The secrecy, however, did not prevent the boss’s intentions becoming widely known. In fact they were obvious in every training session.

At 5pm on 16 April 2011, shortly before Madrid’s home league match against Barcelona, the newspaper Marca reported in its online edition that Madrid would play Pepe in midfield, along with Khedira and Alonso. The team selection was unprecedented: Casillas, Ramos, Albiol, Carvalho, Marcelo, Pepe, Khedira, Alonso, Di María, Ronaldo and Benzema.

The 1-1 draw did not help the home team’s title chances but the crowd applauded their team off with a certain relief, Barça’s last couple of visits having ended with scores of 0–2 and 2–6, and filed out of the stadium reasonably content. Not so Mourinho.
He waited for the team in the dressing room before issuing a torrent of accusations and insults that distorted his face until he began to sob loudly: “You’re traitors. I asked you not to speak with anyone about the team selection but you’ve betrayed me. It shows that you’re not on my side. You’re sons of bitches.
“The only friend I have in this dressing room is Granero . . . and I’m not even sure that I can trust him any more. You’ve left me all on my own. You’re the most treacherous squad I’ve had in my life. Nothing more than sons of bitches.”

Casillas did not wait for the outburst to finish. He pretended that nothing was happening, turned around and went to the shower; he was not the only one who ignored the commotion. But Mourinho was filled with such intense emotion that he grabbed a can of Red Bull and hurled it against the wall. It exploded and drops of the sugary energy drink ran down the faces of those nearest to him.

Squatting on the ground — some say he was kneeling — he rattled off a further series of insults, then, getting up, he wiped the tears from his face and announced that he was going to speak with Pérez [Real’s president] and Sánchez [a director] because they would be able to find the mole. He promised reprisals and also made an analogy between martial law and football: “If I’m in Vietnam and I see you laugh at a mate, I’d grab a gun with my own hands and kill you. Now it’s you yourselves who have to look for the one that leaked the line-up.”
For everyone present it was difficult to work out if what they had seen was a real loss of emotional control or a piece of spontaneous theatre. By improvisation or calculation, Mourinho had ensured that everyone had been on edge. The team had been emotionally stirred up and he had adjusted the final details of his grand tactical plan. All his work, all his energy, the planning of more than nine months, were now focused on one goal: to reach a state of ecstasy in the final of the Copa del Rey in Valencia on 20 April.

The days were filled with impassioned talk until finally 20 April arrived. He talked about politics, about nationalism, about the inexorable division between the Castilian and Catalan peoples. He told the players that they had nothing in common with Barça. He knew, he said, because he had lived in Barcelona for many years, and was well aware of the local culture and the education that Catalan children receive. He explained that people like Puyol, Busquets, Xavi and Piqué had been taught from childhood to distance themselves from Spaniards such as Casillas, Ramos and Arbeloa.

He insisted that his players were wrong if they thought they had made friendships with the Barça players over their years together in the Spanish national team. The Barça players were not their friends because they took advantage of this supposed friendship by betraying the Madrid players, trying to snatch their prestige from them through their manipulation of the press.

They, the Madrid players, were not to participate in this charade any more. They must accept their role as bad guys and should refuse to acknowledge their rivals. Mourinho warned his players that if he saw any of them shaking hands outside of the formalities of the game they would be turning their backs on him — and on their team-mates. Anyone making any such friendly gesture towards the opposition ran the risk of becoming something very much like a traitor.

&gt; On Monday the Daily Telegraph made further allegations regarding Mrs Miller's home in Wimbledon, south-west London, which was sold this year for more than £1m above its 1995 purchase cost.

&gt; In 2009 she redesignated it as her main residence and stopped claiming second-home allowances on it. 

&gt; Also in 2009, in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, MPs were advised to pay capital gains tax on the sale of any home for which they had claimed allowances.

So, she was able to take taxpayer funded expenses towards the mortgage on a house that was her ""second"" home at the time. In 2009, just before the rules changed, she ""flipped"" her primary and second homes and was able to sell the house that *was* her second home without paying capital gains tax - because it is now her ""primary"" home. So, effectively, the taxpayer has bankrolled a mortgage which allowed her to make a tidy, tax free profit of £1m. She managed to do that *just* before new parliamentary standards came in which would make that unethical.

So while going to war with a nation to depose a ruthless bloody dictator may be a justifiable reason to wage war if your true motivations are simply for a certain commodity in that nation then what will likely result is simply replacing that dictator with another who may even be worse than the last but still supply you with the commodity so who cares.

Why not? Stay for a month (best not to blow all your money!). Visit those cities you mention. Maybe you LOVE it here and want to stay. 

Maybe you have doubts - perhaps the same doubts as before - and realise that it's not the location that's the problem.

Moving from the UK to the US or vice versa is a LOT of work. If you get married to someone over here then MAYBE it will be easier, but they're not stupid - they're looking out for that sort of thing.

My best friend went the other way - meeting a girl over in the US and deciding to get married and live there. It's been two years, but he now has a job and residency, and given a few more years he may become a citizen. 

However before that they considered getting her over here to live - and it didn't work. Even thought they were married she couldn't actually stay, and so they were separated for a month or two until he could go back there.

Now the point is not that you need to get married. The point is that it was VERY difficult for them even though they WERE married.

So come visit. Stay. Enjoy. Then if you like it so much you're willing to jump through all the crap to come live here then no doubt you'll put in that work required.

We first saw signs on this back when he got Hoddle sacked through the media. Rumour has it that he clashed and did the same with AVB and was The Sun's 'source' when they were bashing him every week. 

LVG has touted himself for the job in the media. He is a manager who will command respect from players and staff alike, purely down to what he has achieved during his career. We need to be pulling out all the stops to get a top class manager like this as it won't come around very often. 

My fear is if we go for another option then we'll go through another few years of the Levy show if it doesn't work out straight away.

Watch for speed limit signs, speeding will be an immediate fail, travelling too slowly will also result in a fail. Having said that, endure you keep your following distance correct, 2 seconds in dry conditions, 4 in wet.

Don't bother overtaking if the vehicle in front is within 10mph of the speed limit, you won't be expected to filter on the test.

Ensure you know your highway code, but don't expect other road users to follow it.

If you're in the wrong lane on a roundabout for the direction you were asked to go, just take the exit that lane is for, you will not be penalised for taking the wrong exit but will fail if you do something dangerous. Same goes for if you're overtaking on a dual carriageway and can't make the exit, just carry on and the examiner will give you further instructions.

We also had a unit dedicated to taking prisoners out of our hands and dealing with them so we could get back on patrol. Holding onto a prisoner so that you could get your SD was extremely unlikely. So charges and cautions were out of the window, as were most PNDs as they all required arrest and investigation of some kind. So come the end of the month, you'd have a lot of response team officers desperately trying to find people carrying cannabis so that a warning could be issued. 

If you didn't meet the targets, you were less likely to get any courses you wanted to go on, and more likely to be exiled to a team you didn't want to be on, like a safer neighbourhood team or the like. This is still done now, the management just won't admit it. 

Another big problem with it was that it took no consideration for context. Took two weeks holiday and spent one week at court? Better reach your target within the remaining week then. Assigned to a report car for a month, so you spend all day taking statements and creating reports? Bad luck, you should have got your SDs during your lunchbreak.

I hope that people can be tolerant and accepting of homosexuals, so this isn't an anti-gay statement in any way. But there ARE many homosexuals who would rather be straight for their own reasons, and not necessarily because of societal pressure. In that case, is it wrong to try and treat them if they feel they SHOULD be straight but they were born gay. I would draw a similarity with somebody who feels they are a man born in a female body.

We would offer the transsexual person a chance for therapy and potentially surgery.

As I said, I don't want him as our manager next season because I want someone with a history and a reputation in order to add/keep quality players, and I certainly am not campaigning for Sherwood as manager of the year, but I do think he has done a good job overall and I would love for him to stay with Spurs in some fashion.

Plus with a much smaller constituency size you can literally knock on every door if you are committed enough, which is something you definitely can't so as an MP.

Finally the campaigning is much more even at a local level, each candidate gets a free ""mail shot"" and no-one can spend more than £1000 on campaigning compared to the general election where it's a lot higher.

Of course it's pretty easy, but fanhood's about rising above the negative and cheering on in the face of adversity. Being behind the team in the bad and the good.

Considering that he was always a temporary coach and there was literally no-one else available for the post which is why we hired him, there appears to me to be no reason to turn on him when we've no other options at this time anyways.

It comes across as fans who've let themselves get above their station.

At worst he's made just as many mistakes as AVB, for his given time frame, but to me that's not even important. I see it as the club is in a bad situation, we fire AVB and it turns out there's no-one else to get in as manager, we get a temporary manager in (everyone knew this) and we either support the team and new manager until the end of the season where we regroup and find someone new.

Obviously we don't have the full story at the moment but by the sounds of it thats what the union is negotiating for while understanding that savings need to be made somewhere and the company is trying to work with them on it. To me this sounds like an example of a Company-Union relation working properly, almost exactly the opposite of the Grangemouth saga.

Sakho is the best passing center back we have, he is the most physically imposing player we have, he is our best defender in a one on one situation in my opinion and he intercepts a lot of passes and wins a lot of aerial duels.

When you play him with Skrtel, it looks like a natural combination. Sakho defends on the front foot and can get a counter attack started or pass positively in our possession game while Skrtel covers and is usually there for a last ditch tackle or block.

true,Lou3000,flair1,,"Ultimately, I think the biggest issue with Sherwood really isn't his fault.  It isn't his nonsensical lineups or his candid interviews.  Levy should never have given him an 18 month contract.  If Sherwood was really playing hardball with contract terms, then he should have been relegated to the youth squad and a caretaker should have been appointed for the remainder of the season.  

The task was monumental.  Take a dysfunctional squad juggling Europa and PL with an extensive list of injuries and move them from 5th place into 4th in one of the most competitive top 7 in years.  All while enduring Levy's rumored discussions with replacements.  

Though, let's not pity Sherwood too much, this is business.  He knew full well what he was doing.  Levy isn't exactly loyal to coaches, Sherwood demanded a contract, and he should have known the squad and the problems he was inheriting.

In the end, I really hope that this was all ""part of the plan.""  Van Gaal arrives and Sherwood leaves happy because he knew he was really just interim management and his 18 month contract was just an excuse to give him a nice little severance package, and we all move forward anew.

  Cat follows me to train station screaming at me because she didn't want to be following me along a noisy main road but decided to do it anyway. Happens every now and then. She doesn't ever make it passed The Bridge Of Terror so she stops and trots back angrily. I often worry she won't make it back.  
  Early train, had to stand for the 45 minutes, again. I pay nearly 200 quid per month to stand most mornings. Such is life, but I often think it shouldn't be like that. 
  
  Desk at around 8. Threw on the coffee machine and turned on the screens. There's not much to do, as I'm out for the majority of the week. Sipped fresh coffee and lazily filled out some trade reports. Mostly cut and paste jobs.  
  
  Liased with slimy and dangerously two faced PR guy. He's not my sort of person, but he does his job as long as he gets paid, and makes life easier when it comes to company profile. Well connected chap, but I suspect when we stop paying him he'll cause us problems. Still, he serves a purpose.  
  
  Meeting with old guy mid morning, virtually no agenda so it just turned into a chat in his offices over coffee. He supports a rival football team.  
  
  Lunch of Katsu curry. Washed down with coffee. Afternoon of preparing and binding some presentations I'll be doing on my trip. Mostly dull but I couldn't be arsed to delegate it away as I had very little to do. Spotted some things I have to tweak, but it's too late now. Next week.

(BTW, please imagine a genial, conversational tone to the following words)

I had no idea that loose tea was considered so posh, snooty or upper class. Do I seriously sound like a mega-pretentious American douche-nozzle for recommending it? 

Well, allow me to mount a brief defense of my advice- following that, I think I'll never discuss tea again on Reddit!

1) Earl Grey is a popular tea choice in America (available at most any  diner such as Denny's) and it's not unreasonable to suppose OP might consider that as a good choice. And my advice was to *avoid* said tea flavor. Was that bad advice?

2) I suggest loose tea for two reasons- you can brew tea more easily to your tastes (weak or strong) and it's cheaper and more cost-effective than the bags. Either way- bags/loose - UK tea is not going to be cheap in USA, and loose give you more bang for your buck. 

3) Not letting tea steep past the 5-6 minute mark is a piece of advice I was giving, *specific* to the teas I've had from Taylor's of Harrogate. I'll definitely agree with you that, in the case of PG Tips or Tetley or something like Marks and Spencer Gold/silver, this really doesn't matter. I've accidentally left a PG tips tea bag in for an hour+ and (while not ideal) it certainly doesn't make anything un-drinkable.

If you over-brew Yorkshire Gold, you can strip paint with it. The shit becomes un-drinkable! And that's not my being snooty. It gets acidic and funky-tasting. :)

Instead I was using it as a very common figure of speech meaning something like ""Christians shouldn't adopt a superior attitude and talk down to the rest of society about how people should behave because those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"".

Let me make this clear:

I have provided at least 2 clips of the show that back up the theory that the words ""regeneration cycle"" mean one regeneration.

You have provided:

EDIT: Here's an example I'll provide for you - they're discussing the Master's regens in ""The Deadly Assassin"" and say the following:

&gt; ENGIN: Oh, Doctor, could you please be a little more specific?

&gt; DOCTOR: Yes. He was evil, cunning and resourceful. Highly developed powers of ESP and a formidable hypnotist. And the more I think about it, the less likely it seems.

&gt; ENGIN: What?

&gt; DOCTOR: Well, that the Master would meekly accept the end of his regeneration cycle. It's not his style at all.

&gt; ENGIN: But that's something we must all accept, Doctor.

&gt; (Engin hands the Doctor a drink.)

&gt; DOCTOR: Thank you. Not the Master. No, he had some sort of plan. That's why he came here, Engin.

&gt; ENGIN: After the twelfth regeneration, there is no plan that will postpone death.

Think we deserved to win, just about. Far from impressive again but at this point I dont really care, just go to get those wins to get us over the line!

It was a strange game in that, I think if we had scored first half we would have gone on to win comfortably but we just couldn't make the breakthrough and Aldershot were frustrating us. Second half we were pretty crap in all honesty but once again a John Still sub has made the difference decent ball from Howells and McGeehan scores his first senior goal, very scrappy. The amount of times Still has made the absolute correct call with his substitutions this year is outstanding. 

Aldershot were alright, worked hard etc but I never truely felt they had it in them to get the better of us. Maybe the benefit of hindsight talking but I never felt we would lose it.

So, to address your points in a more friendly fashion:

&gt;  Do I seriously sound like a mega-pretentious American douche-nozzle for recommending it?

Mega? No. Pretentious? Yeah a bit. As I'd inferred, tea is just a drink here. You'd have it like you would a glass of juice or coffee or whatever. Loose leaf just means it'll take longer to prepare and has more cleaning afterwards. A cuppa should be convenient.

&gt; And my advice was to avoid said tea flavor

I do beg your pardon, I misread the tone of that paragraph. The ""MONSTER"" sounded like high praise :) But no, not incorrect, Earl Grey (and indeed most named blends) are not that commonly drunk here. Not to say that there isn't a market for them, but when you ask for or make a cuppa in the UK that generally means bog standard black tea.

&gt; you can brew tea more easily to your tastes (weak or strong)

Here I would suggest you are straying into pretention :) if the flavour matters to you to that degree then you're caring too much about it. It's just tea - whether it's brewed for 3 minutes or 5 minutes makes bugger all difference to the vast majority of the country. Hell, I barely let it sit at all.

&gt; loose give you more bang for your buck

That is a perspective I definitely had not considered, and perfectly valid. Do teabags really cost so much over there?

&gt; advice I was giving, specific to the teas I've had from Taylor's of Harrogate

Again, it's just tea. The brand really matters very little. You'd be hard pressed to find a soul in the country who times how long their tea brews for, outside of people who really care, and they'd be considered pretty strange for doing so.

&gt; If you over-brew Yorkshire Gold, you can strip paint with it

Pour a bit away, add more milk, job done ;D In fact that literally exactly describes my last cuppa, down to the brand!

&gt; loose tea = Upper class?

Honestly, most people here don't even give loose leaf a moment's consideration - it all sounds like a lot of faffing around just for a cup of tea. And I said upper middle class, as in the top-end of the middle classes who aspire to be upper class. You'll find that the upper classes generally don't give a toss about appearing upper class and will happily drink any old tea so long as it tastes right :)

&gt; I think I'll never discuss tea again on Reddit

Do please rethink that sentiment old chap(ess?) - this is a place for discussion! I'm thrilled you have such a passion for tea, but just bear in mind that here, tea is something incredibly... normal? Ubiquitous? Ordinary? We don't put much thought into it, and as such those that do seem odd to us, but there is no malice in that :)",0,1396890016,null,0,false,0,cgmd4aa,t3_22cnpv,t1_cgmd4aa,t1_cgmcgpx,null,1433249239,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

I understand that you are frustrated and disenchanted with the education system, but the answer is not to run off to England and go ""Eat, Pray, Love"" on life. It really sounds like you are having much worse problems than just simple frustration with the education system, and I assume the ""family tragedy"" was big enough to affect you in the head, in some way, otherwise you wouldn't have taken off a semester of College. **Your current emotional/mental state can't be ignored.**

I think what you really need to do is sit down with someone you trust, and tell them what you have been thinking, show them your post if you want. But this is not the way to go about having a positive change in your life. I suggest talking to your parents about this, and suggest you see a therapist. I really hope you don't take this as an attack, but you were clear you wanted to hear whether we thought this was or was not a good idea, and I don't. There are so many logistical reasons why this wouldn't work, on top of the clear emotional issues you seem to be having, which you need to straighten yourself out in terms of getting rid of that quote in your head, trying to get more positive, and especially finding out what ways you can make your time in College easier.

Indifference towards your life is a clear-cut sign of depression, and as I said, that is something that can't be ignored. I can't speak to how you have been acting in real life but the way your post read, it sounded like you had no hope in the world, and let me tell you, LEAVING YOUR PROBLEMS BEHIND IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. You're only 20 and have a lot of great things ahead of you, you really need to power through this rut you seem to be in and try and find the positives in your life, or else this could be a dangerous path to set yourself on.

&gt;

&gt;___Catch Phrase___ is a syndicated U.S. game show which ran from September 16, 1985 through January 10, 1986, hosted by [Art James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_James). Two contestants competed to identify a series of animated puzzles called *catch phrases* to win money and prizes.

&gt;Although *Catch Phrase* only lasted thirteen weeks in America, the format was adopted for several international series. The most successful foreign edition was the British version *[Catchphrase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase_(UK_game_show\))* which ran from 1986 to 2002 on the [ITV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\)) network in its original incarnation and recently premiered a revival in 2013. [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia)'s [Nine Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network) aired three *Catch Phrase* series between 1997 and 2002, each one hosted by [John Burgess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burgess_(TV_host\)).

I've never run into racists around any of the pubs around Fulham Road, though I am no expert by any means, but I am also American of Latino descent and I look like I'm from India or Pakistan.

EDIT: To add a little to this. Pubs in England can feel a little more aggressive than they do in America, that's mostly down to culture. In England and many commonwealth countries it's fairly common to make fun of each someone in a way that is not as socially acceptable in America. So if someone ""takes the piss"" as they say, you might read a little too much into it, the better way to handle this is a witty retort, rather than aggression. 
It's a way for people to show they are comfortable around you (enough to make fun of you and you should feel comfortable doing the same, though I wouldn't take it too far). You may be called a yank, or questioned on your Chelsea knowledge, but just take it in stride. It's all in good fun.
Yank may feel ""racist"", I can understand why someone would feel uncomfortable in an environment such as a football pub if they don't understand the culture, especially in football. Just know that there is usually no intention of being rude or insulting, they are just having fun at your expense. This is pretty common in England, as is making fun of one's self.

We can't play the counterattack that mou loves and we have to pressure these guys with intensity. I really hope mourinho doesn't try to play it TOO safe because I believe our best chance is if we come out guns blazing. A goal in the first half would give me a lot of hope. 

If schurrle is injured i'd like to ~~maybe even see~~ ~~salah~~  willian on the right (or at least subbed in) with oscar in the middle and eden on the left. Ideally eto'o up top as well. ~~Salah~~, eto'o, willian, and hazard's speed would be very helpful in pressuring their defense so I really hope mourinho puts in any combination of those guys.

First of all, that's something you should take up with Levy for firing AVB in the first place. Sherwood has been thrust into a very, very shitty situation and although he hasnt done the best, he has done fine with what he has been given. I dont agree with a lot of the things he does but youre naive if you think all the blame rests on Sherwood. 

I'm sure everyone would want to change that line up but we cant do anything about it and we'll have to see what Sherwood can do now.

I don't remember AVB ever playing a genuine 4-3-3 apart from when we thrashed City at home the previous season. He's only ever played 4-2-3-1 this season. The problem with two holding mids is that you need at least one of them to be able to distribute the ball extremely effectively otherwise your build up play becomes stale and predictable. Look at other top clubs, who is our Modric, Alonso, Carrick, Barry, Arteta, Ramsey, Gerrard etc. There's no one in the squad who can do what those players do. Instead AVB built the squad down the Mourinho route, a team of athletes who just win the ball and give it to the forward line and expect them to get on with it. The problem is you need a few world class players in the forward line for that to work, it's not team attacking football.

The benefit of Eriksen coming deeper is that he's far harder to mark out of the game and can get on the ball earlier to craft our attacks.

Paulinho looks tired after 45-60 of closing down, Sandro gives up way to many useless fouls from diving in too aggressively. Benteleb is energetic but does not understand positioning 100%. We do not have the personnel for that so I blame Tim but thats the same story as AVB. 

Our play seems uninspiring, but at this point Dembele might be the only one to be able to reliably take someone on or at least look comfortable on the ball with a defender closing in.

One of the common american stereotypes is that they are loud, brash and arrogant.

In the UK self deprecating humour is a very big thing and almost mandatory in some social situations, certainly its my default response to receiving a compliment from someone I'm not friends with.

Having said that self promotion and confidence is still important when looking for jobs its just I think you need to be more subtle about it. Rather than saying you're great you describe a situation in which you were great and let the other party work it out. Also acknowledging the role of team mates or colleagues rather than making it sound like you worked alone normally goes down fairly well unless you are applying for a highly independent role.

And actually many extremist religious, nationslist and political groups are completely ridiculous and respond in completely inappropriate ways. 

People are acting like the Brotherhood is making outright threats and/or condoing violence. That article, to me, is him giving his opinion on the situation. Also we don't know if we have seen *everything* that he said.

Let's look at what we do know, while remembering there might be more that we don't:

&gt;Ibrahim Mounir, the Brotherhood’s most senior official in the UK, said that the government’s designation of his organization as a terrorist entity could be interpreted by its followers that violence was an option.

This is the interpretation of the person reading the article based off the quotes we have, no Brotherhood representative said this.

&gt;“If this [ban] happened, this would make a lot of people in Muslim communities think that [peaceful] Muslim Brotherhood values . . . didn’t work and now they are designated a terrorist group, which would make the doors open for all options,” Mounir told the newspaper.

Mournir explains what he thinks could happen.

&gt;When he was asked if he meant the group was open to violence, he replied: “Any possibility.”

This is the closest we  get to a statement that the Brotherhood will support or directly organise violent attacks. However it's very open to interpretation, this might be a veiled threat or it could be because it is unwise to commit yourself to a stance when you are meant to be representing a large group of people. 

Also sometimes violence is justified? For example some people would say that violence would be justified if deportation of legal Muslim citizens was carried out by the government. Obviously this is an extreme example but I make it to illustrate my point that being open to the possiblity of violence isn't the same as saying we will be violent about this issue.

&gt;In a statement, the movement said that it would ""openly engage"" with the review ordered by Cameron but it would challenge in the British courts ""any improper attempt to restrict its activity.”

This makes it sound like the Brotherhood's stance is to fight their case in the courts. As is their legal right. However this doesn't get people's blood pumping so wouldn't make a good headline. 



Now the Brotherhood might be making threats, they might condone any violence but at the moment people are jumping to conclusions and I'm sure people wouldn't be so hasty if this was a scenario involving a different type of extremist.

He argues that a relatively small group of people - whom he calls 'The Committee of 300' - constitute a ruling elite who are pursuing a goal of one-world government.

Coleman's books have been influential among more well known conspiracy authors such as David Icke and Jim Marrs who quote him in their own works. Coleman researched the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood is a secret Masonic order created, with support from T. E. Lawrence, Bertrand Russell and St John Philby, to ""keep the Middle East backward so its natural resource, oil, could continue to be looted."" Coleman has also criticized the Club of Rome, the Giorgio Cini Foundation, Global 2000, the Interreligious Peace Colloquium, the Tavistock Institute, and other organizations.

I might be naive, by definition I wouldn't know. I can assure you I'm not a dullard; I'm pretty academically accomplished (obviously not definitive proof but the closest we have to a quantitative system of measuring intelligence). 

In my experience I find people who result to name calling, especially so early on in a discussion, often end up having little of value to add to the discussion themselves. Why don't you buck the trend and try and write somethign constructive instead of childish insults? Or is asking for a reasonable civilised discussion, from an intellectual giant such as yourself, just asking too much?

true,GeneralThrob,null,null,"As far as tea being expensive- it's been a while since I've crunched the numbers- probably about five years ago, when I was owner/operator of a cafe and was ordering the stuff wholesale. But at the time, I figured out it was 10-30% cheaper? Depending on the brand?  If you're interested in the prices we (well, **I**) pay, [here's the website](http://perennialtearoom.com/index.aspx) of a shop I got to, on occasion. 

Where does coffee fall, in the UK hot-beverage spectrum? Is there a typical coffee-drinker stereotype?

Because the way you describe tea-drinking- as a sort of utilitarian transaction with your beverage, devoid of pretense- that's very much the space that coffee occupies in the US. 

Hmm, let me amend that- DRIP coffee (more-or-less French Press) is relatively salt-of-the-earth. Espresso/Starbucks gets pretty silly, rather quickly! ""I'd like a triple half-caff venti Machiatto with medium foam and a dash of sugar-free hazelnut to go!"" And yes, I know what that is and how to make it, from my coffee-jockey days :P

Tea, in the US, occupies this strange space where you're either this pretentious hipster vegan type (and you drink Green Tea), or you lack the fortitude to handle your caffeine and you're ordering a nice after-dinner Chamomile, or some other herbal thing likely called ""Sleepytime Happiness"" or something like that. 

Also worth mentioning- PG Tips would *definitely* be considered on the upscale side in the US. And if you tried our domestic black-tea brands, like Lipton or Stash, I think you'd agree PG Tips qualifies as gourmet, stateside. Seriously, US tea is absolute crap. 

As far as not discussing tea on Reddit goes- I think I'll probably let this discussion with you play out, and never discuss tea again :) Seriously, this is probably the 4-5th time I've seen tea-discussions on Reddit... And they seem to get heated? Emotional? Passionate? Chippy? Let's just say, I wasn't anticipating downvotes, for recommending my favorite tea! 

I mean, from a social perspective- isn't it interesting how quickly this discussion went from tea, to... Other stuff? I remember reading on another thread, maybe in Askreddit or something, where this one guy says (my paraphrasing), ""be sure **not** to boil your tea-water in the microwave, because it messes up the taste of your tea."" And some other guy replies, ""That's got to be the single most pretentious thing I've ever read on Reddit."" And of course, the tea guy had to delete his account, and the responder gets 2000+ upvotes and double-gilded...

Anyway- I think that's one of the things I'm taking away from this! Discussions about tea quickly branch out into other, more contentious issues. I mean, it's hard to imagine this conversation unfolding the same way, if the discussion was about Coke/Pepsi. Or even coffee, for that matter. 

That, and people who discuss optimum tea-brewing techniques make for easy targets :) I'll admit the whole thing sounds pretty snooty. 

Hey, thanks for talking, BTW! I do appreciate your responding!

PS- Re, hard to imagine coke/pepsi generating this discussion... Even coffee!

What's that home-grown soda pop you guys have with a non-English name that inspires a patriotic fervor among its enthusiasts?

A draw against City isn't awful, as long as we score enough in the other fixtures, but I'm of the opinion that we could beat anyone at home, so we might as well try.

All in all, with the form we've been in and the form Arsenal have been in, I'm hoping that we could get away with 14 points and still qualify. All it would take would be one draw for Arsenal and a better goal difference. 

And if it takes Liverpool winning the league to make it happen, then so be it. I just want the best result for us.

Only thing we can do now is sit back and watch.

Edit: Another thing, there is a far outside chance that we could actually finish 3rd. If both Liverpool and we beat Man City (not impossible, with both games in Merseyside), we'd be 4 points behind them, meaning they'd have to drop another 5 points against Sunderland, West Brom, Palace, Villa, or West Ham.

If in doubt when passing a narrow bridge or making a blind junction, sound your horn.
During the part where you have to ride by yourself to an area i'll say its better to go the completely wrong way than to switch lanes erratically to stay on course. I went so many wrong directions because I was dealing with triple roundabouts in Aylesbury (a place with horrible roads) where I'd never ridden before. I decided it was safest to just show off my control and discipline while going the wrong way.
Also mirrors, mirrors when you speed up, slow down, change lanes, heck mirrors when you do anything other than ride in a straight line.
Also shoulder checks. Make sure you have these disciplines down before you test. Spend every moment when you're home from work/ school practising the disciplines. Make them second nature so you're not thinking about them on test day. You want to be thinking about what the stranger is yelling into your ear.

I did my Mod 1 in sleet and my mod 2 in pouring rain (can't believe both weren't cancelled). On different days of course. Don't worry about the weather, just worry about showing you're safe and competent.

They believe that Islam should play an essential role in politics. That alone puts them far outside the political centre of this country. They're religious right wingers. Except they're not some old out-of-touch men with grey hair, they're young, have less to lose and are highly educated.

Comparing them to Irish nationalists is a fair comparison. Then again, at least the nationalists made peace with us eventually. When have the religious right ever been willing to compromise? Especially the current brand of Islamists who can barely even agree with each other on what to have for breakfast, let alone agree with people in other political groups.  

Sure, quotes like the ones in the article can get over-analyzed and misread, but at the same time it suits the leadership to have a level of plausible deniability (essential when you operate an organisation that is always either banned or very close to becoming banned), and at the same time play to their crowd by mentioning the possibility of violence. 

When the Tories lose an election they don't warn us about the possibility of some pensioners going on a murderous rampage to take revenge. Labour don't warn us about the possibility of union thugs smashing up shops if they lose. Why is it acceptable to mention the idea of a violent reprisal for investigating a potential criminal issue inside a political organisation?

Isn't that exactly what Eric Pickles is doing? He is saying that Atheists should ""get over it"" and that Christians should expect special treatment because of the actions of a group of people in the past i.e. the ones who made England a Christian nation?

However Christian intolerance isn't merely limited to the past - I've already quoted a couple of general examples of how it is active today, and I've also experienced it in my personal life. Like the time I attended a predominately Christian school and happened to mention that I'm an eighth jewish (i.e. genetically, not culturally or religiously). Reactions were quite revealing.

&gt; I, too, was using 'no right' in the same non-literal context.

When I lived in China it was dirty, there was a lot of poverty and there was a certain amount of hostility toward white people like me...

In Western Australia I also noticed a lot of casual racism, people took their lifestyles for granted and the amount of bureaucratic, nanny-state bullshit borderlined on the absurd.

Visiting my girlfriend when she lived in the American midwest, the landscape was flat and ugly, public transport was practically non-existent and every shop or restaurant was part of a chain.

Now I loved living in China and Australia and I enjoyed my time visiting the states as well but I don't think I would have wanted to live in any of those places full time.

By staying here, buying a house here, contributing to the local economy, I feel like I'm making a difference - helping drag this beautiful country out of its dark past.

Maybe I'm kidding myself, but I've lived in places where most people have a lot less than us and I've lived in places where most people seem to take what they have for granted. I'd rather stay here and try and make it better.

Maybe a business jet approaching a bit lower than the heavy stuff perhaps too low and giving it a burst of power to make the runway. That would probably be louder than you are used to. Or again just the usual traffic coming in a bit lower than usual and giving it some power to correct.

Unless you hear about some incident on the 10pm news tonight thats all its likely to be.

Edit: Sorry I originally interpreted that as you heard something out of the ordinary, I'll leave the original post as a testament to my stupidity. If you saw it and it was lighter and faster than normal I would say business jet. Was it heading towards the airport as if to land or coming away like it just took off?

true,StormySan,null,null,"Man that site is crazy, make-your-own tea bags! But yeah those prices are heartbreaking, over double what we pay here for tea. You have my sincere sympathies.

&gt; that's very much the space that coffee occupies in the US

Yes, I would utterly agree with that - it's a go-to, staple drink for the masses.

Though coffee has a fairly large demographic here as well - primarily with office workers. I certainly get through plenty of coffee at work, but hardly ever drink it at home. Though don't get me started on the moccafrappacappacciatos ;)

&gt; PG Tips would definitely be considered on the upscale side in the US

Wow. Genuine wow. I don't know how the hell they managed to pull that one off! Though Lipton is a damn strange one, I swear it's sold in every country in the world *except* the UK!

&gt; Seriously, this is probably the 4-5th time I've seen tea-discussions on Reddit... And they seem to get heated?

The problem is, to put a point to it, that Reddit has an understandably proportionally high American user base. So, threads involving tea tend to be populated by Brits and Americans. Brits don't generally start threads about tea (except on /r/britishproblems, end even there it's often downvoted), so that means it's generally instigated by an American. And that person has often picked up an interest in tea offline, through friends etc... and has been fed a lot of ideas about how tea is done.

So, Brits see threads explaining how to make a cup of tea incorrectly, and downvote. As I've said, it's mainly the idea of taking tea as something that precise.

As an analogy, it's like someone having an enthusiasm for water, make sure to leave it sitting after pouring a glass for a minute to let all the bubbles filter out, hard water vs soft water, etc... You might have a preference for water that's been sat for exactly 4 minutes, but the majority of other people won't notice the difference.

&gt; isn't it interesting how quickly this discussion went from tea, to... Other stuff?

To be honest that's one of the things I enjoy about reddit :) discussions are organic, and they don't just travel linearly - they branch out into myriad arms like a Mandelbrot tree.

But yes, microwaving water... it's what microwaves do. That argument is along the lines of CDs vs vinyl, some people think the old way is better because it's the old way and swear they can tell the difference. Most people don't care enough to notice, if there even is a difference. So long as the water's hot, you can make tea with it :)

&gt;  I mean, it's hard to imagine this conversation unfolding the same way, if the discussion was about Coke/Pepsi. Or even coffee

To be honest, in the right sub, I could totally see that happening :)

&gt; That, and people who discuss optimum tea-brewing techniques make for easy targets :) I'll admit the whole thing sounds pretty snooty.

S'all cool man :) It's not a bad thing to be enthused about, just bear in mind that when one is enthused about something from another culture, it's easy to misunderstand little things that that culture takes for granted.

&gt; What's that home-grown soda pop you guys have with a non-English name that inspires a patriotic fervor among its enthusiasts?

Hah! That's Irn-Bru in Scotland! Only country in the world to have a most popular fizzy drink that isn't Coke/Pepsi! It's like crack to them!

No, I retract that last point, that's whiskey (with good reason), but it comes close!

&gt; I think I'll probably let this discussion with you play out, and never discuss tea again

Your choice, and I can only implore you to reconsider.

You arrogant selfish prick. So *you* get to decide what ""normal"" and ""uncontroversial"" is?

Even worse - you think you have a monopoly on the technique of teaching tolerance?

How does the anti-racism discussion go? ""Black people are always right - always treat them differently - like Gods - because God forbid you hold them to the same standard as your brother"".

The acquisitions Netflix have bought thus far (Breaking Bad, It's Always Sunny, Community) are ones that have zero commercial value on regular telly, and were probably picked up for peanuts (even Breaking Bad, though market value rose late on).

If Netflix was to stump up for, say, an output deal with Showtime and AMC, then that would be a game changer.

i like going up tomnahurich hill sometimes too, its so quiet up there and some really nice old trees if you're into that kind of thing, you can see all over town from there too.

* There are certainly Latin Americans at the university. I can't think of anyone I know who is specifically Chilean off the top of my head, but the university is big enough that I'm sure there's a few of them around.

* The traditional answer is that no college is better than any of the others at most subjects. Gonville and Caius is known for having a high proportion of medics relative to any other subject. However, that doesn't mean that you are more likely to get a place if you apply there: the pooling system ensures that the college you apply to shouldn't affect your chances of getting a place.

* Food is in general not bad. Some colleges have better cooking facilities than others if you *want* to cook for yourself -- my college, Christ's, has no ovens at all, and I know some colleges definitely do have at least some (I have personally seen ovens at Trinity and Corpus). Some colleges also have reputations for better food than others (Gonville and Caius is widely regarded as one of the worst, with a strange way of doing things on top of that, but as I have never eaten there I couldn't comment). Different colleges also handle formal dinners differently (how much they cost, how many people dine at once, what courses you get, whether wine is provided, whether you are allowed to bring wine, how many guests you may bring all vary by college).

-Eriksen, nuff said.

-Adebayor deserves a shout for his work ethic that game

-Kane, like Adebayor didn't lose a physical battle all game. Looked promising.

-Chadli seems like a Carragher where he can play every position on the field. Seemed to be holding the midfield a lot today.

-Paulinho had a fair game, if he played like this every game and then had the occasional superb game, id be content

-Rose...not gonna be negative so im going to leave it at that

-Kabiriches- Not bad, pretty solid except for that one mistake.

This ties into the whole topic we're discussing under this thread since teams that aren't familiar with the ground (e.g. us at West Ham) can be seen to play worse than the home team.

&gt;**Top ref Webb snubbed for potential title decider between Liverpool and Man City as Clattenburg is preferred**

&gt;England’s World Cup referee Howard Webb has been dealt another blow by being overlooked for Sunday’s crucial title clash between Liverpool and Manchester City.

&gt;Webb, who has been given a string of low-profile matches since a calamitous performance in the Arsenal-Liverpool FA Cup tie two months ago, will handle Crystal Palace v Aston Villa instead of the weekend’s marquee game.

&gt;Webb will be England’s only referee at the World Cup in Brazil this summer but Mark Clattenburg will be in charge at Anfield.

&gt;Clattenburg last officiated Liverpool on March 16, awarding them three penalties in the comfortable 3-0 win away at Manchester United.

&gt;He also dubiously sent off Nemanja Vidic at Old Trafford and will go into the game on Merseyside having overseen Real Madrid's win against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League last week, plus Chris Hughton's final game in charge of Norwich after going down at home against West Brom on Saturday. 

&gt;Contentious decisions have once again engulfed this Premier League season, with Anthony Taylor the latest man to come under intense scrutiny for his display at Upton Park. 

&gt;Taylor was maligned for allowing Andy Carroll to seemingly get away with a flailing arm in the build-up to the West Ham goal, and was then lambasted by Sam Allardyce for pointing to the spot when Jon Flangan was brought down by the Hammers' goalkeeper Adrian. 

&gt;Both incidents were debated long into Sunday night, with Sportsmail's Graham Poll claiming that he at least got the second decision correct. 

&gt;Nevertheless, it is Clattenburg who has been given the most important fixture of the campaign thus far, which could go some way to determining who wins the title.

&gt;Despite misgivings from Southampton's Adam Lallana at his refereeing style in December - who claimed he swore at him - Clattenburg has been a standout performer in the top flight this year. 

&gt;He brandishes an average of just over three yellow cards a game and has only dished out two red cards in 36. Manchester City drew away at Stoke City and beat Swansea City at the Etihad with Clattenburg as the man in black, while Liverpool have won both of their league fixtures - the first coming against Aston Villa in August. 

&gt;Meanwhile, Taylor will be fourth official for the FA Cup semi-final between Hull City and Sheffield United.",0,1396905937,null,0,false,0,cgml84r,t3_22gc3r,t1_cgml84r,t3_22gc3r,null,1433253131,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I think if he was given time, a full summer to train the team, to bring certain players that he knows would fit his style than he would be in a much better spot as a manager. I mean, the guy was just the managing for the reserve team before taking AVB's place. He had no managerial experience with a PL team. Everyone in this sub and other Spurs social outlets are so fuckin hard on him. Some other team is going to pick up a good manager. LVG is proven and he should be able to help Spurs get into top and take them to another level, but I would have liked to see Tim get a full year. I understand that is not popular opinion. But I really think he did a job with what he had and the circumstances surrounding his take over. If its true that he is leaving, best of luck to him. He deserves it.

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

I will add almost everything by Robert Holmes is fantastic.

true,DougieFFC,null,null,"Fun fact: I was actually at Virgin Media TV when that spat occurred. I came over to Sky when they bought out VMTV to acquire Living. The exclusivity of Atlantic has nothing to do with that spat though. The spat was resolved, iirc, either in 2008 or early 2009, and the HBO deal was very much part of a shift in strategy based on the emerging cable TV market that has only really been a recent thing. 
Without going into detail, there is nothing underhanded in Sky's carriage negotiation deals with respect to launching new channels on top of the existing ones because budget is not being moved from Sky 1 to Sky Atlantic in order to run that channel. In fact, Sky 1's budget has dramatically increased in the last few years as part of an original content initiative. Sky 1 has never been the home of a show like Game of Thrones (I don't think there's been a show like GoT period). It's a broad family-targeting channel that prefers glossy US acquisitions to gritty adult-themed US content. A more appropriate alternate destination for Thrones might have been Fx (now Fox).
As for letting VM has Sky Atlantic, everyone has a price. Obviously there is a calculated value that Atlantic delivers in terms of driving subscriber base, but that would be measured against what VM would offer Sky. There is constant, amicable dialogue between the companies ever since Sky bought VMTV (Sky wanted Living and VM absolutely couldn't wait to get rid, even though we were incredibly profitable), and Atlantic is included in that dialogue (afaik).
