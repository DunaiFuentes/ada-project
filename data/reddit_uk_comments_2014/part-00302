Farage is enormously charismatic, a quality shared by many of the people with whom he surrounds himself. As a card-carrying lefty, I see the emergence of UKIP as a potentially positive thing for left-wing politics- I believe they'll split the Conservative vote in England and lead to a greater plurality in Westminster. Not that having a Labour government would be much different from a Conservative one, but that's another topic entirely!

Ultimately, AV would be the best outcome of that, but I reckon the Lib Dems have tarnished that idea in the minds of the public. A real shame, it works well up here.

Personally, I feel a little sorry for Ruth Davidson- she's a tough lady, but not nearly as tough as her predecessor Annabel Goldie, and you really do need an iron constitution to be a Tory politician in Scotland.

And come on, you are better than this. **Obviously** there are going to be more blueprints for bookcases - there are thousands of very different models. The police boxes are all basically the same.

I said I loved it. I do praise the craftmanship, it looks perfect and I wish I had the skills to build one myself. But I'm not the kind of person who will compliment people on things they don't deserve - I've come across enough people lying about their skills to get more attention, and I *hate* that people. I am not going to praise his ability to make blueprints when it is definitely more probable that he googled them. The possibilty he did them himself exists, but it is minimal. You might be familiar with Occam's Razor. Basically, thats why I'm not believing it - I'm not assuming he cheated. Also, I am not comparing his work to whatever the other students did - I couldn't give less of a shit about the bookcases of his classmates. I would never praise them for building basic bookcases, but I would praise this guy for building a TARDIS. Just not for drawing the blueprints of the TARDIS, until proved they are original. It's as simple as that. It has nothing to do with how impressive the whole work is. Because this thing is really amazing. I just refuse to congratulate someone on something that I cannot prove. It would be unfair. But it is fair to say he executed it brilliantly, and that he is a great builder. Until I see his own blueprints, I'm not gonna assume that he did them. 

Yes, I am a negative person. I definitely am. But that has absolutely nothing to do with being able to admire things and people who deserve it. I believe praise is something one wins rather than something one is entitled to. Perhaps you are lucky enough you can trust people more easily. Perhaps I am more of a twat than I thought. Thing is, I have encountered several forms of plagiarism way too many times in my short life. I have seen people get glorified for things they didn't do, and that thing just makes my insides boil because it's **unfair**. If the possibilty of something being a lie exists, I'm not going to congratulate him on *that part*. Everything else deserves a huge applause because it is absolutely brilliant.

First of all, that Mummy is going to send some kids off to bed with nightmares, just like Doctor Who should! Really great costume work all around actually, set dressing, cinematography, the lot. The little things like the light from the windows being constant due to travelling through space, the anachronistic ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’, jelly baby cases, ‘Are you my Mummy?’. An all-around well-fleshed out world, just ready for a creepy monster to terrorise. 

The Doctor/Clara relationship I think was addressed well. Clara letting her feelings known, as The Doctor just processes silently, and then responding with wanting to talk about planets – such a great Doctor/companion moment. It really shows their interactions as part of an on-going relationship, and here one that is in a bit of a separation/fallout phase. 

In all likelihood the orchestrator of the entire plot is somehow Missy related. Nice thematic resonance with the rest of the series as the Mummy is a soldier gone-wrong; similar also to Khaler-Jex from last series. 

Overall, another fine episode in this wonderfully consistent series, and a real tour-de-force for Capaldi this week!

Well it's been an ongoing battle to be honest, my dad has been trying to get a councillor out for maybe 1year+, but I guess as one neighbour extended their garden, the others thought that they had the right to as well. Some of the neighbours are related to each other too, so I guess if a relative does it, you'd feel a bit more comfortable doing it too. 

My dad's been round to each house with the deeds multiple times during all this, but to no avail. It's so sad because one neighbour in particular has been just plain nasty, and my poor dad is disabled and not really able to stand his ground. We'll definitely get some letters written, that's great advice. 

Thankfully, we've got pictures of the shelter. Regarding the trees, would we report that to the council or to the police do you know?

I'm just so sad. I know it's sounds like a bit of a first world problem, but this is the only thing my grandparents have. The neighbours are all well-off, drive expensive cars and have flashy houses. I feel like they're completely taking advantage because it's obvious to them that we can't afford a solicitor, and that my dad and grandparents are physically too frail to do much about this. 

I'm so overwhelmed by all this. The more I read, the more clueless I feel!

Higher education is all about money. No cash, no courses.

You saw the lecturers. They're what you think you're paying for, and if your £9,000 per year only paid for them, you'd be paying the equivalent of £45/hour or thereabouts.

But it's not them. There's a whole army of people who also need to be paid, who you don't see.

Throw in heating and lighting those buildings, putting books in the library, maintaining the equipment - £9,000 a year is a bargain. 

Having said all that.... we as a society used to pay for it all collectively.

false,Nihht,mcgann,McGann,"That was a great episode; it utilized an enclosed setting well with an interesting villain who wasn't too alien but wasn't too typical, either. The twist was a good one that was unexpected without being unbelievable. I found it very clever that the cheery voiced computer had in fact orchestrated the entire thing. It shifted the villain without taking away the threat of the mummy.

The small cast of supporting character helped too. They were all interesting in their own right and likeable enough to me that I was rather sad when the historian/whoever he was died. The effects were good and I could imagine the fear of being hunted down by the mummy while everyone around you stares at you like you're completely insane; knowing nobody believes you and that there is going to be no help from them.

We even got some humor mixed in, with the jelly baby cigarette case and the obligatory ""Are you my mummy?"" which we were all hoping for.

I'm not sure how to feel about Clara as a character at this point. She seems to have been afflicted by 12's manipulative and lying nature; overwhelmed by the thrill of adventuring through time and space to the point that she lies to Danny about her decision and in turn lies to the Doctor about Danny. I'm hoping this will come up sooner or later.

Also, Capaldi's accent keeps slipping into the things I say in my head.

The day started at 9am when we met at the local pub in the village of Llangynog. There we signed in and paid the optional damage waiver of £25 before loading onto a minibus to head up to the place. They asked if we'd all had experience riding bikes before which everyone had - I believe they will go through the basics of clutch and gears for anyone that hasn't though!

They ask for your gear sizes when you book, so on arrival they have the kit that should fit laid out for you ready to put on. Once everyone was kitted out there was a talk about correct seating/standing position and a brief lesson on how to pick the bike up. They then let us choose a bike with the advice that a KLX250 is a good choice for the inexperienced (also 125cc or 85cc for the younger ones).

The general format is that an instructor would lead, everyone would follow one at a time and then an instructor followed at the back to be sure no one got left behind. They have a load of different trails joined by gravel fire tracks around the hills. We'd stop occasionally to regroup and then get a briefing of how to tackle a particular trail - stuff like how to ride up steep hills with poor traction, or ""walking"" the bike through deep ruts.

We returned to base for a mid morning break and then again for lunch - at this stage they mentioned that due to the difference in experience we'd be split into 2 groups, allowing the experienced guys to have a bit of fun without waiting around. They didn't need to tell us which group to go in - I think everyone knew where they should be!

The afternoon was much of the same format, just with more challenging trails as the day went on. At the very end there was big drop-in from the woods back onto a fire trail - where we were given the choice to ride it down. It was terrifying - especially after someone a few turns before me dropped the bike at the bottom, but I felt it was one of those things you'd regret later if you didn't give it a try and it went better than expected!

I wonder if UKIP fill enough of a niche to be a mainstay in UK politics? They cause a splash now, but a shift to the right by the Tory party nullifies most of their policies; it's the same shit with a much bigger party machine and more reliable voters. This might be further compounded by the fact UKIP focus so heavily on 2 issues, ie EU and immigration. If Britain leaves the EU and does similar immigration policies to UKIP, do they have enough to continue to be successful?    
Maybe these lines have been blurred in recent years, with a general shift to the right marked by New Labour and Orange Book Liberalism. Parties may no longer need to fill a niche but rather comply with the centre-right norm and differentiate within that range, rather than spread out across the political spectrum.

So your solution for this is to segregate students back into that awful system? I like how you add that the new public school system gives an unfair advantage to rich students while unironically advocating a system that actively discriminated against the poor. 

Grammar schools got a lot of the funding from the government budget, and the vast majority lucky enough to be there were paid for by their parents. Leaving the less well off in poorly managed, poorly funded shithouses.

Care to provide any examples? I'm fairly certain the real problem stems from the fact that those who cannot speak English seek assistance from others to help them fill the forms, which is an entirely different thing.

* It can be fun, especially projects started from scratch
* It's neat knowing you've made or been part of a site that huge numbers read

* always learning

Cons:

* oh look another set of CSS / PHP frameworks to learn that offers no advantages over the last 5 you learnt
* ""We want the column on the right side of this layout to match the height of the column of the left side"" . Things demanded by clients which should be simple but are incredibly hard and then having to explain why it took you an entire morning.
* ""we'll return to that later"" As said by clients when you say something is impossible or a horrifically bad idea. It won't get any more possible later on!
* if you're working on a long standing platform developed from scratch, lots of legacy code with no documentation, complex databases and some horrible practices. Then there are the occasions where doing innocuous things that shouldn't have any affect on anything, end up bring down whole servers because of issues/quirks no one told you about.
* Never ending imposter syndrome. Developer for 10 years, still hasn't faded one bit (could just be me though).
* crunch times, especially if they don't pay overtime

To point was to figure out what the Foretold was and how to stop it. The Doctor figured out that it was a soldier, fighting a war that ended long ago. How do you get a soldier to stop fighting you? You surrender. (This has been done before btw)

I'm not sure why you're looking for some specific moral. But if there is one I don't think we'll understand it until the season's over and has wrapped this whole soldier arc it's got going on with Dany and all.

It's not made clear what exactly Gus is. We know that there is some shadowy mastermind that has orchestrated the whole Mummy on the Orient Express deal because he/she/it wants to capture the Mummy's technology for its own evil uses.

We're never told directly where Gus was just the train, programmed by the shadowy Mastermind to do what it did, or whether it was the shadowy Mastermind through some long-distance connection.

It drained their [life energy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy) to keep itself alive.

We don't know but either way you get the same result.

&gt; Why go to all the trouble of camouflaging one carriage, instead of just adding an extra one at the end of the train?

The one at the end would have to be camouflaged anyway unless it was kept locked until the reveal and if you did that you would have to force everyone into that carriage. Anyway, this is the future, maybe holographic camouflage is as cheap as wallpaper to them.

Remember contracts are actually about midway between what he is worth now and what we think he might be worth when he is 25 (assuming he signs this contract in couple of weeks).


Now to the important parts, this should be like any of our recent contracts a performance based one, he has to play to earn that. Secondly ignoring his age (he has been playing for 2 full seasons) he will be around lot of mid to top range forwards wages and he is performing like one and isn't showing any signs of it being purple patch.


The contract if true makes sense for other reasons, first Sterling is very good player and he is worth a lot of money, he is easily top 2 players in the club on performance currently, if he is on 70k dozen top clubs will be able to offer twice that without any trouble. Keeping all of that in mind, there is a balance between wages and revenue. Suarez, Agger and next season Johnson is probably gone we have gotten Balo and Lallana who probably are on 110k +- 10k and our revenues have gone up with CL, with PL increase and the commercial deals. There is a reason United pays 100k to average players, their revenue was nearly twice ours and even then their wage/revenue ratio was lower than ours. We were at 200M in revenue couple of years ago and will most likely break 300M this season, we can't keep paying the same rate.

You're using mythology in a fairly specific way, as if the writers had purposefully decided that the entirety of the show would follow a radically different over-arching philosophy, and that this decision was made purposefully.  We can easily show that's wrong simply by reading interviews with RTD of Moffat, seeing how Moffat has gone out of his way to address even the audio dramas of 8, and by watching the dern show.  This isn't some giant, overarching cultural tale.  It's a popular sci fi show.  It happens to respect it's history and pull from it, while not being afraid to do soft retcons, which, by the way, the old show did too.  I understand not liking the turn 12's personality has.  It seems odd.  The last 3 Doctor incarnations seemed to change relatively organically between one another.  But, that doesn't necessarily mean that's always the case.  The show is internally consistent (most of the time).  Regeneration has caused very dramatic personality shifts in the past.  Hell, even 10 to 11 was fairly drastic in how he relates to people.

Removing the faceplate exposes the test socket. You also need to leave your modem/router off for 30 minutes before you do this.

If you then get a good speed (which you should be able to see by looking at ""sync speed"" in the interface) it shows theres an issues with the extension wiring in your house.

If you don't get a decent speed as estimated by your ISP (estimated is the distance from the exchange to your house) you need to ring your ISP and have them escalate that to BT OpenReach. Once the BT OpenReach owned copper enters your house, it's your responsibility

&gt;but your line disconnecting every time the phone rings is a bit weird

Is a sign of a faulty microfilter, or a phone that isn't filtered. The phone PSTN signals cause more noise on the line that your ADSL has ""buffer"" for, and drops out.

You have to make sure all phones in your house are filtered, it's a PITA because your ISP usually only supplies 1 filter, and you may have multiple extensions.

He has been with us since he was a little kid and I believe he loves the club more than any of us. He is spurs. Just listen to a Fighting Cock episode when his dad visits and you'll understand what I mean.

Remember when he fell over that advertisement sign last year and hurt his arm really bad but refused to leave the pitch? That is passion and loving the shirt, more so than writing #coys on you're instagram page at least. Yes he shoots too much and may be frustrating to watch at times but give the kid a break, he is always the last one on the pitch to give up and he is still young. 

I don't know what it is but many on here and on other social networks writes him of so quickly but are willing to give others endless of new chances to prove themselves. I really admire all of you who keep on rooting for Soldado, I really do, but find some room for Townsend as well, a home grown player. 

In a time where club loyalty doesn't seem to mean much he is a player who would play in lilywhite until his legs fell off. And I do believe that he will be a big asset for us in the future. Don't get me wrong, he isn't ready to be a starter for us just yet but what about when Lamela goes to seek new adventures in more exciting places?

Honestly, as soon as you can, move to Zen Internet; the deals are very clearly explained, if you want a DSL service they give phone line and DSL service combos and the FTTC services are cheaper than the DSL products!

I moved from o2 (which got bought by Sky - The main reason I moved) to Zen................GOD DAMN FUCKING SMOOOOOTH AS GOD DAMN WARM BUTTER.

The customer portal has been built perfectly and anything to think you may need to call into their support team about, its covered on the portal, from billing, to rDNS, ADSL logins, setting up your router to moving your service from one address to another.

They also do rolling contracts, so if you want the connection online for a month and want to turn the service for x amount of time you can easily do this.

Zen all the way

false,SaucyPotato8,null,null,"Let me preface this post by saying that I've watched/played soccer (obviously American) all my life, so don't just think my opinion is of someone who only plays FIFA.

Whenever we buy or are linked with a player, one of the first things I do is check them out on FIFA. I know its only a rough estimate on a player's ability, but we cannot keep getting excited over a player and say that he will be a fantastic addition to our team when he's a low rated player on FIFA. I say this as a person that wants our team to make top 4 in the relatively near future. Buying a player that is a 73 or 76 overall is nothing to get excited about if this is our goal.

The reason I say this is because we continue to buy these players and our club remains at a standstill. If we want to improve our team, we should aim to buy players that are at least an upgrade to the ones we have now. For example, we had Danny Rose and we decided to buy Ben Davies. A quick look on FIFA and there is no difference between these players. And the thing that pisses me off is seeing people surprised that Davies isnt an upgrade to Rose.

I realize that we don't have as much to offer players as some of the other clubs, but I wish we'd set our sights high on some signings rather than getting excited that Stambouli is our new DM.

Shit, I was all over the place, but that's my unpopular opinion.

Edit: I guess what I was trying to say as my opinion, that has apparently been lost, is that we get excited over all these signings and that they'll improve our squad, but they all turn out to be these low rated players on FIFA. If we're trying to get top 4, we should be aiming for higher rated players. I'm not talking about the difference btwn 76 and 74 rated players, but more of an 83 and a 74.

The fact that we got the following sequence of lines before Clara's questionable decision to keep travelling with the doctor kind of hits the point home, in my opinion.

Just infinitely what we need, and massively so over Paulinho. 

Also, at the time Lennon was still somewhat useful recently, and Townsend was coming off a great loan spell at QPR. If you remove considering Townsend's form this season (last season upon Sherwood's appointment he played left wing, which he is even less effective from), he was playing with top confidence there for awhile and causing real problems for defenses. I think his biggest problem is that he's very mentally weak, and has just simply not adjusted to new/changing situations at all. So point is, I think if he had hit a run of form in a system that was not so utterly collapsed due to slow we moved out of midfield and relied on width, I think he would have actually prospered.

---

&gt;

&gt;___Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death___ (commonly shortened to ___The Curse of Fatal Death___) is a two-episode special of *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* made for the [Red Nose Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief_(charity\)) charity [telethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon) in the United Kingdom, and broadcast on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 12 March 1999. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.

&gt;It has a special status amongst *Doctor Who*-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)*  - an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only [parodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody) story to be covered by ""DWM Archives"", a section of *DWM* normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website,  and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned [live-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-action) *Doctor Who* production between [the *Doctor Who* television movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and [""Rose""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who_episode\)).

&gt;Finally, it serves as a production bridge - if not a narrative bridge - between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between ""old"" and ""new"" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised *Doctor Who* script by [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat), the first post-production work of [The Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mill_(post-production\)) on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between [Verity Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verity_Lambert) and [Susie Liggat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Liggat), and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, [Roy Skelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Skelton). Executive Producer [Richard Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curtis) would later write the 2010 episode ""[Vincent and the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_and_the_Doctor)"". [Richard E. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant), who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor would later appear on the actual show, as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the [Great Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Intelligence), after performing the voice of another version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial *[Scream of the Shalka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_of_the_Shalka)*.

Of course, I think Pjanic and his style was so obviously what we were needing at the time anyway. In truth, even in a worse case scenario for Thauvin and Ljajic, I think having Pjanic alone would have turned out better than anyone we could have brought along with Paulinho. He just simply was not what we needed, and only further compounded our problems.

As for Ljajic, he is incredibly aggressive and determined to get to the net, and an extremely versatile player. He is surprisingly physical, and very good at trying to remain on his feet. His aggression and mentality is something I think Spurs could massively have used since that point. I honestly have no idea why he's struggled so much to edge in at Roma, because he was in a very good Fiorentina team when Roma bought him.

* Utterly surprised that Clara was here since her lack of presence in the previews, and glad that like Danny said, when she's not angry she's able to sort out what's bothering her and to make more clear decisions for her next move(s).
* ""It's good to know you're going to die, at least from a research manner of view."" 
* A genius and arrogant on good days. 
* ""Sorry I jumped the gun with the 'You're a genius!' remark.""
* Vampire Teleporting Mummy, cool cool cool. Edit: Scratch that, soldier with a teleporting device unrelieved from duty, of course.

Chadli-Lamela vs Ljajic-Lennon is assuming we'd have made no purchases since, which is unfair considering you're now taking Chadli and Lamela's current form under consideration. So as argued above, I'd argue for Ljajic and Thauvin [i]in a system we'd have played[/i] vs Chadli and Lamela. It's great the latter two have turned out well this season, but give Ljajic and Thauvin Pjanic in behind them vs Paulinho and Dembele, and I don't believe we'd even be having this conversation.

We've beaten the Eriksen wide topic to death, but he hardly could be classified as ""left winger"" given his responsibilities. He was highly productive because of how the system was set up to him being wide to receive the ball in a lethargic, horizontal midfield and ping two tall strikers. But as for defense, he was all the more of a liability than even Siggurdson wide. That cannot all be blamed on Rose, because so many of the situations featured Rose trying to release the ball, but no left winger or CDM presenting to provide him the triangle when he needed it. Insufficient options -&gt; bad pass -&gt; countered. 

Lamela's first season was ""decent,"" as he scored six in 31. Strong debut for certain, but no real indication of ""good"" as plenty of wingers against Serie A defenders score at least six in a season of 30+ games. Not many were paying genuine attention until his second season. Sure, he did well in Argentina, but plenty of players perform well in South American leagues but don't make the transition to Europe, so that's still hardly basis to justify what we spent in comparison to other options that could have helped us. To be clear, this is not to denigrate Lamela's talent, but more so to point out that I believe we should have spent that extent of money on more prudent options.

Wait, last... nope. Not ready for Clara to go. There's no way they'd do that, would they? With all this Mr. Pink stuff built up?

Not a last hurrah. No. Stop that.

&gt;Can I talk about the planets now?

This is gonna be one of those episodes that makes me ""feel things,"" isn't it? I hate that.

Holy crap. The cinematography this season is so much better than it's ever been in Doctor Who before.

Why is Clara so cute?

Doctor having a dialogue with himself. ""I think it's a mummy, don't you, Doctor?"" ""Yes, I do, other Doctor.""

Never knew you could open a door by smashing the electric panel. Seems like a huge security problem.

This myth is awesome. And I'm really, *really* liking this Doctor.

Clara changing her mind about the Doctor. Or at least reconsidering. Good.

""I'm going to have to mark you down for this."" Best Doctor ever.

Teleported away to avoid killing him too soon. That's interesting.

Shit. Clara's not going to want to stay with the Doctor, because of how cold he is, with making her lie to the other woman and say he can save her.

Unless he *does* save her...

&gt;""You're relieved, soldier.""

&gt;""He's not the only one.""

Heh.

Also, the name ""Gus"" reminds me of ""HAL,"" which I guess is intentional. I wonder if Gus is related to the Great Intelligence or something.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think its mostly so we can deport non-British criminals as well 

Is ripping up a piece of human rights legislation which has protected the rights of thousands of British people really worth it to be able to deport a thousand or so foreign criminals? Consider the following list of cases which have gone to the ECHR:

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
* Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)
* If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

Do you notice how a lot of those cases are ""v UK""? In all of these cases the UK government asserted that they were in the right until the ECHR told them otherwise. Do you really trust those same people to stand up for what matters when writing a ""British Bill of Rights""? I certainly don't.

Also, it's worth noting that under EU law we are allowed to refuse entry to non-British criminals but for some reason we rarely use it. Perhaps we should be asking our politicians why?

&gt;revoke the British citizenship.

We can already do that unless it makes them stateless in which case its a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is different to the European Convention on Human Rights and removing the Human Rights Act will not do anything to stop that.",0,1413087267,null,0,false,0,cl73gve,t3_2iz3xc,t1_cl73gve,t1_cl6veg3,null,1426570069,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

Fifth Doctor would flat out pull a Harvey Dent occasionally and flip a coin when deciding life and death situations.

The relationship between the Doctor and Clara seems to be a story arc this season. It's become a Moffat-era tradition to force story arc scenes ham-handedly into episodes just to keep the arc alive. This gives us the big emotional turns in the Doctor/Clara relationship, but we're missing the ongoing motivating tension.

I can imagine Moffat penning those mood swings and passing them to the writers to drop into their episode. Mathieson seems to have done a much better job of it than some of the other writers. Moffat himself packs his stories so full of clever concepts and plot twists that there isn't room to illuminate what's going on in Clara's head.

Jenna Coleman's acting doesn't help. She's good when she's got dialogue, but the rest of the time she just calmly stands around. A better actor would give us a sense of the character's headspace even when the focus is on someone else. She should be reacting to the Doctor's dialogue a lot more and looking a lot more panicked when everything's turning to poo.

This is a fairly liberal subreddit, throwing huge blanket terms over a certain demographic usually results in a mass of refutes and downvotes and this is pretty much the same as everything else in life, once you actually get to know people you begin to understand that although one aspect of them is an opposite world to you, you can love and relate to the rest of their personality. 

I know for a fact some of these people genuinely believe in these types of things. It's really not that bizarre. We have wars over religion, it doesn't take a stretch of the imagine to comprehend some people believe in some sort of psychic powers. Throw in customers who return and say they really helped them in their time of need or gave them hope and motivation or that what they said happened and people will believe they're making a genuine and positive experience doing this. 

I'm not defending the woman in OP's link. Call a spade a spade. But there are degrees of 'psychics and spiritualists' and actually the vast vast majority of them are doing nothing wrong and genuinely believe in what they're doing. Lets not group together thousands of people and label them 'cunts'.

In the same way we don't believe all muslims are terrorists on this subreddit lets not throw labels on a demographic of people with different personalities, this just being one factor of who they are. There are degrees of this stuff, lets not fall for the logically fallacious thinking where we look at the worst example of a demographic and apply it to everybody else who could come under that label.

There is an important recurring theme in the reboots of ""this is important *to me*"".  It started with Rose, who constantly used this excuse when confronted by Jackie or Micky.  When they complained about her running off to do god knows what and abandon her life, she always supported her choices by prioritizing her life with the doctor over the rest of the world.  Though she eventually ended up separated from him, Rose's real life was always in the Tardis.

Amy had a similar dilemma.  It was particularly significant in ""Amy's Choice"" and in every other instance in which she had to choose between the Doctor and Rory.  She chose Rory because he was important to her.  In the end, when she turned her back on that Angel, she was essentially having to make a choice between the Doctor and the real world, and she chose the real world.  Why?  Because that was important to her, despite how long it took for her to make up her mind.  This was the first time someone really chose against the Doctor.  The first time that anything was more important than traveling the universe in the ultimate tourbus.

Clara's demeanor toward amazing things and her focus on real life both hammer home the idea that life isn't just about seeing amazing things.  Sometimes the little things are just as beautiful as the big ones.  She loves her time with the Doctor, but what really matters is her little insignificant life teaching at a little insignificant school.  This, when he realizes it, will be a huge blow to the Doctor's ego, which he may need at one point.  I think Clara is a way to humble the doctor after several regenerations of essentially ""My life is dope and I do dope shit.""  

Clara's false bravado, lack of amazement, and prioritization of her normal life are all important parts of her dynamic with the Doctor.  In this way, she really isn't a proper companion.  She isn't fully committed, she challenges the Doctor's every move, and she can be occasionally obnoxious.  But to me, this is very enjoyable and I see it as important to the story.  None of that means you (or other fans) necessarily enjoy it though.  I completely understand why she isn't a good companion, and I can understand how one might find her very unenjoyable.  Thanks for your perspective, it made me think a little more about her as a character and I understand why so many dislike her.

TL;DR: I think she's *supposed* to be annoying, uncommitted, arrogant, and too attached to her boring life and I like it that way.  But I understand why you might not.

false,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"It's designed around Ivanovic so he can receive high cross field balls that we used to see the team attempt higher up and we'd consistently lose the ball because the players were too short and their full back could immediately pressurise the wide midfielder.

By committing Ivanovic early instead of on the overlap we allow a player to move inside which aids free movement of the more forward players as shown in the video. This in turn allows us to shift the ball much more rapidly between sides rather than being stuck in a position without the option of a simple pass as so often happened last season. As well as obviously having the advantage of maintaining width. The importance of a good striker in this plan is also pretty striking as he has to try and occupy the defenders to prevent them spreading out wider. 

Costa keeps the defence narrow and so on but should the 3 attacking midfielders move central you might see him try and move the centre backs wider quite quickly to free up space but that's another thing. The video covers a lot of the times the ball is continued down the line as the closest AM runs down the line to receive the ball closer to the byline as there's space when the midfielder and LB are not already stacked up.

Anyway these are the main reasons it's centred around Ivanovic I can think of right now. ",0,1413094913,null,0,false,0,cl75rgd,t3_2iytra,t1_cl75rgd,t1_cl6xcze,null,1426568984,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

false,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Couple of points worth bearing in mind:

- UKIP are the least popular party with a seat in Parliament, in that a greater proportion of voters say they will never vote for them. Very nearly a majority of the entire electorate are fundamentally opposed to UKIP.
- Nigel Farage is personally less popular or trusted by the electorate than either David Cameron or Ed Miliband (but more than Nick Clegg, to be fair). Labour voters like David Cameron more than they like Nigel Farage (a serious issue for the 'UKIP are as much as a challenge to Labour as to the Tories' meme)
- Farage is the least trusted leader on the NHS or education (or the environment) and only 5% of the electorate trust him on the economy - including only 37% of UKIP voters!
- polling shows that the rise of UKIP appears to be catalysing an increase in support for European membership. At present, an EU referendum will deliver a comfortable majority to stay in Europe. This is because UKIP is already the place for Europhobes, and they are not winning converts. However, their rise is annoying enough so-far-undecided people who, like the large majority of the electorate, don't care about Europe (it is way down the list of electoral priorities), that they've decided that they want to stay in to annoy Nigel - who most of the electorate do not like.

In other words, UKIP are very clearly being used by a large proportion of their voter base simply as a protest vote. Quite possibly a majority. 

What's more, many - possibly most - current UKIP voters appear not to even trust their own party to be effective in Government and don't actually appear to want them involved in issues of importance, like health, education or the economy. What the polling suggests that they are is a single-issue party that is currently also being used by the electorate as the receptacle for protest votes that the Lib Dems used to be. What this suggests is that if UKIP actually get enough of those protest votes to get into Government in some way, it is almost inevitable that those voters will not like what they see and abandon UKIP as they did the Lib Dems.",0,1413097807,null,0,false,0,cl76fwm,t3_2iz4zv,t1_cl76fwm,t3_2iz4zv,null,1426568667,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

The best place for finding these is [SpareRoom](http://www.spareroom.co.uk).

Finding a place at a distance is particularly difficult. Most people I've spoken to have (like myself) spent some time on someone's floor for a few weeks before finding something. If five people are interested and four attend a viewing, you're going to pick one of the four. Only it won't be five people who are interested, it will be forty.

It took me about a month, but I've got something in Redland now. It's a pretty good area, but can be very expensive. Cliffton even more so (on both counts). Cheaper areas might be Southmead, Fishponds/St George, Brislington and some places around Horfield. For decent bus connections you want to be around Gloucester Road. Otherwise I suggest a bike.

Should anyone who gains some kind of profit from a religious belief also be labeled a scam artist and have their industry banned? Neither psychic powers or religion have been scientifically proven and both can make a profit after all. 

Or maybe you genuinely think these people don't believe in this stuff. Maybe my mum does attend 'Angel healing workshops' just to keep up the appearence. I mean.. the Angel healing workshops cost more than what she makes (far less than minimum wage and that's why she works with those with learning difficulties as a full time job) but that's totally possible eh?

Hate to say it - but that depends on the opinion. When it comes to some opinions there's really nothing to discuss. It's entirely possible that people believe some utterly stupid things that should never even be entertained. Some people just need to be told they're wrong and that the world is moving on and growing up from their outmoded points of view. 

Don't believe me?

But at a similar age (probably not the best comparison but I don't know how you would compare communication or by what metric) their non-autistic counterparts could be expected to be competent with the best candidates nearing fluency.

I'm in a 'safe' Lib Dem seat, Lib Dem MP and Lib Dem run council, and generally the reaction on the doorstep is pretty positive. People like our stance on the EU, they recognise the moderating effect we've had on the Tories, they recognise that raising the tax allowance and gay marriage were two huge things we delivered upon and to which the Tories now claim most of the credit.

You get the odd spat about tuition fees and that's fair enough. It's something, as a student as well, I feel let down by. It is worth remembering the nature of coalition though, the nature of compromise. I think coalition is healthy and it would have been pretty undemocratic for the Lib Dems to get their own way all of the time. 

The one thing that does grate me is the occasional Labour voter going on at you about tuition fees. After all, it was Labour who promised not to introduce tuition fees and then did. It was Labour who promised not to introduce top up fees and did. It was Labour who commissioned the Browne Review on tuition fees which lead to the hike.

&gt;2) Does it commit Palestine to its boarders as is and its political situation as is. Because both territoriality and the fact that its still in a slow motion civil war seems to make Palestine non-viable.

I'd also add concerns others have echo'ed here that the internal palesintian political situation is not something you'd want to support considered by itself. The question then also becomes what does this vote do in regards to that?

So to the OP, its got to be a screaming TECHNICAL COLLEGES, LOOK AT THEM TODAY AND BOOK AND KEEP A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT.

Anyway to the wider debate about the Job center:

1) They seem to recruit themselves from the absolute dregs of the civil service and HR labour market. Occasionally you get someone competant who gives a fuck, but its few adn far between. You can pratically smell the wide tie stats focused mangers as well.

All of that just needs to go, if they just did something like hire people from the private recruiting sector at slightly higher wages we'd see a marked improvement as well as drop the stats driven management. Unfortunately given how deep the stats culture goes across all of the civil service its hard to see how a culture change could be effected.

2) The entire I.T infrastructure is laughable, really obviously  lowest possible bidder. This of course again is nothing new in the public sector, but until you have an infrastructure at least as good as your average job search website it needs to just be binned because most employers won't fucking bother. 

3) Workfare is not a fundamentally bad idea, its just implemented like fucking shite.

A big problem with structural unemployment, essentially is people not having skills that are in demand / no real skills. 

But stacking shelves doesn't change that, problem is again, why the fuck would a semi-conductor plant or a home delivery firm get involved at the moment. Its actively going to hurt them to train people from scratch who can just fuck off at any moment.

Sufficient financial incentives however, and any industry will do almost anything. 

The problem is simply that for years its been a horrdenously negelected part of the civil service that yes was very easy to game. They have tried to make it harder to game, but thats about the totality of the reforms.

Firstly, where about's in the UK are you? If you're in North East Scotland then life became a lot easier for you, if not, it's not impossible but it is difficult. Many companies don't like taking on guys with no offshore experience which leads to a massive catch 22 of can't get a job without experience but can't get experience without a job. Your best bet is the drilling and service companies, don't bother with the owner/operator companies such as Shell, BP etc. 
You'll also need your offshore tickets Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency Training. This involves being dunked in a swimming pool in a replica helicopter, spun upside-down and then left to escape. New Compressed air Emergency Breathing System training and Minimum Industry Safety Training. Some Companies will pay for all this but other expect you to have it and it costs anywhere from about £500 upwards. 
Another thing to consider is have you spent time away from you family before, offshore stints can be anywhere from 2 weeks to a month and I've heard tales of young lads breaking down after a day offshore because they miss there girlfriend, this is one of the reasons so many companies are keen on ex-forces personnel.
Have a look around the internet, Rigzone, Oilcareers and Oil and Gas UK are all good sites and will give you some idea of the sorts of jobs out there. Apart from that if that's what you've got your heart set on expect to be knocked back a lot. As a personal example I'm a time served electronics technician with 17 years military experience, I've got all my offshore tickets and my CompEx qualification (for working in explosive atmospheres) and I've applied for over 100 jobs and not had an interview yet. So, not to put you off, or labour the point but expect a lot of rejections but don't give up.Good luck

Now I work at an awesome job and life is immeasurably better for the choice I made.

Things probably seem hopeless now, but they get better. You just have to take control. If you're not on medication for depression, get one some. And join a gym or take up some kind of sport - those two things combined will do a lot to help the symptoms.

You're still young. If you're smart, get A-levels or equivalent, go to university, do a decent subject and get a good grade. Despite what people say about the debt and lack of opportunity, it gives you independence and if you have a good grade in a proper subject it wont make the employment process easier, but the jobs available will be much much more preferable, and worth the effort.

Don't dwell on the whole JSA system, just manage it. Unfortunately the same goes for the depression, but know that that's a common and *somewhat* healthy response to just being young, let alone out of work/education etc.

There are multiple unique reasons why geothermal ""works"" for Iceland.

1. They live on several active volcanoes. Which often cause issues such as [destroying villages](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77359000/jpg/_77359180_1973-volcano.jpg). I shouldn't have to point out most of us don't have so many active volcanoes in our countries; and thank fuck for that.

2. Iceland has a truly tiny population by any stretch of only 300k people. Even their nordic cousins in Norway have around 5 million in population. Reykjavik basically counts for over a third of their entire country's population all by its own. This makes their energy needs significantly smaller than any other developed nation in the first world.

3. Continuing from my second point. Their industry has traditionally been non-industrial with fishing and financial industries being the lions share. Only recently have they begun to do more manufacturing, although they only really export aluminium. This is certainly not on the level of cars or other first world and second world manufactured goods. They are a highly developed country, but not a very industrialised country by comparison to many other Europeans. They import almost everything they need.

4. Iceland actually uses both hydroelectric and geothermal.

For these reasons Iceland is fairly unique in its power requirements and access to renewable energy sources. However, it is still pretty cool nonetheless. Several people, including myself, have the dream of Europe one day using Iceland's volcanoes to help power a continent wide power grid. However in order to transfer the energy efficiently we would need something like room temperature superconductor cabling we could run undersea. Of course we have yet to invent that technology.

tldr: Iceland is unique. But it would be neat if we could invent a way for them to share the heat, without the ash.",0,1413115856,null,0,1413116268,0,cl79k0s,t3_2ixrcl,t1_cl79k0s,t1_cl6iqcy,null,1426567143,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

You're putting all their value on how they look rather than the actual actions and character they have. It's really rather degrading.

Like... Over the course of four years, I think four characters that fit that description is not an issue, do you? Do you really? Because I don't see anyone up in arms about the older gentleman in a suit villain that is so heavily used (especially during RTDs run). 

I mean, let's look at everything you said there. Pale... they're from the UK. Unless you're in a sunbed you won't have a tan. Middle aged... wow it's almost as though older women can do things too! Dark hair... Well Kovarian's is black. Missy's is brunette, and Kalibraxos is red, so... Dark lipstick... The only one that actually wears dark lipstick is Kovarian. Kalabraxos is red, Missy is pink. Weight... Well it's nice to know you can tell the weight of three women based on their appearance not on screen together and spaced years apart in some cases. That argument is basically, they're not really thin and they're not fat. Similar stature... Well sue me if a women standing (which missy isn't) is now something that Moffat is in charge of. Wow. Women standing... How similar of them. And then dark clothes... This is almost one that has weight. But it's kind of ruined by the fact Missy clearly wears purple. Karabraxos is a businesswoman so a suit (which is generally dark) is required. Kovarian is the only one that really wears clothes that are dark and probably unconventional, but yet it still fits within the villain trope. 

There isn't anything there to support any sort of argument. Like I've said if you wanna look at them and see three similar women then be my guest. But you and I both know that how these women look has no bearing on who they actually are and to imply so is highly degrading.

The argument that we parked vs Bayern. It's Bayern Munich in Germany, tbh its not parking the bus if you literally cannot get the ball because they are so good at keeping possession. Real Madrid played of the counter against Bayern, granted they won 3-0 Bayern still dominated possesion; are we gonna say RM parks the bus too? I watched the City game and they got completely ran over by Bayern and were lucky just to lose 1-0. It's a ridiculous claim that Chelsea has seen success from playing crap football over the years. Crap football is playing through the middle and making no chances against Chelsea, with no shots on target **Arsenal**. Liverpool plays nice football, ManU eghh they play from the wings and cross it in and hope someone heads it in. Point is on the attack we are as good as any other teams in England and we put up better fights against Europes best than those whingy shits ever do. Mainly directed at Arsenal fans.

To give it some truth Mourinho does go into some games (e.g. City away) just playing to soak up pressure and pinch a win, which I personally don't like to see, but on the attack and at home we play attacking football better than all other english teams.

As a general rule it's due to the separation between the retail ISP (who you contract with for tech support) and Openreach, the telephone line wholesaler.

I don't know how things stand between Openreach (formerly BT Wholesale) and BT's retail ISP division today, but as a general rule the retail ISPs tend to discourage sending out engineers because they can be charged a fee (c £150) if they've misdiagnosed the fault and an engineer wasn't needed at all.

A good tech support geek can identify a line fault pretty quickly and with a high degree of accuracy (assuming a reasonably capable customer, too) however the tendency amongst ISPs has been (in the past) to employ telephone staff who have no idea about technology and have them follow a slow and cumbersome diagnosis script.

If you want a good ISP then PlusNet and Eclipse are at the top of my list. I can usually get an engineer booked within 5 minutes of calling up Eclipse, and have done several times (the telephone lines to my last flat were particularly bad).

Name of the Doctor was pretty good too, but what ends up happening to Clara is one of those over-the-top Doctor Who moments that take me out of the story and make me roll my eyes, like that episode where everyone on Earth turned into the Master.

I didn't enjoy Listen, I found it lacklustre and anticlimactic. It relied on the Doctor's curiosity and Clara's lack of communication skills to drive most of the plot. I think Moffat relies too heavily on the mystery angle to drive his stories. Mysteries are best when the characters *need* to find the answer for some other reason, not just because they are curious.

The C.B.T. course may be of benefit. It teaches you to change your mindset and look at things in a different light. I took the course myself last year and found it to be a huge help (been suffering from depression for almost 20 years). I'd also recommend a book called The Mindful Way Through Depression by Williams, Teasedale and other authors. It works as an introduction as sorts to CBT (also comes with a CD of meditation techniques that can come in handy too). Getting that sorted out sooner rather than later will do a great deal to help.

&gt; A thousand calories' worth of healthy foods such as tomatoes, broccoli and tuna increased in price from an average of £5.65 to £7.49 between 2002 and 2012, whereas unhealthy food with equivalent calories costs just £2.50.

Who the hell buys 1000 calories worth of veg? the whole point of eating better is that you feel full on fewer calories. I wouldn't want to see the vast pile that 500 calories of veg makes, let alone try and eat through it singlehanded.

This week, we - a family of four - two adults, two teens - have £50 to spend on food to last us until next Friday. Yesterday, i went out for an hour and a half (with travel time), starting at 4pm, and spent £45 on fresh veg, raw meat and all the sundries with which to make enough bolognese sauce, pie fillings, maybe stews, and roast chicken for that week.

The stuff we'll eat over the weekend will stay in the fridge, the rest will get frozen down.

The bolognese sauce will make several dishes - canneloni, lasagne, spag bol for starters. It can go on baked potatoes, it can be wrapped in large cabbage leaves and baked, it can be slopped over a plate of cheesy chips.

I bought £7 worth of raw beef - labelled as ""stir fry steak"". That was the most expensive purchase, but with the simple addition of gravy, worcester sauce and a block of puff pastry that cost all of 80p, you have enough for four or six steak and kidney pies (pig's kidneys go for less than 70p per kidney and they're huge), probably more.

One whole chicken and two boxes of chicken quarters can all be butchered down in less than five minutes to provide ~20 single portions. Each pack of quarters contains five pieces. Cut the drums from the thighs, and assume two drums per portion, 6 servings per pack. A whole chicken will give you - 2x wings, 2x thighs, 2x drums, cut the fillet out of the breasts and cut the breast into 3 and you have 8 portions from the breasts alone. It takes no skill, no time and only a sharp knife and some freezer bags.

Lean beef mince is incredibly versatile, of course.

2.5 kilos of potatoes is just over a quid, a kilo of carrots is under a quid, as is a kilo of onions and a kilo of parsnips. Even sweet potatoes are cheap enough to buy on a budget. Mushrooms also come in at around a quid, giving you a pack big enough to satisfy anyone but a particularly starving hobbit.

A 30-pack of eggs is £3. Flour comes in at 45p a kilo, baking fat is 50p a block, sugar is less than a quid a kilo, golden syrup is a quid a tin.

100g each of sugar, self-raising and marg, two eggs and a big dollop of syrup is all you need for a glorious sponge pudding. That's 10 syrup sponge puddings for roughly 52p each. sure,you'll get sick of 'em, but you can substitute the syrup for jam at 80p a jar, fruit like apples at a quid a bag, pineapple for £1.50 each (drench the rest in sugar and dry-fry. You'll thank me!)

The myth that fresh, raw, healthy ingredients are out of the price range and convenience zone of people in poverty is just that - a myth. Is it the best quality? No, everything I've mentioned was from the while label savers range in Asda. 

We have had organic and free range, and yes, it does make a huge difference to taste, but needs must, and when you have less than fifty quid to feed your family for a week, you don't look at the best stuff, you do what you must.

yes, I enjoy cooking, but I'm not overly skilled.

Actually, you don't.

It's what's so bad about UKIP supporters - at least those on Reddit - that they'll ignore facts and evidence if it doesn't fit with their narrative.

Farage used to use a line about the EU costing us [£50m per day](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8911689/EU-costs-Britain-50m-a-day-Ukip-claims.html) - he continued using it, and UKIP supporters on here continued using it, [long after it had been debunked.](http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/05/ukips-britain-paying-the-eu-40-million-a-day-claim-vs-the-real-costs-of-uk-eu-membership/)

It's fucking tragic, and it's destroyed my faith in political progress. We all know that politicians are a dodgy bunch, but usually it's the case that things have moved on after the lie has been revealed and it's not repeated. In the case of UKIP's supporters they're happy to give Farage a pass, and even repeat known lies, just because it suits them to give a finger to the other parties.

None have got off the ground, partially due to environmental concerns, as /u/Cymraeg_Atodeg alludes to (the destruction of intertidal habitats and the endangering of the birds which rely on them, mainly), but mainly because of the vast amounts of capital investment needed to get the project going. 

More recently there have been proposals for a [tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay](http://www.tidallagoonswanseabay.com/), which, if you ask me, is far more likely to proceed. If that gets going and proves the technology viable, there's plenty of potential for more lagoons off Cardiff and Newport and in Bridgewater Bay, south across the estuary.

Personally I'd love to see a Barrage across the Severn. Birds be damned - the proposal for a barrage running from Lavernock Point by Penarth to Weston-super-Mare has the potential to generate a whole 5% of the UK's energy needs - or all of Wales' - completely renewably!

&gt;The __Severn Barrage__ refers to a range of ideas for building a [barrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_barrage) from the [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast) to the [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) coast over the [Severn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn) [tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal) [estuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary). Ideas for [damming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam) or barraging the [Severn estuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_estuary) (and [Bristol Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Channel)) have existed since the 19th century. The building of such a barrage would be a huge engineering feat, comparable with some of the world's biggest construction projects. The purposes of such a project has typically been one, or several of: transport links, [flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood) protection, [harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour) creation, or [tidal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_power) generation. In recent decades it is the latter that has grown to be the primary focus for barrage ideas, and the others are now seen as useful side-effects. Following the [Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Tidal_Power_Feasibility_Study) (2008–10), the British government concluded that there was no strategic case for building a barrage but to continue to investigate emerging technologies.

I have to admit that I'm very sceptical about the value of a degree these days vs. the costs of one. If you talk to anyone over 40 about university education then remember that they grew up in [the days when a degree was considerably more prestigious.](http://i.imgur.com/ySxae9q.png)

Last time I went out for lunch with my mother, both the barmen were graduates - honestly, they'd have been doing better today if they'd skipped uni, gone straight into retail / service jobs and spent 3 years applying for (trainee?) manager jobs.

Do not mistake dissatisfaction with your current job for something that can be fixed simply with a degree. For many people, life is just a succession of shitty jobs, and that's as true for those who have degrees as for those working in supermarkets.

Rossiter made his debut and scored vs Middlesbrough.

Beat Middlesbrough 14-13 on pens.

Phil fucking Jagielka equalised in the last minute of the derby with a goal he wouldn't score again if he tried a million more times.

Rubbish vs Basel.

Beat West Brom.

Sterling looks tired.

Lallana's boss.

Mario will probably work better with Sturridge.

Lovren and Markovic injured on internationals.

WE WON THE LEAGUE* (womens league)

You are so correct about the heat in the moment. After looking back, I shouldn't have gotten so caught up in trying to gain more and more readers; because instead, I just came off as an annoying spammer/marketer. (Which truly were not my intentions)  

Going ahead, I'll definitely go with the [summary] + [if you're interested..] route, just not as frequent as I have been. (avoid spamming)  I truly did want people to ~~join my cult army!!!~~ take a look at my post. 


Also, please don't feel like an ass, for I truly do appreciate the feedback. Contrary to what some believe, not all habits are broken down by simply ""ignoring the problem"". Rather than just downvoting someone's posts or even someone else IRL, sometimes it takes just one person to take the time and give a few moments of feedback. If you didn't say anything, I would still be commenting, people would still be downvoting, and we would forever be stuck in a perpetual loop that would get us nowhere.

Idk what I'm saying, and I'm pretty sure people are getting fed up with me getting off track. Just wanted to say thanks and let you know that your words just weren't wasted on a post. ty :)

Despite all that, I was accepted at Liverpool John Moores and Chester university (as well as Edge Hill, obviously). So from my experience, a lot of universities are flexible.

As a few others have said, give some universities a call and have a nice chat with them. Don't be put off if you're told no by a few (I had it made perfectly clear to me by a few universities that I wouldn't even be considered in clearing!), just keep ringing round.

It was supposed to be a key moment of the tension between clara and the doctor, which would have made a good episode into a great one or a brilliant one into an epic one, but the episode was so bad that it made a terrible episode into a bad one, I think the writers need to watch some more Babylon 5 (or even some of the 10/11th doctors) and understand how to do complex story arcs without taking away from individual episodes.

He abandoned her in the 22nd Century, out of a TARDIS that looked like a blue police box.

[unproven theory, not cannon, but here goes] I think the Doctor keeps the TARDIS in police box form so that when Susan see references to the blue box, she still knows he's out there - *keeping her safe*. I thinks that's part of why the Doctor is earth's protector (keeping Susan's home safe plus his own interest in humanity).

He doesn't fix the Chameleon Circuit (which has also been called a polymorphic generator by the fourth Doctor) so that it doesn't tempt him to change it's appearance. Even when Six fixed it, he decided to put it back, claiming he liked it.

In series 7 she came off as much more gentle and caring, like a loving friend or a supportive girlfriend.

etc etc. How many of them are now ""great""? There are literally thousands of players like him that have potential to be good. Just take the 6 top leagues, I think that's 116 teams. Each would probably have their own youth teams (take U17/18/21) and reserves. Assume each has 20 players. That's 116 (20 teams in PL/LL/Serie A/Ligue 1, 18 in BL/Portugal). 60 players in &lt;=17/18/21, about 7k players alone. Add 5 in the first team and 10 in reserves - about 8.5k. Now imagine others in other leagues in Europe. Probably 25+ more leagues alone in Europe, imagine all the players in Africa, SA, NA, Asia pacific region.... 

So I'm sorry that I'm not enthusiastic about ""the next big thing"" and I'm sorry if I think you should tone down your expectations. I have seen this literally hundreds of times before. Even for Spurs - Holtby hype? Paulinho? He was given a trophy for third best player in the confed cup. Coulthirst's hat-trick against the Barca youth, iirc he was quoted as being ""unplayable"" on the night and was being tracked by Barca and RM. Carroll? He's been touted for a long time. Ceballos?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=act0RUfs-u4

Christian Ceballos - Barcelona's boy wonder ""The New Barcelona Star in making guide by Ronaldinho""

Ring any bells for being ""the next big thing"" or being ""potentially great""? Or do you have a really good feeling about him this time that I should take seriously? Sure, a few make it, a few who you don't expect end up being better but if someone tells me someone has ""potential"", so what? Ffs I ""had potential"", granted it was lower than these guys but trials for a league 2 side isn't completely terrible.

Oh and saying ""he's fast"" - so what? Speed's nice but I don't see people pushing for Lennon as a starter. And up until a couple of weeks ago people wanted Kaboul out, his speed didn't mean much then did it?

The Green Death and Invasion of the Dinosaurs is actually a pretty good one-two punch even if both are a bit dated.

He knows he's going to be alive for a few more hundred years. 

I think it's more that the doctor became attached to his 10th regeneration. He knows how he's changed since meeting rose, losing her, traveling with Martha, and traveling and losing Donna as well. He had a long run and he didn't want to change. And back to what I was saying before, about being a different man, when 10 was talking to Wilfred he mentions how it still hurts to change. The old him dies and a new doctor takes over. It's still him, but at the same time it's not. Each doctor may be a regeneration of the same man, but in a way each regeneration dies and is replaced. They may have the same memories, but they are different people, and 10 and 11 both voiced that.

When they aren't working or looking after their children at the same time as spending a solid two hours preparing a healthy meal, they should be doing something productive, like running. Those with families can alleviate childcare problems by taking it in turns; one runs, the other watches the kids. Any form of entertainment with a cost is irresponsible. For those who really enjoy watching media, obviously cinemas and the like are out of the question at those prices. A family trip to the cinema probably costs more than a couple of months of Sky, but Sky itself is a waste of money when freeview exists. Friday nights can be spent watching Coronation Street and Take Me Out rather than wasting money on alcohol, broken up by laps around the council estate.

For those who love their football, there's still no need to squander all your money.

&gt; The soul crushing inevitability of the realisation that there is nought but futility in my existence.

Okay you are, just like myself, a collection of an innumerable amount of atoms. The universe has converged in an infinite number of ways for your glorious existence to occur.

The Big Bang happened, expanding particles outwards into a murky soup of potential. For millions of years this condenses until, somehow, a star is formed. This star burns for millennia and then most likely explodes. All across the universe this is happening. In their deaths these stars are producing  heavier elements, and ejecting them into the cosmos.

Now look to our solar system. It has formed from these heavier elements its own planets, moons, and a sizable collection of asteroids throughout. Ah but the most incredible thing is the third rock. On its surface the first amino acids have been formed, and from that proteins. Further on down the line, single celled organisms. In these we see infinitely complex functions and mechanisms; eating, digesting, multiplying, energy production and management. But, they evolve through greater magnitudes of being. From single, to multiple, to fish-like in nature, and then to the land.

Ah, land.

From here we see a plethora of life. We see the many hominids sprout up and die off. And then we see humans; Tools, fire, domestication. We are the apex predator, the minds of the animal kingdom, and we cannot be contained. We build great cities, and giant monuments to this and that. Then even greater wars, feats of engineering, disease, and exploration. We establish electricity, radio, space travel. Most importantly of all, we proliferate.

You were born just like me. A collection of cells brought on by complex mechanisms inside of your own mother. You are alive. Most of you was forged inside of a dying star to be spit out and recycled until it culminated in your existence. That in itself leaves me in awe.

To me you are a precious and incredible convergence of a great many things. I know you feel bad. I know this may not help you. But remember you were pretty cool, even from the first atom :)

First, you've got the ferry trip. Who doesn't love ferries?

When you're there, Blackgang Chine (""Land of Imagination"" theme park) and Robin Hill (""Adventure Park and Gardens"") are both good places there for kids, while also offering a joint ticket, although it's worth judging for yourself whether they'd be age appropriate. Also worth keeping in mind what the weather will be like, to see if that restricts what they're doing.

You could say this about any flaw of a tv show which has run for a long time. The issue still remains that the time travel isn't done well and could be done better.


&gt;I find the Daleks are shown to be more than one-dimensional in many of their episodes. Yeah some are rote and they become one-dimensional but there are plenty that go beyond them as just killing machines. They are shown to be quite deceptive and persuasive at times. They are also often willing to keep people alive to achieve their goals. The fact that some Daleks follow Davros and some follow the Emperor shows that they are not single-minded.

And their goals are always genocidal. A one dimensional or flat character is a character that has regularly only one goal or personality trait and aside from the very occasional deceit and the malfunctioning Daleks. In the case of the Daleks this goal and personality trait is the envy to kill everything that is not Dalek, the fact they very occasionally  deceive people or keep hostages to attain this goal hardly makes them fully fleshed out characters as it does not create a new goal or a new character trait.It is just a method they adopt to get to the already established goal that is already within their established means.

&gt;The point of The Waters of Mars wasn't to show that the Doctor saving Adelaide was wrong nor was it showing that not saving them was wrong. Even Adelaide alludes to this saying that Time Lord Victorious is wrong, not that the Doctor himself was wrong. 

&gt; The point was how the Doctor responded to the situation and how he felt about the decision he made and what he did after he made this decision to save them.

Isn't the response to the situation the saving of the people?

I'd be open to it being his reaction (i.e. the TLV speech) but you seem to classify this as another category ( ""how he felt about the decision he made and what he did after he made this decision to save them."").

 I'll respond to the rest later

Alternatively you could open a Cash NISA. http://www.bmsavings.co.uk/savings/isa-savings/ This is currently the cash ISA with the best rate (1.55% AER).

Bite your tongue!

While the 3rd is my favorite (out of old Who), it does have the drawback of being camp, rather than ""gripping"".  I can sort of understand why you would find it boring, particularly the first season (with Liz).  I find myself admiring the ""black &amp; white"" and dissecting the production details, rather than following the silly story.  But he's the Doctor with ""flair"", ""enthusiasm"".  You won't see it again until Tennant.  And he breaks the mold for his previous two incarnations, which ends up setting the behaviors for many future doctors.

false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Even as a descendent of (Jewish+Socialist) Holocaust survivors, I can't profess to knowing everything on this topic. But the general conclusions I've come to is that the term ""Jewish"" has become *incredibly vague* in modern English usage. Your dictionary might have a very solid definition, but I'll be pretty shocked if everybody is actually following it. 

However, I usually identify three different ways of being Jewish: racial, cultural and religious. These usually overlap. 

Although I doubt that there is much racial similarity between the various racial jews which can be found all over the World today, they usually will argue that their heritage at least partially leads back to Abraham in the Holy Land. Obviously we don't have records going back 2000 years so the idea is somewhat spurious. Still, it didn't stop the National Socialists seeing them as an identifiable ""race"" (and exterminating anybody directly related to one) nor does it stop many people calling them one.  

Being racially Jewish is normally a pre-requirement of being either a cultural or religious Jew, but if you're either a cultural or religious one, then you're usually the other kind as well because the practices of the culture are usually bound up with the religion. It's hard to follow one without the other (although from what I understand, it is possible). 

These are the definitions and markers I use, but I think that other people will use slightly different ones because Jewishness is such a vague term these days. ",0,1413133308,null,0,false,0,cl7fcui,t3_2j0lhi,t1_cl7fcui,t1_cl7f0jf,null,1426564310,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Even the Nazis, for all their antisemitic barbarism, were surely targeting Jews as identified by culture (though they certainly talked in terms of race, I'm not sure how they would have identified a German Jewish non-circumcised baby left on the street as Jewish against a German Protestant baby left next to them). 

Still, as I say I'm not entirely convinced by the notion of race as a whole.

A banana has 100 calories, so if that's the measure, we could say 10 bananas = £2, and wow the rich people have it so cheap! It's just meaningless. Eating 10 bananas isn't healthy either.

Food costs _have_ gone up, but the problem with food is more than just how much Brocolli costs. It's the whole attitude to food and cooking. I enjoy cooking and spending a couple of hours on a meal, but I watch any of the 'easy meals' TV shows and think this really won't inspire people to start.

The problem with Jamie Oliver's TV shows (and others) is yeah, the cost of the meal might be £4 a portion, when you count a tablespoon of Imported Rarest Crap as 5p. The problem is someone on a very limited food budget isn't going to go and splash £10 on the jar of Imported Rarest Crap in the first place.

Cooking shows need to stop being sexy, and really get down to basics. How to roast a chicken. Or better - how to butcher a whole chicken into constituent parts so you don't need to buy expensive breasts. How to cook vegetables properly. How to make an omelet.

Work in tax here, the simple answer is you need to declare all of your earnings. The thing is if you put your information from your P60 I.e. Income and tax paid on the employment pages of your tax return that should be it. You won't pay more tax on your employment income than has been deducted at source (unless your PAYE coding notice was incorrect), you will only have a tax payment on the £20 of self employment income.

Nope, and it's not a struggle. I'd like people to learn the basic cooking skills that I have, which would make convenience food pretty much redundant.

&gt;  ""everyone should work harder to be healthier like me""

I'm five stone overweight and type 2 diabetic. I'd wish for nobody to be as healthy as me.

Again though, it's really not hard work. Even a full roast dinner with all the trimmings isn't a big deal. It's all down to timings and preparation.

Look at it this way - it's rare that a restaurant or pub can't get your food to you within 20 minutes (busy periods aside). How do they get your roast chicken and trimmings to you, freshly cooked and piping hot (ideally), 2 hours quicker than at home? Preparation. If they can do it, you can do it. Find out what they do and copy it. Simples.

&gt; The huge income gap between the richest and the poorest is ridiculous and increasing to an all time high

Dangerous turn of phrase, there. See: Middle ages, Victorian workhouses, etc.

&gt;  it takes a lot of time an effort to eat healthily on a budget

It really doesn't.

First episode -the Doctor has an edventure on his own, juxtaposed by Clara at home with Danny. Bit of character development all round, and we discover the ""dynamic"" that is missing from both their lives when they're not together. Doctor comes over for tea at the end. Then the second episode is this one. Much more storytelling, more satisfying.

Few problems I had with this episode:

- The Doctor is suicidal? He nearly died at the end. If it was THAT important he shows Clara his ""nice side"", it should have been noticed as such, but nothing was made of how he just nearly kills himself.

- The drama we all liked at the end of last episode is completely trivialised in this one. Clara first says ""I can't do this, not the way you do it."" - sounds pretty considered and definite - then ""Oh, Danny's ok with me 'knocking about' with you, so I'm fine with it now."" That makes zero sense.

- The whole ""sexy young nymph with older gentleman"" thing seems a little weird now. I'm expecting a scene where they're [lying somewhere next to each other talking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNK7N3AwVFQ), almost touching but not quite.

- Danny is way to blase about meeting someone who travels in time and space. How dismally uninquisitive would a person be, not to want a ride, see things, etc. Esp. things his girlfriend is seeing. They'll never experience anything as exciting together if he doesn't go, he should know that and be worried about it, just from a relationship point of view if nothing else. His character is dumb.

ed: I mean, Matt Smith had the ""raggedy man"" and ""impossible girl"" thing. Capaldi is doing amazing with his character, but there's no ""lead balance"" because Clara is so ... normal really. Apart from the banter (which wasn't much in evidence this time) what's her place in the story?

false,dirtyewok,num26,,"I wouldn't say people ""shit on Yedlin"".....but there is certainly a group of people who are very excited about his ability, at times this excitement comes across as an irrational optimism. You have people who react against this optimism for any number of reasons, in this case they are just as vocal.

Truth is this happens in most major sports...Fans/Supporters of all sports love the ""next big thing"" doesn't matter if it is baseball, football, the NFL or NBA. People love looking at the ""prospects"" and thinking of what they *could* do in the future....its canned hope and people love it.

But as much as there is reason for optimism with Yedlin there is alsoa liteany of names that can be given of players who looked a ""sure thing"" and never panned out.

Long time USMNT supporters can regale you of the tale that was Freddy Adu....at 14 years old Adu was the player who seemed destined to lead the USMNT for years to come, he was supposed to be **THE BIG THING**, he was supposed to be the first US player who would be on par with the stars of South America or Europe. We all know how it turned out...a star that faded quietly.

From Spurs you can list any number of players who were supposed to be the ""next big thing""....David ""The Next Beckham"" Bentley, Souleymane ""the Next Drogba"" Coulibaly. Bentley we paid £15m for, at 24 years old he was supposed to be the cornerstone for the club and country....in 5 years with the club he scored 3 goals and spent the better part of 3 seasons in the reserves or on loan.

An even better example of a player not panning out for Spurs may  be John Bostock....at 15 he was the youngest player to ever play for Crystal Palace, he was also the youngest to ever start a match for Palace. At 16 we paid close to £1m for him with more money to be paid out in incentives...we had him capped at 16. The youngest player in Tottenham club history to ever play in a competitive match (a Europa league match).  The sky was quite literally the limit for Bostock, people were talking about how he would anchor the midfield for Spurs and how he was destined to be a star for the England team....he was going to be a star, truly a ""can't miss"" prospect.  5 years later he never played a single match in the PL for Spurs, he went on 5 disappointing loans and now at 22 is playing in the Belgian second division. Bostock serves as a warning about falling in love with potential.

When i look at Yedlin i see a young kid with great physical ability that needs to learn....but he is exciting. If he works, maybe he turns into something special, maybe he falls onto the scrap heap of ""prospects"" that litter the world of football. 

We won't really know what we have until he gets to the club.

A massive swarm of votes from the Tories to UKIP in one seat (though people were voting to keep their current MP so it's not necessarily about what party he was standing for), and a massive surge in votes in another, cutting Labour's majority to around 600. In the EU elections they topped the poll in South East England, a traditionally right-wing area, and came a very close second in Wales, typically a left wing area.

This was possible because Euroscepticism is relevant to many political ideologies, but as UKIP grow as a party and get more responsibility, there will come a point where they have to declare strong stances on other issues as they have already been doing to an extent. When they do that and start to focus less on the EU, they will likely alienate a large chunk of their voter base. It has also been helpful to them that there has not been much proper debate on the EU at all, it is easy to believe the EU is the source of all of our problems when there has not been proper scrutiny of the claim. However should the issue ever be brought to prominence some of their support may dwindle.

Right now I think UKIP are popular because people are fed up of the mainstream parties. At the last GE, the lib dems saw a surge in support for the same reason but then they entered government and in their support as the alternative party to the status quo has collapsed. UKIP have very easily established themselves as being on the side of the people, where the Lib Dems used to be. When all of the political parties that the public hate close ranks to smear UKIP, it's not surprising that this only galvanises their support.

Asking on /r/unitedkingdom if anyone thinks UKIP are an awful alternative is preaching to the choir. 

I also wouldn't necessarily agree about your point regarding them only having 1 MP, and infact as you'll no doubt be aware before Friday they didn't have a single MP. They are important because of what they mean for the May 2015 General Election - not because of their current number of MPs... so before you convince yourself its all just the media getting carried away, remember they are polling between 15 and 25% of the vote... and that's literally groundbreaking. Never in British politics has such a comparatively new and unestablished party hit polls like that, and they stand to split the Conservative vote - and perhaps also Labour to. If the Greens were polling 25% and threatening to change the face of British politics at the next election, potentially pushing us into a 4 party system, then we'd all be talking about them. 

I wouldn't agree they are Tories in a different tie either. They are certainly right-wing obviously, but thats where they stop. UKIP are interesting because they've managed to capture something that Labour and the Conservatives have struggled with for the last decade really... and that is aspirational appeal to every day voters. It's probably because since the late 90s British politics has become increasingly about middle-England ""swing"" voters... and pleasing them has gone to such extremes that quite often it's come at the expense of the average voter.

In my opinion, the long story short is that 99% (talking to the dead act the 1%) of the industry is completely fine as it is. They have disclaimers and the customers go into into it with full knowledge it's to be used for entertainment purposes only.  People don't have an answer to what they should change about this industry from what's already in place because it's fine as it is. The comments in this thread were actually quite disgusting (Calling my mum a cunt because she reads palms in her spare time?) and were purely based on the emotion from watching OP's video rather than actual knowledge about the industry (nobody here has any and making opinions about shit you know nothing about rarely goes well) or any kind of logic.

I guess I can say what I like about this, at least it's not j-pop! (though the [""Tete"" closing theme from Space Brothers](http://www.jpopsuki.tv/video/Akihisa-Kondo---Tete/3ca72b35fd29411dea1730fbbebb57ce) is fantastic)

&gt; This show was lovingly made by and for people who just enjoy trains soooo much that they can never look at them go by enough! :)

And that's what I love about Anime - that's all the reason they need.

Space Brothers would never have been made as a western series - too straightforward, too literal, too drawn out. I love all of the intricate detail in it, that only space geeks would get. (It did start to drag seriously about 52 episodes in, though - I'm on a very long break right now...) ^(Yes, it's the only anime I've ever committed to.)

Because of that I was actually paying attention to the price of them for a change... normally I don't. I noticed that some things were very cheap and some things weren't.

If I was inclined to save more money I could blanch and freeze stuff, or I could just choose to use what was cheap. 

I also noticed that frozen veg is a better option for some stuff.

Brocolli was 49p for the head, but it was much less than half of what's in a frozen bag for £1, and the frozen bag has florets rather than the head so you're not paying for the stalk.

I could live very very cheaply if I chose to.

The problem is it takes time, and effort, a bit of knowledge and being able to spend what you need to, when you need to.

My understanding is that frozen veg is not significantly worse that fresh veg - and I'm sure I've read somewhere that it's better.

On top of that while having Sunday dinner I was asking my father about food on ration books - he grew up on it. His view was that food was much less important and people were content with what they had because there wasn't the amazing variety that we have now. 

Something else someone mentioned in a similar thread is that some takeaway shops will do food on credit - so people will be effectively taking out pay-day loans for food, buying low quality shite ensuring that when they do get their wage/benefits in they have no way to get themselves out of the hole.

So I think the problem is convenience. This is a little bit nasty, but the same choices that lead someone to a dead end job are the same choices that lead someone to high carb/low quality Farmfoods meals. And feeding that to children will result in the same pattern.

How to fix it? I can't think of a way that's not invasive and nannying. Is it punitive taxes? Is it to legislate to ensure there's healthy, inexpensive convenience meals? Is it to put health warnings on bread? Is it to replace benefits with something draconian?

I don't have the answers but what I do know is that just simply giving people more money won't make them less ""lazy"".

&gt; In the full context of the former President’s speech, he is saying that the European Parliament legislates on 75 per cent of laws passed by the European Union. That is, the Parliament had a say in 75 per cent of the legislation that the Union, as an institution in itself, was making and not 75 per cent of the laws being made by each member state in the Union.

In other words, 25% of legislation passed by the EU goes through with _no say from the EU parliament_! How can a government that doesn't let the representatives of the people have a say in 25% of the laws that it passes possibly consider itself to be ""democratic""? If there's ever a good reason to oppose the increasing influence of the EU, this is it.

Even post-Lisbon, which the EU claims gives the parliament a say in ""100%"" of legislation that's still only a 50% say, with the unelected council of ministers having the other 50%.

That being said, I seem to remember that when with us he enrolled in Swansea University, and was taking something pretty advanced (Some sort of offshoot of medicine if I remember correctly). He's played for Port Talbot prior to this, so perhaps he's staying in the region to focus on his education and thus his career after football; I can't imagine he's earned a fortune during his football, not enough to retire on.

false,Carlswaen,null,null,"&gt;In his 2004 speech to the CBI Mandelson said the single market was worth about 2% of GDP to the UK and 
contended that this benefit of EU membership had to 
be weighed in the balance against the cost of regulation, which was 4% of GDP. His claim does not stand up. 
The benefit of industrial free trade with our European 
neighbours can be enjoyed outside the EU, just as readily as it can be enjoyed inside it. A common argument 
in British political debate is that the UK must belong to 
the EU in order to participate in the industrial free trade 
that accompanies ‘the single market’. That argument is 
bogus. Sure, in exporting to the EU27 British companies 
would have to meet the EU’s regulatory requirements. 
But we can negotiate over the content of these regulations, just as Mexico, Israel and Japan have done in their 
FTAs. More generally, British companies have to meet 
national regulatory requirements when they export to 
the USA, China or India. But no one has proposed that 
the UK has to embrace full-scale political union with the USA, China or India in order for these exports to be
acceptable in these important foreign markets.

That 4% is now estimated to have possibly passed 10% in the last 10 years, by the same professor of economics.

So, even if we take Mandelson's 2004 figure, and not the 2013 update, we're talking about an additional ~4% of GDP.

Putting aside whether it is for a 'greater good', which is really a matter of opinion, it's no longer a tiny sacrifice.  4% of a £1.5 trillion economy is no 'tiny sacrifice'.  Nor does it account for the loss to the fisheries.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; He's allowed to say that because some EU commissioner said it

That's the thing though isn't it - no EU Commissioner said it. [UKIP say Viviane Reading said that](http://www.ukip.org/the_truth_is_out_at_least_75_of_our_laws_are_made_by_eu_institutions_says_senior_european_commissioner_viviane_reding) but she didn't. According to [one of the articles I mentioned](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu_make_uk_laws_70_per_cent-29589):

&gt;&gt;We contacted Ms Reding’s press office to find out what source she was basing this on. In fact, the percentage was actually referring to something entirely different – where the European Parliament (consisting of elected representatives for each EU country) has an equal say to the European Council (made up of the governments of all EU countries) **on EU laws, not UK laws**.

In other words she said that the European Parliament had a say on 70% of EU made laws. The number of EU laws compared to UK laws is not mentioned. 

&gt;I don't really think we should really have people from other countries voting on how our country is run 

How are we supposed to integrate our markets in goods and services then? To give one random example - Imagine Germany decides the precise regulations for car manufacture in Germany and we decide on a different set of regulations making our cars illegal in Germany and German cars illegal here. That hurts British manufacturers and German manufacturers. The EU solution is that we get together through the EU institutions and hash out a solution we both like and both use the same system of regulation allowing British products to be sold in Germany and German products to be sold here benefiting everyone. That process can't happen without some negotiations and a final vote. So yes, if you want to collaborate internationally foreigners have to be indirectly part of the collaborative effort to produce common international standards because both parties have to agree. The EU has competence over international issues like trade and the integration of markets across the EU. It cannot make laws on purely national issues. 

To suggest that foreigners should have no part in forming the regulations we use is to say that we should not take into account the opinions of our potential customers - it's total isolationism. Every time we sign up to any international agreement like those to combat terrorism or climate change that agreement could not have been signed except with the agreement of foreigners. The EU is the exact same thing but on a larger scale and dealing with many more issues. 

&gt;we're basically pumping in money to help everyone else

We're 'pumping' in about 8.7 billion a year or 1.2% of our budget. We currently pay 5 times that amount just paying interest on the debt we owe - paying off our national debt would be so much more economically helpful than leaving the EU. It's not very much money and the benefit it has by investing in physical infrastructure, internet infrastructure and by encouraging economic activity in poorer EU countries (not by simply handing out cash to people as some tend to suggest) will come back to us in the form of them buying British products. If someone in Eastern Europe has more money to spend and the roads around them improve with the help of EU money then some will be more willing to buy a British car or buy British food products or other British manufactured goods. Why else do you think the biggest business organisation and lobby group with over 1500 business members big and small is so sure that British businesses receive a big economic boost as a result of the common market in the EU. After trade negotiations with the US and Japan are concluded British business will have access not just to our $2.6 trillion economy but to a $47 trillion market. As the CBI says: 'The UK would struggle to achieve the same quality of trade deals independently'. 55% of SMEs think the EU international trade deals that UKIP want to end have had a positive impact compared to only 3% who think they have been negative. Those are the same SMEs that are employing British people and paying them. The integral nature of the benefits EU trade has provided can't really be overstated. It affects almost everyone.

Put it this way: I did Home Ec GCSE in 1995; there were enough people doing it that the school ran two sets of classes.

It wasn't rocket science, but it did teach you a LOT of basics that otherwise I wouldn't have a clue about. I wasn't Gordon Ramsay, but at 16 I could bake bread, separate an egg, bake a cake, make sausage rolls, make a simple roux and follow a recipe. I took it not because I was necessarily enormously interested, but because I couldn't find another GCSE I was interested in and I figured it was a useful skill to have.

Six years later:

 - The teacher had retired, not been replaced, and the cooking area used for teaching had been repurposed. All the cookers had been removed and disposed of; all the worktops torn out.
 - Another school that I worked at had one (1!) person doing home ec at GCSE - and she was only allowed to do it because it was a private school, the parents threatened to pull her out if the school didn't do it for her and the teacher was being paid a full-time wage anyway.

These were in private schools that could afford to keep the facilities going with relatively little interest in the subject probably longer than most state schools could hope to.

No bugger's doing home ec any more. And that was thirteen years ago. By now, that generation has young families.",0,1413144299,null,0,false,0,cl7l26y,t3_2j0w5k,t1_cl7l26y,t1_cl7g36d,null,1426561648,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I think this is something that a lot of people don't understand or realise - and it seems you're getting a good deal of angry down-arrows for your trouble! People focus - for good reason I suppose - on the folks who make thousands or, in the case of those like Morgan, millions out of those who are recently bereaved or can't let go etc. and tar all with the same money-making, celebrity courting, [helping a distraught mother find her daughter](http://badpsychics.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/psychic-joe-power.html) attention seeking brush. I'll be clear: the money makers are most likely to be shitty people, possibly to a man. But there are a good many folk who think they can do the same but don't go around 'scamming'. At least not in the sense most people would think, and certainly not knowingly.

I'll compare it to [Peter Popoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff), an evangelical. He believes/claims that prayer can heal. He makes (or made) millions and millions off of it. I don't think he can be compared to your average religious person who prays for people to be healed. Both are wrong/misguided, in my opinion, but their wrong-doings are not comparable. One is decidedly less ethical.

There (must be) are tons of people around the country and world who don't fleece people who come to them for help, and honestly think they're doing good. They're not out to make millions. I personally am of the opinion that they're deluded or similar, but that doesn't mean they're nasty or horrible people. What they end up doing might be seen as disagreeable, but that's another matter. On that front:

&gt; the vast vast majority of them are doing nothing wrong and genuinely believe in what they're doing

I'd agree with the latter part of that sentence, but perhaps not the first as it depends what you mean by ""wrong"". I'm not sure it's as simple as ""helping someone in need"" or making them feel better, but that's a larger conversation and probably better suited to psychologists. And I ain't one.

TL;DR - I understand what you're saying, and/but I know where others are coming from. However they need to look at the bigger picture and consider that a good many people who believe they have certain powers are just as nice, or regular, as anyone else you might meet and also don't scam/cheat or charge people money necessarily. On the ""nice"" psychic front [this episode of the Podcast ""Be Reasonable"" is a good start](http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/2014/04/be-reasonable-episode-016-vicki-monroe/): An interview with a psychic - Vicki Monroe.

&gt;

&gt;A __tor__, which is also known by [geomorphologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomorphologist) as either a __castle koppie__ or __kopje__, is a large, free-standing [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology\)) [outcrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcrop) that rises abruptly from the surrounding smooth and gentle slopes of a rounded hill [summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit) or [ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge) crest. In the [South West of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England), the term is commonly also used for the hills themselves – particularly the high points of [Dartmoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmoor) in Devon and [Bodmin Moor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodmin_Moor) in Cornwall.

&gt; Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play.

Bevan: ""Furthermore—and this is an argument of the utmost importance—if it be our contract with the British people, if it be our intention that we should universalise the best, that we shall promise every citizen in this country the same standard of service, how can that be articulated through a rate-borne institution which means that the poor authority will not be able to carry out the same thing at all? It means that once more we shall be faced with all kinds of anomalies, just in those areas where hospital facilities are most needed, and in those very conditions where the mass of the poor people will be unable to find the finance to supply the hospitals.""

&gt;EU citizens have a right to stay in the UK, or any other Member State that is not their own, for up to three months with a valid passport or identity card. But to stay for longer, they need to be:

&gt;1. in employment; or
2. continue to seek employment and have a genuine chance of being engaged; or
3. to be able to show that they have sufficient resources not to be a burden on public funds and sickness insurance.

You are not protected under EU law if you are in the country after 3 month with no money and no prospect of work and it is totally legal for EU countries to limit access to benefits until migrants begin paying tax. Those people who do not meet these tests can be returned to their home countries. I believe Germany is going to physically ban people from coming back to the country even for a visit for a temporary time if they are found cheating the benefits systems - again I believe this should be legal under EU law and something we could legally under EU law do but chose not to.

Is that what you thought it meant?  That we wouldn't be able to deliver stuff?   Gosh.

Incidentally the EU Commissioner is reintroducing ACTA through CETA, the Canadian-EU trade deal.  Leaving the EU might be a necessity in protecting those rights.

There was a leak in 2012 showing that ACTA had been gift wrapped inside a trade deal.  The EU announced that they had removed it in 2013.  In December 2013 the German Pirate Party leaked again, reporting that whilst elements of ACTA had been removed, the real meat was still present.

The EU has competency (by our agreement to the EU treaties) over the regulation of cross-border markets in goods and services within the EU and cross-border movement of money and people within the EU. That's it. Plenty of issues come under those headings but they should respect the domestic UK parliament's right to legislate on things that are domestic only and not cross-border. Education is a good example - domestic education of domestic children is a matter for the UK government only. Education of children from other EU countries in the UK becomes an issue the EU will have partial input on because it is cross-border with one state educating another state's citizen. The EU can then, as it does with university fees in the UK, ensure that citizens of other EU countries are not unfairly treated compared to British citizens. It's up to the UK alone to set it's own tuition fees rate even if it's different to other EU countries as we did in 2010/11.
