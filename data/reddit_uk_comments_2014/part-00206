I don't care what you think about Torres. It's a waste of time talking about him. Whether he's average or ""dog sh't"" isn't the point. The point is that talking about how bad he is just makes the problem worse. Some people on here seem downright hateful. He's on of our players. He's completely lost confidence. I feel sad for him, I don't hate him or wish that he would ""f'ck off.""

And the ironic thing is that /u/the_celler_d00r apparently doesn't like people talking about Torres, and decided to thus make a thread of people talking about Torres. 

/u/AlphaShotZ totally hit the nail on the head. It's about opinions. You can have whatever opinion that you want, no matter how stupid it is. You can say that you think that Torres is the worst player ever and that it would be better to play a hamster than to play him. Or you could say that Torres is the best and deserving of a Ballon d'Or. Both opinions are stupid, yet both are perfectly valid.

I'd rather people stop trying to dictate other people's opinions (like the OP here) and I'd also rather people stop the hate (like the people telling Torres to ""f*ck off""), but those are valid opinions just like any other.

My advice to everyone: take it easy. This isn't a life or death matter. It's people arguing about sports on the internet. Have a laugh and get on with your life.

All that said this rumor has merit, even if we ignore James, Isco and Illara were promised to be the next project of Real along with Morata and Jese and only one of them have been a part of the team seriously (Jese), Morata has already left and I can't see Isco deciding to take step down from NT to bench and then missing out on WC. Players are after all ambitious regardless of club, and I doubt he would want to remain there another year in bench of they really are after James. Isco to James is Ozil to Bale, a player that doesn't fit them very well even if he is extremely talented vs a player that fits them perfectly. James also comes with that sweet sweet image after the WC and a talent that is far more obvious and productive and Isco.

Here's a fun fact; Israel are (at the time of this post) 296 murders in the latest bit of conflict. 80% are civilian. Entire families wiped out. Still getting your kicks from this?

Here's another fun fact: the initial start of this conflict was because three Israelis were kidnapped. No investigation needed; just bomb Gaza. Still fun? Any murders = Kill people in Gaza.

Here's another fun fact: Gaza is blockaded by land, sea, and air. They manage to smuggle the odd thing in, but they are besieged. A besieged stronghold does not attack - it defends, it resists. What you see is Hamas resistance.

As far as I'm aware, in this latest bit of conflict 2 Israelis have died, one soldier (while attacking Gaza), and one civilian.

296 deaths vs 2 deaths. You still think Hamas is a brutal efficient terrorist organisation?

Anyone from Northern Ireland is both Irish and a British Citizen. You don't have to describe yourself as either of these but the fact remains that we have dual citizenship of both political states. 

People say they're ""Northern Irish"" so they can sit on the fence and not offend anyone by not claiming to have either of the above citizenships but I find it mildly offensive - you're just snubbing your nose in 2 directions instead of the usual 1.

Personally, I quite like having both citizenships and while I identify primarily as Irish I am also happy to be from the UK. I have family from Scotland and England and I grew up immersed in more UK culture than Irish - as did the vast majority of the population of NI.

I think more of us from NI should embrace both sides of our nationality. Neither of them are going away any time soon and it's pointless to hate half of your own nationality.

&gt; their penchant for blowing up buses or restaurants? Your view of reality is thoroughly warped.

Oh, is that better than Israel targetting Al-Wafa hospital is it? Where the surviving victims (women, children innocent men) were brought to? They've targetted it several times, as well as other hospital and infrastructure. Crippling the chance of any further innocents injured will survive at all.

If we can't offload him I think he would put a lot of pressure on Mignolet for the starting spot imo as even though Mignolet is the better shot stopper, overall I don't think they are too far apart in terms of ability.

It pacified anti-EU people because they now feel that Cameron is representing them. Pacifying them does not mean changing their mind.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"Every single time Jones has had a run of games he's made massive mistakes. He would not even be a starting keeper for a Championship side so he's not good enough to be a backup for a side trying to stay in the top 4.  I can remember just off the top of my head a number of times he's been at fault for our losses, and he's played what...20 matches in total? [Oldham match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBOey60Eg4) is a good example. [Or this](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/8027459070_699151e6f1_o.gif). Those two are just off the top of my head, there are a few more. His mistake to game ratio is much much worse than Reinas. Reina played something like 350-400 matches for us and it was only his last couple seasons where he made 3-4 high profile errors costing us matches. Considering the amount of times he's saved us 3 points I think people were very harsh. Our whole team performed terribly for a couple of years. Maybe i'm being harsh but Id rather have a a quality GK with a shit attitude as backup than an extremely nice, personable GK who is not very good. Even if we manage to sell Reina we NEED a GK who can put pressure on Mignolet. 

Jones being so average is one of the main reasons our GKs become complacent. When there is zero competition for places its only natural their form will drop. This was especially obviously with Reina and I believe it will be the same with Mignolet. Having Reina sitting on the bench with obscene wages is obviously not ideal. But i'd rather have him there than Jones if we aren't going to sign another keeper because if Mignolet were to get injured we'd be screwed.",0,1405751141,null,0,1405751777,0,cj1m81k,t3_2b3gue,t1_cj1m81k,t1_cj1ln18,null,1434789340,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Marko might start but he'll likely have to prove he's earned the spot. I don't think Brendan will just hand it over.

So we'll have some sort of 4-5-1 with Sturridge up top and everyone else similar enough. 

Say we have some coup and pull in a top, top, TOP player...maybe they push for Coutinho or Sterling's spot. I feel Sterling has earned his place more and that Lallana provides a lot of what Coutinho does plus some dynamism, but we'll see.

Take a look at the link up play between Suarez, Sturridge, and Sterling last season. They were absolutely phenomenal  because they had an understanding of each other's game and communicated with each other to let them know what runs to make. Suarez kept Sterling under his wing and taught him so much last summer on what runs to make and how to move to get into the right positions or help draw out defenders. 

I believe we'll see a lot of the old vanguard from last season, with some integration of the new blood sprinkled in through the first half of the season.

I work in a university and we have a dedicated Clearing hotline that is separate from our Admissions Office, so make sure you check that before you phone anyone up! We have a special Clearing section on our website that goes live a couple of weeks before Results Day and it has a list of courses that are expected to be available in Clearing as well as the phone number for the Clearing and Adjustment hotlines.  

The way it works with my uni is... You phone up the Clearing hotline and tell the operator your A-Level grades and what subject you want to study. They will check to see if there are places and whether you meet the minimum criteria. If you do, they will transfer you to the Admissions Tutor of that course. Then you'll have a bit of a phone interview.  

Re-read your personal statement and remember all the points you made: Why do you want to study this subject? Any relevant work experience or volunteering? Have you already started reading some of the textbooks on the reading list? What are your career plans? Etc...    

Some other general tips... You'll make a good impression if you are polite to everyone you speak to. Say hello, say please and thank you, don't swear.  

With regards to your last question 

&gt;If there is a vacancy in another similar course, can I take that place and then switch to my desired course?

It's generally pretty easy to switch between courses, I know quite a few people who've done this. Once you're *at* the university they want to keep you! It's usually easier to do this either during the first couple of weeks, or after end the of the first year.

There's an Irish systems scientist called David Korowicz who studies things like resiliency in complex networks such as our economy, his two main papers are [here](http://www.feasta.org/2010/03/15/tipping-point-near-term-systemic-implications-of-a-peak-in-global-oil-production-an-outline-review/) and [here](http://www.feasta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Trade-Off1.pdf).

Also, do you know if they're done a great deal of planning for the potential downside of something like peak oil?

The problem with that CCTV was it was a private system that only went back two weeks. Now this was a minor crime and I couldn't really do any more.

&gt;__Irish nationality law__ is contained in the provisions of the *Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004* and in the relevant provisions of the [Irish Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland). A person may be an Irish citizen  through birth, descent, marriage to an Irish citizen or through [naturalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization). The law grants citizenship to individuals born in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) under the same conditions as those born in the Republic of Ireland.

true,DirtyWooster,null,null,"You're rather proving my point here.

You've pointed out Israel's wrongs and brushed Hamas's actions under the carpet, despite their explicit intention of hitting civilians. And they would have managed if Israel hadn't invested huge sums in missile defense and if Israeli residents hadn't taken actions of self protection - rockets have hit houses, schools and nursery schools, and would have killed dozens had anyone been there. Hamas's ""fighters"" have attempted to carry out massive attacks against civilian population through the ""terror tunnels"" - these have been thwarted.

On the other side, Hamas have demanded that innocent Gazans stand strong as human shields to ward off Israeli plane strikes (they know that pilots will think twice if civilians are seen in the area) - they've announced it publicly. And instead of investing in their residents' quality of life, they poured tens of millions into tunnels and weapon acquisition.

And the claim of Israel not returning land is flawed, as Israel did unilaterally leave the Gaza strip in 2005. But Hamas chose their path.

Hamas has said they will accept nothing less than the cessation of the state of Israel. They are hard-line Islamists, supported by the Muslim Brotherhood and Hizballah. Egypt, the Arab League and even the UN (none of whom have been known to be Israel-friendly) have tired of them. Hamas thrive through hardship, in the same way Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIS have. They terrorize their own population, ban dancing and other unIslamic behavior, and have killed dozens (if not hundreds) of Gazans themselves.

The point of this one-sided block of text is to try to show you the other side, since you are obviously biased and seem to ignore one side. This isn't Israel vs. Palestinians. It's Israel vs. Hamas and other militant Islamist factions, with the Gazan civilian population stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Blowing up children on a beach *is* indefensible, and should be investigated. The same way that killing the Arab teen Abu Khedair was inexcusable, and those who did it are in prison (As opposed to Palestinians who killed Israeli civilians - who are celebrated by Hamas). But if you think that the IDF targets children as a policy, then they're either extremely inefficient or that's just not true. 

I spent a few hours yesterday (not on reddit) trying to show a hardline Israeli rightist the Palestinian side of things, and why the IDF must not attack indiscriminately, despite Hamas doing just that. Because he was one sided and refused to acknowledge Palestinian suffering. I tried to talk about Abu Mazen (who has denounced Hamas's actions) and about how Israel mustn't abandon peace talks. I hope I made him reconsider things.  

I deplore the loss of life, even more when it's kids.

As I said, it's complicated. Israel must answer to its actions. As must Hamas.  Showing it as a black-and-white situation does a disservice both to those who are suffering and to those who read are thus misinformed.

- Xabi Alonso was 23 and relatively unknown outside of spain, he turned into a star with us
- Torres was a well known player but was 23,  wasn't guaranteed to hit the ground running in the Premier League
- Suarez was 23 and scoring goals for fun in the Dutch league but there's a big difference between Holland and England
- Sturridge needed an opportunity, a platform to show what he could do and it wasn't until we gave him a run of games in his favoured position that he really showed his talent. Again he was 23
- Coutinho, 20 at the time, had a good 6 months on loan at Espanol but Inter didn't really know what to do with him. BR brought him in, gave him confidence and the freedom to express himself and he thrived. 

None of these players were in their late '20s already in their peak. Bottom line is, I don't think BR is going to sign a global star for many millions who's already made it to the top.

Anyway he plays much more proactively for Nigeria yet at Chelsea he is a passenger, willing to do a role but never push and prod really add intensity.

Create a drinking game out of it is obviously the best way to do it.

* Everybody pick a unique player each from the starting line-up, randomize or decide the picking order but host picks first always. If that player scores everyone else must take 3 drinks. (If you're a lot of players, same player can be picked multiple times, no one should be forced to pick Hugo but are free to.)

* Every goal we concede everybody must take 5 drinks.

* Everytime they show Poch on air, 1 drink.

* Hugo getting mad? Oh, you're screwed now. Everybody finish their drink, chug it if needed. No exceptions.

* Eriksen missing a pass/cross, 2 drinks.

* Rose scoring?! All start a new drink, all start chugging, whoever finishes their drink first or stops chugging last wins the game. (If someone has picked Rose as their player, they win the game by default.)

* Your picked player gets a yellow, 2 drinks.

* Your picked player gets a red, 5 drinks.

* Your picked player gets subbed, 3 drinks. Pick a new player.

* Hugo scores? Everybody wins.

* Adebayor offside? All take 3 drinks. If someone has picked Adebayor, they take 1 drink extra, that's the price they pay.

* Someone makes a ""Oh, Lamela is alive""-joke? Kick them out, they're not your friend anymore.

* Someone mentions or asks about Bale? 2 drinks for that person.

* Someone mentions liking Messi or Barcelona? Put them in the kitchen, they obviously doesn't know anything about football. They don't get to watch proper football.

* Guess how many added minutes there will be in every half. If you get it wrong, 2 drinks.

* Half time is mandatory pee break. If you miss any minutes of game play, 1 drink per minute missed.

* If Lamela starts, everybody take 2 drinks to start it off with a bang. If someone has picked Lamela, they take 1 drink.

* If we take Hugo off, 2 drinks.

* If Hugo doesn't start, 4 drinks.

* ~~If~~ When Walker misses a cross, 1 drink.

* Soldado starts, 1 drink.

* Some of our players get injured? Everybody take 3 drinks. If your picked player was injured, you only take 1 drink.

* Hugo gets injured? Game over...

The goal is to stay somewhat sober.

I'll probably come up with more things before the game if needed. Feel free to add your own rules.

Alternatively, we dive into the transfer market... the issue with that is there are very little options available. Benzema, Mandzukic and other potential targets have committed themselves elsewhere, leaving us with little choice in a capable backup able to challenge Costa.

At a guess, you're saying ""they were born in Scotland, therefore they were representing Scotland"" which is very much based around a *very* outdated idea of which ""birthright"" is a part.

where someone is born does not make them a representative of that place, in the role of Prime Minister, both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were representing the UK as a whole, not any specific part (though they held their duties as local MP's too), put it like this, In the Scottish Parliament there are plenty of people who were *born* in England, does that mean that England is represented in the Scottish Parliament? there is also a French Born MSP, does that mean France is represented in the Scottish Parliament?

I think CMS could really prove himself this season and be effective alongside O'Grady, big and strong to compliment small and nimble. I think we will see Fenelon go out on loan once more, i hope to see Solly getting more play time than last season along with Ince, Dunk, and Caskey our most promising prospects. I hope to see Walton integrated as goalkeeper as well. Rumours have it that we are going to make a million approach for Stockdale which would be a great signing for the price, and it would be good to get Ward in again for some continuity unless we can find younger and better for the same price.

We need one more striker, a big signing to rejuvenate the spirit within the camp and give a sense of ambition once more which was a reason Ulloa left. With Poyet we felt like an aspiring premiership unit but last season with the hangover from failure in the play offs it took a long time to recover and we didn't display the same flair in spite of Garcia's miracle. Hyypia is a chance to put us back on the tracks to the premier league once more but i have faith in our club with whatever plan they pursue as they seem to be providing the foundations from which we can make a solid push; stadium, training grounds, new back room staff, getting our finances in to check, new sponsorship and kit deals. We are blessed with competent management and whilst many are frustrated i wouldn't mind seeing a consolidation season for a push next season.

All those stats are very impressive. You see pass completion % of 89% and you cannot help but be impressed. You see he even has the most number of tackles won. But what these stats don't consider is a more real world approach to analysis. 

1. First thing to consider is when did Mikel play last season? The answer to that is when Jose wanted some defensive stability; i.e. when we were planning to play deep, defensive, counter-attacking football. Out of the 3 clubs (Chelsea, Barca, Real Madrid), we are the only ones that played the defensive, counter-attacking style of football. This meant Mikel had a lot more defensive support last season from wingers and the CAM than Busquets and Alonso. Consequently, this meant he had more 1v1 tackles because his opposite number had nowhere to really pass, which meant he ended up dwelling on the ball, which gave Mikel a clear chance to take the ball off him. Regardless of this, I want to point out that Mikel has always been quite decent at pure 1v1 tackling. But it is important to understand the different elements that are never considered in these stats.

2. Pass completion rate and average pass length: For a position like a deep defensive midfielder, these stats are irrelevant because most of his passes are straight to an attacking player or a player in front of him. Where the average pass length **should** matter, is when you compare it with the number of chances created or with the number of key passes made or the number of forward passes. 

**Here's how those stats compare between the three players:** http://imgur.com/mB1a1gr

**In terms of defensive stats that actually matter, this is how they fare:** http://imgur.com/Vi0RHCt

Now these stats I've presented are from last season, i.e. 2013/14. But if you go further back to even 2012/13, Mikel's stats drop considerably, given the fact that he was left a lot more exposed by the wingers and CAM (Mata).

But here's the real problem. What none of these stats will ever be able to show you are Mikel's lapses in concentration. There have been so many instances where he's just gone to sleep and the opposition team have passed the ball around him and scored before he's even moved a muscle. Or where he's unable to read the opposition attack and just shuts down.

What those stats won't show you just how much his lack of pace or even his lack of effort to ever get back while being countered affects the team. I have seen him way too many times just hover outside the box while the opposition team, including the opposition's attacking CM get in ahead of him into our box. With Matic you almost never see that. In fact, there have been so many instances where Matic has tracked back so far that he has ended up clearing an attacking cross instead of our CBs or full-backs. That's called effectively marking the player you're supposed to mark. Mikel's tendency is to mark the player till the edge of the box then slow down and just stand there.

I urge everyone to watch some of the matches we've lost in which Mikel has played. I can guarantee you that almost always has Mikel been in a spot where he could have done more to stop the attack from scoring a goal, but because of his sheer size, or slow pace, or lack of concentration, or whatever the factor may be, he just doesn't. He just stands there ball watching and that is THE most frustrating part about watching Mikel play.

Here are how his defensive and offensive stats compare to Matic:

**Passing stats:** http://imgur.com/Fpr8uz8

**Defensive stats:** http://imgur.com/uoZ1ZfS

Now suddenly you'll notice how irrelevant Mikel's initial stats are, especially since Mikel's ""possession stats"" are some how better than Matic's even though Matic's passes have been more influential.

All this isn't to say that Mikel is a bad player. He would actually be a very good player for most teams. But when you're playing at the highest level, your weaknesses get exposed if you don't do exactly what you're supposed to do. He just isn't good enough to be our first choice DM, to a slightly weaker team he would be invaluable.

Christianity, and I imagine a lot of religions are similar, is an incredibly broad term. What your proposing pushes a lot of expressions of faith into a very small defined box. For example there are malicious and radical groups that act under the banner of Christianity, the KKK being one. However that is incredibly detached from the Church of England or the pentecostal movement that I'm a part of. I'm certain there's a similar range and depth among groups that identify as Islamic.

He's good at running in behind the defense, which works well at smaller clubs that play against teams with a high back line, but that isn't something he will get to use a lot at a big club like Liverpool. Especially not in the league or in domestic cup games, which is where he'll probably play the most.

He isn't very good running at defenders. He's not good at taking on a man, as his ball control at high speed isn't more than average, and his dribbling skills are below average. In terms of technique, he isn't a very good finisher either. He can finish well enough alone with the GK at a good angle, but he won't be in situations like that in a slow to develop offense like Rodgers seems to prefer. He doesn't pick the right spot when finishing from an angle or under pressure from defenders, and he isn't good at shooting from outside the box.

He isn't very good in the passing game either. He's not the type of player who likes to get involved and play other players through. He likes to get upfield, turned towards goal, and expects most of the service to come his way, preferably as through balls in behind the defense. He lacks the ball control and body control to hold up the ball in tight spaces, and the creativity to take part in an established attack.

Islam is a religion, not an ideology. Therefore, just like with other religions, you'll find that in relatively socially liberal countries such as our own people won't take the book word for word.

The ideological tenets of it are arguably little worse than those of Christianity anyway.

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;How anyone can say the welfare reforms are disastrous is beyond me

Read the report linked - it's pretty damning. 59% of the affected tenants surveyed said they had always or mostly been working anyway. Only 18% said they had considered working more to make up the benefit shortfall, 14% had actually looked for a job. Many of them can't for some reason (such as disability), and about 60% of affected tenants are now in rent arrears because of it. That means less revenue for social landlords and councils. 

The main policy intention that it would make tenants downsize is an almost complete failure, with only 4.6% moving to a smaller social tenancy, from only 14% considering it, and somehow a projection that up to 20% might have moved after 2 years. Predictably there has been movement (1.4%) out of social tenancies into private ones. As well as being less secure for the tenants, those are *much* more expensive for the public purse if they continue to claim Housing Benefit.

For what its worth, I can accept the idea behind the Benefit Cap (that a non-working family should receive no more than the average earnings in benefits - £26,000 per year). The Bedroom Tax is a bad idea poorly executed. Universal credit is a good idea poorly executed. ATLAS (automated transfer to Local authority systems) and real-time monitoring of incomes at HMRC are good -if obvious- ideas, poorly implemented.

I was lucky not to have any major issues, but the minor ones were far less expensive to fix than new car payments.  Keeping that going even though it was old allowed me to save more to have more security for later buying a near new car.

I think what I most wanted to say was don't write the punto off in your head until something actually goes wrong, keep it maintained and treat it well and it may continue for a long time.

Also, let's not forget that the British government offered a united Ireland in return for Ireland entering WW2, but Dev turned it down because he felt it was against Irish interests at that time.

&gt;The __sovereign citizen movement__ is a loose grouping of [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) litigants, commentators, [tax protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_protesters) and financial scheme promoters. Self-described sovereign citizens take the position that they are answerable only to their particular interpretation of the term [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) and are not subject to any [statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute) or proceedings at the [federal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States), [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States), or municipal levels, or that they do not recognize U.S. currency and that they are ""free of any legal constraints"".    They especially reject most forms of [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation) as illegitimate.  Participants in the movement argue this concept in opposition to ""federal citizens"" who, they say, have unknowingly forfeited their rights by accepting some aspect of federal law.

The author's utterly racist and narrow-minded world-view practically screams in your face - it's absolutely great! The more articles like this come out, the more and more crystal-clear the actual reality of the situation is to anyone who takes even the most passing interest. 

The march was entirely peaceful and made up of thousands and thousands of caring and conscientious people from all over the country, from hugely diverse backgrounds - young and old, Christian, Muslim, Jewish.. people of all faiths and all backgrounds joining together and speaking with a single voice to express their utter outrage at the senseless murder of thousands of innocent defenceless people - actions which have been consistently supported and funded by our own Government. 

At the end of the march outside the Israeli embassy we stood to hear the speakers, the most powerful and emotive of whom was a Jewish lady from ""Jews for Justice for Palestinians"", expressing her utter shame and despair at the actions carried out daily in her name. Their organisation is advised and supported by 25 Rabbis from all across the UK, and she read statements from a few of them, receiving a standing ovation and deafening cheers and applause from everyone there - the absolute and total opposite of what you read in this weird article.

Mind telling us why you disagree with the premise of the article?

Just that they only seem to care when Jews are killing Muslims (with a policy of being as careful as possible not to harm those uninvolved in the attacks, which cannot be said for ANY other militant force over there).

Or why you're rather unconcerned with the evidence of outright anti-semitism in the Muslim community given therein?

That said, anecdotal accounts of NHS usage shouldn't enter the debate of whether or not a major reform is needed of the NHS. A major misunderstanding of certain parties' plans for a reform of the healthcare system by a large number of people is that they're planning to make the whole thing private and no longer a nationalised service. This isn't the case, no party has said this.

None of those links are in the UK. None of them are in ""local councils"" either. WTF?

First link: very one sided story, it's likely he said something beyond what he mentions and even if he didn't he was directly abusing a co-worker. He was there a month before he was let go. If you think he was actually fired for that single remark then you are a naive fool. No employer gets rid of a good employee.

Second link: employee was racist **to a customer**. What the hell is wrong with you?

Third link: blatant racism posted on social media

None of these links relate in any way to someone being afraid to report a legitimate problem due to racism. Not even in the slightest. All they prove is that blatant racism will get you in hot water. 

Do you believe that employees should have the right to display their racism to customers? Even if that harms the companies bottom line through bad PR? Anything that makes the company ""look bad"" will get you sacked. Are you a child? Have you never had a real job?

No, they aren't. You clearly know shit-all about local politics. 

&gt; I believe this tactic is called derailing and is traditional when one has lost the argument and so tries to create straw men and utilise ad hominem arguments to sway the topic to other areas.

No, get your ass back to wikipedia and re-read the page. This is directly relevant, these are the people that you claim are being overtly ""politically correct"". People who think 9-year rape victims are ""asking for it"". People who think it's OK to arrange trips for their Orange Order buddies to visit England in conjunction with Rangers UEFA football matches. Jesus fucking Christ, the Glasgow council is routinely accused of being sectarian and anti-catholic and you want me to believe that they are ""Muslim lovers""?

&gt; And indeed to stop and search non-BME groups so as to keep their statistics looking less racist than they actually are.

Wait, WTF? This makes no sense. Their stats show that they are MASSIVELY RACIST. A black person is 12 times more likely to harassed by them. Are you insane? 

&gt; You haven't addressed my argument which is that political correctness inhibits addressing problems that it makes it taboo to discuss.

We only have Sterling and Markovic as wingers, having Ibe if one of them gets injured would be acceptable. We were looking to sign winger in winter window, now we have more games and have only bought one. I fully expect Ibe to stay unless another winger comes.


Some people are underestimating him too much, he doesn't have to start but he has everything needed to make impact, I remember last season when he played 120m and ran until the last minute. He made his debut over a year ago, it's about time he gets minutes. If he doesn't establish himself this season he will still only be 19 and have had a year of first team involvement, move him on to loan in PL. 


Players don't develop with just games, I doubt if we loaned Sterling out last summer he would become the player he is, some players have to learn from better manager and players. Suarez before BR scored 11 and under him he scored 23 and 31. If Ibe can become twice the player he is under our system then we should keep him. Let him learn to make the runs and meet the balls from the players he will play with in the next couple of years.

The article makes a whole lot of accusations and tries to tar the crowd by comparing them to the actions of other people. Whilst showing no evidence and apparently despite seeing part of it the author had apparently not actually bothered talking to anyone to see what they said or thought.

Paragraph 1: Baseless accustation of all crowd members being anti-semites.

Paragraph 3: Because they didn't march before about other matters they are now just fakes who really don't care. Nevermind that the author didn't seem to ask anyone if they took action about this events (so how can he even accuse them of that in the first place?), or even considers that ISIS does not have a London embassy that people can walk up to and petition making such a comparsion really difficult to pull off fairly.

Then there is this paragraph which is so downright messed up I don't even know where to start

&gt; I suppose some of the people in London today might still try to pretend that they don’t hate Jews. Perhaps some of them would not even do what their co-religionists in France did last week when – intent on violence – they blockaded worshippers inside a Synagogue. But there is only one explanation for their horrible beliefs and actions.

That might be semantics, but I wonder that it might be important.

&gt; Oddly enough the ""We know what's best for you"" attitude often includes a peaceful death.

I think the important aspect that ties in with the bill, in that case, is that of autonomy.

You've reminded me of an issue with regard to doctors and mercy killing, actually. There was a series of articles in the press a few years back (I imagine you know about it?), mainly under the headline(s):

&gt; [Atheist doctors more likely to hasten death.](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/26/doctors-religious-beliefs-terminally-ill)

The annoyance inducing aspect of the headline, or the way the story was presented, was that it took a very skewed view of the data, or what doctors had answered. One way to look at it all was as the headline implied: that if a doctor had no belief in a deity, or a religion, that they were more likely to ""off their patients"".

9 is the traditional number for the main striker/centre forward, so if someone refers to a player as a ""traditional number 9"", they are actually referring to their play style as a pure striker. A false 9 is a term that has developed indicating a striker who plays in the same position as the traditional #9, but whose playstyle is much more about dropping deeper and getting involved in the build up play.

The #10 role is the player behind the striker(s) in a [4-2-3-1](http://footballspeak.com/PostImages/uploadedimage/2012_6_17_21_49.jpg) or [4-1-2-1-2 (sometimes called the 4-4-2 diamond)](http://www.soccer-universe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4-2-3-1_Formation1.png). A ""true #10"" is referring to a type of player who plays that position as the playmaker, someone who generally stays in that position and uses his passing ability to construct attacks. An example of someone playing that position and *not* being a pure #10 is a player who generally plays that position, but also drifts to either wing to create two on one situations with his winger teammate against the opposing full back. An attacking midfielder whose main job is to get forward and run beyond the striker would also not be considered a true #10.

Yes, they are. You clearly know shit-all about local politics.

/sigh

I'm pointing out that the police stop and search figures would be even more racist than they appear if such counter-racism measures were removed from them and you interpret this as me saying the complete opposite? One of us certainly appears to be insane...

&gt; I've shown you many examples of people who outright reject ""political correctness"" working in councils and getting away with far worse.

But this is a fallacy that it contradicts my argument. It doesn't. Just because bad things happen at the right-most end of the political spectrum on local councils doesn't mean that the left-most end functions perfectly.

true,uk_finance,null,null,"Depending on how long you stay with the employer, the pension scheme will have to offer you a transfer value. This is the value of your contributions and the employer's contributions and it can be moved to a new pension scheme. This new pension scheme could be a personal scheme or another employer scheme.
The downside of moving is:
  (a) the transfer value could be less than the ""true"" value of the benefits, as it is based on a lot of assumptions  
  (b) you might be an entry charge into the new scheme. This could be due to an adviser charge (if you need it) and/or a new provider charge.

In terms of looking for a personal scheme, the key things are:  
  (a) charges. Possibly entry/exit and ongoing. 
  (b) investment options. Two key types now are personal pensions and SIPPs (self invested personal personal pension). Key difference is SIPPs can invest in the same as personal pension but can also invest in company shares and commercial property. However charges are often higher than personal pensions.
  (c) other things such as administration, provider reviews, financial strength of provider. 

If you decide not to move there is no particular downside. For example if you have 5 separate pension schemes all earning 5% a year then you will still make 5% a year overall. The key downside in my opinion is if the old schemes are not managed properly because you start to forget about them a bit, eg if the investment choices are not reviewed and if they do not match the level of risk you are prepared to take. Many schemes are invested in ""default"" funds, but you may be willing to take more/less risk than this. This potential problem is compounded if you have a long time to go before you access your pension benefits.

true,RedUSA,lfc99,,"&gt; When they get tackled it isn't assault

As long as the tackler makes contact with the person they are trying to dispossess it is.  Same thing in American football, basketball, etc. with tackling, hacking and the other range of fouls and normal game occurrences that happen in those sports.  If you are in a contact sport, you know that you are going to undergo physical assault and it may not end well for you. This doesn't just apply to the flow of the game - it applies to fights that break out, head butting and yes, biting - however unusual it may be.  

Yes, Suarez assaulted 3 people, but they were people who stepped onto a field knowing that they were running the risk of injury or incident.  Its also worth pointing out that none of those 3 people he bit even had to leave the game, Chiellini and Branislav probably didn't even feel anything 2 hours after their 'assaults' - let alone had their life changed/ended by the incidents. 

And pardon me for letting my emotions seep into an argument where you are comparing something that needlessly takes far too many innocent lives too early and is a menace to society vs. what is essentially a playground temper tantrum that had no long term effects on the victims.  I'd be more than happy to have a civilized debate on economics or foreign policy, but I just don't understand how you could possibly equate and compare the things that you are.

Precisely. When LFC operates like a cohesive *team* that is when we will succeed not only in the short term but the long term as well. I believe this because Brendan Rodgers is the sort of manager who can really pull this together. He has the ability to get the most of his players and we need to believe in Rodgers and what *he* needs not what supporters *thinks* would be the 'perfect signing.'

Everyone expected us to struggle to grab a 4th place spot but we blew everyone out of the water and almost won a title.

WRT the article, nationalisation of rail would be a slam dunk for Labour. Treating it as infrastructure instead of a cash cow is pretty much beyond doubt as the correct thing to because the rail system as it currently is is pretty much a natural monopoly. The idea that competition in the marketplace breeds efficiency is only when that marketplace is dealing with goods or services of a similar character.

If the rail system hadn't been gutted by Beeching, who removed the plurality of lines going to cities, then the franchising system could have worked well with two companies competing for passengers from the same origin to different destinations. Instead these franchises were/are bidding on holding a monopoly for five years and fuck anybody who complains because they dont have a choice to go elsewhere - or at least, not by train.

You're also quite right that Labour are in dire need to do something - anything, in fact, to set them apart from the Conservatives in the run up to the election.

(2) What I don't agree with you on is the implication that us getting £14m from him should play any part in **his** decision making. What does he care how much we get? He wants what's best for him. I, like you, personally think what's best for him **is** to go to Sunderland. But fair play to him if he does want to stay and fight.

The short answer was that when he was in the show it was run poorly and the staff were treated badly. So at the end of the day he wasn't having fun playing the role so didn't do another series. Which is fair enough I suppose.


Although in all of his interview he does come across as having turned his back from being the doctor, I'm assuming because he had such a rubbish time playing him.


Most of this is conjecture but it does seem to explain how he feels about it.


Also, he's such a 'serious' actor. In front of the camera he does good work, can't fault him on that. But once the lights go out, he doesn't do any of the conventions or fan things that the other doctors do. And any time someone asks about Doctor Who he just seems so damned annoyed.

Well yeah Griezmann at £24m is a steal considering his record for club and country lately.. we need a left footed winger as we only have Lallana and he'll probably be playing in the middle. I really think Lallana will be amazing for us but I'm not sure if we can rely on him to score goals. 

Rodgers has said a few times in the past that 70 goals is the magic target for CL, I think we'd get that if Sturridge and Sterling both stay injury free for 90%+ of the season but it's risky.

a resident of the island of Ireland who is entitled to reside in either the Republic or in Northern Ireland without any time limit on that residence;[6] or
a legal resident of the island of Ireland for three out of the 4 years preceding the child's birth (although time spent as a student or as an asylum seeker does not count for this purpose).[7]

reland previously had a much less diluted application of jus soli (the right to citizenship of the country of birth) which still applies to anyone born on or before 31 December 2004. Although passed in 2001, the applicable law was deemed enacted on 2 December 1999[9] and provided that anyone born on the island of Ireland is:
entitled to be an Irish citizen and
automatically an Irish citizen if he or she was not entitled to the citizenship of any other country.

The previous legislation was largely replaced by the 1999 changes, which were retroactive in effect. Before 2 December 1999, the distinction between Irish citizenship and entitlement to Irish citizenship rested on the place of birth. Under this regime, any person born on the island of Ireland was:
automatically an Irish citizen if born:
on the island of Ireland before 6 December 1922,
in the territory which currently comprises the Republic of Ireland, or
in Northern Ireland on or after 6 December 1922 with a parent who was an Irish citizen at the time of birth;

They pretty much all say the same thing, if you're on or born on the island at or before these dates you're automatically a citizen.

&gt;The ""absurdities"" of politics are a recurrent theme of our conversation. As reshuffled ministers take up their new posts, he offers this warning. ""You arrive at a department you hadn't thought you were going to get sent to. You spend the first six months faffing about. After about six months, you've decided you know exactly what to do. After about two years, you realise you're screwing this up, you didn't get it right, but now you really understand it. And then the bloody phone rings and you're moved to another department and you go back to square one.""

2. Health

&gt;The best jobs he ever had, he says, were as health secretary and chancellor – ""both fascinating stuff"" where he had a long stint that gave him the chance to ""deliver my own agenda"". His first challenge at health was heading off Thatcher, who ""wanted to go to the American system"", he reveals. ""I had ferocious rows with her about it. She wanted compulsory insurance, with the state paying the premiums for the less well-off. I thought that was a disaster. The American system is hopeless … dreadful.""

The 'internal market' was his compromise.

3. Economy

&gt;The key terrain will be the economy. He is too large a character, and too candid a one, to talk about it in bullish soundbites. The recovery is ""a work in progress"" because ""it's not firmly enough rooted on a proper balance between manufacturing and a wide range of services and financial services"". The banking crisis ""isn't resolved""; the international outlook is ""fragile"". There is ""a long, long way to go"" in terms of skills and investment to create ""a modern, competitive economy capable of taking on the Chinese, Brazilians and everyone else.""

4. Modern politics

&gt;ainting Miliband as unfit to be prime minister is the plan among Tory strategists. ""I'm not squeamish about my trade,"" says Clarke, but he expresses distaste for ad hominem attacks. ""This is a generational thing. One of the ways in which politics has changed which I don't find very desirable is … the celebrity culture. The system gets more and more presidential."" A result is ""the personal attacks on individuals"". Mind you, the pugnacious Clarke has never pulled his own punches. ""That's right, but not by going out making offensive attacks on my opponents. I'm old-fashioned. I always got on with everybody who shadowed me. I even got on with Gordon Brown.""

5. Juncker

&gt;As for Cameron's attempt to block Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the commission: ""I think it was the British press that gave Jean-Claude the job. Suddenly, the rightwing press were attacking this Luxembourger who has never caused a moment's excitement to anybody for the past 30 years.

&gt;""The idea that they [European leaders] could go back to their own countries and media and say we have to get rid of Juncker because the British media were going bananas about him – how on earth could you get away with that? It looks so pathetic and wet.""

And my favourite:

&gt;He recalls one of his worst moments – when the Daily Mirror leaked his entire budget speech the day before he was due to deliver it. ""Whereupon flapdoodle broke out. People were saying: 'We've got to cancel the budget.' I was surrounded by people running around in ever-diminishing circles. So I said I was going for a curry and I hoped we'd have a lawyer when I got back to give advice on whether we could stop the leak. And we did. We got one of those midnight injunctions.""

Just around the corner from Redpoint, heading north towards Oppinan is the deepest part, there are a few sheltered beaches you can walk down to from the road (closer to redpoint the better) for kelp and deeper water.  

There is kelp on that whole coastline but it is deepest there and there are usually a group of guillemots on a huge house sized rock just off of a cliff. They are going after the smaller white bait type fish in the area which the pollock go for too.

I don't really spearfish, have a few friends that do but I use lobster/crab pots and gather seaweeds to eat. I have seen pollock though, plenty of plaice and few other silver scaled fishies in the water and would go for them if i did have a speargun. I'm more in to photography and freediving that specifically hunting.

Another beautiful place is the quay at Diabaig further south on that peninsula. Dove there from the quay and it is all seaweed and goes down to about 15m on the right hand side, if stood on the quay end and there should be some there too with the amount of kelp if that is the sort of area you are after.

I'm glad the NHS is here, and I'm glad that people who don't have insurance coverage or some other means don't have to worry about being bankrupted by disease or injury.

At the same time, I wish I could say that my experiences were as good as yours.  I've tried a couple of different surgeries and it's always a mess trying to get an appointment, nothing is ever on time, and I feel like I'm treated more like a problem they'd rather not deal with than like a customer.  And this one took the cake:  My most recent surgery (where I haven't visited in a couple of years) rang me up a couple of weeks ago, wanting to make an appointment to discuss some test results.  I said that I hadn't been in to visit them, but that I did go to a private clinic about some food poisoning a couple of months ago.  They said that it must be related to that and scheduled an appointment for me.  I went in at the appointed time, was finally seen (about an hour late), and was told that I had glandular fever based on the results of my blood test.  I had mono (glandular fever) about ten years ago, back in the US, and you generally don't get it again.  I also didn't have any symptoms of glandular fever.  And most importantly of all, I haven't had a blood test in years.  Some test results got inadvertently assigned to me, somehow, and some poor chap is at home with a fever and tired all the time and has no idea what's wrong.

I've used private care in this country too, and my wife uses it regularly to treat a chronic condition, and I have to say, it's excellent and it's what US healthcare should be.

The only major thing I noticed in the first half was how more inverted we were. Full backs turned into wing backs and our midfield duo dropped super deep. At times, the 3rd midfielder would occupy the center and the deep 2 would spread wide to create a sort of 5-man formation at the back.

I thought Capoue was brilliant in the handful of matches he played last season as that lone destroyer in a 1-2 midfield, but he looked erratic and unsure of his positioning with the Holtby pairing. I wonder what we'll do with the likes of Paulinho/Bentaleb/Holtby/Dembele/Carroll since they all play the same role very well, though Carroll would probably be more suitable farther up the pitch.

Part of me wants Spurs to play a 4-3-3 similar to Barcelona with a destroyer at DM, Lamela and Townsend bombing in with runs on the wings and two titanic midfielders that can do anything (like Holtby today), but I also think we need to build the team around Eriksen, who's much better as a #10...

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Defensively we were laughable in the first half, but we were also trying some uncomfortable things. 

I know it's very early and we were very sloppy, but I think it was rather easy to see that we were making more of an effort to move the ball quickly and more vertically. There were more cutting passes into feet and more risks taken with incisive passes. 

When we won the ball back we showed a lot of urgency to break and we attempted a lot of quick little combinations, some of which came off pretty nicely. 

Thought our worst players were Dawson and Capoue. Capoue was so languid it looked like he was playing in quick sand. So incredibly slow mentally and physically, but I'm not going to crucify people on the first friendly. Townsend and Lennon were also pretty poor but I think the first half sloppiness is almost entirely to blame on the central defenders and central midfielders. 

Thought Carroll started poorly but grew into the game and really started to look comfortable later when he had more movement and more people showing for the ball in front of him. Holtby gave the ball away a lot but he also won it back and ran around like it was the world cup final. 

Lamela Falque and Ceballos all being on at the same time created a lot more interesting spaces and movements from everyone. Erik was active and picked up very good positions even if he wasn't always found with the ball. The play was pretty raw in that half but there were a lot more interesting ideas on display IMO.

Soldado and Kane were both fine too IMO. Kane didn't get as much involvement because he was supported by Lennon and Townsend as opposed to the very active Ceballos and Lamela, but I think he's a really underrated player. 

Mason is another one I really like but he is pretty similar to Carroll when he's played in that role. He can play more advanced as well but I'm not sure where his position is going to finally be. It was nice that he replaced Capoue because the ball started moving quicker. 

Finally I really can't wait to see more of Milos Veljkovic. Really composed in the handful of moments he was called into action. ",0,1405808852,null,0,false,0,cj23jxg,t3_2b5wt5,t1_cj23jxg,t3_2b5wt5,null,1434798021,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16

They converse.
* I returned an hour later and now they had the cybermen out, walking down from St Pauls in the same direction the Doctor had previously ran, but during this all the extras were clapping. The cybermen come to a halt and everyone takes selfies and poses for photos with them. Michelle Gomez said something along the lines of ""well done boys"" and pulled something from her hat. I took it that she was controlling them.
* I returned 3 hours after that, around 6.30ish to see them on the steps of St Pauls. The doctor runs out of the main door looking worried, where Gomez calmly joins them. The doctor looks up into the sky looking worried/intense. Again Gomez is quite calm.

The security guys said it was for the finale. One guy also said that in other scenes London has been taken over by forestry, with trees everywhere. It sounds far-fetched, I'm just relaying it.

We need to give them time to translate to Poch's formation. I think several of the players are already adapting to it, but it will come with time. 

Holtby has so much heart but he still needs to fine tune his game. God bless him, he just needs some discipline. He was our only midfielder (imo) who knew how to operate in the first half. Carroll came around, but ultimately, Holtby was the leader of that offense in the 1st half.

Kane will challenge for 1st option ST this year. 

Youth looks good. I am especially excited to see more of Ceballos, Veljkovic, and Carroll. 

Also, Lamela just needs to work up some confidence and he is going to be dangerous. Plus I think I speak for all of us when I say that im excited to see him with Eriksen. He  needs to get some time with Eriksen before West Ham. 

I'll end on a negative. Dawson looked like he hasn't moved since the last game of last season. Townsend needs to work on his touch and passing still. And Lennon is just about irrelevant anymore.  While he might have operated out of position, he still had shit touches and did nothing but turn the ball over when he had possession. 
All in all, it was a good game, but we need to allow time to have the core team learn Poch's system. It'll come by Chicago,  I'm sure of it. ",0,1405812240,null,0,false,0,cj24vkp,t3_2b5wt5,t1_cj24vkp,t3_2b5wt5,null,1434798748,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

The most straightforward route to get to Stamford Bridge from King's Cross is to take the Piccadilly Line (blue) down to Earl's Court station. Then change to the District Line (green) - and take that to Fulham Broadway. 

From Earl's Court to Fulham Broadway, assuming its close to match time, you'll be swarmed with Chelsea fans - just follow the crowds. However, if you're there before anyone else, once you exit the Fulham Broadway station, just take a left and walk 100m. Voila, Stamford Bridge.

Ask the stewards which entrance is most convenient, but you can enter the stadium wherever you like. The Megastore is right at the front, so it might be worth a visit in there before you go through the gates. Soak in the atmosphere, then take your ticket and there will be a barcode scanner that lets you through the turnstiles. Scan your ticket, barcode opens the gates and you're in! From then on, just find your area and seat - there are plenty of stewards to help with that.

Note: Pints and food are expensive at the Bridge, and they only take cash. I waited in line 5 minutes past half-time on my first visit only to get turned away with my card.

Head south till you get to a stop called earls court, get off and head up towards the main platform. Now unless your incredibly early earls court will be packed full of Chelsea fans in blue and you can just follow them but if not you will want another tube train, earls court has a lot of lines that split off from it compared to other stations but each train approaching will have a sign with its terminal station on it (there are signs on the platform as well and loudpseaker) the one you want is a tube train that terminates at Wimbledon.

Take this tube train for the next two stops getting off at Fulham Broadway and then exit the station, when you get out onto the street take a left and Stamford bridge is about 200-300 meters away. 

Approaching stamford bridge the way you are the east stand is the furthest away on the other side. walk round to it and there will be a number of gates - each gate has a sign saying which block its best to use for, there will be helpful stewards in high vis jackets if you need to ask but all gates lead into the stand so it doesn't really matter which one you pick just as long as its lower not upper.

finally put your ticket in a scanner, wait for the beeb and enter the turnstile.

they do check bags but only for glass and offensive stuff.

food and drink is very expensive inside.

Stamford bridge is quite compact in its area and doesnt have that many gates, you want to be in the queue for the gate about 20-25 minutes before kick off so you can go to the toilet, find your seat and join in the liquidation (pre match clap). it will also take you about half an hour to get out and back onto the tube unless you wanna leave early.

It's not a parody account. I just find it interesting when people make these empty statements in the guise of masking their own biases.

I am part of [this organisation](http://www.urbansynergy.com/), and we have members from all walks of life, including the ones you mention above. Those ""uncomfortable truths"" are ones we all know all too well, and so we act on them, by *actually* trying to tackle the problem head on.

What we *don't* do, and this is where your problems start, is demonise young black males. We don't run around with ""Watch out for young black men!"" T-Shirts on, or print it in papers (we have newspaper journalists) or bring it up randomly on TV (we have TV presenters and newscasters too) because, and you may find this hard to comprehend, it doesn't help anything. This isn't an awareness issue, it's an education and opportunities issue. We try to get to these boys before they ever get into the gangs. And when they're in we try to show them a way out.

Once they commit a crime, well they're the trouble of the law (we have police, barristers and judges) but we don't abandon them after that. Organisations like [St Giles Trust](http://www.stgilestrust.org.uk/) and [SOS Project](http://www.sosproject.org.uk/) try to show them there's a life after the gangs.

Tackling the problem isn't shouting your favourite Stormfront copypasta in every forum going. In fact I've asked a few times and you'll never be able to articulate how that helps even a little bit.

Now sir, under what capacity do *you* work and how is it you've come by the knowledge that you claim to have? What information is it that's not being passed on...from who to whom?

I think the comparison to Sterling two years ago is quite apt, Sterling then and Ibe now are both very quick, direct players, who regularly take on opponents, and while that's exciting for the fans, they're also prone to making mistakes by taking on too many players. This is the main thing that Sterling has improved since then, he hasn't gotten (much) quicker, and while he's bulked up, he was always pretty hard to push off the ball.

Last season, we saw Sterling transition from a fast winger who would always just take on his man, into someone who could also look up and make a brilliant pass to a teammate. This is what Ibe needs to work on now.

However, if Milner is ""fed up"" - according to the Mirror - with being a bit-part player, I don't see how the situation would change drastically for him at Liverpool.

And as for the protestors - itdoes not mean someone is anti-Israeli or anti-jewish or pro-Hamas. The majority are protesting against a ground invasion that has already claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The loss of life is arguably disproportional to the motivations behind the operation, considering that only around 25 Israelis have been killed in 15,000 rocket and mortar attacks in the last thirteen years.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt; how do you think Milner would translate to the RB position?

Not as crazy as one may think.

Just as a bit of a refresher, I was taking a look through Milner's Wiki page and it states: *Milner played in a number of different positions for Aston Villa, including both wings, in central midfield and even as a right back.*

That line links to [an old Daily Mail article from back in March of 2010](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1254639/James-Milner-puts-forward-defence-England-boss-Fabio-Capello.html) where Milner states (in regards to his England duties):

&gt;To have Wayne Bridge available would be great but we'll move on. I've had 15 minutes experience at left-back but that was for England [...] If I'm asked to play there I'll do the best job I can - but my best position is further forward [...] When I've played at right-back for Villa, it's usually been when we are behind and chasing the game so it was more like a wing-back. My best position is definitely more attacking central midfield, which I am enjoying immensely at the moment, or right-wing and left-wing. That is more suited to my game but, if the manager asks me to play right-back, I'll do it to the best of my ability.

So, Milner's versatility and willingness to be versatile is certainly something.

However, is he willing to shift to RB semi-permanently? Likely not. I know Glen Johnson has been getting a lot of stick lately but would Milner be better than Johnson at the RB position? Likely not.

If Milner was willing to bounce around various positions in order to get more playing time? Hm. Then perhaps we'll have something there if Rodgers really is interested in pursuing Milner.",0,1405817938,null,0,false,0,cj2712c,t3_2b655x,t1_cj2712c,t1_cj25xbd,null,1434799685,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I think Raheem Sterling was a bit lucky in the sense that there was a window of opportunity for him to play, play regularly, and have the opportunity to shine in the 2013-14 season. (A season where many of us felt we'd be lucky to snag 4th place; The stakes are different this upcoming season).

Also, my impression is that Sterling was able to seize the opportunity and succeed because, in addition to his obvious skill, he also has a sort of natural footballing intelligence (i.e. in terms of vision, spacing, tactics, etc. etc.).

Whereas with Ibe, my impression is that he is still a bit more of a raw talent compared to Sterling.

true,ImperviousSeahorse,null,null,"Hamas’ impact on the Israel-Palestine conflict has been phenomenally destructive. The organization has made sure to undermine any positive dynamic that could have paved the way to a two-state solution. Its suicide bombings in 1996 made sure Benjamin Netanyahu won that year’s general election – and Netanyahu has previously taken pride in having destroyed the Oslo process during that 1996-1999 tenure.

Hamas’ shelling of the country’s south since Israel’s disengagement from Gaza in 2005 has become one of the main reasons Israelis are not willing to take the risk of the Israel Defense Forces’ withdrawal from the West Bank. Israelis rightly ask what would happen if Hamas took over the West Bank and could turn life in all of Israel’s population centers into a living hell.

These fears are only exacerbated by Hamas’ infuriating cynicism and its use of Palestinian civilians as human shields. Most rockets are launched from densely populated areas, and Hamas does everything to prevent the civilians the IDF has warned of imminent bombardment from leaving their buildings. Hamas has certainly earned being classified as a terror organization by the Free World: its disregard for human live – mostly Palestinian, but also Israeli – is appalling.

Israel’s extreme right-wingers bask in macho statements (some of them made by women) that Hamas must be destroyed, neutralized, disarmed, shattered or smashed. This makes for good rhetoric but is utterly useless. Naftali Bennett, Danny Danon (whom Netanyahu rightly fired from the government this week), Avigdor Lieberman &amp; Co can dispense such advice freely, since they know it will not be implemented. If they actually had to take responsibility for their inflammatory rhetoric, they would be in trouble, because then they would have to come up with a plan on how to do this – which, of course, they do not have.

Here is Israel’s conundrum: When we leave the realm of irresponsible rhetoric and enter the world of actual planning, there seems to be only one way out – and this way creates a problem for Netanyahu.

There is remarkable consensus, ranging from Haaretz commentator Zvi Bar’el to a recent Guardian editorial (a paper generally quite critical of Israel), that the unity government of Fatah and Hamas established in June is Israel’s only chance to stabilize the situation. It would allow Fatah gradually to regain control over the Gaza Strip, creating a situation in which Israel would have a partner for negotiations that has control not only in the West Bank but in Gaza as well.

Many a reader might now want to ask: “You just wrote that Hamas is a cynical organization that doesn’t shy away from horrendous acts – and now you’re telling us it needs to be involved in a future peace process, even if indirectly? Are you out of your mind?”

As much as I loath Hamas, its anti-Semitic charter and the brutality of its leadership, I have also studied the logic of peace processes around the globe, with the help of Lord John Alderdice. He is one of the world’s leading authorities on the topic, receiving his lordship for his contribution to the Northern Ireland peace agreement. One of the main lessons Alderdice has learned from his participation in that peace process, and his involvement in many other conflict areas, is that you can never reach durable calm if a major player of the conflict is excluded from the process.

The analogy with Northern Ireland is instructive. The Ulster conflict, generally known as The Troubles, lasted 30 years and cost about 3,500 people their lives – and the conflict had roots that went back to the 17th century. Britons viewed the Irish Republican Army with no less loathing than we currently view Hamas, and the IRA’s terror tactics were often horrifying. There are even more analogies to the Israel/Palestine conflict, including the hunger strikes of Republican prisoners that played a crucial role in the conflict. And yet the IRA’s political wing, Sinn Féin, became a central player in the peace process that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

Israel is currently not willing to recognize Hamas as a legitimate political party. Emotionally, I couldn’t agree more, and I have accused Hamas more than once for its destructive impact on the area and the terrible price it exacts from its own people. But if I look at Israel’s long-term interest, it is clear that without involving Hamas in some way, Israel will be under attack time and again in the coming years, and in the long run Hamas will undermine any attempt to achieve a durable agreement with Palestine if it does not get involved in the political process.

The Palestinian unity government would allow Israel to stabilize the situation in the short term, without directly talking to or recognizing Hamas for the time being. But this requires that Israel becomes serious about moving toward a durable agreement with the Palestinians, which places Netanyahu in an impossible situation. He is currently in open conflict with his own party and his “natural” allies from the right, including the settlers. His laudable restraint in the current round of conflict with Hamas has isolated him even further, and he does not have any political backing in his own camp for a constructive policy toward the Palestinians.

Danon, a powerful leading figure in Likud, has lately called him the “Labor Party’s subcontractor,” and it is unclear how much backing Netanyahu has in his own party – which has, for some time, ceased to be a mainstream right-wing party and moved toward the extreme right as represented by figures like Danon and Miri Regev.

In a sense, it is difficult to feel much sympathy for Netanyahu, because the extreme right-wing party he currently heads is largely of his own making. In the 1990s, he did much to create Likud’s culture of hatred for the peace camp, and he didn’t do much to moderate his second government from 2009-2013.

Unfortunately, the same cautiousness that has led Netanyahu to keep escalations with Hamas within limits is also likely to keep him from courageous moves and to engage with the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, reaffirmed lately by former Saudi Intelligence Chief Turki al-Faisal in the pages of Haaretz.

And if Netanyahu will not muster the courage for a creative long-term strategy, the next escalation with Hamas is only a matter of time.",0,1405819856,null,0,false,0,cj27qeb,t3_2b67vh,t1_cj27qeb,t1_cj27nlb,null,1434799979,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5

&gt;One final question, what do I do with my ticket?

Keep it safe and you just scan it in a barcode scanner, which lets you through a turnstile. From there you go through, get your pint of warm, flat Singha beer for a high price, and find your seat.

Online seasons.

Pick Chelsea.

Go 5-2-1-2.

Make sure the forward players are Oscar, Hazard and Schurrle (Defensive players are up to you).

D-Pad left to Ultra defensive at start of the game.

D-pad down and down again to choose ""counter attack"".

Frustrate the Madrid picking motherfuckers with your sexy bus.

Score on the break again and again.

Send your opponent a kinect video of you doing the duggy with celery taped to your balls after the match conclusion.
