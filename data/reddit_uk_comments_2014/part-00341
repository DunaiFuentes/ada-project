false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think Rafa got stuck having to sell to buy and a few strange things happened over the course of 2 seasons that led to Xabi's eventual departure:

1. Rafa went after Barry the summer before the 08-09 season, which really unsettled Xabi.  Xabi had a very average season in 07-08 so I don't know if Rafa wanted to off him or if he wanted to play him together with Barry, but it started the rift.  It made him feel insecure about his place at the club and feel like Rafa didn't want him.  He probably would've left that summer if he could have.  We ended up not getting Barry that summer for whatever reason.  

2. Liverpool went back in hard for Barry the summer after 08-09 season.  I'd imagine this was when Rafa wanted to really play them together (speculation: maybe a diamond of sorts with Mascherano anchoring it, Gerrard and Xabi to either side, and then Benayoun at the tip with Torres and Kuyt up top?)

3. Real came in big for Alonso.  The previous summer probably still left  him feeling a bit down about his place in the manager's plans in spite of his outrageously good campaign. Very few footballers turn down Real Madrid if they come for you no matter who they're already playing for.  The lure of Real plus the previous summer had him packing his bags.  Rafa needed to sell to buy remember, so with an offer like 30mil coming in, he must have felt he could use it to improve other areas of the squad enough to compensate (and that the Barry transfer would greatly minimize the damage... Barry was really playing great football at the time though obviously not quite at Alonso's level).  Obviously we then missed out on Barry again (IIRC there was a deal and it collapsed at some point?).  We did snag Aquilani, who was at the time very good attack minded midfielder, but he was constantly injured and never got off the ground for us.  He wouldn't have been a direct replacement for Alonso (no one would be) but had he stayed fit AND we got Barry, things wouldn't have looked so bad.  Neither of those happened and we proceeded to dive face first into a steaming pile of shit during the 09-10 season.

The summer after the 09-10 season Rafa got replaced by some owl faced prick to felt as though the likes of Konchesky and Paulsen were good enough for Liverpool.  They weren't.  Hodgson also wasn't.

Each new Doctor is so different from the Doctor you've spent the past few seasons (or season in Eccleston's case) getting to know, that's it's a bit stinging. That's why I loved Rose's initial reaction to Tennant and Clara's initial reaction to Capaldi. They both kind of say what the audience is thinking, ""You're not the Doctor I know...

That all said, don't worry. Matt Smith is a fantastic Doctor. His Doctor is much more whimsical than Tennant's, but you come to understand the reasons why his Doctor is like that as his seasons progress. Geronimo!

I think Sandro at his best would be better than Capoue, and I loved his heart, but he's lost his upside from his injury and he was simply a tough tie to cut. But, a good decision. And, by no means do I agree and think Livermore would have been as good as Capoue. 

I think Caulker could be as good or better than Chiriches, but I also don't think he wanted to play backup, which is why he went and also why Chiriches also seems on his way out. And Dawson didn't want to back anyone up either, and as much as I love him, we all should understand why his move was best for everyone involved. 

Really the only players from the list that you put up who I wish we'd have kept were Siggy an Dempsey, but on the counter argument that wish is very unrealistic. Those are both players who'd have wanted to start, which would have displaced Eriksen. I think our up and ups looked at and still look at Eriksen as a huge portion of our future given his skill, his age, and his open verbal commitments to playing for Spurs.

Basically what I'm saying is I'm not that worried, which I understand it uncommon around here. Poch's system needs time and patience, like any coach's system. We've continuously had coaches come in and get players who don't fit there system have to try and figure out how to fit a group of random players into some type of working system. When we get Walker back for a stretch of games I see us doing a bit better, and I see us hopefully looking to fix our striker position. We just have to be patient.

**Money and Banks C: Money Creation - Process**

•A wants to buy goods (or assets), B wants to sell goods (or assets).

•A goes to the bank to get financing, B stays at home.

•A gets a new loan of $1m, and a new deposit of $1m.

•The bank has created its own funds, deposits, in the act of lending.

•This is an extraordinary privilege that is not enjoyed by anyother 
type of business.

•A then uses the new deposit to pay B.

•This is not abstract, not impossible, and in fact it happens every single time banks make a loan.

**Bank Money Creation Exhibit A: Schumpeter (1954)**

But this ... makes it highly inadvisable to construe bank credit on the model of existing funds’ being withdrawn from previous uses by an entirely imaginary act of saving and then lent out by their owners. It is much more realistic to say that the banks ... create deposits in their act of lending , than to say that they lend the deposits that have been entrusted to them. ... The theory to which economists clung so tenaciously makes [depositors] out to be savers when they neither save nor intend to do so; it attributes to them an influence on the ‘supply of credit’ which they do not have. Nevertheless, it proved extraordinarily difficult for economists to recognize that bank loans and bank investments do create deposits. In fact, throughout the period under review they refused with practical unanimity to do so. And even in 1930, when a large majority had been converted and accepted that doctrine as a matter of course, Keynes rightly felt it to be necessary to re-expound and to defend the doctrine at length ...

**Bank Money Creation Exhibit B: Central Banks**

•Keister and McAndrews (2009), Federal Reserve Bank of New York: ""Suppose that Bank A gives a new loan of $20 to Firm X ... Bank A does this by crediting Firm X’s account by $20. The bank now has a new asset (the loantoFirm X) and an offsetting liability (...Firm X’s deposit at the bank).""

•Graham Towers (1939), former Governor of the central bank of Canada:""Each and every time a bank makes a loan, new bank credit is created - new deposits - brand new money.""

•Berry et al. (2007), Bank of England: ""When banks make loans,they create additional deposits for those that have borrowed the money.""

•Bundesbank (2009): ""In the Eurosystem, money is primarily created throughthe extension of bank credit ... The commercial banks can create money themselves ...""

Probably because a lot of people aren't expected to pay back the full amount of their loans, so that would just be £250 more that wouldn't get paid back. They're obligated to write off the loan, not the £250 - so of course they won't.

&gt; 2\. Why isn't the amount I'm paying back now taking into account that I can't afford to eat for 3 days a month because I'm paying back money that was given to me through someone elses mistake?

Sorry, but it sounds like the real mistake was in *spending* the £250. I don't get the problem - you were given £250... you don't know why you got it, but instead of questioning it, you spent it. Surprise! They want it back.

However, do they want it back because you ""cancelled your funding"" (not sure what that means), or because it was in error?

Look at Stewart Lee, you could quote some of the things he has literally said and they would sound abhorrent, wishing Richard Hammond had died horribly in his crash, or wishing Jeremy Clarkson's children were born blind, these statements are enshrined within a thoughtful and intelligent context, showing that shocking and offensive statements can be used skilfully for comedic effect. 

The problem I have with Dapper Laughs, and with crass humour in general, is that it often forgoes crafting that context, it throws the shock in your face, and expects you to laugh simply by virtue of it being shocking. This is the fundamental difference between what makes one piece of comedy satirical (even if it doesn't have animals in it), and another simply crude. 

Audiences exist as fluid subsets of people, constantly shifting and changing. They come and go all the time. I'm sure you can think of many examples yourself, but think about media characters like Katie Hopkins, despite her reputation and what I imagine most people think of her, huge audiences swell up to meet her through social media whenever she appears on This Morning, or releases a carefully crafted statement to the press with the sole intention of being controversial. Audiences are dynamic, yet incredible fallible when faced with the colossal might of public opinion.

1. He's a CB.  His mistakes cost goals which cost games.  One slight screw up from a CB leads to a goal a high % of the time, while a screw up from a ST results in a wasted opportunity, which happen relatively often.  There is also a lot of cover for CB's (right now we have 5-Jan, Kaboul, Fazio, Dier, Vlad).

2. Soldado was supposed to be our savior.  He was a big money signing at a position we've been lacking for ages.  Spurs have desperately wanted the team's next striker for what, the past 6 windows?  We want him to succeed because we need him to succeed.  Vlad on the other hand, is kind of replaceable (see previous point about cover).

3. Soldado seems to have more of a visible personality to the fans-twitter/IG postings, photos of him laughing with the lads, apparent leadership qualities, an apparent love of the club.  I'm not saying that Vlad doesn't have any of these, but Soldado's are much more visible.

false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt;Lukaku: I agree with you: feel like if Barkley's not going full speed Lukaku dooes nothing, he just can't be found by anybody else (except whoever it was for West Brom)

I think the issue I said in the last post is the problem/ solution. Whilst WBA had some decent direct playmakers (James Morrison for one), they broke very quickly and allowed Romo to make the most of his pace. Our problem is that we allow teams to set themselves up pretty deep and organise their lines before we get the ball anywhere near Lukaku. 

When Barkley plays he carries the ball 30 yards in the transition and puts us in a position where we can either make full use of the overlap, or catch the defence out of position with a direct ball to Lukaku. That being said we really should be looking at playing more killer balls from deep as Lukaku does make the runs all goddamn day, but nobody looks to find him because of the short pass mentality. 

If you watch Bayern, they will play a short game- but a fair % of their goals come from long balls. I think that both Barry and McCarthy have the range to play long balls either onto the flanks or through the middle, and would love to see them encouraged to take a few more risks, like final season Moysie had the deeper mids doing. 

&gt; But as far as improvement goes, I'll give Alcaraz a bit of a shout. Maybe not super solid, and when he was playing it was bad for Coleman cause he couldn't do Coleman things, but he's made fewer mistakes than, say, Howard. Not saying much I know, but seriously he's been a bit better, and as the 4th CB anyway he's not a horrible option.
 

I was never in the Alcaraz hate club really, he made mistakes- but was crucified for very minor errors that a rotation player is expected to to make. Yes, he had some howlers, but that comes with the pressure of having to come in a team like Everton without match practise.

Icardi from Inter is another possibility. He's young and mobile and pisses people off which is good, but I suppose there's a chance he could be another Borini. 

I personally think the best option might be just to recall Origi if possible. He's clearly very talented and it seems like pressure doesn't really bother him as he's performed really well for Belgium in big international games and for Lille in the Europa League.

He defended 'punitive devastation' against the Pashtuns. In South Africa he justified harsh measures against the Boers, including farm burnings and concentration camps. In Iraq he urged the use of mustard gas against 'uncivilised tribes'. In Ireland he favoured machine-gunning Sinn Fein meetings from the air. He hoped for 'bitter and bloody' communal violence in India to make the white Raj seem essential, and he reacted callously to the 1943 Bengal famine.](http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/about.htm)

No it's not. You can only send direct messages to people who follow you. How is that equivalent to a letter? That's the stupidest thing you've said so far.

&gt;Secondly, newspapers, radio, and televisions are platforms 'that people can choose to look at' (as if that were any excuse), and Twitter is different from these media in no relevant way.

It's different in that it could shut down it's UK operations and still be accessible to UK users and under no obligation to follow UK laws.

...That UK users can't be protected from seeing that material. Nor should they be, as they are actively choosing to either follow people who broadcast that material.

That was part of Mercia, which then became England when Mercia and Wessex combined under Æthelstan, who established the border of England at the Tamar and didn't bother much with it.

The claim that Cornwall somehow became part of England was down to various bishops claiming it was in their patch, and taking orders from Canterbury, and then William the Conqueror just assuming he'd conquered it without actually going there, and appointing someone who had a claim to be part of the old royal line of Cornwall as being in charge of it. Then, until a bit later things like royal attempts to impose taxes and prayer books were about the only practical way that England tried to actually rule in Cornwall until the Duchy of Cornwall was created, which was supposed to be self-governing, instead of part of England. 

The Act of Union of 1707 to create the UK was between England and Scotland, but because Cornwall wasn't governed by England, because of the Duchy thing, it shouldn't have been included in this.

Ask them if there's anything coming up. 

I did this when I was a student, walked from the end of south clerk street all the way to the west end of Princes St. must have gone into hundreds of places on the way. Was ready to give up but just kept on trying, by 4pm I had found a job (in Dixon's storeroom on Princes St) I also did it in first year in Glasgow and got a job with Olympus sport on Argyle street. That didnt take nearly as long IIRC. Both were good enough to pay the bills.. In fact I didnt mind either job although the pay was hardly amazing.

They'll probably be hiring Christmas folk this time of year, good way to get your foot in the door. Also you never know what you might find.

If you can get them talking then you're 100 times more likely than if you posted a CV to them. They'll pick the guy they've met, and who had the gumption to come in to speak to them over the faceless CVs they get in the post.

Take your time, you dont want to seem in too much of a hurry with them, plus if you can reassure them that you're normal and they like you then you might just save them from a round of interviews (that they no doubt hate doing)

false,fatalillusion,uk,Nottingham,"In general, I'm behind the wheelchair user all the way, there are very few cases where a baby cannot reasonably be removed from a pram and held in the mothers arms for a journey. There are,of course, a very few exceptions - such as a baby young that is too young to independently lift its head, or a child who has an oxygen tank stowed in the carry all under  the pushchair. In general though, I am of the opinion that a disabled person, who is paying for a ticket, has more right to that space than a pushchair, provided there is opportunity for the parent to safely hold the child, and to safely stow the pushchair.

I actually think, in most cases the problem is not so much the mother not wanting to move, as that a lack of helpfulness now generally means that the mother will be juggling a baby and a pushchair, while unfriendly passengers tut at her for holding up their journey - when I was a young un, in the days before lower-able floors, people would always get up to help a young mother or a wheelchair on board, and help them off again at the other end. That help seems rather absent nowadays.

There was the wheel/push chair bay, and then under the steps to the top level, a space with straps where you could secure a collapsed pushchair.

So it also depends if you are developing a theme, trying to persuade people to hate a particular group by continuously spouting hate. If your stream of tweets is actually likely to influence people, then you should definitely be held accountable for it.

I'll get hate and called a troll for this, but having clinical depression and saying you're feeling depressed are two different things. A diagnosis of depression takes time and observation. There are criteria to fulfil and each of them requires an observation time of months.

Unfortunately, I've seen and heard and read about GP's who actively and willingly call their profession lazy, and were you to go to your GP and tell them how you're feeling, they would more than likely prescribe anti-depressants, but they aren't going to solve your problems. They're like a sticking plaster, they hide the problems and make you not care about them. My SO has been on them for years and I can tell you for nothing that her problems have **not** gone away, they just bother her less. To my mind, that's not dealing with the problem so it goes away, that's tucking it under the carpet so the GP doesn't have to deal with it.

So I'd like to ask a little about your lifestyle. Feel free to tell me to fuck off.

Do you work? 

Where (generally) do you live - like, do you have the opportunity to mingle and get out, or are you in a rural area, miles from anywhere with no easy transportation available? 

What sort of things do you occupy yourself with on the computer? 

What *would* motivate you to get out of the house? Would, say, an online buddy help, with whom you share small challenges, like ""Take a picture of the view from the end of your road"", or ""visit a nearby park and take some pictures of the wildlife""?

I don't want to belittle how you're feeling, but how much of your demotivation would you put down to boredom? I've been unemployed for over five years now and on my bad days, you've described just how I feel...demotivated, lazy, uncaring, devoid of any kind of enjoyment, just wanting to be left alone with your computer and your fags...

But I'm not depressed, I'm bored and stuck in a rut. I wrote out a list of 50 things to do a couple of summers back. I've done about six. I'll get around to them, but it's really hard to find the motivation, especially when you're isolated by a lack of friends and funds and incentive.

It's a hard rut to be stuck in, and one I know well...but depressed? We couldn't possibly know. I know I'm not, but everyone's different.

the left lane is easy, thats almost always left, or maybe 2nd left.

one next to that is trickier, it really depends on the roundabout and how many exits it has. It could be straight on, a 2nd left lane, or the next few exits all the way around to the end.

right hand one is almost always for going to the *last* exit, but it can be for ones further round too, it depends on the size of the roundabout.

motorway exit roundabouts tend to be quite special, because people do whatever the hell they want on them. especially in heavy traffic they hate moving to let anyone in, you just have to be a bit forceful in getting to your lane.

All that has happened here is someone got sacked for being a supporter of a political party that at this point as gotten into the mainstream.

The political climate of having to prove you are not a racist is akin to being forced to say or do whatever the party line demands. Discussion is allowed but within clear lines set. British politics is in fact a great example of this occurring. Debate and discussion is ""civil"" and ""open"" but woe to anyone not left wing or someone who does not toe the line correctly.

Fact of the matter is that someone got sacked because he was a member of a mainstream political party and if you don't see that as wrong it's not UKIP you should be worried about.

You can talk of image and people's perceptions being the issue and not the policies themselves, this ignores the central point that so long as they are opposed to immigration and europe people's perceptions of them being racist will never ever change. There is no possible way in the political climate we have today that a party can be strongly against immigration without being called racist.

For a 3 lane roundabout, you could be in the left or middle lane just before your exit, but not the right hand lane.

&gt; I think the problem (aside form signage) is people using the middle lane for the third exit

Correct. Anyone entering in the middle lane knowing they're leaving at the third exit are fucking up the system. They should be on the right hand lane to start, moving to the left as traffic filters off the roundabout.

Last season we started the season 'poorly' because we played a more conservative style but we still managed to grind results because of Sturridge, and then Suarez scoring endless amount of goals(plus we actually kept clean sheets, remember those?). So by the time we reached peak fitness we were blitzing the likes of Spurs, United and Arsenal.

If we played at the high tempo game from the start it would have had a negative effect on the fitness levels of players later on in the season and we might not have done as well without our super quick tempo game.

I think Rodgers was trying to do something similar this season by hoping Sturridge scored goals, therefore winning matches for us while we were integrating the newer signings so when everybody is settled in we could have returned to peak form and fitness. 

That strategy started promisingly with the win against Southampton. We were poor but Sturridge bailed us out. However, Hodgson ruined that and it's ONE of the reasons why we've been poor this season. I guarantee had Sturridge been fit we'd have more points now.

That kind of freedom and space here is damned expensive. So you get people moving back out again to places where they can afford to actually live again.  

I also believe another - of the many -  reasons this happens ( I'm talking about central London living here ) is that the corporate bullshit people put up with in order to have this party lifestyle in their 20's ( which in London is pretty heavy and extremely competitive ) wears very thin once you get into your 30's and if you haven't established your career  i.e. moved up the ladder enough so it doesn't bother you so much, then you can burn out pretty quickly with the constant influx of younger people who'll basically do anything to take your job. And I mean anything. 

Also kids. I mean seriously, who'd want to bring up a kid in central London if you didn't have enough money? I know people who do and they struggle every day. Central London, unless you have shed loads of cash, isn't really a great place for families.

50% of board members will be fans, the other 50% including the head of the SFA will be an elected (by the fans and clubs) business person.

We have 42 teams in our 4 leagues.  A league of 12 teams and 3 leagues of 10 teams.
If you divide 42 by 3 you get 14.

If I had my way - we'd have:
3 leagues of 14 teams...
One team automatically relegated and the play off system would be the same for each league: second bottom versus second top. The split has become largely successful (mostly because of the playoffs) so there should be simple 7-7 splits towards the very end of each season. Or no splits in any of the 3 leagues. Uniformity and  consistency is what is needed.

Strict controls over spending and debt levels. All clubs must spend a proportion of their income on youth development. Deals will be hammered out to make ticket prices cheaper, with reciprocal agreements between teams.

The contracts with broadcasters would be renegotiated to ensure max revenues, sensible match times and the now more powerful and united SFA will not bend to Sky's every demand.

**Here's how it happened for me:**

Things took a downhill turn for me, and i had a lot of issues to contend with. i couldn't go outside, talk to people (even my relatives!) there was no motivation or enthusiasm for anything that i liked before such as reading, art, etc. i slept the days away for one week then would have insomnia the next. i was completely dependent on my parents to help me, but bless them, they just didn't help in the way i needed help.  

EVENTUALLY, after staying in the house 3 years straight (yes really, i didn't even go out into the garden) i decided to at least TRY. made an telephone appointment to talk to GP, on the phone cuz it felt easier. she was lovely and asked if i could see her in person so reluctantly i said yes. went down to the surgery and almost had a panic attack. When i saw the doc she asked how long i've been feeling this way? did i feel suicidal? i can't remember all to be honest. She suggested an SSRI (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) which is an anti-depressant (the first line choice for most doctors as they have the least side-effects and are safest) i didn't want to take tablets as i was worried i'd turn into some kind of walking zombie and the thought of messing with my brain was scary. i eventually decided to take them, but will get to that in a min. 

GP then talked about therapy, that is, talking therapy (counseling) and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) but i didn't feel up to seeing anyone like that just yet,but told her i would like to give it a try eventually. so i said i'd try the SSRI's, once they'd kick in i'd try therapy (cuz they take 2-4 weeks to kick in) as i was sure it would be easier then.  

Not so, disappointingly.  the tablets didn't make a difference, or rather they did but it wasn't working very well. so GP and i decided to try new tablets. again didn't work. FYI it does take a while to find a tablet that works for you as everybody is different, so don't give up.  

On the third type of tablets the GP said that sometimes tablets only work their best in conjunction WITH therapy so i said i'd try therapy (at last!). she made a referral for me to someplace i had no idea of, called KCA. had a telephone assessment with them that basically tried to see what my symptoms were, i scored really high on depression and really high on anxiety. should've expected it but still shocked me. they then gave me an appointment to see a therapist. i went to the first one but didn't feel comfortable talking to the guy i got, so didn't go back for the second. i got cancelled out of their system as result (standard policy).  

After more trial and error for tablets i asked to go back to therapy and my GP wrote down 2 numbers for me, asked if wanted to phone them or should she. i said i would. the 2nd number was for KCA and i thought to try them again. another telephone assessment and then another appointment with a therapist, this time a different one, female. she was amazing.  i chose to have CBT and had 12 sessions with her, it didn't work miracles but it helped to get me out the house just a tiny bit for a while. 

After the 12 sessions ended we agreed to have a break for 1 month, and start another block of therapy after.  during that break i got put onto new tablets that weren't SSRI's but were similar to them, called an SNRI (serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). there was trial and error working out the dosage but it started to actually help a bit, so kept taking them.  went to therapy again and things started looking up, very, VERY slowly.  

Currently my situation is that i'm still taking the SNRI and going to therapy, it's a long uphill struggle and i imagine it'll be a few years before i get back to how i used to be (or i hope so anyway).



**so that's how it all happened for me, not sure what your GP will offer you, it depends really. if you do go, and i really suggest you do,  just remember to tell them EVERYTHING. they can't help you if you keep stuff to yourself. be honest even if you're embarrassed - they've more than likely had patients just like you before**

**Eating well and exercise only help so much, it's about finding the source of the problem for you - why do you turn away from people? does going on the internet help the depression?**

**my therapist said to me this: depression causes us to feel down, not just down but flat, unfeeling, unmotivated, unenthusiastic about anything, and this is a way to stop us feeling all the other emotions; grief, happiness, stress etc,  It's basically your mind trying to help you by not causing so many ""waves"" in our emotions. being unmotivated means you won't do anything that's likely to cause you stress or emotions that you can't handle. being happy means that you're also going to feel sad - you will go up and down and that's difficult to handle, so your brain just makes everything 'flat' to avoid those 'down' dips, but this unfortunately means you don't get those 'up' dips as well.  If this is making ANY SENSE.**

**Jesus i've written a lot...**

false,potentialhijabi1,eng-yorkshire,God's own land,"&gt; 30 years from now, if the tumult in the Mideast settles, people will be less leery of Muslims.

  I doubt it. The history of the West's Islamophobia is centuries old, motivated at first by religious difference (the medieval Christian West was, right from its first dealings with Islam, unable to either treat Islam as a seperate religion, nor did anyone care to make a balanced study of Islam's beliefs) and then by the repetition of the centuries. Most of the usual myths about Islam (oppression of women, terrorism and jihad, the Qur'an being made up, the whole 'Muhammad (saw) was an epileptic' etc.) actually date back to the Crusades, at a time when basically the Christian world, in an attempt to justify much of its own distinctly contradictory actions, performed a sort of projection onto Islam of everything that they hoped they were not. 

 It surprised even me to learn that it wasn't until the Victorian period that even a single unbiased Qur'an translation was published (until that point there had been attempts to translate the Qur'an, but these were often completed for the purposes of anti-Islamic rhetoric and so were often massively skewed and the meanings of passages misunderstood), much less any actual factual information regarding the beliefs of Muslims. 

  Chances are that even if international events serve to become more peaceful, yes people will likely stop getting their jilbab in a knot about Muslims and Islam, but there will be little attempt by anyone to correct these ridiculous perceptions of Islam's beliefs. The same old rumours and misinformation will continue to persist.

false,bleepbloop12345,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;What we need is to get more working class people interested in politics, real politics, and teach people about the way the country works.

Sure, I agree. But while electoral politics alone can certainly *help* the working class it will never liberate them from Capitalism. ""The rich will not allow us to vote away their wealth.""

&gt;I don't believe that having businesses running the country would end well at all because everything would then be for profit

I don't think you really understand what Socialism is. Capitalism is a system built around the pursuit of profit - the market economy is driven by profit and actors act based on the pursuit of profit. Socialism is a radical alternative whereby the means of production are owned socially - i.e. by those of actually work them - for the good of the community as a whole. There would be no businesses, only worker co-operatives. When I say that the country would be run by confederations of workplaces, I'm advocating for direct democracy by the masses - not the bourgeoisie sham we have now. 

&gt;and we'd end up in the same hole as America

American is a capitalist country. I reject Capitalism.

&gt;Extremism on either side of the spectrum doesn't work.

Is it really extreme to believe that the people should be able to control their own destiny? There are valid critiques of what I believe but just because it is at the end of the right/left axiom it doesn't mean it's unworkable.

Physically human, Yana believed that he was found on the coast of the Silver Devastation with only an ""heirloom"" fob watch.

Don't forget that all of these lands were deeply Christian before this. The Islamic armies then advanced into France, until they were defeated by Charles the Hammer. 

Islam emerged on the world stage campaigning against Christendom. (And it didn't stop campaigning against Christendom until the Siege of Vienna in 1683, and even after this there were constant slaving raids on Mediterranean and Pontic Europe until European naval supremacy silenced this).

Now as for the Crusades; the Arab Muslims, due to prior arrangement, had been accommodating for Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land for centuries.

Go to your doctor. What other people have said in this thread is right; some doctors are assholes/don't like prescribing SSRIs. If the first person you see is an asshole, see someone else. It will do you no harm to try SSRIs for a bit. And try a couple different types if the first doesn't work.

Good luck dude/dudette

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What you describe *sounds* like depression.  You probably should go see your doctor.

If you go speak to your GP they will do two things...    
They'll throw prescriptions for anti-depressants at you like they negotiated a bulk discount.    
They'll suggest you start exercising.  *(This genuinely is helpful, but I appreciate that it's hard to get to it.)*

On anti-depressants...  Anti-depressants don't fix anything.  What they're good for is levelling you out so you don't think about laying your head on a trainline or disintegrate every time you have to speak to another person.  If you're just feeling hollowed out and unmotivated they may not be the best option.  Also...  Even when they are the right move, there's generally a bit of tinkering to find the right medication and dosage. *(This is something to discuss with your GP, rather than taking the advice of some dude on the internet.)*

If you push it a bit more they'll make you a referral for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.  CBT.    
Personally I have an extremely low opinion of CBT.  That said it **does** work for some people.    
In my opinion the reason the NHS relies on CBT is two-fold.  Firstly, it's cheap and it can be done by someone who doesn't need much training.  Secondly, for many people depression can be situational.  By the time you've waited a few months to be seen and had a session once a week for two or three months you may have levelled out.  So, it looks like it did something any it was just time.
Personally I found CBT entirely worthless.  **However** in addition to any help it *may* offer you it's a gatekeeper to further help.  You have to go through that and get referred back to your GP to get any more substantial support. 

This is where *(in my experience at least)* the NHS fails people who desperately need help.  You'll have to fight for it.  You'll have to chase your doctor and other parties involved.  Everything has to be nudged over and over.  At the point I went through this I was barely functional as a person and just couldn't do it.  Every time I called my doctor's surgery I felt like a nuisance and a fraud.

Ok, so that's the experience and I'm sorry it's not more encouraging.    
Onto something a bit more practical...

a.  OK, you know this bit and I know you know this bit...    

Get off your ass and exercise.  Try to quit smoking, if it's viable.  *(Have you considered vaping?))*  Eat better.    

Try to interact with people.  Combining this and exercise, consider something like **[Park Run](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/)**.  If you work, maybe arrange to go out to lunch with people.  I find going out with groups of people excruciating, but I go out about once a week with people I like one at a time.  Just invite them.  Set a time, it's as simple as, ""Wanna go out to lunch on Thursday?""  Absolute worst case is they say no.  Here's a secret for you:  Everyone in the world is waiting for someone else to ask them.  Be honest, you've thought, ""Well, if they wanted me along they'd invite me!"" haven't you?    

Have a look at the clubs you might be able to join, with moderate interaction that would interest you.  If you're doing something you can be around people without having to interact as much.  I took up scuba diving - The dude who talks too much at a scuba diving class drowns! - It might not be financially viable *(or even desirable)* for you, but it's exactly the right level of social interaction for me.    

If you're not working, consider looking for some sort of volunteer work.  Physically doing stuff and being around people can be surprisingly therapeutic.

b.  Yes, absolutely go see your GP.  If you're not comfortable with the GP you see, change surgery.  Finding a GP you can speak to and who doesn't make you feel utterly like shit will make all the difference in the world.    

Part of your GP's job is to not make you feel like a worthless, malingering piece of shit.  They're people and people fuck up and they're busy and like the rest of us they have off days.  But you need to be able to speak to your doctor honestly and if you have to change GP there's no harm in that.

c.  As I said above, their first step will likely be to throw anti-depressants at you.  Talk to them about side-effects and whether you really need them.  I hate them, they're like throwing a wet blanket over my thoughts.  It makes everything feel dull and distant and like I'm slow.    

*(I have a technically complicated job and I do it fine.  They won't necessarily make you slower, or dumber, but I HATE they way they make me feel inside my head far more than I can readily express.)*    

If you don't **need** them I'd strongly argue that you should avoid them.  For all that, discuss it with your GP, I'm just some dude on the internet.

d.  Speak to someone who cares about you.    

There are several parts to this.  Firstly, as I said you're probably going to have to keep poking your GP again and again to get any real support.  The cruel irony is that someone in a state of severe depression may not be able to scrape up the will to do it.  Having some support, someone who can phone the doctor's surgery even, just so you don't feel crushingly guilty about it might help.    

Secondly, while you may feel utterly alone and worthless, people tend to still care about you.  Human contact is helpful.  Thirdly, they might act as a form of monitor as to what state you're in.  If you're suffering from depression you're not a reliable observer of your own mental state.  Actually you're a miserably poor observer.  One of the things that scares me most is that I can't tell how broken I am at any given point.  

e.  Deal with it sooner, rather than later.    

You can go a long time, suffering from depression, just forcing yourself to go on.    

I managed nearly a decade from the point where I started considering walking into traffic on a daily basis, rather than go into work.  You **can** do it.  But if and when everything inside you finally snaps the fall will be a whole lot further.

Ok, so last thing:  I want to address something from your post:    
&gt; I kinda convince myself I'm just lazy, introverted ect but deep down have a feeling I'm destined for great things once I pull myself together.

Ok, I'll try to say this in a way that doesn't come off as obnoxious or soul crushing...  Nearly everyone gets told some variant of the American, *""You could be anything, son.  Even the President!""*  It's bollocks and it's the sort of thing that that can fuck up your head.  If you get your motivation sorted out you can sure as fuck be more than you are now.  You could learn to play the guitar, or work with old people, or learn to build houses, or repair bikes, or to program computers...  

You could become **great** at these things, but barring spectacular luck it doesn't lead to great things.  Nor does it need to!    

Your value...  Your self-worth, or your value to other people, or your value as a human being is not defined by your doing great things.  It's possible that you suffer from depression at least in part caused by the cognitive dissonance resulting from the fact that you think you're destined for greatness, when you're sitting on your ass smoking, unable to find the energy to take a cup through to the kitchen and drop it in the sink, rather than drop it on the floor beside you.  

It is far more important that you manage to be ok inside your self, to be a basically decent person, to be a good husband, or wife, or parent...  You don't **need** to be great.  You may be, if you get your act together, but it shouldn't be the thing you have to be.  Down that path lies the abyss of feeling like a worthless, pathetic failure even if you're objectively doing really well.

Best of luck.

No worries thanks for the reply and also for everyone else's. Ye I agree, to be honest I've never considered I could be depressed until recently when I did little reading on it and hearing from other experiences on it, I'm clearly not severely clinically depressed, I assume just mildly if anything. In regards to the computer, I generally read politics, economics, business, tech news, sometimes watch iplayer ect, anything that can distract me and hold my attention. 

I'm actually working in a job at the moment which involves being around people a lot and requires being happy, but I just put a brave face on and pretend and feel empty inside most days and struggle through. When I finish work I just want to be alone although I have lots of people I could hang out with. This job finishes soon and I'll be unemployed.

The thing that I almost find strange is that by all measures I should be happy, I have a great family, I'm fairly well educated, people often quite like me, have lived around the world in amazing places and experienced more things than most people would dream of, but I've never really been happy for a sustained period.

In fact the reason I've probably done so many interesting and unusual things is that when I'm feeling down, I think they will make it better, sometimes they did for a small amount of time, but it never really lasted long and I would looking for the next thing to finally make me happy.

The main concern I have at the moment is that I feel like its just getting worst and going to being unemployed is likely to have a further impact, I've tried applying for jobs and had an interview, but was rejected for lack of enthusiasm, which just made me feel even worst. 

I don't want sympathy or anything, just hopefully some sort of strategy to stop myself from spiraling downwards. Winter coming is also a worry as I think this affects me strongly, when I was student I would barley my bed, let alone the house for long stretches. I also loose my appetite and don't eat very well, usually just something small and quick here and there to keep me going. 

Either way I think I'll go to the doctor soon and see what they say.       ",0,1415929709,null,0,1415930621,0,cm1xyvi,t3_2m7rcv,t1_cm1xyvi,t1_cm1te2s,null,1426036083,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

My appointments took maybe 5 minutes with him just signing off another batch of drugs (even though I'd told him they weren't doing anything).

I did have doctor in another city who was much more helpful - she printed off self-help guides, referred me to counselling, signed me off work. She definitely seemed to try and do whatever she could to help, which is more than can be said for my other doctor. I definitely feel that younger doctors are more likely to take depression seriously.

So, go to the doctor. They can refer you on and provide help. But be aware that many doctors will not be helpful, and if they are not right for you then see a different doctor. Don't do the British thing and put up with it, you deserve to see someone who will listen and help.

I personally find counselling more helpful than antidepressants. It helps me open up about things that I would otherwise bottle up.

Right off the bat, I'd like to recommend this **[Rolling Stone article about alleged fraud at JPMorgan-Chase](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-9-billion-witness-20141106)**.  It relates to an American bank and regulatory capture in the US, but the same issues exist in the UK.

The first problem is that parliament is in the thrall of the banks.  Even without putting on a tinfoil hat and starting to mutter darkly about banking conspiracies, government *(of whichever flavour you look at)* is too dependent on the favours of the big banks.  

At the merest threat of the slightest bit of regulation or even at not being able to pay vast bonuses the banks threaten to leave the country.  Banks caused more harm both globally and within the UK than any terrorist could ever hope to and none of them have seen more than a polite telling off.

The second issue is that to regulate something as complex as a bank you need regulators who understand them.  You need people who are sufficiently capable and knowledgeable and adequately resourced to fight the banks.  *(Right here you run face first into the same issue HMRC has in regulating big business.)*  The people you want and need in those jobs can earn a lot more money in the private sector.  Crime **does** pay and it pays a whole lot better than fighting it.

Thirdly, the reason you haven't seen a single prosecution is that the criminal justice system as it exists is not capable of dealing with this sort issue.  The article I linked includes the following quote:
&gt;""Responsibility remains so diffuse, and top executives so insulated,"" Holder said, ""that any misconduct could again be considered more a symptom of the institution's culture than a result of the willful actions of any single individual.""

Essentially:  Everyone managed to have plausible deniability.

Being tried by a jury of your peers was an entirely adequate model when the issue was, ""Did you steal those sheep?""  The chances of rounding up a jury who can understand ForEx, or LIBOR and follow the way these things can be and are manipulated are so slender as to be negligible.  The CPS won't consider a case for prosecution unless it's considered more likely than not to succeed.

Muhammad (saw) actually spared many of the Quraysh upon capturing Makkah, and even when in Medinah happily lived in peace alongside those other religious groups who were not a direct threat. Often envoys from other tribes and religious communities even found themselves housed in the mosque itself, and often Muhammad (saw) found himself answering questions and solving issues from non-Muslims, as no-one was barred from seeing him or seeking his advice. 

Similarly the ghazu or caravan raids were a totally acceptable cultural feature of the time- whilst some actions of the early Muslims seem odd or even shocking to us now, it must be remembered that Islam did not have the benefit of having grown as Christianity did in an established framework of empire, with the accompanying securities it gave, but in what was essentially a wild west type land. It did not have the luxury as Christianity did of being able to passively sit back and gain its following, but rather had no option but to use some defensive action in order to ensure survival. 

Similarly there exists many a Muslim communty which was established without a single drop of blood being shed.

He's also very predictable in that he's constantly looking to force one-two's through tight spaces when it just isn't there at times. Same goes for Yaya in that regard.  And jovetic seems to play in a similar fashion as well, from what little I've been able to see of him.

But I see what you are saying, it isn't the fact we necessarily have slow players--more the fact that we are slow in possession when certain players get on the ball.

Our transfer window was not as successful as it was expensive. That is Ian Ayre's fault. He has no balls. He's entire nature seems cowardice to me, and not at all who you want to be leading negotiations for the club.

false,SylvieK,lfc99,,"Well I'd say I'm somewhat in between the two camps. 

I have a lot of faith in Brendan. People cite his transfer record, but it's not just who he's brought in. It's also how he's managed and got the best out of a lot of  players who were otherwise marginalized/had a foot out the door - Hendo &amp; Suarez come to mind. So in that sense, I think the players have a lot of faith in him. 

This is hugely key to me - it means fuck all what us fans think, it matters that he has the players' faith. Last season Man U devolved because Moyes had clearly lost the dressing room. Players quite clearly could not give a fuck. When that happens, management takes notice. Because  that is the point of no return. 

What can and will start hurting morale and faith, in addition to our losing streak - is the fact that Brendan starts/benches players against their run of form. So while Borini &amp; Toure have recently looked like they deserved to start, they do not. And Gerrard has looked more effective coming off the bench, but he starts consistently. 

Besides the unpredictability of who is started/benched, what is utterly predictable is our formation. It is one that is clearly not working for us, for a myriad of reasons, not least that Balotelli is infective as a lone striker. I think this is another area where players might start losing faith in the system, if they see that it is not adapting to results or they feel like they could be more effective in other positions but aren't given the opportunity to play There. 

You combine these factors, and my only source for pessimism is that I worry we will  lose the faith and spirit that many of these players had last season. I chiefly worry about Sterling because he is exactly at  the age where he could think - fuck it, I'm out of here. 

Last source of pessimism is our defense, though that has come off better in the last few games barring Chelsea. Lovren is a huge liability, and In general we have a lack of composure and communication that is worrying and comically sad. 

My general source of optimism comes from players like Moreno,Can and Markovic. And of course Sterling. If we can retain such young talent, with the likes of Rossiter, Ibe &amp; Origi still to join, the future is bright. This current season though, I think will be sub par, if by par we mean a 4th place finish.

5. Everything Missy ""planned"" with Clara leads up to absolutely nothing. Why. Why. Why.

In 2003, Abramovich bought the club for £140M ( paid £60M for club and bought of all the £80M debt ). By 2009, Abramovich funded the clubs with loans upto £709M through a company Fordstam Limited (owned by Abramovich). All the loan was converted to equity, making our club debt free. But since the company that provided the loans is owned by Abramovich, technically all the loan remains with Fordstam. 

And that is why in 2012 the club was able to announce the profit for the first time ever under his ownership. 

About why it is a good thing to have it. Well firstly he is a very passionate ( a bit eccentric ) billionaire. And his son too seems to be [similarly passionate](http://www.espnfc.com/blog/kicking-and-screaming/63/post/1843678/hirshey-watching-chelsea-with-the-future-of-romans-empire). This means the club could technically be debt free unlike other clubs whos owners take loan for the club to spend money on the club. 
Being a billionaire he can indulge himself in spending a few millions every year on the club for players or stadium or general club development in various ways.

Being a independent club restricts the club from doing so, and more so having a public IPO also keeps the club finances in a lot of pressure and scrutiny since any dip in form or players or slack means people lose trust and interest to realise the value lies for a long term unlike regular stock shares where business is everything for the company since its listed in stock market.",0,1415941781,null,0,false,0,cm23l8g,t3_2m70up,t1_cm23l8g,t1_cm1ibsy,null,1426033376,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

How is unknown, the why was to prevent the Doctor from reaching Trenzalore.

&gt;2. Shouldn't the cracks in the universe still be everywhere? They were all throughout time...

They began repairing themselves after the universe reboot, but some remain.

&gt;3. Why did the cracks only have certain effects depending on the story? Erasing people from existence in season 5 yet can be communicated through in season 7.

In season five the cracks were the points where universe was breaking down. Since the Doctor rebooted everything the universe isn't breaking down, but the remaining cracks represent weak spots between dimensions. The TARDIS actually fell through one in the first NuWho season... Torchwood experimented with that particular crack extensively.

&gt;4. A ""miracle"" is not a good enough reason for him to escape the pandorica...

This is not an unexplained plot point, just your opinion.  Also it wasn't a ""miracle"", it was a bootstrap paradox that allowed him to escape. 

&gt;5. Everything Missy ""planned"" with Clara leads up to absolutely nothing. Why. Why. Why. 

Missy obviously needed Clara to prevent the Doctor from dying on Trenzalore. 

&gt;6. Speaking of Clara, what the hell did that leaf have to do with anything? It's a leaf. A dead leaf.

It was a momento, a connection to a lost timeline. It dealt the deathblow to a god for crying out loud! What are you whining about?

&gt;7. Gallifrey is timelocked in a different dimension. We know this. Yet Clara could go there in Listen? ...no 

Apparently so. I agree this point is still open. I do expect this to explored further in the next season.

&gt;8. Clara and River Song are supposed to be connected somehow, and when asked how, River says, ""SPOILERS."" (barf) We still know nothing more. 

Fair.

&gt;9. So that bracelet that Danny used to come back from the afterlife (don't get me started) was supposed to be for controlling the cybermen. WHY COULD THAT BRING SOME KID BACK TO LIFE. No rhyme or reason. 

It was connected to the Nethersphere, which held the essence of those captive in it. Although no definitive explanation on how it works was given it is not an open thread. 

&gt;10. So this kid they brought back to life...is Clara just going to get a flight to his war torn country and use her GPS to go find and give him back to his parents?  Several years after he's been dead?  And has not aged?  

Fair. If we never hear from Clara or the kid again I am assuming she adopted him. Danny was obviously emotionally scared by the whole thing and wasn't thinking rationally when he asked Clara to find his parents. I will say however that Danny knew Clara had a friend that time means nothing too, maybe he was expecting the Doctor to help her.

&gt;11. How on earth did Missy get out of gallifrey? I thought her and that council from End of Time were in their own separate bubble? (I could be wrong) and how on earth did she get control of the cybermen? 

It's implied that the story with Missy isn't finished yet... And she made her own Cybermen.

&gt;I could go on for days. 

Okay.

Club does makes money from other merchandises sale but talking about jerseys not directly but yes. 

Since jerseys are sponsored by manufacturer and there is a jersey sponsor too. As of now Club gets $80M per year. (Adidas $50M + Samsung $30M ) So when it comes to jersey sales the club gets about 8-10% of actual shirt value. Depending upon the badges, player names, customisation etc.. But the more shirt sales happen the happier the sponsors and the club are. The shirt sales directly reflect to any future kit deals and makes it really good for the club to leverage upon and negotiate or re-negotiate kit deals every year if they can. 

Just like in 2013, adidas-chelsea deal was re-negotiated to about $500M ( £300M) for 10 years. Which gave us about £30M per year ( earlier was £18M per year ). 

Based on last year approximate of 900k shirt sale figure, the club probably made about 9M or so. Which is not phenomenal at the club operations but still huge.

Edit : I don't know how they manage the sale profit when it comes to selling it at stores offline and online retailers but I would assume better way would be to buy from megastore.

Why, to kill The Doctor. How? No clue

I assume the Time Lords figured out how to manipulate then to allow communication.

She must have figured Clara was someone who would be able to convince The Doctor to investigate the afterlife when she lost someone close. I think she probably killed Danny. ""You'd go to hell if she asked, and she would.""

&gt;6. Speaking of Clara, what the hell did that leaf have to do with anything? It's a leaf. A dead leaf.

In Rings of Akhaten, it represented the times that could have been, I wasn't crazy about that use. In Name it is used to remind Clara who she is while she's in The Doctor's timeline.

false,Happy_Bee,null,null,"That's the thing - not everybody knows what 'type' they are at 16. Lot's of students - including myself - excelled at a lot of subjects at that age, and forcing myself to choose a certain path so young was really difficult. I am incredibly jealous of people who knew what their calling was the moment they started the class, be it drama, chemistry, or business.

I appreciate that for the kids who know what they want to do from a young age then our education system is a godsend, but for slightly more unsure kids who seem to be a 'jack of all trades, master of none' then this system is pretty harsh.

Personal story time:

At 16 I took 11 GCSEs in a wide range of subjects (all 3 sciences, maths, english, history) and got 10 As and 1 B. I didn't have any subject where I was getting full marks and an A*, I just enjoyed all of them. Then suddenly I had to narrow this group down to 4 AS levels when I was 15, one of which I would eventually study at university.

At that time I enjoyed speaking my mind and having discussions, so I chose 3 humanities (history, politics, english) and maths. Eventually here I am studying politics at university in my second year, and I'm dropping out at Christmas. The reason for this is because I realised I made the wrong choice. I am a science girl at heart, and I deeply regret not taking physics because I didn't think I was good enough.

Now I'm stuck with debt for a degree I won't have, in a subject that isn't my passion, just because I was forced to choose too early what I wanted to do with my life. I have a lot of regrets, and I've gone from being an all A student to a university drop out, and I couldn't be more disappointed in myself for a mistake I made four years ago.

But I guess that's life.

Edit: Grammar.

Edit 2: Just to mention that I am not failing at university, I passed my first year with a high 2:1, and am doing well in my second year. I'm just not happy, and I know this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life.

If you are in crisis contact your local mental health team. They are equipped and resourced to help you. 

Its worth taking the time to address your mental health concerns. 

I hope it goes well.

false,mush01,eng-yorkshire,Northerner in London,"As much as the bank-loving economic-liberals of this world like to preach personal responsibility, there is none within these systems.  The bankers can sit there protected by limited liability and the aforementioned diffusion of responsibility to the extent that they are completely insulated not just from any sort of blame, but from any sort of consequences for their actions too.

They are perfectly content to take the gains for themselves and socialise the losses they inevitably incur when they fuck the whole thing up again.  And then start all over again because there has not been any incentive to learn **anything**.

I've been thinking, every time I've heard the news of ""the recession is over"" and ""wages rising again"" recently, seemingly accompanied by the singing of herald angels:  No, it's not over.  It's perhaps over *for now*, if you ignore the sectors of society who are still feeling the pain from last time.  It's over *this time*.  Until *next* time - which is quite clearly already well in the making, as banks are already lying to and cheating and swindling each other all over again.

And when it again gets to the point where none of them will trust each other enough to lend to each other and the entire global economy crashes again, you can be your bottom dollar it's not them who'll be paying for it.  No, we'll come leaping to their rescue again and throw whatever post-austerity crumbs are left onto the bonfire in order to do it, because we wouldn't want to piss the banks off would we?  No, then they might leave and *damage our economy*!

And it won't stop.  They will keep doing it again and again and again until the NHS is destroyed and there is no social security left to speak of and every aspect of your life is just another financial product they can trade and bet on and lie and cheat and swindle each other out of to get their grossly inflated bonuses, while everyone else lives on the fucking knife-edge that's left where society used to be, where one slip, one misfortune gets you hit with a good dose of the surplus personal responsibility left over from the people who put you there not taking any.

Only perhaps then it will stop, because eventually they'll take away so much of ordinary people's security, so many ordinary people's livelihoods that it won't be stood for any longer and they will bring about their own destruction.  But if that's the only point at which people will demand that the system changes, things will have to get a **lot** worse before they stand any chance of getting better.",0,1415947344,null,0,1415951004,0,cm25fpx,t3_2m800a,t1_cm25fpx,t1_cm1yqm5,null,1426032515,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Do it - what you spend on diesel over running a more economical car you will more than save in parts / servicing and insurance, and as your parents will probably agree - they last for years and you can drive through puddles up to the windscreen in them without worrying.

When I stopped doing the expeditions and sold them off - my ""Work horse"" was called Mavis and was a 21y old 110 300tdi with 175k on the clock.  God I loved that beast.  I sold Mavis to a couple who were driving from London to Cape town and I lost £200 on the sale after owning it for 5 years and sticking over 100k on the clock - they don't even depreciate much if you look after them.  

I used the money to buy a sensible family car - which costs about £600 a year in parts to keep running and is 30% more to insure.  EG break pads - £12 Land Rover / £38 Audi, Break disks - £74 Land Rover / £280 Audi. Also I can't fix the Audi myself as I don't have the specialist tools and they are very complex.

Second stop, look into free/volunteer run counseling sessions in your local area, there's lots of stuff going on but you have to look really hard for it sometimes. There are drop in sessions, befriending schemes, all sorts to tie you over until you get the NHS support.

People buy into a team (or teams), we open the boxes live (for full disclosure and for fun), and then the person gets every card (rare or not) gets those cards.

First off, I think we should assess what we really *want*.

* To pick up right where we left off? Silly to expect that considering the new players we've added, the new challenge of Champions League we've added, the loss of a player like Luis Suarez, the injuries to Daniel Sturridge, Flanagan, Sakho, etc.

I truly think the primary focus is to get at least a 4th place spot so we'll be in the Champions League again. And with the Champions League we will retain the clout and receive the money to continue adding to our team.

Otherwise, I feel as if this is a transitional season. It will take time to get all the players and coaches on the same page, to adjust to the new challenges (both for the players and the coaches).

From a *micro* perspective, I am *not* happy at all. We've played poorly. We have not made the proper adjustments.

From a *macro* perspective, we are the cusp of something *great*.

I believe in Brendan Rodgers. He is learning and growing as the boss of a big club in the same way, say, youngsters like Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson, etc. are learning and growing as well.

Point is that Rodgers - and our young players - clearly exhibit the *talent* and *potential* to grow together and succeed for long periods of time.

Do we abandon our youngsters and Rodgers now? For what? To create more instability? To make lateral movements with players and coaches at the cost of team-building and cohesion?

Fuck that.

We are only in mid-November. Eleven matches into the Premier League season. We're only 29% through the Premier League season for Christ's sake.

There is still *plenty* of time to grow, improve, succeed, win.

For some perspective, look the Premier League table.

Aside from Chelsea... do you really think Southampton, West Ham and Swansea has what it takes to finish in the top 4 or 5 when all is said and done?

West Ham are currently in 4th with 18 points but the difference between 4th and 14th is a mere 6 points. Do you really think that things won't change significantly 27 matches from now?

Should we have patience?

Absolutely.

Frankly, I intend to try my best not to panic until the end of February. By then, we'll see how we have grown, where we are in the table, what additions we've made in January, how they have helped (or not) through February.

That is when we can truly assess where we stand. And if we can panic then.

I'm not saying it would be simple to expand Luton, but I think it would be much easier and cheaper then trying to further expand Heathrow (which as others have pointed out, has been pushed for some decades now without much happening).

As to your points;

1) The re-build of the rounderbout near the M1 should be completed next year, and that will help access to the airport considerably. It's also not impossible to connect the airport through to the A1M; you could re-build the B653 and connect the airport to Hatfield.

2) There are wealthy people in London too, even in West London, and land is unlikely to be cheaper inside the M25.

3) There's been an approved plan for extending the runway for some time now.

4) Airlines will ultimately go where its cheaper to fly from.

5) We don't need multiple hubs, and what proportion of airtravel involves multiple flights? All we're trying to do is ease capacity on Heathrow (which even with a third runway, clearly can't keep expanding forever).&gt; Im from Luton and work more or less on the Airport site and the cost of doing what would need to be done to make Luton an acceptable airport to take (even a small number) passenger traffic from a place like Heathrow is prohibitive.

I have a wonderful girlfriend, we'd bought a house together a few years earlier and I was self-employed. I'd been made redundant from a job I really loved and decided to work self employed in the same industry as a sound and lighting tech. It worked for a time and I got some work but it slowly tailed off. I ended up taking a part time job that I became dependent on and this hampered my self employed work as I wasn't always available due to commitments at the part time job.

Anyway, a combination of other events left me feeling like you do now. The way I explain it to others is ""grey"". Like all of the colour had just been drained away and everything is just grey. If my life was a sound system it would be a Bose, no highs, no lows, that's Bose.

It took a long time to realise that I wasn't right. Strangely it was a reply to a twitter comment that I made that actually woke me up to the idea that I was suffering with depression.

My GF eventually convinced me to go to the doctors. I explained how I felt to my GP and he said it was depression and discussed the options, medication he felt was not his preferred option and I was not depressed enough to truly warrant it. I agreed and he referred me to a service that would contact me directly on the phone each week and would work through techniques to help. Their help was excellent, non-patronising and genuine.

I'm not going to lie to you and say that it was an instant turn around and even now 18 months later I still have moments but please go speak to your GP. I eventually found my way back into a job I love and I don't wake up each day feeling numb.

As a postgrad, I'll let you into a little secret. Most people see undergraduates as a bit of a nuisance. If you don't want to follow the path set out for you, you need to be very loud and pushy about it. Go and speak to physicists and see what they recommend. You may be able to sit in lectures and volunteer in physics labs in order to boost your credentials to switch to physics as a masters degree after your undergraduate.

If you don't actually *want* to be a scientist, don't do a postgrad at all. Finish up with politics and get a job (any job). From there, take open university classes or find relevant experience in the job you actually want (i.e., if I wanted to be a politician, I'd join a party, take an introductory course and then try and gain practical experience within the party or do a masters). Then you can side step.

The issue with Evens is he is a football player who is seen to be a role model for kids. I can understand the argument that he never asked to be a role model or shouldn't be regarded as one, but the fact is he is, and a large part of footballs popularity (that no doubt he has benefited from) is selling the game to kids, and being a role model to kids.

This depends on how you look at it - to my knowledge Evens has made very little effort to apologies for his behavior (correct me if I'm wrong) and as such there's little evidence he's a reformed character which if true you can hardly blame other people not wanting to be associated with him.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; The issue with Evens is he is a football player who is seen to be a role model for kids. I can understand the argument that he never asked to be a role model or shouldn't be regarded as one, but the fact is he is, and a large part of footballs popularity (that no doubt he has benefited from) is selling the game to kids, and being a role model to kids.

Fair enough, but having read other excerpts from the case it looks like there isn't even complete proof that he was guilty - let alone that after he has been punished by law, he should have vigilantes trying to keep him from working etc. 

&gt; This depends on how you look at it - to my knowledge Evens has made very little effort to apologies for his behavior (correct me if I'm wrong) and as such there's little evidence he's a reformed character which if true you can hardly blame other people not wanting to be associated with him.

I read that he still protests his innocence - it'd be odd to apologise for something you're convinced you've never done. 

I don't know whether he did what he's accused of - or did not. I *read* that he and his friend protested everything was consensual and the girl was intoxicated but agreed to what happened. *She* claims she was so drunk as to not remember - but filed a rape claim later having passed out there. 

Rape is a serious thing - but it's hard to know what really happened here. Either both men are lying or the girl is. I've not seen anything so far (and I'm sorry if I've simply missed something here) that implies without a shadow of doubt that the rape took place. 

If there was absolute proof I'd not feel as passionately about this, but the idea of wrongly accusing someone of a crime like this is (to me) as abhorrent as actually committing it. As we see here it has the potential to follow someone and destroy their lives whether they really did it or not (and now the law has done its bit - it's down to the public how long they feel like hounding this person).

All I can do with stories is read them. The report I linked, if you take the trouble to read it, says nothing about the couple being gay. They were yelled at repeatedly from a car, thought it was a joke at first, then the car physically blocked them and confronted them. Also, some drunk men were attacked physically and there was stuff about trying to force women to dress modestly near a mosque.

You have not called me racist yet, but feel free. I will decide. It's not racist to point out that the above is not the same, or similar to what is described in the linked article. 

Whatever else bf do is relevant to the wider issue, but not to your specific comparison one of whose parts was this particular article about the bf.

You know, you ought to have the decency to acknowledge that. And have some seriousness. What the Muslim patrol did was to try to impose its stupid, and they are stupid, really stupid, religious practices on others. We can't live together in peace like that. Muslims can hold their beliefs and worship their God as they please. They can also express their beliefs, in speech and writing, including handing out leaflets.  This fundamental freedom must be protected. But don't let your liberal ego get in the way of remembering the same applies to everybody else. 

Have the decency to discriminate between particular cases based on the details. 

If the report had said the bf went into mosques like you said, and I've no doubt they have done in the past, that would be another matter. If bf went around trying to coerce couples to hold hands and all the rest of it, ripping off women's hijabs etc., then you'd have your case and I'd be right behind you. And to the extent that they do use coercion and force, I am of course behind you, but that's not what this particular report alleges. You can't just change the subject like that.

false,gudgiecoff,scot-Highlands,novo-ross-shiya,"i agree about education, but i think there should be a lot more in school too, especially at secondary level, in home economics and social education classes, PE too.

when kids are in primary school or w/e you call that in england it's more the norm i think that the parents and school controls what they eat, typically you'd either get fed by the school canteen or a packed lunch your parents made you or atleast controlled the content of, so in that case it's probably more important to educate the parents (canteen staff i guess probably have a decent grasp already), as they are responsible for what the kid eats and therefore what kind of habits the kid forms in terms of eating. 

whereas in secondary or whatever, more typically there's some choice in the canteen, and a lot of kids might just get a couple of quid and ""go down the street"" as we used to call it, where they have all kinds of choice, bag of chips and a coke being not uncommon, a fair stack of calories.

anyway, i think home ec should try and teach kids to have a general idea of the amount of calories in different types of food, and really drum it in, not just a week long unit type thing. also more coverage of nutrition and food types (which i do remember getting a little of, but it was token content at best). they should aim to have every kid having atleast a decent idea of what's in food to the point that it's common knowledge, to the point that a kid can make educated guesses like ""oh yeah that burger's probably about 600-800 cals"" from a quick look.

soc ed should try to cover the health problems of obesity a bit more, maybe touch on a bit of the psychology of over eating and get some conversation going about the kind of lifestyle that often accompanies it, discuss the social issues around it, home life, body image and that sort of thing. not going to be comfy for a lot of people and should be approached carefully, but necessary i think.

PE should mirror home ec in a way, try to teach roughly how many calories are burnt while exercising, maybe have kids try to estimate their calories burnt at the end of the lesson for example. should try to teach the way nutrition, hydration etc. effects physical and mental performance and energy. a bit more emphasis on the exercise and physical improvement aspect of it in general, rather than ayy lmao lets have a kickabout for an hour, though that teaches teamwork, cameraderie, physical coordination, is often good excersise and fun too, so should by no means be neglected.

I have a job I hate right now. When I come in at night, I feel like shit. All I want to do is lose myself somehow. Some people just stare at the TV, others play games, others read, others just crawl into bed and sleep. Some people sleep poorly when they're stressed and spend their entire lives feeling drained and tired. I can't imagine what it would be like if I also had children to worry about and care for. Yes, children can inspire people to make changes and do good by them, but there's no denying that having them can also be tiring and stressful as hell. It can also be hard to fight with your kids every single day when they want chicken nuggets and you put veggie pasta down in front of them. So they don't eat it, then they pester you for crisps all night. It can all be hugely tiring and exhausting.

All I'm trying to say is that I believe this kind of thing to be massively over-simplified.

false,naryn,eng-kent,Canterbury - Kent,"&gt;To generalise away from journalism, these technical subjects need to be understood by joe plumber or he'll be misled by vested interests the next time he goes to the polling booth, or signs an online petition against a nuclear power station. 

In this case, the internet is a wonderful tool. It allows you to generalise your education on your own terms and is what we should encourage people to do. You say these technical subjects need to be understood by joe plumber, well I say that things like economics need to be understood on at least a minor level by people who want their opinion heard on the matter.

However, school is *not* the correct area for this. I might vote for a candidate or party based on his / their opinions on nuclear plants but I might also do it on many other basis' such as their social views, their economic views, their foreign policy beliefs etc. But you should be informed about these through your own research ideally, and not through school.

&gt;I think journalism is a really important example because they define the flow of information to laypeople. 

Journalism here is a good example, and is why I used it. But as I mentioned before, ideally journalists would use their own research, or at least find experts in the field to backup their claims. Journalism, especially in tabloid journalism (or their tv equivalents) often seem to cater to the lowest common denominator, for instance The Sun (Largest British newspaper) ran with the story about Kim Kardashian rather than the Rosetta probe story. The reality is newspapers are a business, if the story doesn't sell then it won't be printed.

People need to realise that the underlying problem isn't going to be solved by quick fixes of TV, games, reading. Want to relieve some stress and sleep better? Exercise. It is the best way to lose yourself and gain a clear head on things. Eating a well balanced diet contributes probably more than you think.

false,Kesuke,null,null,"I don't think it's that debatable to be honest. As I mentioned above, Sikhs and other ethnic groups like Ghurkas were deliberately targeted for recruitment into the British Indian Army following the failed Indian Mutiny of 1857 which began in the 19th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry of the Bengal Army. The Bengal Army was one of three armies (the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Bengal Army) that made up the East India Companies forces which would become consolidated under crown control. 

Ideas about racial ideology would come along much later, not just in the British empire but across Europe. You've got to bear all this in the context of the time... for example it wasn't until 1859 that Charles Darwin would publish his seminal *""On the Original of the Species""* that set the framework for that sort of thinking. Indeed it wouldn't be for another 20 years that the concept got widespread traction at the level where it might have filtered through to military planners. In reality, the ""zenith"" of that sort of racial-thinking was actually in the 1920s. 

I think the over simplistic (and racist) concept that the British preferred lighter skinned northerners is demonstrably false. Infact as I pointed out elsewhere, this strategy (of recruiting government and military roles) from minority groups would become a widely replicated tenant of the Empire elsewhere. For example, in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the generally darker skinned minority Tamil group made up the bulk of the colonial forces and administrative body - over the lighter skinned Sinhalese ethnic group that made up the majority of the islands population. It was, at its core, part of the concept of *""Divide and Conquer""*. Why did the British do that? - Well, they already understood the Tamil culture and language from their time in Southern India and when the empire Encompassed Ceylon they simply settled on the people they understood and could work with most effectively.

In reality, this recruitment strategy had little if anything to do with racial profiling and was more about loyalty and dependability. The British were shocked (in India and at home) by the mutiny. In the aftermath of the failed rebellion the British were keen to avoid a repeat and the remnants of the Bengal army were all by disbanded... even units that had largely remained loyal to the Crown.

To give you a modern analogy.. it's rather like the situation in Iraq/Syria against ISIS. The Iraqi army has turned out to be an ineffective force that doesn't have the mettle to stand and fight in the field. **However**, the more contiguous Kurdish army (the Peshmerga) has proved fairly effective. They share a more unified culture which has made them easier to train into a western style army (i.e. they naturally act more like a disciplined force). I imagine the situation in India in 1857 was perhaps similar... the British ultimately wanted to recruit the soldiers that would best serve their interests. I doubt many British officers cared what colour their skin was, and infact the thinking at the time would have followed that any non-Christian was a sinful heathen (and indeed literature of the time is littered with epithets like that) for which they would have had equal disdain. Ultimately they settled on minority groups that were easier to train into a disciplined force that could be depended upon.",0,1415965490,null,0,1415965704,0,cm29449,t3_2m5tyi,t1_cm29449,t1_cm1bshm,null,1426030742,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Side roads are also a pain with those paths - you're crossing right next to the junction with no priority, so have to look in three directions including directly to the rear. I find cycling on the road, with priority over turning drivers at junctions, to be a lot easier and quite possibly safer.

It's not only about the on-field mentality of the players they will work on, so seeing drastic changes in the second half after going down late in the first won't be visible to the naked eye. In cases like the former it's just as much about the opposition and their boost in confidence.

What I believe the psychologists will help with is anything anyone in the Swansea team, including coaches and others, need in terms of mental health. Lack of motivation, lack of confidence, depressive symptoms, etc. I believe having something like this easily available will be helpful in regards to prevention of factors which might affect the team (e.g. lots of mental issues, lack of motivation on the training field), and they will be there to support their on field mentality as well.

tl;dr.. 
While on field mentality is important, the things going on off field is where most of the work will be done and that's where psychologists come in handy.

After all, if we're deeming managers unsuitable for the job because they have a slightly dodgy season after coming 2nd, then really Rafa has already had his chance and proved in 2010 he wasn't up to scratch. Rodgers should get more time in the role before we line up someone else.

&gt;I always find it funny how the exact same people who want a soft approach to alcoholism, smoking or drug abuse on the basis of addiction or wanting to reclassify them as a health issue, are always front of the line to say that fat people are just lazy gluttonous bastards who should eat less and exercise more.


Well said. I actually had written a few paragraphs to go along with what you wrote,  but you hit the nail on the head. 

I used to be obese, gained weight because I got depressed, stressed, and got in denial. It took a lot of dedication for me to get back down to normal BMI. I will never shame people for being fat because I know not everyone that is obese/overweight is that way on purpose or simply because they were lazy. It can be due to a million other reasons. But most of Reddit, just like how they think feminism = crazy bitches, they think fat people = lazy.

&gt;They would only be allowed to return if they agreed to be escorted by the police before facing either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers. 

I don't understand. What is the point of these new powers? If it could be shown that they did something illegal or fought with ISIS, then surely the police would be right there waiting to arrest them anyway. Their name is on the flight manifest and on the passport, both easily accessible by police on the way in.

Why do we need their agreement to do this? Why do we need them to give themselves up when we know exactly when and where they will arrive into the country?

It sounds to me like DC is setting this new law up to be ambiguous enough such that pretty much anyone who travelled to a country with an ISIS presence could be classified as a possible ""suspect"" fighting with ISIS and would be forced to give themselves up ""voluntarily"" to police questioning even if the police have no proof that they ever fought for ISIS at all.",0,1415966385,null,0,false,0,cm29aif,t3_2m81v7,t1_cm29aif,t3_2m81v7,null,1426030659,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Im largely looking at it from an airline perspective as thats my main background and im not sure about this. As of right now its cheaper to fly from Luton and any number of other airports and major scheduled airlines arent doing it. Why would this change with all of this development that if anything would probably increase prices of landing slots at LTN to help pay for the development? 

The fact of the matter is, that for scheduled airlines like those that largely make up the traffic at LHR, it is simply not their business model to operate to an airport like Luton, they want to be at a hub. 

Other counter points, fair comment but im still not entirely sure of the access road issue and you would probably need another terminal built too.

I don't realise how people can be so oblivious to the concept when it is so widely known. People eating a McDonalds know perfectly well that it isn't healthy, that fizzy drinks are full of sugar. Most people have access to the internet these days, a simple Google can bring up all the information you need to change your life.






You don't have to do it every day though. Exercising for 30 minutes for 3/5 times a week can help turn things around. You can game after, you can watch TV on your rest days. It's about balance but people want to indulge in the things that make them feel good in the fastest ways possible.







I agree that being nasty and rude isn't productive but again, your issue with poorer people, it's not all about diet.

Bigots often have a victim complex. They think they're being persecuted for not conforming to beliefs of the politically-correct masses.

&gt;Racism tends to attract attention when it's flagrant and filled with invective. But like all bigotry, the most potent component of racism is frame-flipping—positioning the bigot as the actual victim. So the gay do not simply want to marry, they want to convert our children into sin. The Jews do not merely want to be left in peace, they actually are plotting world take-over. And the blacks are not actually victims of American power, but beneficiaries of the war against hard-working whites. This is a respectable, more sensible, bigotry, one that does not seek to name-call, preferring instead change the subject and strawman. Thus segregation wasn't necessary to keep the niggers in line, it was necessary to protect the honor of white women.

false,thatcambridgebird,null,null,"&gt; But your original comment was a sweeping one about cyclists in general not using cycle paths. For which there are a multitude of possible reasons. 

Where? The majority - the *vast* majority in fact - of cyclists *use* the designated paths. I'm not aware that I said they didn't. I was talking about the possibility that the linked vid showed a path to the left which that particular cyclist wasn't using. That's what my original comment said. 

Trumpington Road's path has been designed with a split cyclist and pedestrian area. If anyone's blasting along at &gt;20mph then it's great that they're so fit, but they also should still show consideration for other path users by slight slowing to overtake, not weaving into the pedestrian area etc and consideration for car users by not using the road and slowing traffic down when drivers can't get past them in busy periods. Even &gt;20mph isn't car speed, so an extremely quick cyclist is still getting in the way and not using an area designated for them. Likewise, I know many fast riders get pissed off with herds of students riding along at 20-abreast and showing absolutely no consideration on that part. It's swings and roundabouts on all sides. 


However, many many paths are, frankly, shit, as /u/FLHerne says below, which is a shame for an alleged cycle-friendly city. I completely understand the point about them intersecting with junctions and therefore having to look all ways, but it's not that much of a hardship to look in a couple of directions before crossing.

Another easy win is home made Egg Fried Rice or other dishes like that, I have a roast on a Sunday, Monday will be left over meat and homemade chips (cut up, boil for 15 mins, drains and place into hot tray coat with frylight and bake in over for 30 mins) then Tuesday will be Stirfry with whatever meat is left.

What decisions: to employ him? If that's the case then what do we do with any convicted criminal? Should they never be employed again? 

If they've been through the justice service and done their time (or not) as appropriate then there shouldn't be a further witch hunt afterwards. Either people are satisfied or we look at the idea that the justice system is wrong / too soft etc. 

Mob justice isn't good. 

&gt; I think this whole argument should wait until the outcome of his appeal, at the moment it's all conjecture that his conviction for rape will be overturned, once any appeals are exhausted, or he is found innocent then his actions can be viewed clearly. 

It can't wait though, we already have Ennis-Hill threatening to pull her endorsement if the club doesn't act as she desires. *She* should wait. 

&gt; Is he a rich rapist using a media machine against a vulnerable victim, or is he an innocent man unfairly accused.

Everything I've seen about him has been negative of him and neutral and/or positive of the alleged victim. From what I can judge, he's not using money or wealth or power here? 

I do agree (everyone) should wait and see what the outcome of his appeal is but even then I haven't seen conclusive evidence of a rape. If that's the case then the weight of public attention on a potentially innocent man is awful and yet more proof that mob justice is a bad idea.

2. No. They were patched up.

3. The first ones were caused by an exploding TARDIS, the second one was the Timelords using the weakness in the universe (scar tissue of where there used to be a crack) to open it. Besides, you could communicate through it before anyway, if there was someone on the other side that is. Some cracks went to different places, simply put. Some went to nothingness, this is explicitly stated in Vampires of Venice.

4. It's not really a miracle to begin with, so that's fine. 

5. Huh? The plan was simply to keep her and the Doctor together. She wanted to witness the tug of war and needed the Doctor safe. 

6. The leaf caused her parents to meet which caused her to be born, so pretty significant. It's what it represents that's important.

7. No. Why do people misunderstand timelocks??? It clearly says in the name that it locks time. Gallifrey is NOT timelocked in another dimension, the Time War is timelocked in our universe. Clara went to moments before the Time War. The TARDIS is supposed to prevent going there as well, but with the safeguards disabled, the Doctor unconscious and at the end of the universe...

8. What? Did you pay no attention at all when you watch Doctor Who?  They were linked because of the conference call and the reason River was still there was because Clara was still alive. That was the whole point. She was inferring Clara would survive and that he'd be fine. 

9. The bracelet had many functions, it could disintegrate, teleport and had a whole host of other functions we didn't witness. It was basically how Missy controlled her little created world. Hell, she could even disintegrate an AI with it. Not sure about the logistics of having that body be de-cybermanized and all that, but it's not the most farfetched thing we've seen.

10. Maybe wait and see? Or maybe that's simply not the point. This is like asking what happens after the Doctor leaves and a host of buildings are destroyed. It's kind of irrelevant to the point and to the story. 

11. Good question and one I wish the Doctor asked. It might come up in series 9, though, so there's no reason to really pose this right now just yet. It will probably tie in closely with WHERE Gallifrey is, and as such obviously they are placing that further down the pipeline.

Fair enough if she's apologised about it feels like she's only getting involved in the Ched Evans stuff because it will raise her profile.

She should remove herself from being involved with anyone in any sport with a criminal history if this is her actual view. Surely at sky sports she's worked/interviewed people who have a criminal background and have served time.

I have read her article and it points out primarily the victim's pain (which is very valid) but what does she want a witch-hunt ?

The problem is basically that RE is in a middle ground right now - you have to do something, but there's no political will to say ""and you have to teach proper, comparative religion without bias"" and simultaneously piss off Middle England, all the conservative faith groups, *and* the NSS/BHA all at once. Plus, to anyone from a liberal political tradition, doing so *feels* a bit icky - regardless of the underlying motive it's got a whiff of the ""telling people how to practice their faith"" to it, and that's a strange position for a secular liberal to be holding.

[1] Handily this gets around bans on teachers explicitly saying ""homosexuality is wrong!"" by framing it in an appeal to divine authority.

Don't worry about what others will perceive because all that's going to matter is that you two have a blast. One thing I do recommend is using an e-wedding site like weddingwire.com for rsvps. It doesn't guarantee you'll get everyone to send one back but it does cut down on mail and waste.

We did a lot of things to cut costs and cut corners for this. Here's what we did so maybe that will help.

* Made 90% of the decorations ourselves. (Paper lanterns and hearts on strings)
* Pot luck weddings are so handy. It makes it easier since people are sometimes bad at RSVPing. We told everyone they didn't have to worry about a wedding present, just bring a dish and gift us the recipe instead.
* We brewed 10 gallons of beer and supplied some well liquor and wine for guests. Brewing didn't save us a tremendous amount but I already had kegging equipment and it let me buy a tap setup so we turned an old kitchen cabinet into a very nice butcher block bar.
* We had our event outdoors so talk with some companies local that can supply tents/tables/chairs if you go that route. This made it easier since we had a greater say in what went on.
* Talk talk talk to each other. You'll both have different ideas about how you'd like things to go. Maybe you can't have a full blown warhammer theme, but maybe you can throw some subtle nods to it around such as some minis strategically placed around.
* If you feel things are getting a little heated with a portion of the decision making. Both of you feel free to call a timeout on that portion and maybe focus on another area for a little bit. Calm down and then discuss what you'd like to see and what you are envisioning. See if you can find a way to integrate both ideas but don't get sold that either will get their way every time.

Those are really what I can offer but feel free to shoot me a message and we can talk more about it. The big key is communication. Since we spent quite a while in a long distance relationship (8 hours apart/5 hour time difference/an ocean in between) we had a lot of practice in open and honest communication and it helps when you and your partner can express what you are looking for.

The differences in old doctors from one to the next has OFTEN been FAR more startling than any of the newer doctor transitions have been. 3-4 and 4-5, and ESPECIALLY 5-6 (as far as I have gotten) are vast differences in attitude, and often times age as well. 

10-11 change is different though, in the fact it's one of the more slight changes I've noticed relatively speaking. 11 seems to view his time as 10 as something to surpass (not the actor, but the Doctor himself). His motions, actions, and manor of self is grandiose and purposefully so. 10 almost always ended up that way because of his PTSD and desire to impress his companions (especially rose, somewhat into Martha, but back to adventuring with the often unimpressed Donna).

I think many that reject 11 and 12 do not have the full scope of the Doctor's life in mind when judging him. His regenerations are akin to moments in life where you realize ""nothing will ever be the same again"". A high dose of radiation akin to the loss of a loved one, falling from an impossible height similar to the plummeting into engagement and adulthood.

false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,"well first of all, lets get something straight. we haven't played 'tiki taka' since 2012-2013. 

second, while i agree that rafa's teams were well drilled, hard to score against, etc etc...think about a few things here. rafa had inherited a team with some great defenders, Big Sami, carra, finnan, riise, and more. he also inherited a steven gerrard who was building into his prime. he then was able to nab xabi alonso to go with didi hamann, sissoko he got and masch. he went after different types of players. but lets also not forget who else who bought that went horribly wrong: he bought the likes of morientes, bellamy, penent, babel, dossena, aquilani and keane (combined this is approximately 65m of flops)...all i would say were pretty massive flops (i know bellamy ended up helping us a lot but when we first got him he was considered a flop)...Rafa did things a certain way (like a certain someone your taking about above) and did not like to bend, flex or adjust too much. i would say his man management was poor at best and he froze out arguably our most important player we had the last decade bar stevie...Xabi alonso. and for what? for fucking gareth barry. i understand that rafa had a hard time with our knobhead owners but here's an interesting stat:  rafa in 5-6 years, spent 230m pounds. and that wasn't even with todays prices. brendao in 3 has probably spent close to that to be honest, but he is also dealing with a different beast in the transfer market when it comes to prices, when it comes to competing with the big boys. the squad has been gutted and we have had a look at the youth, the quality, the talent. If 50% of our transfers fulfill their potential, we'll have a great starting 11 with youth players rising through the ranks and more youth being brought in...just the way it's gonna be. brendao will make this light shine through.  top 4 and making it out of group stages would be a fantastic achievement and one that would see us remain with the big dogs...it is also one that we should expect. but if not, i have faith that our owners will do what it takes to keep the team together for another push next season. look at what they did to suarez, you really think they'll sell sterling, sturridge, hendo, marko, coutinho, moreno? they will hold onto them like they did with suarez and make them honor their contracts. part of the beauty of the stunt with suarez last year was the owners taking the club by the balls and saying, we run this shit, we write your checks, we own you until we want to sell you or we let your contract run out. quite refreshing in a day in age when you have so many whiners, complainers and babies looking for a pay day (and i don't blame them). 

so just to clarify, im not trying to fight or argue :) i loved rafa and his time here. he helped to push our team past the finish line in 05, albeit as lucky as we were, and get us to the line in 07. he won an fa cup. he won a league cup. he came up just short to finish second in the league...there is no doubt he provided us with memories that will last a lifetime and engrave his name into anfield folklore, but we need to move on. as i agree that BR has had a rough go of things this year, it's tough on him for you to say that it's just this year. if you liked him last year while we were winning, you better like him when we're losing. he's a genius, all of the 'egotistical' stuff people say about him, it's genius. he's doing everything possible to make himself the focal point of this team, something that mourinho does, something pellegrini does, something every great coach does. i mean van gaal is a prick bag and he is always talking shit and cocky as shit. rodgers is young and won't always play the correct cards, but i can see his progression as manager before my eyes and it's beautiful. we have such a bright young squad, they are not playing so poorly that i'm disinterested. they are just making mistakes in the final third on each end. and that gets better with familiarity, with practice and time. to be honest, i can see our squad making a deep run in a couple domestic comps, i can see us compete for top 4 and i can see us getting out of group stages. this run of games is so important for our season and br is gonna change it all. 

final side note, our depth (including loanees) looks awesome! below is a list, by position of all of our players with age:

gk: mignolet (26), jones (32)
rb: manquillo (20), johnson (30), flanno (21), wisdom (21)
cb: toure (33), lovren (25), skrtel (29), sahko (24), ilori (21), coates (24)
lb: enrique (27), moreno (22), brad smith (20) 

midfielders: gerrard (34), coutinho (22), hendo (24), lallana (26), lucas (27), can (20), ALLEN (24), sterling (19), brannagan (18), ibe (18), rossiter (17), jordan williams (18), marko (20), teixeria (21), alberto (22), 

st: balo (24), origi (19), sturridge (25), lambo (32), dunn (19), borini (23), assaidi (26) 

the squad will be trimmed of a lot of ""fat"" soon and rodgers will have a full squad he can call his. but look at the average ages on those guys. our strike force has 1 guy over 25...1 (not including assaidi). our midfield (not including academy guys) has two players over 25...2. our defense bar johnson, skrtel, toure and enrique has 4 over 25...4. and gk, well they're our gk. that's 9 guys over 25 on a roster of over 25. and many of them are not much over. so much to be positive about. head up, rodgers will grow on you. it took me time but halfway through his first season, i really liked what i saw. and i realized it wasn't luck either. kenny couldn't do it, roy couldn't do it, rafa in his last season couldn't do it...i think rodgers is the right man for the job..we just need to cut him some slack and send him positive vibes!

As I understand it (however this is based off 2nd hand information), you can extend your lease privately with the freeholder and they can grant the extension or not if they want to (will probably pay them money). However if they refuse or you can't agree on terms, you can go the statutory route where they legally have to extend it by 90 years (more info in the above link) but this will cost a fair amount.

FSG and Rodgers pretty much had to start over because the 3 previous years had been disasterous. Rodgers inherited couple of key players, too, but he couldn't rely on the core to stay there for years. Gerrard and Carragher were getting on, Pepe seemed certain to leave for Barca. Sure we had Suarez but there's always that catch when players get into a great form - they get too good for Barca's and Real's liking.

Also the general direction is different - we buy more promising young players and while it could be more rewarding, it's much more riskier and takes more time. I know that many fans are already losing patience but I like that direction and would plough on.

However, I definitely can see more validity in outsiders' criticisms of Rodgers this season. Last season I think a lot of the criticism from rival fans was just jealousy. Arsenal have tried for years to put together a team like we had last year and Rodgers put it all together in only his second season at Liverpool. 

This season though, the jabs about him being tactically naive or his penchant for cringey statements are ringing truer. Persisting with the lone striker and the way he's handled issues with Sakho and to an extent Sterling left a lot to be desired. I was also pretty horrified by the statement he made about having no sympathy for Southampton; it was such a foolish thing to say. 

Anyways, I think he himself has as much to improve on as the team does. That being said, Rafa was certainly not above making stupid statements and handling player conflict poorly. Remember his ""list"" of examples of where United got preferential treatment? At least no rival manager has managed to mentally break Rodgers like Ferguson did to Rafa.

Indeed, as is its purpose. I'm making a point of avoiding Sainsburys henceforth because I utterly despise the advert and, by extension, I would also like to offer my biggest ever ""fuck you"" to everyone involved in its production (except for the British Legion).

&gt; Seems the cynicism has completely ignored the actual reality of advertising.

The reality of advertising is that it is used to increase profits, sell a products or to implant an idea/meme in the public consciousness. To believe otherwise is to be woefully naive. The reality of *this advert* is that somewhere, around a table or skype call, a bunch of marketing people discussed how they could manipulate a public recently saturated with WW1 remembrance into buying more Sainsburys products than Tesco products.   

The Sainsburys ad is a turd flung into the face of history for the purpose of generating profit. The effort put into its production does not change the fact that it is not art; it does not seek to speak the unspeakable, it is sanitised, saccharine and romanticises a continental catastrophe. By its very nature it reduces the real historical incident to the level of the chocolate-peddling Phil Collins gorilla.

&gt; A person is guilty of an offence if-
&gt; he causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer
&gt; the access he intends to secure is unauthorised; and
&gt; he knows at the time when he causes the computer to perform the function that that is the case.

And from Facebook-
&gt; You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account or do anything else that might jeopardise the security of your account.

Betfred -
&gt; When opening an account, customers are required to choose their own username and password. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that these details are kept private, as they are responsible for all bets accepted on their account. If you lose or forget your username and/or password, or if you are concerned that a third party is aware of them, you should change your password details immediately.

My interpretation is that any computer system that is restricted in any way (user authentication, physical securement, etc) is covered by the Act if a user other than the one intended uses it.

In the case of the OP, most bookie T&amp;Cs will probably state that user accounts should be kept private. Using a friend's would violate such terms and under the Computer Misuse Act be considered illegal. Since you're claiming to be someone you're not, that probably falls under ""Fraud by misrepresentation"" under Section 2 of the Fraud Act.

This also suggests fraping is illegal. Apparently [a man in Ireland was prosecuted for this](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/man-fined-2000-for-first-facebook-frapingcriminal-case-30394813.html) though it was a malicious act and I suspect no one is going to arrest you for humourously changing your friend's date of birth or posting sexually deviant exposition on their behalf.

Edit: Grammar and link to better source. Also, more rambling below.

 * Fraud Act - http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/contents

Examples of things you've done that may be considered illegal:

 * Using your partner's bank card (with their permission)
 * Copying that file for a colleague
 * ""Liking"" Twilight's Facebook page on behalf of your friend
 * Sharing a Facebook account to act as a band/shop/etc
 * [Using unsecured wireless networks](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4721723.stm)
 * Setting up your parents' tablet so they can check their email, skype, etc.
 * Using discount codes your scoured from the net

From the Computer Misuse Act again, ""Interpretation"":

&gt; Access of any kind by any person to any program or data held in a computer is unauthorised if—
(a)he is not himself entitled to control access of the kind in question to the program or data; and
(b)he does not have consent to access by him of the kind in question to the program or data from any person who is so entitled

But in your example, I would say both of you are violating the ToS. And if a service provider has made it clear they don't want you to do something and you do it anyway, that's unauthorised.

Even if you're not immediately breaking the law, signing up and agreeing to a ToS is a contract and presumably if violated either party can take the other to court.

Morientes: previously world class striker bought for around 6m - defo worth a punt, people were very excited at the time

Bellamy: Pacy, aggressive forward who actually played very well for us and scored some vital goals (Barca away), no way was he a flop.

Pennant: Youngish winger who hadn't worked out at previous clubs. Actually wasn't as bad as people made out, when he could be bothered he put in some fantastic performances.

Babel: Again, young and VERY promising, lots of clubs were after him at the time. Might not have lived up to the hype but was still a valuable player for us and scored some big goals.

Dossena: utter shite, I'll give you that one.

Aqcuilani: Had ability but wasn't suited to the league and injuries ruined his start. Should have been given more chances imo

Keane: not bought by Benitez and wasn't anywhere near as bad as some people claim he was.

If they are his biggest flops then it proves how fucking good he was. You should have maybe added someone like Kromkamp, he was atrocious. The thing is, Rafa was working under extremely difficult circumstances, if you look at some of the players he wanted to get but couldn't (David Silva, Mata, Falcao etc...) you get a picture of how good we could have been if he was backed properly. 

Rafa's biggest mistake was ostracising Alonso for Barry, then not getting Barry! It would have turned out a bit differently if we got him, he might not be Alonso but he would have been a lot better than Aquilani or anyone else we have had in midfield since.

 [**Burning of Washington**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning%20of%20Washington): [](#sfw)

&gt;The __Burning of Washington__ in 1814 was an attack during the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812) between [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) forces and those of the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America). On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the [Battle of Bladensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg), a British force led by Major General [Robert Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ross_(British_army_officer\)) occupied [Washington City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_City) and set fire to many public buildings, including the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) (known as the presidential mansion at the time), and the [Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Capitol), as well as other facilities of the [U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government).  The attack was in part a retaliation to American actions in the [Raid on Port Dover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Port_Dover).

This isn't something he should be praised for, he's not doing it on purpose, the attention and pressure is on him now because of performances, not because of anything he's said, he didn't lose three games in a row and field that team against Madrid as some calculated plan to alleviate pressure from the players. He's the manager at the end of the day and the buck stops with him, individual players can only be blamed for so long before the attention swings his way.

&gt;although i gotta wonder how many of those were committee buys

None of us know for sure, Tony Barrett stated the other day he believes Lallana, Lambert, Markovich &amp; Lovren were the signings that Rodgers wanted, the rest were committee, his opinion only but it's interested he thinks this way none the less. Rodgers has the final say on players that are signed so I don't believe there's any player here that he hasn't agreed to.

My main problem with Rodgers right now is that there doesn't some to have been any structure to the players he signed, he didn't seem to have a plan or a way of fitting them together, he just went out and bought loads of average to decent players with potential to be great - none of whom really slot into a given system.

false,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I rate Townsend, but he's not first team quality yet, and opposing defenses know this. Last fall when he first started seeing playing time, he was often double-teamed and was able to stretch defenses out. Now, he induces no fear, and as a result he provides little more stretch and open channels than the rest of our wide options. 

That kind of striker would be fantastic and I entirely agree with you, but there are some very key differences between our setup and those of the ones Aguero and Suarez ran around for. Those sides have threats everywhere, especially from range in the middle of the park. Teams may stack their boxes against them, but they have to be far more balanced to counter as many of the threats as possible, and inevitably leave more channels to move through than we ever see. 

So yes, I do think we need improvement at striker. But I think the single most potentially impactful player in attack we could introduce is one of Depay or Konoplyanka's playing style, with blistering pace, aggressive dribbling, and accuracy from range. We have got to open those channels back up, or even the deadliest mobile striker won't have much to work with.

For me, I think we could use Nastasic' Prem experience. Less of a ""maybe,"" and we need immediate reinforcement of our back line.

Yes he's been dropped for game, but I think he knows well and good it's just to push him more and he likely even appreciates the opportunity to not be blamed.

Facebook authorises you to use the account they have provided you. You cannot authorise another person. It's just the same as sharing an assigned password for work with your colleagues.

Imagine your friend is in need so you give him a key to your house and let him crash on the sofa. One day he decides to get a new key cut so he can give it to his mate. He has no right to do that. His mate could be a corporate spy or a 9gagger. Your facebook account is just a sofa.

&gt;Once someone has given you thier password, then you are no longer unauthorised. It's only unauthorised access if you steal/guess the password and use it to access an account without the owners permission.

**It doesn't matter if you stole, guessed or were given the password, if the system owner has not given their permission then you are unauthorised.**

&gt;

&gt;Crook and his wife Lindsay, a former advertising executive, reside in the north London suburb of [Muswell Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muswell_Hill).   Crook and his wife were married in April 2001, and have a son, Jude Michael, born 17 January 2003, and a daughter, Scout Elizabeth, born 24 December 2007.

&gt;As a teenager, he inherited a rare breeding pair of Mediterranean [spur-thighed tortoises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spur-thighed_tortoise), leading to his hobby of breeding [chelonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle).  In January 2010 on the [Andrew Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Marr) Show, Crook revealed that he himself provides the tortoises used in his new play 'Jerusalem', taking them from his own herd. A committed conservationist, Crook purchased eight acres of [Essex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex) woodland in 2008, to create his own private nature reserve.  In an interview with the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) he denied claims made on Wikipedia that he was a [Green Party of England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales) activist. 

&gt;His favourite musicians are [Nick Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake) and [Kurt Cobain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain).

&gt; &gt;In 2007, only 13% of women and 4% of men considered themselves to be obese, and in 2012 that dropped to 11% and 7%.

&gt;I just.. I mean those numbers... Why does it smell like burning copper?

&gt;Regardless of bad math, this is something I've thought a lot about.  When I was obese, I didn't identify as such.  None of my friends called me obese.  Even now people who knew me then refer to me as formerly ""big"" or ""chubby"".  I was full on BMI of 32.  So what do you do?  You show me a huge guy on TV and the first thought would have been ""Well I'm not that big"" so you dismiss it.  Show me someone smaller and I'll disregard it as being not that much smaller, I'm close enough.  It was really an apathetic and somewhat warped mindset that was easy to get into. Fat logic, if you will.

&gt;I have no idea how you get your average obese person to recognize it's a problem and they can do something about it without them being defensive and dismissing it.

The omni-rumor is an ongoing rumor that all or most of the missing episode of Doctor Who have been found.  There are various variations on the rumor but it keeps resurfacing.  Last year, the BBC released a nearly complete version of The Web of Fear and a complete version of Enemy of the World, both of which were mostly missing before.  Since then, the rumor has persisted that Marco Polo at least, and supposedly the majority of other missing episodes have been found.

Glossary of terms from the quoted letter:

""Phil"" - Phillip Morris is the head of TIEA, the organization that was responsible for hunting down and finding the copies of Enemy of the World and Web of Fear that were released last year.   He is the figurehead at the eye of this storm as his work with TIEA was responsible for recent recovery of previously lost episodes.

""TIEA"" - Television International Enterprises Archive - an organization that is dedicated to finding lost or missing television and preserving it for archival purposes.  TIEA is headed by Phillip Morris and was responsible for tracking down the copies of Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear that were released last year.  TIEA's efforts are not limited to the recovery of Doctor Who but their efforts are at the heart of the omni-rumor.

The directive applies to any EEA citizen that is moving to and living in an EEA state other than his own. (The exclusion is based on the principle of non-interference with purely national issues). However, it also applies when a European citizen is moving back to his home country after staying abroad, as defined in the case of Surinder Singh.[4] For dual citizens with two EEA nationalities the directive can apply in any EEA state. Temporary limitations are in place for the new member states of the EU.

To be fully covered by the European right of free movement, the EEA citizen needs to exercise one of the four treaty rights:

working as an employee (this includes looking for work for a reasonable amount of time),
working as a self-employed person,
studying,
being self-sufficient or retired.
These rights are named after the Treaty of Rome, which defines the freedom of movement for workers. They have been extended over time, and are mainly of historical significance by now, since being self-sufficient has been added to the list. As long as a citizen has sufficient money or income not to rely on public funds and holds comprehensive health insurance, he/she exercises one or more treaty rights. If no treaty right is exercised, the right of free movement is limited to three months.

**Family members are also covered by the right of free movement, but only as a *dependent* of the EEA citizen. The right is limited to the EEA state in which the EEA citizen is exercising treaty rights.** In certain cases (e.g. divorce after at least 3 years of marriage where 1 year must have been spent in the host member state), the family member can retain the right of residence. A family member is defined as:

- **the spouse** (unless in a marriage of convenience),


 - the registered same-sex partner (but only in a state where same-sex relationships are recognised),

false,xionuk,null,null,"I work for an ISP here, but not BT - troubleshooting is much the same though.  Are you using a wireless connection to the router or a wired one?

If it's wired, are you noticing any pattern to the disconnects?  If there are, then this is most troubling and if they can't see that, they they suck at monitoring your connection - especially if it's hitting all devices.

If there is a pattern, e.g. it happens during rain, then it suggests that there is an intermittent fault somewhere on the cable.  These can be a bitch to find, just keep logging it each time it happens till you get someone with a ounce of sense to notice multiple faults and log it further.

If your connection is wireless, is the disconnect happening to one or all devices.  If it's one, then it suggests interference between the router and the device in question.  Water/Electricity (i.e. fuse box)/metal will all interrupt the wireless signal and cause these issues.

If it's all devices, change your routers wireless channel off Auto and move it onto 3/4/8/9/13.  Routers will default to 1/6/11 by default as they don't interfere, but from how your posting, it sounds like your in a flat, so there's lots of congestion on those channels.  Moving to one of the other five will give you a better signal quality which will help you further.

You can see where your neighbours have their channels either by typing 
    netsh wlan show networks bssid
into command prompt on Windows Vista or later, or on OS X, search for system information on Spotlight or find it in the Utilities folder, select WiFi from the right hand menu bar (Or Airport if it's an older mac) and then you'll be presented with a list of the networks.  On both, your interested in a channel number (between 1-13), avoid being next to high concentrations of people on the same channel.

If your router is next to something else wireless, like a cordless phone, try keeping it about 1m away from the other device and see if that helps.  If it's next to the fuse box, move it as far away as the ADSL cable will allow, don't connect it to another socket in the house as it could end up lowering your connection speed if the internal wiring is poor.  If relocation isn't an option, even something simple as rotating the router can help as it will relocated the antenna in the router and it might be enough to overcome some of the interference.  

If it's wireless, you're really on your own to resolve the issue as ISPs generally won't do much checks other than the basics I've listed above.  Sadly WiFi is impacted by too much out with our control.  😔 



If you are still getting nowhere with BT, don't call them, send an email to them as when I used to be with BT a few years ago, it was picked up by a contact centre in Ireland so you could speak with someone who didn't have to follow the script or lose their job. -.-  This might have changed though.

While I see that the quality of the healthcare provided in the US is generally better, the current system encourages skyrocketing prices and fraud, including providing treatment that's not needed.

For example, my British patients tend to be on less medications than my patients were in the US. This is partially because medicines are expensive, so bankrupt NHS won't give medicines to patients unless they really need them, whereas pharmacists in the US are often employed by the company who makes them medications and are therefore incentivized to keep patients on more medications than they really need. Thus, American people are often overmedicated and British people are potentially undermedicated.

Waiting times and ""extra"" services are not so great in the NHS. I recently had a fairly young patient who came into hospital for kidney failure, and while he was there it was noticed that he had major trouble talking. Once they noticed this it took them almost a week before they ordered a CT scan, which showed he had a stroke. At this point he should have gone home and started getting speech therapy, but instead he sat in hospital FOUR WEEKS for no reason whatsoever before they finally got around to sending him home. Once he got home I think he had to wait several more weeks before getting any speech therapy because the waiting list was so long. In the meantime a golden window was missed for the best time to get therapy, which is in the first few weeks after a stroke. In the US he would likely have had plenty of therapy immediately available if he had medicare, and at least a few weeks if he had private insurance. And he definitely wouldn't have sat in hospital for 4 weeks for no reason. 

Another interesting difference between American and British healthcare is their treatment of older people and people with dementia. In the US very old people or people with dementia are more likely to be kept alive with a feeding tube even if they can't swallow. It's a complicated ethical issue which I won't go into detail on now, but FWIW I think there are times when each approach is preferable. 

I'm convinced that the huge problems we have around the world with healthcare will never be solved until a patient's treatment is completely between the patient and the healthcare provider, as it would be in a free market. As soon as you introduce third-party insurance or government-run systems, you create incentives for waste and corruption. Even though such a system would lower prices and improve quality for everyone, I don't it will ever happen because it would necessarily involve the risk of some people not being able to afford their healthcare.

I must admit that I'm struggling to wrap my head around it - if I'm reading this right, then the next election may be an object lesson in why the electoral system used for the Assembly - the Additional Member System (AMS) - isn't fit for purpose.

They're predicting that UKIP is going to achieve a combined vote share of 12% across both the constituency and regional list votes - fractionally over 200,000 votes in total. They also predict a vote share of 18% for Plaid (~360,000 votes) and 21% for the Conservatives (~420,000 votes) - both parties are therefore expected to hold steady in terms of vote share, with a slight increase in the absolute number of votes cast for Plaid and a slightly bigger drop for the Tories.

From these figures, UKIP are predicted to win 11 seats, the Tories 10 (-4) and Plaid 9 (-2), despite garnering a much smaller vote share than the those two parties. This is due to UKIP not winning a single constituency seat - so they are compensated through achieving a clean sweep on the regional list, obliterating Conservative and Plaid candidates there. 

Seem unfair? I think so. But wait, it gets better! [Opinion polling shows](http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2013/07/NAW-Constit-Polls.png) that most of UKIP's recent rise in support in Wales seems to be coming from disgruntled Labour voters.

false,threejoinedrings,null,null,"I'd say it's probably a common thread that all Greens would like the most local democracy, which for Scotland was independence when it was offered and for all regions is the highest level of devolution. I'm in Northern Ireland and I'd say most of our Greens would pick whatever offered the most local, highest level of government - if we were keeping Stormont with all its powers then obviously that means switching from answering to London to answering to Dublin (where we'd be 25% of the Dáil), but if a united Ireland would mean no devolution within Ireland then we'd be losing a tier of more local government so we'd actually be more centralised to Dublin.

Speaking from that point of view, I think whatever offers nations the most control over their own affairs while still remaining viable and connected is good - I'd be happy with a federalised EU if it meant places like Catalonia, Venice, Flanders, Basque, etc all being considered separate states if they wanted it. Similarly, I think a federal UK would be great, but I don't think ""England"" should be one state - I think that enough people from, for example, Yorkshire and Cornwall would be interested in being different states that it would be viable to split England up to make it a bit more equally weighted between states.

It's worth considering, though, that I don't consider myself British at all and I have basically zero ""sentimental"" attachment and very little respect for the current systems across the UK in terms of how Westminster manages them.",0,1415989753,null,0,false,0,cm2j97e,t3_2m8nnp,t1_cm2j97e,t3_2m8nnp,null,1426025940,5,false,UKGreens,t5_34166,5
