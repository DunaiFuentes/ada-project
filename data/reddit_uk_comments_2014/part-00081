Q2: I'd think UTD could finish 5th, maybe edging out Everton and Spurs. A lot can still happen. As for the Champions league, with Mata cup tied and Van Persie out for 4 - 6 weeks it doesn't look like they'll make semi's.

Q3: I love Upton Park and i'm a bit sad about the move but i understand it's a business and needs to progress and expand. hurts a bit.

Q4: I think Allardyce is a good manager and at the end of last season he said one of his goals for next season was to ""Adopt the West Ham way"" unfortunately due to a terrible spell of injuries we got sucked into a relegation battle and he was forced to winning games the way he knows best.

Q5: I think he has huge potential and as long as he cools his head and looses the 'solo man, god complex' thing he was gifted by the press he will be a great attribute. I believe he was loaned to QPR due to complaints of a small injury, which was never proven by the medical staff at West Ham. for this reason Allardyce decided he wasn't committed enough for a relegation battle and shipped him off where he'd get game time.

Q6: though we have made mostly lone deals, It has to be Carlton Cole. He came back and helped us out big time when we where at our most injury stricken. hell he didn't need the money but he wanted to help the club and he did. Worst has to be 'Relegation Rodger' from wolves.   

Q7: Two, assuming they stay, would be Danny Potts, and Elliot Lee. Potts played some first team games last season and i thought he was excellent, lots of commitment and passion for the game. Elliot Lee is already earmarked to go but he has played brilliantly for our under 21s would be a sad loss.

Q8: 'Assuming we stay up' Shots fired! Sign a small skilful striker to work with Carroll. Keep Winston Reid and find him a place in the squad that doesn't break up the Tomkins/Collins partnership. which has been great, also Noble as captain. 

Q9: Adrian, Tomkins, Collins, Reid, Armero, Noble (C), Diame, Downing, Nolan, Jarvis, Carroll.

Q10: Can't say, everything's up in the air at the moment. I like to think It'll be 3 - 2. Carroll with 2, Nolan with 1 and Rooney with 2.

true,wredditcrew,null,null,"First you need to see what's available in your area. Is there Virgin Media cable (who are bastards), is there FTTC (BT, who are far worse than VM, call it ""Infinity"", Sky call it ""Sky Fibre"" etc.)?

Speaking as a Virgin Media customer that has dealt with loads of different ISPs, if I could get FTTC then my first choice would be the high-end fibre from PlusNet ""Unlimited Fibre Broadband"". Up to 76Mb/s down and 19.5Mb/s up. It's £22.50 (+ Line Rental) at full price, but they do a massively cut priced bundle at the moment and there's a ridiculously high amount of cashback via Quidco at the moment.

After that, it'd be Sky Fibre Unlimited Pro, but it's vastly more expensive at the moment. 

Edit: Most important: NOT FUCKING TALKTALK!

Edit 2: But obviously, don't go for the higher-speed pro packages if your line is unlikely to support those speeds. And if you do go for highspeed fibre, budget to replace the RJ11 cable with a short high-end Belkin one, and provide your own VDSL iPlate, probably about £12 each. 

And if you're professionals, I'd well recommend sticking a small UPS (battery backup) on the router(s) so that you don't loose broadband in the event of a power cut. A power cut won't kill your laptops/tablets/phones, so you shouldn't let it take down your broadband without warning, if you're remote working it's a fucking godsend. It's like insurance, you're hoping you won't need it, but if you need it even once, it's worth far more than you paid for it. http://www.ebuyer.com/201003-liebert-psp-650mt-ups-390w-650va-usb-4-output-psp650mt3-230u would do fine. The quidco on the cashback on Plusnet would more than cover all the accessories.

2) 6th place, and I can see a brutal ass raping courtesy of Bayern. Sorry :/

3) Possibly yes, but all the while the Fat Man is in charge of us, no.

4) The Fat Man is yet to outlive his usefulness, however he will only be viable for maintaining survival and stability. We will not progress at all with him in charge.

5) No idea. Based on past English talents he will probably never be anything more than 'potential', but he could end up the next big thing. I think he's worth keeping. And I think he went to QPR for some game time, as the Fat Man will never drop Nolan, his long term romantic partner.

6) The best is definitely Adrian. Worst, either Roger Johnson or Razvan Rat.

7) Elliot Lee, Daniel Potts, Ravel Morrison

8) Stay up again. That's all a team with the Fat Man in charge can ever hope to do. He will consistently keep us treading water in lower mid table.

I understand that it puts this person in a bind if they don't want to expose their young child to these types of issues at a young age, but Yid is such a huge part of Tottenham, it's so powerful when everyone gets in a chant. I think this person just needs to nut up and explain it to his kid.

""As a Jew...I would not be comfortable to take my children to games and have to explain the fans are singing the Y-word and what it means...""

First of all, everyone should know what the Holocaust is, and this person, as a parent should take the opportunity to explain it to his kid how he thinks is best instead of letting him possibly get some weird explanation somewhere else. Furthermore, he is a Jew, so the fact that he is shying away from teaching his kid about the Holocaust is unbelievable to me. Importantly, Yid is a huge thing for Spurs. It's such a powerful feeling you get when everyone is chanting together at it's unifying hearing that word. It's an amazing feeling.

To those being offended despite the lack of intent to offend: don't be offended. Get a grip. Realize that no one is directing anything at you, and then get over it. It's like people can't control their emotions anymore and everyone else has to tip-toe around their feelings.

If this guy wants to postpone his kid learning about horrible things like that until he is older, then don't bring your kid to the game. Get a nanny. Better yet, bring your kid, and if he asks, just tell him a white lie.

In april, when you are looking for a new ISA, it might pay to get one where you can 'transfer in', So while the ISA you set up now might not pay much interest, especially if you move it next month. It will still be tax free next year too.

It wasn't just 10-20 minute spells either, he was starting games for us. If I recall correctly he starting something like 10 games for us, 2 of which were in the CL. Plenty of people noticed he was very talented and he was given the chance to prove it, which he did as he was one of Carlo's favoured players. 

Saying McEachran's loan isn't nowhere near Chalobah's is also being a bit harsh, he fizzled out towards the end but apart from that he played very well. Bamford, well he's a striker and a very good one at that so he will naturally get more plaudits but his impact on the team is comparable to McEachran and Chalobah during their loan spells. 

McEachran's recent loan spell has probably taken away any advantage he had but that's mainly down to injuries, Chalobah seems to be liked by Jose as well so McEachran's chances are even worse and it's still Bamford's first season so it's too early for him. If we're talking about who's done the most to warrant the chance though then it's McEachran as far as I'm concerned because he's already showed he's good enough for us, if it wasn't for the revolving managers we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

When I last applied for DLA, I didn't have my permanent feeding tube, I didn't need as many medications to deal with potentially life-threatening problems and I only required a carer for about 3 hours a day while my husband worked. 

I always qualified for Higher Rate Mobility but I currently receive Middle Rate Care which is too low now my problems have progressed.

Since my last award, I've had surgery to fit a permanent tube into my intestine to bypass my paralysed stomach, my mobility has decreased even further (I now have a partially customised powered wheelchair, as opposed to my old standard chair and my flat has been adapted with ceiling hoists, remote control windows, doors and kitchen counters and a video intercom (I'm also deaf)...amongst many other things!)

These days I require 24/7 care to keep me safe and as my needs are now more medical than ""social"", Social Services no longer pays for it. I get my funding from ""NHS Continuing Care"" and hire a Personal Assistant (PA), trained specifically to help with my issues using the money the NHS provides (they pay for my PA's wages and all training for her as without it, I'd basically be in hospital all the time.)

I notified the DWP that my circumstances had changed over a year ago as they demand you do... but they've done seemingly nothing to reassess my needs and I've been stuck with a Care rate that just doesn't reflect my reality.

I'm still really scared of being assessed for PIP though. It seems like they just wish we'd all die so they didn't have to pay anymore and they think that if they take enough away from you, you'll drop dead anyway and they'll save money. It seems they'll do anything to take your benefits off you completely and they'll definitely do their best to avoid giving me the rates I need.

I also qualify for ESA on paper, I should by all rights be automatically in the support group but I'm just too sick to jump through the hoops to claim it. I could really use that money to improve the quality of my life but I don't think I can handle the pressure of it.

I HIGHLY suggest you subscribe to this website: http://disabilityrightsuk.org/

as it will not only help you massively filling in claims in the future, but it might be able to provide you with information regarding support for filling in the ESA50. 

As for the backpayment, if you informed them of your change, then I assume you should be allowed to claim for backpayments, though I am not certain because I'm not completely read up on the system. Knowing them they would have to send you another claim form or something stupid, but I would certainly take a look into it to see if you are eligible for the backpayments. It seems like it's their fault, so you are entitled to it. 

I have filled in both the ESA50 and the PIP claims form in the past, and of the two I would say the ESA50 is a bit easier. Most of the answers can be copied directly through from your PIP form, and the money is nothing to scoff at, especially if you get in the support group. 

I really hope I have not given you incorrect information on the backpayment thing, I dont think I have or I wouldnt have said anything. I certainly think it is worth getting in touch with a support group and seeing how an adviser can help you with your claims, you would be amazed at all the stupid loopholes and ways you can claim back money. 

The one thing I am certain of which I would advise is send off for the ESA50 now. They HAVE to backpay it to when you requested the form, same for PIP, and it is currently taking them 6-8 months to process claims, so all that time will be backpaid. 

Edit: I asked my mum. Turns out you should be able to claim the backpayments from when you requested to be reassessed, though you would need to be able to prove that you requested it. Did you send any letters or did they send you any?

&gt;Chelsea. Where do you see them dropping points? Will CL distract them? Will they get past PSG?

I think Chelsea will probably drop points at Anfield, although I think they'll most likely still get a point here. The only other really tough fixture they have is against Arsenal where yet again I think they'll still get at least a point. 

As for the Champions League I'm not sure the quarterfinals will have a huge effect on their league performance since the game sandwiched between the two legs is at home against Stoke. I don't know a ton about PSG but from what I do know they're fairly evenly matched with Chelsea, but I would give Chelsea a slight edge to advance since they play the second leg at home.

&gt;City. Aguero might miss United and Arsenal games[1] . How big a blow is that? Will they be dropping points anywhere?

City are rather deep at striker, so I don't think it's a huge blow. It is a blow nonetheless, however I think City should still beat United regardless of whether Aguero plays. I think City will drop at least 5 points, at three at Anfield and two at Goodison. At Arsenal and against Southampton are also games where I could see City dropping points.

&gt;Arsenal. No-one's really talking about them winning it. Why not? Like us they have to play Chelsea and City, if that goes well the rest of their games are pretty winnable. Will they win the FA cup?

My guess is no-one has been talking about Arsenal because of the tough run of fixtures they have been currently going through. In the nine weeks from Feb. 8th to Apr. 6th they will have had to play all 6 of the other top 7 teams. From that stretch so far they have picked up 7 out of 15 and they still have to play City, at Chelsea, and at Everton. Arsenal just haven't really been on great form recently and their fixtures over the next few weeks aren't getting any easier.

If they can come out of those three games against Chelsea, City, and Everton then I think they have a pretty good shot at the title. I along with a lot of people just don't see it happening. I do think that they have a great chance to win the FA Cup, though.

&gt;Tottenham and Everton. Who's going to finish highest of these two. Are Tottenham collapsing or have they just had a run of hard games?

It's tough to say who will finish higher. Tottenham have an easier run of fixtures but Everton have been playing better and have just played a lot more cohesively as a team. Right now Everton is two points back with two games in hand, but they still have to play City, Arsenal, United, and at Southampton where as Tottenham only have to come to Anfield and have Southampton at home. If Everton can get at least two points from their matches against Arsenal and City then I think they will finish above Tottenham.",0,1395434715,null,0,false,0,cg8k5b2,t3_21041q,t1_cg8k5b2,t3_21041q,null,1433010462,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Am I right in thinking you can end up in a vicious circle where you wear to much, it ruins your skin, you have to wear more, it ruins your skin more?

Not really, well not if you know what you're doing. If you just cake a ton of foundation onto a certain skin type without a good primer (just like a paint primer) then some foundations (oily) can break you out in spots, and others can dry your skin out to billy-o. But as long as you know what you're doing and using stuff properly that doesn't really have to be a problem anymore. Makeup technology has advanced massively in the last 30 years.

&gt;3) Sounds like either they are trying it on or have changed their mind, they would (or should) be fully aware what they pay your agency but may not be aware your exact earnings (tho usually you can just knock 20% off and you're about there) so them saying they can't pay ""you"" more is complete bollocks unless they are keeping you on an agency rather than a full contract?

Trying it on. The question I posed to work today was 'let's say you're offered a new job and you're due to start on Monday, then they call you and say you know we promised to better your current salary? Well we're not gonna now.' Would you still take the job or tell them to stuff it? The answer is obvious.

Phone up your credit card and ask for a balance transfer to your current account. They'll probably charge you a 3%ish fee, but this works out much cheaper than a personal loan or the regular credit card interest rates.

Pay at least the minimum every month, otherwise you'll get stuck for penalty charges - never, ever miss a payment.

If you haven't paid it off by the end of the interest free period, find another card that is offering 0% and transfer the balance (again for a small fee).

Remember, they are not making any money off you if you do this right. They are hoping that you will either a) overstrech yourself and miss payments or b) forget about the end of the interest free period and just keep on paying the minimum.

true,FinalEdit,null,null,"The backlash against the BBC's programming is such a disingenuous argument. It tries to cater for every taste with a wide variety of programs that span many genres. It has a track record of producing the best TV in the world - yet people here moan that they don't like Strictly - well I don't either but to suggest ditching the whole organisation which spans entertainment, news, sport, documentaries and radio - as well as providing a top class on demand service is just fucking ludicrous. Just look at ITV if you want to see the alternative, can anyone here honestly day they've produced anything near as good as Planet Earth? Is LBC even close to Radio 4? No. 

As someone who doesn't work for the beeb, but works for a major broadcaster I can completely understand the need for this organisation to furnish it's offices with visually stimulating and/or relaxing environments. Working in TV can be fucking gruelling and to expect people to turn up every day and think of brand new ideas is the norm - spending 12 hours a day in a badly lit or baldly decorated suite trying to impress and appeal to a wide demographic is not fucking easy. Every second is fawned over - we don't just sit there circle jerking each other after a 6 hour day and go home - to get these shows out on air people have to fucking destroy themselves on a daily basis to create high production value material that is worthy and impressive. This shit isn't just plucked out of the fucking air and as the world of TV progresses, the demands and timeframe shave changed dramatically. Let them have their new fucking carpets because a warm, stimulating and interesting environment lets people feel at ease to create shit a lot of you here take for granted. 

Or just pop over to channel 5 and sit through 12 minutes of adverts every hour with no programming that criticises or analyses certain brands or companies for fear of losing ad revenue. Enjoy your product placement also. I may not like 50% of what's on the beeb at any given moment but I know I can rely on it to have quality above quantity in so many different ways. C4 is really the only commercial channel that comes close - but you get SO much more with the BBC.

I agree with certain complaints about the way the organisation is run - too much reliance on contractors and over management have caused money to be zapped away from production and spent on middle management wages which has been a disaster - but the spirit of the place remains, and as money has become an issue, people in pre and post production roles have had to work harder and harder to ensure the quality is kept to a high standard. Management needs to  change - but don't expect those dedicated to producing the best content should force themselves to work in a bland laboratory environment simply because you can't see a tangible endgame to the money spent. The right environment creates better programs, trust me.

Some cherry picked quotes from the same article on wiki, [under prevalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM#Prevalence):

&gt;BDSM is practiced in all social strata and is common in both heterosexual and homosexual men and women in varied occurrences and intensities.

&gt;A non-representative survey on the sexual behaviour of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. It results showed 15% of openly homosexual males, 21% of openly lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies.[63] In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%.

&gt;Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. 

&gt;A representative study done from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) had engaged in BDSM activity in the previous year.

&gt;Another representative study, published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time.

&gt;According to yet another survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed have at least used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities once, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM.[91] In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds and/or handcuffs.[91]

&gt;A 1985 study found 52 out of 182 female respondents (28%) were involved in sadomasochistic activities.

Also, under Origins:

&gt;Practices of BDSM survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world, associated with rituals to the Goddess Inanna (Ishtar in Akkadian). Academic historian and archaeologist Anne O Nomis has undertaken research revealing cuneiform texts dedicated to Inanna which incorporate domination rituals. In particular she points to ancient writings such as Inanna and Ebih (in which the Goddess dominates Ebih), and Hymn to Inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals ""imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initation and journeys of altered states of consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief.""

It's not really my thing but to try and pretend the prevalence of BDSM is a new phenomenon is just silly. Porn also has a very long and varied history, so if it skewed our views on pain and pleasure it was probably not too long into our visual history.",0,1395437106,null,0,false,0,cg8l7de,t3_20zno9,t1_cg8l7de,t1_cg8ckhe,null,1433010960,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;

&gt;""__Vincent and the Doctor__"" is the tenth episode in the [fifth series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_5\)) of British [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) television series *[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, first broadcast on [BBC One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 5 June 2010. It was written by [Richard Curtis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curtis) and directed by [Jonny Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Campbell) and featured an uncredited guest appearance from actor [Bill Nighy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nighy).

&gt;Intrigued by an ominous figure in one of [Vincent van Gogh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh)'s paintings, alien time traveller [the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor) ([Matt Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\))) and his [companion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) [Amy Pond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Pond) ([Karen Gillan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Gillan)) go back in time to meet Van Gogh ([Tony Curran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Curran)) and discover that [Provence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence) has been plagued by an invisible monster, known as the [Krafayis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H-Z\)#Krafayis), which only Van Gogh can see. The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.

&gt;Curtis, inspired by the fact that Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred around him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his madness. The episode was filmed in [Trogir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogir), [Croatia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia) and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and [BBC HD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_HD). Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated over, most reviewers agreed that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster while Curran's performance as Van Gogh was immensely praised.

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"There are good points about privatisation. For example, in Hinchingbrooke Hospital, decision making ahs been put back in the hands of nurses and doctors (as it used to be in the NHS before people (mainly labour) started bringing in all the un-needed paperwork and managers) and has seen waiting times drop massively and patient satisfaction and service increase massively.

I personally do not like the fact that the NHS is having parts commercialised. I would rather it be all government, but with the facilities run by the people who work there aka doctors, surgeons, consultants and nurses because they, and only they, know what they need and how to run the hospital properly (maybe employ a few accountants and a handful of admin staff to help though).

On another note, i thought Pharmacy and catering services have always been contracted out?

Also, i am not quite sure how X-Rays and blood tests can be commercialised as they are done in the hospital itself, not sent off to other labs.",0,1395437582,null,0,false,0,cg8leo8,t3_20xh9i,t1_cg8leo8,t1_cg86o0d,null,1433011055,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Hahaha, I don't want to bore everyone but 2012 started out really really shit for me, on top of the fact that my job at the time was making me completely miserable. I saw the Bellers documentary on ITV (I live in America but I use a VPN to watch TV programmes from back home) and thought it looked cool. I decided to visit their website just to read more about it and I discovered they were looking for volunteers for 3 month stints. I hadn't even considered the possibility of going out there but over the next few weeks the thought just wouldn't go away, so I realised I had to give it a go.

Had an interview over the telephone and then a few weeks later I received an email that they wanted me to come over and help out. So I handed in my two weeks notice that day and 3 weeks later I was flying to Sierra Leone (with a quick trip back to England to visit family on the way).

Arrived there with 4 other people who had applied (we ranged from 20-26 years old. I was 22 at the time and was 2nd oldest) and we basically just worked at the grassroots level. The CBF is divided into 2 different branches: the league and the academy. I worked on the league side of things.

The league had 4 regions around the country and I was working in a pilot scheme in one of the regions as like a liaison between the staff at the grassroots level (who were local people in the area) and the management level at HQ in the capital city of Freetown (who were all young British people with sports development backgrounds). Basically it was my job to be the eyes and ears for the management on the ground and try to work out ways to overcome any operational issues, since the league was still so young at the time. I believe when I went there the league was only in its 2nd or 3rd season and so still had loads of teething problems.

Me and the others were able to take a couple of trips down from our house in Makeni to Tombo, where the Academy is. We met Johnny McKinstry, the head coach of the academy at the time (he's the one with the stubble in the video you posted). He's since gone on to become Sierra Leone's national team manager actually. So yeah we were lucky enough to stay at the Academy for a couple of weekends. I was actually there the night England lost to Italy on penalties in the Euros. Took a few pics and met a few of the lads. About a month after I left, two of the lads at the academy actually had trials at Liverpool. At the time one of them was a 6'3"" striker called [Mustapha](http://craigbellamyfoundation.org/academy/11-1st-generation/27-mustapha). 15 years old (he must be almost 17 by now). He had an absolute rocket of a shot. Seriously. Riise would be jealous. AFAIK Liverpool really loved him but unfortunately we can't sign him till he's 18 because he's not an EU citizen. Honestly though, I'll be surprised if we don't sign him next year.

The other was a shorter lad, central midfielder called [Sulaiman](http://craigbellamyfoundation.org/academy/11-1st-generation/21-sulaiman). Very talented on the ball. Can pick a pass out of nowhere.

Both of them have had trials at Liverpool and Cardiff and Sulaiman has since gone to City as well.

Anyway, sorry for taking over the thread like I said I wouldn't. I just really miss it and really want to go back at some point in the next year or two.

It's really quite unreasonable to expect anyone, regardless of heritage, to explain the meaning and enormity of the Holocaust to someone who's 5 years old.  Expecting them to ""nut up"" and deal with it is, I think, insensitive.

There's a world of difference between ""taking the opportunity to explain"" the meaning of the word, and wanting to wait until the child is at an appropriate age to actually process some of what that word means and what it's contextual importance is.  Jews have, and will always have, an inviolable right to be offended by the word ""yid"", regardless of context, and I'm afraid that you don't get to tell them otherwise just because you want to use it in a football-related chant; however much you may think that yid is a ""huge thing"" for Spurs, I can promise you that the legacy of anti-Semitism is a huger thing for Jews, and grappling with it is an ongoing and far more difficult process.

I think the club's response was very measured and appropriately respectful both of the history of the word ""yid"", its more recent usage within the context of Tottenham, and the multitude of complicated feelings both Jewish supporters and non-Jewish supporters have with respect to its continued usage.  And I like /u/MadArend's proposed means of addressing the subject in a careful and non-terrifying way that can be supplemented when children become older.  We should be *really* careful before we tell people to just suck up their feelings in response to a word with centuries of hateful connotation, just so a bunch of football fans can chant something during a match.",0,1395441364,null,0,false,0,cg8mzsm,t3_2108ka,t1_cg8mzsm,t1_cg8iiqf,null,1433011804,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

&gt;

&gt;""__Dalek__"" is the sixth [episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [first series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)) of British [science fiction television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) programme *[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast on 30 April 2005. This episode is the first appearance of the Daleks in the 21st century revival of *Doctor Who*; it also marks the first appearance of [Bruno Langley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Langley) as [companion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) [Adam Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mitchell_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;The episode is set in [Utah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah) in the year 2012, in the underground bunker owned by [Henry van Statten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_villains#Henry_van_Statten), a rich collector of alien artifacts. The Doctor encounters his one living exhibit: a creature called ""the Metaltron"", which the Doctor is horrified to discover is a surviving Dalek. When the Dalek escapes, the Doctor races against time to stop it from getting to the surface and wreaking havoc on humanity.

Secondly, If you are giving them money, (that is not specifically for a deposit) you should expect them to enjoy this money. They might see this as, a retirement pot, alternatively, they might see it as a pot for travelling or a new car. But that isn't a negative, they aren't wasting their money they just aren't buying what you wanted them too.

You might see a round the world trip as a waste of money, but your child might want that more than Xk towards a house.

Personally, I would give them stocks and shares with a small amount of cash, this way, you can see compound growth for at least 18 years, keeping the account in your name, then when you are ready, transfer it to them, its a bit harder to spend wastefully, as its not easily accessible, and chances are they will have the knowledge that in 10 years it will be worth even more.

true,DontMuchTooThink,null,null,"&gt; I think that if you are wanting them to have it as a deposit for a house, save in your own name and give them a nice surprise whenever they buy it.

This is pretty much what I would like to happen.

&gt; You seem to have it planned that they will buy at 25, but you never know, they might buy when they are 21, or 35 and no account will, account for that. 

Agreed. And I'm completely fine with that. I just don't see them buying at 18, which is when they would gain full control over the money.

&gt; Secondly, If you are giving them money, (that is not specifically for a deposit) you should expect them to enjoy this money. They might see this as, a retirement pot, alternatively, they might see it as a pot for travelling or a new car. But that isn't a negative, they aren't wasting their money they just aren't buying what you wanted them too.

I'm hoping that I won't have to save for 20 years to be able to help them with costs of travel or a car. House deposit (2 if each of the twins would end up buying one) on the other hand isn't something I will be able to scrap together in short period of time.

&gt; You might see a round the world trip as a waste of money, but your child might want that more than Xk towards a house.

That's why I'd rather prefer if they didn't know the money existed in the first place. Nice surprise when they finally decide to get a house (if).

&gt; Personally, I would give them stocks and shares with a small amount of cash, this way, you can see compound growth for at least 18 years, keeping the account in your name, then when you are ready, transfer it to them, its a bit harder to spend wastefully, as its not easily accessible, and chances are they will have the knowledge that in 10 years it will be worth even more.

Do you mean a stock and shares ISA in my name for example?

&gt;Road traffic self report collision form - Form 207

&gt;This form has been provided to allow drivers/ riders/ cyclists to self-report such cases where police did not attend the scene. It is emphasised that the completed form **must be handed in to a police station** and date stamped accordingly.

&gt;Our road traffic collision / accident form (form 207) can be downloaded from our related publications section of this page.

&gt;This must be done as soon as is practicable and in any event **within 24 hours of the accident** in order to assist any possible investigation and to comply with the law.

&gt;Upon receipt of the form you will then be sent a letter acknowledging receipt and explaining what will happen next.

[LFGSS - What to do in case of an accident](http://www.lfgss.com/thread4213.html) (relevant stuff about CCTV)

[LCC - How to report dangerous driving](http://lcc.org.uk/articles/how-to-report-dangerous-driving) (Contact details for buses. Possibly too slow)

I think all buses have CCTV facing forwards to enforce bus lanes, but I'm not (at all) sure. In any case you need to act fast to try and find out what they have, and get a copy. You have a right to any CCTV footage with yourself in it. It's called a subject access request and has nothing to do with the fact that there was a collision. I don't know if it's a good idea to do such a request, or just to tell them they need to sit on the footage for the benefit of the police. Or both.

I found an [FOI request of Bus registration plates](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/fleet_list_for_london_buses) - it's a bit out of date (there may be newer ones around), but it might have the reg of the bus on it allowing you to find out which company is responsible, hopefully speeding things up enough to get the video (if it even exists).

I normally invest direct, say Baillie Gifford, and there is often a hefty charge to use their ISA service, so I stick to the 'Share plans' - If needs be, I can sell off at the end of the tax year, maxing my capital gains, and then do the same a few days later in the next tax year.  (But yeah some share plan in your own name, I think also you can add a designation to each account, and label it with their initials - not 100% sure though)

You will be liable for taxation on the difference between the amount you acquired them at and the amount you sell them at. So since you will never sell them, it won't bother you if it is taxable. And then when you gift to your children, that is the value they acquire them at, and they have already had 25 years of growth, so they sell them a year or two later and the growth won't be as much, and likely fall under capital gains allowance.

Another point is that you cannot claim a capital loss in S&amp;S, you and your SO may be able to do this and offset some capital gains during your ownership of the children's shares.

Take a look at the trusts you may be interested in, and eye up the costs. It may pay to buy outside the ISA until the amount is much larger, then transfer. (But you are liable for capital gains when you transfer, (Bed &amp; isa I think))

But reading what you've said, I would recommend this method, namely shares of some sort in your own name, they will have no idea until you announce it to them!

If you head into the city centre for a night out, the Cellar's quite grimey but usually has decent nights on (think house/DnB), The Wheatsheaf is a nice little pub that usually has bands playing, the house bar is another cocktail bar just down the alley from Wheatsheaf, and the King's Arms at the bottom or Broad street also a great pub.

If you venture as far as the Cowley road, there's an Irish pub called the Black Swan - tell them Conor sent you - and a few nice restaurants, especially the Aziz or the Majliss for authentic Indian/Bangaldeshi cuisine and a vintage shop called Reign which can be worth checking out.

Daytime activities - take a stroll in Port Meadow (just next to Jericho) or University Parks which is right outside Keble, or Christchurch Meadows off Aldate Street. Little Clarendon street also has some nice restuarants and a vintage shop (called Uncle Sam or something similar, in case youre feeling homesick). Go check out the castle, the museums, the art gallery on St Ebbe's (next to Westgate) and I'd recommend Mission Burrito if you get hungry. Great munch in there.

It's a website for a radio station, I hazard a guess that 90% of the people coming to the site are there to find a programme to listen to.  Yet the organization of the programmes is completely un-intuitive. 
The website is obviously put together by people that never listen to the station and who never have to use the website.  The original Radio4 website was far more functional.  The whole point of URL's was to take hideous incomprehensible computer code madness and turn it into something that is accessible to a human.
For example.
bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers 
is transposed to 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr
completely useless, unless you are a machine.  pathetic!

Equally something that was obvious easy and intuitive
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/drama
Is now just a 404 page.
Substitute all the obvious for equally hideous results.

A nice touch would be to arrange drama programs by length of programme.

Also to allow the schedule page to be arranged so the current day is the  last day so all currently available programs are conveniently displayed on one page.

All obvious stuff if you used the site on a regular basis.

true,gregzorian,flair8,,"I agree I think the club's response what great. I don't think the police would be doing the right thing if they didn't let Spurs fans say it. 

It's obviously a hard thing to explain to a child, but so is parenting. There are challenges in life. You have to overcome them.

It's easy to say ""this word has centuries of Jewish persecution attached to it"" or ""the legacy of anti-semitism is a huger thing for Jews"". Playing that card disguises the issue. It's not the history of anti-semitism vs. the history of the yid chant at white hart lane. You have to really look at how the word is being used and the specific context. What is actually happening here? Here, no one is calling anyone else a yid. There is a group of people who, doing what they have done for many years, call themselves yids (this was actually what stopped other people from calling them yids in an insulting way). This is what is happening.

So when a Jew says he is offended by it, it just doesn't make any sense. No one is even talking to him. The spurs chant of yid is in a way showing pride in being Jewish.

When you say ""We should be really careful before we tell people to just suck up their feelings in response to a word with centuries of hateful connotation, just so a bunch of football fans can chant something during a match"" you again disguise the issue. It's not just ""chanting something during a match"" and being ""a bunch of football fans"" doesn't lessen the cause. This is a free speech issue, and it can have big ramifications down the line. Furthermore, I know my language was sort exaggerated and lazy in my post above, but I thought it was clear that I didn't mean they should ""just suck up their feelings"". I was saying that they should understand that it's important for people in a country to say things that offend other people. Also more generally, there are difficulties in life, and you have to overcome them. This difficulty in particular (this issue of explaning it to a kid) I think is quite easy to overcome. Obviously you don't try to explain the holocaust or the magnitude of it to a little kid. They won't understand, and we all know that. You shouldn't even tell them what happened. We all know this. All you have to do is say yid is a bad word to say to someone, don't call them that. It really is easy. Tell your child it is a swear word.

Also, I think I said it somewhere above, the spurs fans chanting yid stopped them from being verbally abused by opposing fans. And know it's looked at negatively?

Also, I mentioned above, this is a free speech issue. I don't want to say that free speech goes down the drain if we ban this chant, because it doesn't, but people should realize that it is important to defend your freedoms.

To summarize, I really don't understand why people are getting offended by this is the first place. Moreover, I don't think this amount of offense, even if it were justified (which I still deny), is enough to merit censorship of a tradition.

EDIT: I also think that some people like to say they feel offended because it gives them a feeling of empowerment. I don't think is that common though.",0,1395447713,null,0,false,0,cg8pjev,t3_2108ka,t1_cg8pjev,t1_cg8mzsm,null,1433013002,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK, so how about I break down the reasoning behind that law for you? Yeah? Lets do that.

Power requirements:

Incandescent (traditional light bulbs) - ~60W    
Compact Fluoro (mercury) - ~15W    
LED - ~ 8W (falling all the time)    

from that maybe you can aleady see the reasoning? no?

consider this;

If everyone in the UK who watches Eastenders (~8million people) on a typical night, switched just ONE lightbulb from Incandescent to CFL, that's a net saving for that one hour of 360 megawatts.

See why they're doing it now?

No? 

Europe is coming up on an energy crisis. Demand is rising quickly and new powerstations are not being brought online fast enough to increase capacity to fulfill this new demand. 

Although the production of CFLs are technically more environmentally unfriendly, the reduced power consumption is VASTLY helpful in buying governments time to build new powerplants.

All CFL's are are a stop gap for LED's, which when the regulations were introduced were not cost effective for the average consumer. This is changing rapidly and as such are being more widely adopted further driving down price.




Not so insignificant now is it?


How about in future you actually educate yourself on issues before bringing them up?  I'm rather confident most of your problems with the EU that are rational could be explained in a similar way.

true,maybelying,null,null,"I had an idea in my head about introducing the Valeyard following the events of DotD.  The Valeyard was supposed to be an incarnation comprised of some of the Doctor's darkest elements, and the original destruction of Gallifrey certainly contributed to the Doctor's darkness.

With that history being re-written to one where Gallifrey was saved instead of destroyed, the Doctor found redemption - however, perhaps in forking his timeline away from that previous reality, elements of that old timeline remain.  Perhaps the darkness that was cast away with his new found redemption doesn't actually go away, but somehow manifests itself into a version of the Doctor that lacks that sense of redemption and has only the painful history that was left behind.

The self-loathing, the bitterness, the regret - all of it concentrated in a shadow of the Doctor's actual person, looking on at the real Doctor living his new life.

A little convoluted, and doesn't mesh with the *Gallifrey-was-never-destroyed-they-just-forgot* view that I personally reject, but there it is.

At any rate, I've posted before in previous threads that I doubt we'll see the Valeyard return.  Particularly since TotD basically negated NotD after the Time Lords rewrote his future, and it was in the battle of Trenzalore on the NotD time line that he was supposed to be known as the Valeyard.

They can wipe stuff like that so easily with a little computer magic so why didn't they? If I was Dalton I might be cringing a bit seeing myself on screen spittle flying. Probably he couldn't help it, had a bad set of dentures in or something, but still I feel it was a bit disrespectful not to do something about that. I mean he was playing Rassilon (or some variant on) besides. He should have looked totally elegant and deadly, and instead his performance was completely overshadowed by his flying spit? Not cool.

The buildings cost a fifth of that (about the same as they received for selling off television centre in London). The £900m quoted by the trust was the figures for everything to do with the move including running costs to 2030. I'm afraid I can't say how this compares to the London costs. 

But to answer your question, yes, I think it is reasonable for the BBC to be run by it's management and answerable to their board. I don't think it's unreasonable to decide to change the layout of a couple of floors in a new building when, a year and a half after moving in, you decide that you want to use the space in a different way.

But that still leaves you with a healthy surplus. If your employer has a pension scheme and makes employers' contributions to it, then it might be worth putting some of your salary into a pension, as otherwise you're saying no to free money. Plus the government will put the tax you paid on your contributions into the pension.

Beyond that, it's probably best to do two things:

1. Make sure you have a 4-6 months' income stored in some sort of instant access account
2. Decide what you want to save for, and over what time horizon(s), to enable what level of volatility you are willing to take on in your investments. 

For example: If you want to build up a deposit to buy a house in four years' time, then you would want a low-volatility investment, probably involving putting your money into a cash savings account. Your money will increase, but at a slow and steady rate. 

But if you're saving for the long term (say 25+ years), then it would actually be worth taking on some volatility now -- say a S&amp;S ISA holding a portfolio with quite a high equities balance. This is likely to return a much bigger return in the long run, but there is no guarantee that your savings will have increased in the short term.

Of course it's perfectly sensible to have multiple financial objectives, and I actually invest my money in all four of the ways I've described (pension, long-term investment, house deposit, emergency funds).

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"I agree Bertrand would be a good signing. But I think this only happens if Chelsea get Luke Shaw. I'm not sure we need a right back, though. Having Bacuna attack from deep works well for us because he can't be marked in that position (much like Bale under Redknapp), and defensively he's not so bad. Provided El Ahmadi (or whoever is playing the defensive role in midfield) does his job, there should always be cover for Bacuna if he pushes forward. Defensively, we're not actually that bad.

I disagree with your assessment of the width we have though. There is zero lack of width in this team, dude. Bacuna, Bertrand, Albrighton, Agbonlahor, Weimann, even Bennett, Luna and Lowton. All capable wide players. And realistically, since we have a counterattacking style, we have to defend narrow. The players we have now are probably a better fit than if we were to go out and buy a proper winger (unless said winger would provide more goals than Gabby/Weimann).

The real problem, imo, is that we have a ""broken team"". There is no solid link between attack and defence, which is why almost all our goals come from counterattacks.

There are two ways to address this imo:

1 - get a playmaker to play ahead of Delph and Westwood, and link play (mostly for when we face teams who sit back against us, against better teams, we stick with the current setup)

2 - get a defensive midfielder to free up Delph to play the link role. As much as I like Delph, I think he is best served in a box-to-box role, but there is no reason he couldn't be the link player. He's probably the most technically gifted player in the squad at the moment, and is clearly an inventive, creative player.

I imagine option 2 might be the one the board pushes for, since a defensive midfielder will likely be cheaper than a playmaker. But I'm still holding out hope for option 1 with a Kiyotake signing. Nurenburg are having a bad season and could get relegated...

tl;dr - hope Chelsea get Luke Shaw, and Nuremburg get relegated, so we can get Bertrand and Kiyotake.",0,1395488954,null,0,false,0,cg8zpzy,t3_20p9jp,t1_cg8zpzy,t1_cg5j9td,null,1433017933,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

true,Boiiing,null,null,"It's always good to be open to new ideas like that. But I would not start a SIPP for the children unless I was pretty wealthy and therefore also in a position to give each of them substantial financial help in their 20s.

Your goal is not to have a maturing pot of cash for them at age 17/18, right? You have said you would maybe let them have it at 21 once they've grown up a bit. Maybe you want to get them a deposit on a flat when they've started working and in order to get enough salary to support a mortgage they will need a career to have started first - maybe looking at 25 to 30.
 
But by opening a SIPP in their names, you are building a pot of money for them to access at 57 (per this week's budget, though it will inevitably be a higher age in 57 years time). By that time they will have already gone through every major event and emergency in their life - self funded. 


So what you are buying them, is the ability to know, in their 20s, that their pension has already been kicked off for them and if they don't put much away from their salary between the ages of 20 and 30 it won't matter too much. 


So at age 22 they leave uni and embark upon a career path. Probably wouldn't have been putting money into a pension then anyway - other priorities with a small paycheck and no emergency savings, and although pension contributions are a generally smart idea, a percent of your salary as an intern or junior employee age 22, even with annual growth, is not anywhere near as good as putting a percent in as a manager on a doubled salary a few years later...

By 25, we would of course want them to be thinking about retirement and putting something away each month (inside or outside of a pension wrapper). But as the pension already exists, they have a safety net, and what they don't have is a house deposit, so they will skimp on making pension contributions themselves to put extra savings towards a house deposit. 

The speed at which they can grow that house deposit is limited to what is available from their salary that was otherwise going to go into pension. If they put zero into the pension between 25 and 30, instead of a couple of hundred pounds a month, they might build up a sum of money in five years to get them 15k nearer towards a house deposit than they would otherwise have been with ordinary savings alone. Meanwhile if you had not locked all their money away forever, they might have already had a 30k house deposit in their hand by age 25.

Also, this safety net you are building for them, this retirement wealth. They may be inspired to add to it. But they do not have a house, or car, or diamond engagement ring for their honey, and their retirement is OK to ignore for a bit. So they will take money that would have gone into their workplace pension and build up a savings stash. In forgoing the workplace pension, they miss the free employer matching which would have been worth several percent of their salary per year. 

I would not do this. You should not do this. Get them a shares based investment in bare trust that belongs to them and whose growth has benefited from them not being taxpayers over the years, and at age 18 decide whether or not to tell them about it and what it is for. 

Or if you have sufficient annual ISA capacity between you and other half to save tax free in your own names, do that, and have even more flexibility. 

Or if you are age 30+ and have pension capacity, consider putting more into your own pensions with the express intention of taking out in 30 years and gifting to them at that point. It may be too late to help them with Uni costs or a wedding or anything else that happens to them in their 20s, but it will help them buy a house or take a very nice holiday when they have grown out of Club 18-30.",0,1395490632,null,0,false,0,cg8zzrg,t3_20zi85,t1_cg8zzrg,t1_cg8b29n,null,1433018061,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The 201k is the one I'm going to use as a workhorse. 

Two reasons,  first they are going on display in my kitchen window, it leads onto the street and the people round here take real pride in their window displays, I am going to have three of them with the lids off in rotation with little cards giving the history of them.  The third one is going to be a early very ornate hand cranked but I need to find one with perfect decal, I have my eye on a Jones but need to hunt one down. 

The other reason I need something that will power through very thick material, such as canvas, I have a imported all metal modern machine from America that can theoretically do it but it's a lot less stressful to have a beast that can eat through it without thinking. 

Vintage machines are *awesome* I do not understand why someone would buy a really shitty machine made of plastic for £100 which absolutely will not go though denim without screaming and chewing,  when you can pick these up for so little. (I'm sure you know I paid  a lot  for mine but I got stung by needing home delivery which is in a different price bracket to buyer collects, those go from £25-£40). The fact is that you don't really need anything other than straight stitch for most work, especially clothing,  and you can get feet for vintage machine that do hemming, binding, gathering, buttonholes, zips and so on.

The best part is that there are only  few parts on it, if they are all working when you buy the machine then short,  of taking a hammer to it it's not going to break down. ",0,1395491007,null,0,false,0,cg90210,t3_211dcs,t1_cg90210,t1_cg8xviw,null,1433018091,1,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,1

&gt;Martinez has completely changed how we use full backs. Both now have the permission to attack at the same time as McCarthy and Barry fill in there.        
Moyes always wanted Baines to get forward but given the opportunity, he preferred his right backs more defensive and would play Neville or Hibbert there over Coleman who was stuck further up as a winger.           
Coleman got a lot more time at right back last season but that only seemed to come about with Neville moving to CM (urgh!) and Hibbert on the decline.

true,happybeing,null,null,"It gets a lot of criticism, but it's not clear to me that their are better alternatives. It relies on people taking responsibility, which means some people take advantage, but that alone is not bad if overall it turns out to be more efficient, or less restrictive. Some will behave irresponsibly, but that doesn't mean we should treat everyone like children. Some need to see responsible behaviors to adopt them. Some in to defy authority, the system etc, before making it better. I certainly have. 

On this I'm not persuaded one way or the other, because I'm unhappy with the impact of pay for everything subscription models and DRM. These end up putting money as the highest good, which is actually harmful because undermines the original purpose of licensing and copyright (which is to reward and encourage creativity for the benefit of all rather than to enrich a few - though the latter may be an acceptable side effect).

Such restrictions get adopted because those who benefit most from them use their influence to ensure this happens, while those who lose out are generally unaware, or if they do object, go unheard because a wealthy few have more influence on policy. 

I only came to really understand this, something I've felt for a long time, while listening to [Cory Doctorow on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZqodxGufR8#t=875)  yesterday, where he laid out the severe dangers we face from two directions: loss of privacy (Google, NSA etc), and loss of freedom (internet ""filters"", digital rights management etc), both of which are acting to curtail freedoms, or put another way, to enslave us for the benefit of slave masters.

I realise that language sounds so extreme, paranoid etc, but I'm not one for groundless conspiracy theories. Bad things have happened in the past, no one can deny that, and the reason is that people did not face the awfulness that was approaching until it was too late. What's the worst that could happen if we ignore this? Just look at history.

Northern Ireland is on a long road to being transferred to the Republic and the NI Executive only exists as a way of making that transition as smooth as possible. It is also worth noting that Northern Ireland has very little influence in Parliament, which is where my problems with Scotland come in.

Scotland had a system set up to give Scots who feel like they're not listened to by HM Government a bigger say in how their country is governed. The problem is that Scotland has so much influence in Westminster yet Westminster is having increasingly less influence in Scotland. This leads to England feeling like it is being governed by Scotland. Michael Gove is the Secretary of State for Education, yet he only really has power in England while Scots still get to hold him to account. The other problem is that the Unicameral legislature they have in Scotland allows Salmond to run the place like a dictatorship.

The devolution they have in Wales I can't really complain about, it works for Wales and it works for the United Kingdom.

**In your name / partner's name - using capacity in your own tax wrapper**

&gt; Option 1) Stocks and Shares ISA ""investment ISA"" in your name(s). Note, cash ISA is not suitable for this timescale due to inability to beat inflation.

For this tax year ending in a couple of weeks you have about 12k of ISA wrapper, each, which can be S&amp;S or a mixture of cash and S&amp;S. That's 24k. Did you use it all up? 

On 6 April you will get access to the 2014/15 allowance. That will be another 12k each, another 24k between you. Was announced in the budget this week that the 12k per person for 2014/15 tax year will be increasing to 15k although they can't implement that until July this year, but basically your 24 between you will go up to 30. So in this calendar year alone you can fit 24 (2013/14)+30 (2014/15) = 54k. Enough capacity to put money aside for the kids and all dividends, interest and gains will be tax free. 

But you are right that this type of wrapper will be viewed as your own assets for means testing.

&gt; 2) More pension assets in your name(s)

Significant benefit over ISAs if one of you is a high rate taxpayer now and expects to be on a lower marginal rate in retirement. Smaller benefit if both are low rate taxpayers, but an element of it is expected to still escape tax presuming '25% tax free lump sum' on retirement still exists. Also if you die before taking the pension the pot is bigger than the ISA pot would be because it's gross of tax, and the income tax won't be paid by the beneficiary so tax is escaped.

Further advantage over ISA is that pension assets will not be counted if you are means tested or if you are being chased by creditors in a bankruptcy or IVA. They are likely still counted in a divorce. 

The obvious downside is you can't get them back until you are 55, 57 or whatever the age is when you get to that stage of your life. So if you are 25 now you won't have the cash in hand to give your kids when they themselves are 25.

**In the child's name - using capacity in their tax free wrappers**

&gt; 1) Junior S&amp;S ISA (not cash ISA)

Junior ISA gives you 3.7k capacity per child for this tax year and a further 3.8k capacity from 6 April, without using your own limits and without counting as your own assets for means tested benefits.

Downside they can control ISA at 16, access proceeds of it at 18.

&gt; 2) Personal pension / Junior SIPP

In this way they can't touch it at 18 (although they can of course control it and gamble it away on high risk stocks if they wanted). They also can't touch it at 21, 25, 30, 40, 50 to help deal with whatever life milestones they want. They can touch it when the government allow them, which will be at least 57 but perhaps by the time they get there, 60+ 

Unlike using your own pension wrapper, there isn't the same tax saving potential as getting a gross up for high rate tax now and only paying basic tax in retirement. They only get a gross up for low rate tax now. And who knows, they might be high rate in retirement for all you know. 

The other advantage of being ignored for means testing might be of use to them but as the cash itself is no use to them during the best 60 years of their life that's not something that they'd see as a benefit. Just means they can take the foot of the gas: put a bit less into their own pension plan to tryto build up savings slightly quicker. Certainly not as useful as having cash for e.g. university at 18, relocating for a job at 21, getting married at 25, buying a house at 30.

**Could I just ignore the tax wrappers?**

They do not have jobs so are not tax payers anyway so can receive 10k of income every year without needing a wrapper. Even if they were lower rate taxpayers in the first few years out of university they would not pay tax on dividend income because of the tax credit. You would hope they make significant capital gains on a stock market investment over 20 years but this can be managed by taking the resulting proceeds in stages so that they make use of the annual capital gains allowance which would otherwise go unused anyway. 

So, I wouldn't get hung up on the tax wrappers even though it sounds eminently sensible to use the child's tax wrapper first and only go unwrapped if you run out of space. If you don't trust child /don't have spare ISA capacity yourself - comments about not paying tax on dividends as a basic rate taxpayer, and having an annual capital gains tax allowance, might also be applicable to you or wife.

One advantage of investing in their name but outside tax wrappers is that from time to time you may find more flexible or lower cost savings and investment products, for example a high interest children's saver special promo cash account that pays more than the equivalent cash isa.

Also, you should be doing this long term investment via stock market linked products, however you might find some kindly family member like a granny or an uncle would like to contribute but naively doesn't believe in the stock market or in the particular investment strategy you adopt. A child cannot have more than one ISA at a time (although the total subscriptions can increase each year). You could allow the granny or the uncle to contribute to the ISA every so often, while you go off and do a completely different thing.

An example of investing outside an ISA for the long term is one of the various ""children's investment plans"" offered by investment managers, often through their investment trust products. An example from F&amp;C [here](http://www.fandc.com/uk/private-investors/savings-plans/savings-plans-range/childrens-investment-plan/). 

As you are not using anyone's tax wrapper you have the choice of running:

- a 'designated account' where it is technically your money in case of emergency, and will be taxed as your money until you officially gift it to the child at 18 (or any point you choose after 18)  but the child's name or initials is stamped on the account so you can remember who you're trying to save for.

- a 'bare trust' where you and 1-3 other parties acknowledge that it has been gifted to the child right now (so is taxed as the child and owned by them at 18) but is held in your joint adult names because children cannot legally own shares.

If you adopt the latter approach (bare trust), and simply don't tell the child you are doing it, you might get away with hiding it from them for a bit longer than 18 (although it raises moral questions!). It also means it is in the name of joint trustees until that point - whereas if it is simply a designated account or in you or the wife's own names, you can pull out the cash and spend it down the pub, much to the rage and fury of your wife and her family if they didn't agree with that.

If you adopt the former approach, designated account, you might wonder why you would bother looking for something like that when you could just do your own investment plan with any number of providers and mentally allocate 10% or whatever for the child. One reason you might do this is costs and minimum contribution limits. 

Many investment platforms allow an adult to invest £500 lump sums or say £50 per month by direct debit into products designed for adults. Their equivalent products designed for children allow £25 a month or £100 or £250 single contributions and are therefore more accessible to someone who is less well off. Sometimes the ongoing annual fixed or percentage-based fees can also be lower. 

However if you are looking at children's investment plans, whether inside or outside a child's ISA, do consider what the admin fees could add up to. If you are only contributing £25 a month, a £12.50 flat annual admin fee in month 12 is a significant percentage hit in the first year. You would be better with someone charging percentage based fees only, if you can find one, while the amounts are tiny. Slightly better the second year. If you already have £2k+ in there it's only half a percent so still annoying but as the plan could have moved in value by 20% it is not the end of the world. If you were using a provider like that you would be better not running separate £25 pm accounts, and instead contribute £100 a month into a bigger account and sharing it between child 1, child 2, mum and dad with still only one admin fee on the account.

&gt;Trusts

A 'bare trust' mentioned above is simply one person holding assets for another in their legal name but the other person is the beneficiary. So account name ""DontMuchTooThink and Wife as Trustee for the benefit of ChildOne"". Every bit of income belongs exclusively to the child and he has the absolute right to it at age 18. That is the true beneficial ownership and it is respected by welfare offices, creditors and the taxman. And your investment provider will set it up for you by filling out a form when applying for the account, no charge.

If you want something more complex, like a discretionary family trust where the amounts get paid out in a non-fixed sharing ratio at some point down the line in the trustees discretion, it is more complex. 

Some have said you can get sample trust deeds quite cheaply which is true. But most would agree it does need advice and is not so straightforward. You want to understand whether the grantor/settlor (you), the beneficiary (child 1, child 2, child x), or the trust itself will pay tax. You could hold all sorts of things in it from savings accounts to the family home, but sounds like this is way overkill. 

If your affairs are not complex and your family estate is not huge, you just want to put a bit of cash away from time to time for uni fees or a house deposit in 2040, I would ignore any trust that you can't DIY in 30 seconds. Too many child investment plans and child isas exist off the shelf for free, for you to think about paid-for trust arrangements unless you are looking at proper estate planning.

I went to a lecture recently given by a network security professor and ambassador at a GCHQ centre of excellence on the guardian leaks. They really did have no idea what they were showing. Pictures in particular are incredibly dangerous to publish if you don't understand what you're talking about, for example they published the circuitboard for spying on desktops, which, if it happens to be found in some foreign leader's computer, can now be traced back to GCHQ.

Even more sensitive was the picture of the intercepted cryptofax from the EU's DC outpost, as while it may seem innocuous the slanted nature of the text shows to an expert that a Tempest attack was used- meaning someone broke into the EU outpost and damaged the electromagnetic shielding on the fax machine.

Wow, that is one hastily constructed strawman you're burning there. Systems exist for more important reasons than tradition.  How about if the people of Scotland chose to have a death penalty and their politicians voted in favour of it?  Should it be allowed then, or would that still be because of ""tradition""?

Doesn't a single parliament in London exist because of ""tradition""?  Should we reconsider its role, given that the needs of the nation are subject to...

&gt; continually change and are a function of technology and progress

Or is the single parliament model required because of the weather, which is apparently one of the few things that would justify constitutional change.  Rather than, say, the varying needs of the populace?

On a side note - democracy (and internet forums) exist because people disagree with each other.  That's a good thing.  Can you imaging how awful the world would be if everyone thought that you were right all the time?  
Being abusive and treating people as though they're not a smart as you just because they disagree with your opinions, doesn't make you at all impressive.

true,bonew23,null,null,"Recognizing that you have to pay your bills is important, whether it's your rent or your taxes. Those who refuse to pay 1 likely refuse to pay the other as well. If someone doesn't respect basic private property rights, do you think it is likely that they respect the governments property rights, or their right to collect taxes? No. 

The overlap can easily be seen from comments on the articles and videos on this issue. The article is about the Council supposedly trying to evict someone, which means it is a council house and not a private let. Do we think that not paying rent on our social housing is smart? They're not screwing over a fat cat, they're screwing over those who want to actually help.

Greece's problems stem from many issues, such as their utterly inept government, their massively bloated public sector, their economy that was growing unsustainably quickly. But the one issue that is relevant to this discussion is that a sizeable group of people felt they didn't need to bother paying the taxes they owe. It was a cultural problem that was present in all classes of society, from rich to poor. The government spent a lot of money and didn't collect enough. Their tax collectors were lame ducks because the public would have voted the politicians out had the taxman actually started collecting what was owed. 

People are quick to jump up and yell about tax avoidance in this country, but the difference is the scale and the acceptability of it. People try and hide their dodgy tricks in this country, celebrities that are caught have to fake an apology and renounce their ways. In Greece corruption and tax avoidance was just blatant.

Agree with the rest of your post but don't agree with that statement. Willian has been more of a team player and defends a lot more than Schurrle which hinders his attacking movement, but he will adapt to that and be a much more potent threat next season. Schurrle's role is different to Willian's since he is traditionally a striker while Willian is a midfielder. If you watched Willian for Shakhtar you wouldn't have said Schurrle is better at attacking. Willian can do things Schurrle can only dream of; hence why we paid £32m for Willian and £17m for Schurrle.

Personally, I don't even know that I'll be able to come back next year despite how desperately I want it, because I DON'T have all this money that you assume that I have. My father, even if he were to consent to help me with payment of my education, which I assure you he doesn't, earned negative money last year, with a total ""income"" of about $6500 while even more money went into equipment and repairs to keep the business running. 

And I, unfortunately, spent all of the money I had saved to pay for this year, so if I can't magic up another $21,000, then I won't be back for my ""fucking arse-hole-y subject"" that I chose to study because I bloody love the subject! 

Additionally, in response to your ""other far cheaper and possibly better options"", I say, ""no."" No, there were not better and cheaper options for me. I'm from America, where university is more than twice the cost for even a decent education. The only thing better is that it would be easier for me to get loans in order to saddle myself with debt. I would also have had to be nearer to my father and family, which would be enormously detrimental to my health, which is already suffering six time zones away from them. 

Go away, and stick your prejudice and overgeneralisations where the sun doesn't shine, because there are some of us who are struggling and suffering enormously to be here, to try to get away from our pasts and build a better future, some of us who have been horribly abused and damaged, but still continue to strive for hope.",0,1395499881,null,0,false,0,cg92bln,t3_1zt6u1,t1_cg92bln,t1_cfxgh4y,null,1433019158,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

Also that's a really poor excuse in my opinion because Willian has had plenty of chances to score goals and provide assists but failed to do so, him defending shouldn't have that much of an impact on his natural ability.

You're right, I didn't watch Willian for Shakhtar. I can only go off what he's shown during his time here and what I've seen is someone who has fantastic close control and could probably take on the entire team like Hazard does but for some reason chooses not to and who also messes up simple final passes (Who can forget the two games in a row where he had 8 chances in total to play the final pass and messes all of them up, 2 were box standards ones as well like Schurrle's pass to Eto'o today) and scuffs his shots. He'll improved once he gets used to the team, league, etc obviously but that's just what I've seen as of right now.

Willian is a better teamplayer, not questioning that one bit but if we want to be a clinical counter attacking team then he has no place in the starting line up ahead of Schurrle as far as I'm concerned.

Q2: I think you'll finish either 5th or 6th and you're more than likely going out against Bayern, though you never know... stranger things have happened.

Q3: Not being local or going to games (born &amp; bred a sweaty sock) I'm not really too bothered about the move to the new stadium, if we can get decent attendance then the extra money/income will surely be good for the club.

Q4: Allardyce can be a decent manager at times, though when we first signed him I wasn't at all impressed, but he's proven to me that there's more to his repertoire than just hoicking it up the pitch.

Q5: Ravel could be a great player, he could also just as easily fade into insignificance, he's been loaned out to QPR because he was disruptive to the squad and that's something we really could do without right now.

Q6: Ask me this in about 6 weeks for a definitive answer, though I think Adrian has been a solid signing and is hopefully here to stay, as for the worst I honestly couldn't say right now.

Q7: Not seen enough of any of them in the senior team to comment tbh.

Q8: Hopefully a solid top 10 finish without the usual scrapping in the relegation zone.

Q9: Adrian, Tomkins, Collins, Reid, Armero, Noble, Diame, Downing, Nolan, Jarvis, Carroll.

seems you cant understand how, both countries cannot be correct having wildly differing policies on something when they are so similarly structured and indifferent as a population.

if the death penalty (for example) worked for the greater good overall then it would be wrong not to implement it elsewhere, if it didn't work it would be wrong to implement it somewhere.

What I agree with is Schurrle gets into better attacking positions than Willian, but let me assure you that Schurrle has wasted just as many chances, if not more over the course of the season. Its because he's recently scored a hat trick and a goal now that people are overlooking his other shocking misses and chances, especially from outside the box on the left wing. 

Also, Willian does defender better than Schurrle. He is always great at tracking the full-back's run as well as tackling - even remember Gary Neville suggesting satirically that Willian might be the best tackler in the team given how well he wins the ball back - and that's not an excuse for poor attacking prowess, but what is a good excuse is that its his first season in the league and needs time to calibrate himself. 

&gt;Also Schurrle wasn't offside any more than our other players.

Not true. We had 6 offsides in total and Schurrle was offside at least 3-4 times. Similar stats vs Gala.

At least Schurrle gets into the positions where he can miss them, that's something that's been lacking from Willian all season and is why we look devoid of ideas when Hazard is not playing well. 

Oh, I agree Willian is a good defender. I've said myself on here he would be far better off in midfield than attacking mid. I do however think there are different ways of defending. Willian's style which is running around and getting stuck in wherever and whenever will naturally get more plaudits, that's not the way Schurrle defends. He covers gaps, watches runners and only presses when necessary. He focuses on intercepting rather than tackling. Now I don't know if that's Jose telling him to do that or just the way he is, either way it's not really fair to compare his style to Willian's because both get the job done at the end of the day, it just comes down to a matter of preference. Also,  Let's not forget that Schurrle has played left back for us quite a few times this season (Not started there, I mean he's moved there during the match), Jose wouldn't put him there if he didn't have faith in his defending. 

Fair enough, I thought Salah was off more than Schurrle but to be honest I was too happy to care. I think our whole team need to work on being onside more to be honest, either that or we should be making that final pass a lot quicker.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; Also that's a really poor excuse in my opinion because Willian has had plenty of chances to score goals and provide assists but failed to do so

.

&gt;At least Schurrle gets into the positions where he can miss them, that's something that's been lacking from Willian all season

You can't have it both ways mate.

&gt;Willian's style which is running around and getting stuck in wherever and whenever will naturally get more plaudits, that's not the way Schurrle defends. He covers gaps, watches runners and only presses when necessary.

While that's true, I was referring more about defending on the counter/when the opposite team attacks. Schurrle usually tends to arrive late to defend because he is so invested in attacking. 

&gt; either way it's not really fair to compare his style to Willian's because both get the job done at the end of the day

Not entirely true, because Willian has been starting every game for which he's been available over Schurrle. Again, I'm not saying Schurrle can't defend, I'm saying Willian is just better at it and hence tends to play a more withdrawn role which hampers his attacking ability. If you noticed, Oscar and Hazard were playing a more withdrawn role today and instead Schurrle was playing as a striker.

Complete and utter rubbish, that has only been the case the last 2 seasons.

Arsenal had the best record against the top 4 in 1997/98, 2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09 and 2010/11. The seasons he hasn't won the league from them are because of the inconsistencies vs the smaller clubs.

It's the inconsistency against small clubs which has cost Arsenal titles for the past 15 years apart from the last 2.

That's natural really, every player who makes a run in behind will be slow to get back and defend. I've seen Hazard do it, Oscar do it, even Ivanovic. 

Well like you said yourself, Willian cost £30m. You don't pay that much for a bench player. Also he adapted better than Schurrle but now Schurrle is playing the way Jose wants. I still don't see how it hampers his attacking ability, I agree he won't have as much freedom as before at Shakhtar but his ability in the final third should still be the same regardless of what role he plays. You don't see Luiz or Cahill consistently scuffing shots or failing to make that final pass when their in and around the box because they have been defending for  long periods of the game, so why is Willian different?

true,PTRJK,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I think it should be moved to Cardiff. Wales is basically our Belgium (when compared to the EU). A small country geographically central to the UK. Besides, Cardiff doesn't have *that much* going for it and it might even put Wales on the map, let alone Cardiff. I say this as an Englishman, so I'm not biased.

I also think the UK should become a Federation, where all four UK nations would have devolved and equal powers, except we'll have a parliament and counsels for things like defence and foreign affairs. For example; we would share a pot of money for defence expenditure and we would need the permission off all four countries to use our military. As there are four major countries in the British isles and if an election for each country's leader is held once every four years, our leaders could each take it in turns to be the president or representative of the union for one year.

If we were also a republic, we could invite the Republic of Ireland to join, with the incentive of seeding Northern Ireland back to them. If the UK as we know it and royalty no longer existed, it would suck a lot of wind out of both their sails.

It would probably mean us leaving the EU because, with inevitable further European integration it will eventually make the UK as a political union redundant (which will happen anyway, with the UK as it is). I mean we could still be part of the 'European Free Trade Association' like Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland...

So:

* England wouldn't have to be in the European Union.

* Scotland would gain far more independence, while keeping many of the benefits of the UK.

* Ireland would be reunited **and** Northern Ireland would still be part of a union with Great Britain.

* We would be a bigger union, more equal union and a more independent union sharing and coordinating the burden of defence, foreign policy (that'll be a tricky one) infrastructure, research &amp; development and maybe cultural things like the British/UK film counsel etc.",0,1395507209,null,0,1395521966,0,cg94m38,t3_212b1e,t1_cg94m38,t3_212b1e,null,1433020238,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Migs: not too bad, got left out to dry on the goals but pretty solid on the corners and in his distribution.


Flanno: not one of his best games, gave up a massive hole on the second goal but seemed to do solidly after. Surprised Cissohko got a look in, didn't do very well.


Skagger: were quite shaky in the first half, and gave up easy goals. Not one of their best performances, but for Skrtel's goals. Sahko might start getting into the starting lineup after this.


Johnson: beautiful runs into the opponents' half. Rarely bothered on his side until the end, and by then the entire Cardiff team was bombing forward.


Allen: quiet, unsung breaker of plays. Scrappy play.


Gerrard: sloppy fouls but otherwise solid.


Henderson: I'm still amazed at his tirelessness. Nice hold up play to feed Johnson on the wings, but not very good pass wise in the first half.


Couts: quiet, not one of his better games. Lots of sloppy passes in the first half. Sterling looked more hungry coming in.


Studge: solid Studge, came back often to recover and got his goal after being fed by Suarez.


Suarez: brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Hat-trick hero. I don't think Sterling can blame him for taking that last shot.",1,1395508451,null,0,1395508723,0,cg94xbt,t3_2131ne,t1_cg94xbt,t3_2131ne,null,1433020386,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

What they've said in that quote is not the same thing, they won't appose the independence. That doesn't mean they can join the EU.

&gt;Mariano Rajoy said his government believed an independent Scotland could only apply to join the EU from outside the organisation as a new state, as he warned against regions of Europe embarking on ""solo adventures in an uncertain future"".

&gt;His intervention confirms long-held suspicions that the Madrid government will resist the Scottish government's plans because of its rejection of Catalonian independence, which has seen large marches in Barcelona in favour of secession.

true,LordAnubis12,null,null,"I dare say part of the issue is that feeling. I know that's not helpful but if you're going for jobs without much care for them then it'll probably show to the employer. I got offered 2 jobs a while ago that were entry level but were really genuinely interesting and that came across in interview I think which helped - mostly because I asked so many questions!

What job sites are you using? Have you looked for smaller, local based job sites that cater to specific industries? Small companies can't afford the big sites to advertise on and are probably more likely to interview and give that personal touch where experience is less necessary (depending on role). I'm not sure but certainly I'd much rather work with someone with less actual experience but is a nice person vs total dickhead who's experienced because the environment is so small. 

How are you presenting current experience and job roles? What hobbies do you have that require a technical or skill/knowledge? 

If you're just applying for everything with the same CV and cover letter - stop. This will be demoralising you because you don't hear back, but you won't hear back because it's clearly generic. Reduce your applications to jobs that you genuinely find interesting, even if they're not entry, and tailor your CV or cover letter at least to that job requirements. 

I applied the other day for a job that was like £60k despite me only earning £8k atm - I still got a response because I was genuinely interested in the job and wanted to know how best position myself for it, or if there were any junior positions.

Basically, quality not quantity. There is no easy way to get a job, but my advice (feel free to ignore it obviously, I'm not exactly a manager or anything fancy) would be to focus on things that interest you to both give you a bit of a moral boost in that you're just applying for shit jobs, but also that it'll probably increase conversion rates because you're not just another number applying for a job. 

Worse case scenario - supermarkets. You're usually treated pretty well and you might get soul crushed after a while but there's plenty of departments to work on, and the pay is alright. Usually once you apply and not a total idiot you'll get an interview/the job - or at least everyone I know has. I imagine it's the same with others but Sainsburys take down each job posting after they've received 5 applications for it.

In Britain we don't have the same culture that other European nations have in terms of singing; I have been to games in Germany, Italy, Greece, Spain, Holland and Turkey and there are certainly different national identities when it comes to how teams support. 

In countries with a strong Ultra type culture there is certainly a huge emphasis moved towards singing for the full 90 minutes. This is cheerled by the diehard ultras with their flags and flares, and it allows some of the crowd to join in. 

In Britain this was pretty well killed off in the 80s when The Football Spectators Act killed a lot of the things that lead to this style of support. No standing, no booze and no large groups of fans deemed to be potential hooligans by the police. Football is also so expensive that even a lot of hardcore fans cannot afford to go week in week out, meaning that the sort of relationships that you would build with those sitting in your section week in week out are tough to maintain.

What this has done is lead to a more dispersed support in the stands, whilst chants and songs can still get going, it is an awful lot tougher. That being said the die hard season ticket areas will always be bouncing, singing and going for it, and if you really want a cauldron- go to our away matches.

&gt; How are you presenting current experience and job roles?

I present my current work experience in its own section within my CV in a reverse-chronological order. I don't touch that much on personal hobbies unless they are directly related to the job in which case I would include them in the cover letter. I wouldn't, for instance, mention that I like video games unless it was for a job that involved video games to some degree even if it was just selling them because such a hobby would be considered anathema to a recruiter.

&gt; What hobbies do you have that require a technical or skill/knowledge?

The only one I can think of is regular computer use, from which I have a basic knowledge of programming languages and applications such as Photoshop, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.

&gt; If you're just applying for everything with the same CV and cover letter - stop. This will be demoralising you because you don't hear back, but you won't hear back because it's clearly generic.

I don't respond with the same CV and cover letter. That would be a very big mistake to do. I tailor certain parts (such as the personal statement) to fit the nature of the role I'm applying for and I write entirely different cover letters for each role and explain why - in terms of my job experience, personal interests and education - I would be suitable for the role.

&gt; Reduce your applications to jobs that you genuinely find interesting, even if they're not entry, and tailor your CV or cover letter at least to that job requirements.

&gt; I applied the other day for a job that was like £60k despite me only earning £8k atm - I still got a response because I was genuinely interested in the job and wanted to know how best position myself for it, or if there were any junior positions.

I assume the response was a generic rejection letter that went ""Thank you for your interest in our company. After careful consideration, we have unfortunately decided not to pursue your application further. Due to a high volume of applications, we do not provide individual feedback""? Or was it a more meaningful reply?

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"I got a decent job out of one of the work placement schemes this work programme replaced. It was only a 6 month fixed contract, but it was a decent entry level wage and encompassed skills development (administration, customer service, sales, I.T etc.) As far as I'm concerned the work-schemes under Labour were working and they did not need to be messed with. 

The advantages of the old scheme I was on.. 

1) It was a real job with real training and competitive wages. None of the this bogus apprenticeship crap.

2) I was told from the start that it was a fixed term contract and what experience I would gain to put on my CV.

3) I wasn't pressured in to it and there were no penalties threatened for not taking it, it was entirely optional so long as I was applying elsewhere. 

4) They didn't wait until I was long term unemployed, I was offered this within the first month of signing on. They wanted to catch people early and get them back in to work.

So work placements aren't inherently a bad thing, they just need to be managed with a modicum of common sense.

true,goolies,null,null,"You're right - I gave the figures without accounting for interest. 

However when you do factor in interest you have to do so for both the up-front payers and those paying through the scheme. Factoring this in still leaves the up-front payers better off, though compared to the 30-year average salary of £40,000 they are a relatively small £3,000 worse off. (note: £3,000 at 30 years after graduation value i.e. £3,000 in 2043 money!)

Assuming 3% RPI an average salary of £40,000 over the future 30 years is really not particularly high (it equates to a getting a below-average salary of ~£25,00 straight out of university and the pay only increasing at RPI) and yet leaves the student worse off than those able to pay up front.


The policy is **not** progressive and to call it a graduate tax is wholly inconsistent with what it actually is. The system penalises those who go on to financial success from a position where paying up front is infeasible whilst giving a free ride to the select few from wealthy families.


All this is also without mention that a future parliament could change the terms of interest and repayment - which could be very serious for those with &gt;£30,000 debt thanks to the new higher fees.

true,tsoli,null,null,"My biggest worry is that, now that her ""Mystery"" is solved, she'll get poor writing and just be the explaining board for a frenetic doctor to tell what brilliant thing he's doing.  

The doctor needs companions for several reasons.  First off, for companionship.  It's his nature to want to explore the universe with someone.  Call it showing off, or just not wanting to be alone, but it's still there.  Clara is a person and can fill this role just by breathing.

His solutions often require another person doing something while he does something else.  Clara, being able to walk and push buttons and things, is also fully capable of being his surrogate in tasks.

On a production standpoint, we need an explaining board and a humanizing agent through which to experience the show.  Clara can do this just by being there.

More importantly, the doctor isn't infallible.  Sometimes he's wrong.  Sometimes he misses something.  We need Clara to be used in a way that she ADDS to the doctor's solutions and improves them.  She has been written so far in such a way that she does.  Her character, more so than any other since perhaps Donna (New series, anyway) challenges the Doctor and requires him to rethink his assumptions.  That's what makes a stellar companion.  

Let's hope that she continues to be written well.  And kudos to Moffat for resisting the lovesick puppy angle.  A little romantic tension is fine and dandy, but another Martha would just be cruel.

The midfield was shocking, for a team whose philosophy is based on passing and movement- we were thoroughly outpassed, outpaced and outworked by a Swansea side who are not in good form at all. Our team had a 76% passing percentage today in the opposition half, compared to 84% overall this season, and our usual top performers were very poor (Barry was wasteful and McCarthy looked tired).

We put 3 goals away, and were lucky that Swansea were out of form in front of goal, otherwise we would have let in 5 on another day.

2. If you want to start a discussion, then make a text post, and seed the discussion with some actual thoughts on how well BR's done, why he's been so successful, etc.  If you really don't have anything worthwhile to say on the matter, but still want to start a discussion, make a text post and don't write anything in the body of the post.  But you should have some thoughts on it if you want to have a discussion.

3. You clearly *aren't* looking for a discussion here.  You just want to post a picture of BR and cash in on karma after everybody is riding high after a win.  You didn't make a text post because you don't have anything to say, and text posts don't earn you karma anyway.

Regardless, Flanno had a shaky starting minutes, but Rodgers did very well to adjust: He pushed Agger to basically holding hands with Flanno and that helped a lot. The addition of Sterling was something I thought would have come a bit sooner to spread the pitch wide and help both our fullbacks and exploit their flanks. However, the team managed to fix their mistakes with the personalle on the field and by the time Sterling came on I don't even think he was needed. 

Overall, Rodgers showed once again why he is such a genius. Brilliant change in tactics to fix our problems and paid off heavily.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I honestly think this is how you should build sides that are capable of winning the title.

It's always said that ultimately the side that wins the title isn't the one that wins the games against big teams, but the one that wins all the games they're supposed to win against the smaller ones. For the past ten, twenty years or so we've been a team that has struggled to do that.

Teams would come to Anfield with the mentality of putting ten men behind the ball all game, being happy to neutralise the game and maybe hope to nick a goal or two if we were complacent. Under Houllier and Benitez we were solid at keeping clean sheets, but we always struggled to break down sides that were never really that interested in scoring against us to begin with. And if we did make a mistake at the back it would typically cost us points.

We got a lot of draws against sides that we really should have beaten and that's what held us back. In 08/09 we finished in second - 4 points off United. We lost two games all season, but we drew eleven games, and those eleven draws cost us the title. 

This season it's different. In previous years if we went 1-0 down early against Cardiff away and they stuck 10 men behind the ball, we'd have them pinned back all game but still struggle to score. Maybe we'd nick a goal back and salvage a point. Today Cardiff went in front, threw everything into defending, and within ten minutes we'd equalised. They score again, defend again, we equalise again. 

Teams can't line up against us with this ""park the bus for 90 minutes and hope we get a result"" mentality. It doesn't work. If they try it, we score anyway, we win. If they try and play football then maybe they'll get a few goals because we don't defend very well, but they'll give us the space to open them up and we tend to just score more than they do because we have a more clinical strike force. 

You have to go back to November and our 2-0 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates for the last time someone kept a clean sheet against us. That's **twenty three consecutive games** since a team shut us out. 

I still think it's an outside chance for us winning the title this season, but it's obvious where we need to improve over the summer and I think next season we'll be up there as potential challengers right from the start. And even if we don't get the title it'll still be entertaining as hell every week.

*tl;dr* - You win titles by beating the smaller teams, and you beat the smaller teams by having an attack that they can't stop scoring no matter how much they park the bus. For the first time since I've been old enough to support the club (so about 20 years or so) I feel we have that.

I'd certainly mention this, especially how you came about the knowledge. And I meant more presenting in terms of have you squeezed every skill you can of your archiving work - I imagine that's quite technical and requires a high level of accuracy so things like that I'd definitely put in. Obviously don't be too stupid with it. For example my work at Sainsburys I have ""Provided point of contact care and responses to customers"" - basically I'd answer the phone if it rang and issue refunds for stuff. 

The reply I got wasn't that meaningful as I think it was an agency, but they just said ""Unfortunately you've not got enough experience, but I'll give you a shout if I see any lower level jobs"" - could be nothing but I've found that random interactions like that can lead to stuff sometimes. I may have been mocked in the office, or put in a 'potentially useful contact' drawer - who knows. But worth a try. 

With experience it's a bit tricky as  you say - though volunteering is good. Quite often I don't think experience matters so much as showing that you can hold a job down (e.g retail) - may be different for me though as I've basically built my own experience though personal projects and point to them.

Job site wise I was referring more so to - [wiredsussex](http://www.wiredsussex.com) - something like that might be around locally. I found my current job through them and will probably look for any future jobs primarily through them.

This is **yet another** intentionally misleading Guardian shit story.

If you read carefully you'll see that it's 48,000 people that have caused the maximum payout to be done. And how long to they need to be in a job? 104 weeks. 

So since it started 48,000 have found a job, and been in it for 2 years. Meaning that it could only be 48,000 in the first year, not three years.

Additionally it's not been 3 years. The scheme launched in June 2011 but we don't know when the Guardian's figures run up to. We also don't know how long it takes for that payment to be done. Presumably 2-3 months before now?

So the very most the Guardian could say here is..

In the first six months of the government scheme 48,000 people found work, and were still in the job 2 years later.

Bear in mind petrol hasn't always been this expensive. When I first started driving, late 80s, I think it was about 30p! So that extra 0.9p was quite significant. Now it doesn't matter as much, but old habits die hard.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The Section 7 powers are for use solely to determine whether the target IS A TERRORIST.

Firstly, I think you are confusing *Section* 7 with *Schedule* 7.

Section 7 refers to nothing of the sort; Schedule 7 is the part that refers to port inspections and the ability to stop and detain someone.

Source 1: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/7
Source 2: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7 

The legislation explicitly refers to the definitions laid down in Section 1 of the 2000 act:

Source: 
Power to stop, question and detain

2(1)An examining officer may question a person to whom this paragraph applies for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b).

&gt; I disagree, and so does the law (as written).

The law, as writen, does not:

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40

40 Terrorist: interpretation.

(1)In this Part “terrorist” means a person who—
(a)has committed an offence under any of sections 11, 12, 15 to 18, 54 and 56 to 63, or
(b)is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

Carrying state secrets and conveying them to those who have no authority to read them clearly counts as being ""concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"", where terrorism is defined in Section 1 of the 2000 act as:

(2)Action falls within this subsection if it—
(a)involves serious violence against a person,
(b)involves serious damage to property,
(c)endangers a person’s life, other than that of the person committing the action,
(d)creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or
(e)is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.

Now that may not have been the explicit intent of the legislation as it was written, but it was designed to be flexible - this was not knee-jerk legislation passed after 9/11 as it clearly predates it.

&gt; You are welcome to your contrary opinion of course, but you'll have to get a law passed to that effect before the authorities can legally do as you wish. 

The legislation seems to back my interpretation, although it's the interpretation of the courts that matter.",0,1395518269,null,0,false,0,cg98pzl,t3_212hia,t1_cg98pzl,t1_cg95uie,null,1433022241,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Milner was really good today. He showed real confidence through the game at both ends and linked up well with Silva. I think this was his best game of the season and he was clearly gutted to not have scored himself. 

I liked Jovetic's movement when he came on. Plays as a really active second striker always moving and calling for the ball. Too bad he couldn't play the full game but its important he returns only gradually.

I was sat in the away end with my dad, front row, right behind Sterling/Lucas/Sakho/Aspas warming up, complete other side from the LFC fans. Being from Wales, I know how vile people from Cardiff can be and they were. Disgraceful bunch, some of the things I heard. ""I hope Suarez has a heart attack on the pitch"", ""Look at that little black cunt"" - aimed at Sterling. ""Break their fucking ankles"" - Really horrific 'fans'.
    
    
So me and my dad were obviously sitting on our hands. So difficult not being able to celebrate with your club. We had a guy behind us who knew we were scousers because we kept making excited noises/almost standing up. He kept calling us out to his friends and stuff. Another guy with 3 teeth (not even kidding) ""Dirty horrible scouse cunts, burn the fuckers"" directed at the team but obviously we turned around to look thinking it was directed at us. A few scousers a few rows behind us were thrown out after being started on by Cardiff fans. (They were seriously vile.)
    
    
So 5-3 up, we're enjoying ourselves a little **too much** to be home fans. Everyone starts getting angsty around us. We stand up ready to leave, when Suarez scores his hat-trick. We cheered as loud as we fucking could and RAN as fast as we could up from row A to the top of the first tier celebrating. All their fans booing, half in shock and my dad just jumps in the air with a clenched fist out the door. Never ran from a stadium as fast as that.    

    
What a fucking result hahaha!

They collectively would be like adding the military of the Netherlands (Europe's 6th biggest economy) to England's. I think the four countries should all contribute the same percentage of their GDP to the defence budget, so in that sense it would be fair.

If the Republic of Ireland ever did join, they would obviously have to end their neutrality, raise their defence spending and join NATO with us. Maybe if in return, Great Britain were more pacifist and lowered our defence spending to the NATO minimum of 2% (instead of 2.5%), which I think would be a fair compromise.

Obviously, players like Ronaldo and Hazard aren't rotated, but that's because it pays to have these players getting as much practice as possible, and they aren't expected to have the defensive work-rate of the other 2 attacking midfielders.

Against teams where we expect them to set up defensively, Schurrle is the better option. He offers more going forward, and does not have the same defensive ability as Willian. Against teams where we have to set up defensively (think against Man City at the Etihad, or against PSG in Paris) Willian is the preferred option. Willian can play all 90 minutes at break-neck speed and he can slot in as CAM, LM or RM depending on who is subbed out.

This is why Chelsea is such a dangerous team. We don't have a top striker, we have a poacher/tricky striker (Eto'o) and a striker who excels at headers &amp; at getting behind the last defender (Torres). Depending on what we need, we can choose.

Prior to delivery, the obstetrician will need to open the vagina by performing an episiotomy.  The edges will then be sewn to achieve haemostasis but *not* repaired to their original mutilated state.  This in itself would be an act of FGM.  

Perhaps this doctor was ignorant of this and tried to put things back to the way they were before he started.  

There's an ethical issue here - if a woman can give informed consent for FGM, then is it any different to getting a Harley St fannyplasty?  Should we be prosecuting the modification of consenting womens' bodies because it doesn't suit us culturally in the UK?   After all, we don't criticise women with genital piercings or cosmetic labioplasty.  I think it's a disgusting practice to perform the extreme end of the FGM spectrum, consenting or not, but at the lower end it isn't a million miles away from what is already accepted and freely advertised to women in this country.

I'm not sure if DW's fandom and less community connected viewers are the type of people who appreciate grumpy, cynical characters like, say, House. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. People seemed to like Captain Grumpy, though, and he'd eventually lighten up a little once he realises his attitude makes him lonely. That said, the Doctor is one of the most well known for compassion and wonder characters in all of fiction and it might be too jarring to have him act too out of character for too long.

I think it'd be a neat little vacation to see (or imagine) a totally different, cynical Doctor, like Eccleston in his most sarcastic, grumpy mood but for several episodes. Kind of like comic book ""What if?"" stories. I guess that's what fanfiction is for, though I'm not a fan.
