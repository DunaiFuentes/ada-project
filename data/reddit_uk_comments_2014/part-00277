Its actually pretty astute from Marty.

If you wait 30 years until there is a clear Catholic majority that it'd pass first time, then say 'we want a referendum', just think what the unionist reaction would be, trying everything until its forced on them.

BUT...

If you say 'right lets have one' when its clear that its going to be maybe 70/30 in favour of the union, then the unionists won't be shit scared and may say 'right, if it shuts you up...'

But then he's got them. the GFA says every seven years, so three more fails and martys guaranteed it... probably without just as much unionist handwringing.

It wouldn't have been good for either. It would have split families between borders, would mean there would be no common identity or culture, it would have created an international border where there hasn't been one for 300 years, and it would have severely weakened both rUK and Scotland internationally. 

That's not to mention the economic  uncertainly and damage both economies of rUK and iScotland, all of these negative consequences even while Scotland economic policy would be, at least to some extent, tied to the Policies of the Bank of England.

It is. The EU is supposed to be positives only but obviously some potential negatives can come out of it. UK pays more money than it gets back in different schemes but at the same time it gains from new opportunities etc.

&gt;boarder control.

Sorry for pointing it out, but it's ""border"" - you keep repeating wrong spelling.

&gt;No, I have explained this several times now, we are responsible for our borders, and they are responsible for theirs. 

And I have explained to you couple of times that all depends on point of view. Just imagine that a border, is actually something what is made up. Scotland and England don't have border control, even though they are legally different countries but also form another country (I still can't grasp that). They made an arrangement to not have borders.... meaning it's POSSIBLE to change the perspective of view.

The same is in the EU. In Schoengen, there aren't borders. People come and go as they like. It's a hell lot easier to travel, especially when you take roads. It's even much more easier for people who are near borders of other countries (I was recently on a holiday in Europe, and picked up a quicker route through other country, being in the other).

You are intentionally building up a concept, which can easily be withdrawn when needed. It's what's in our heads and how look at things, not your ""country has a responsibility"". Look at example above, DIFFERENT countries make a new country, yet they are still counted as separate countries anyway. Whoah.... but that exists and you could say ""this and that"" but that's how it is, meaning it can be done.

&gt;Countries in the EU could share information on convictions, many already do

They could share it already but the process is still very long. Unless new systems come into place, we are still far from such quick checks, especially worldwide.

&gt;he alternative is what you have just seen, let criminals through without checking and risk getting your citizens murdered. 

And at the same time a Brit could have murdered someone in Spain. In fact, you would still have that murder in the country, just done by a Brit, not a Latvian. Does it really matter person of what origin murdered her (if indeed but it's getting more likely)? We should focus on reducing overall figures and general prevention, not making a point, which really doesn't help but only divides.

Just read it today: [Murder of woman by estranged husband was preventable, says report](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/17/paul-holmes-murder-estranged-wife-becky-mcphee-preventable-merseyside-police). Why don't you complain about this? This murder was preventable and it was done by a Brit.

&gt;The data you are providing is completely irrelevant. Migrants may commit less crime, then again blond people might statistically commit less crime. Does that mean we should only let in blond immigrants?

Irrelevant? I'm sorry, but you are completely out of reason here. Immigrants, is not ""blond people"", it's the same group of people like the ones residing in the country in question (unless you have an issue with that but that means it's xenophobia). If you bothered reading the article, it said specifically, that A8 immigrants came here mainly to work, that is why that figure was lower than with locals. It was different though when compared with asylum seekers, due to the fact they migrated because of different reasons. This sole point actually proved to all UKIP-ers that work migration is a positive migration and should be least attacked... but hey, better to you it's ""irrelevant"" because of mumbo jumbo..... 

You make a case that ex-convicts shouldn't be let in this country, hence ALL people should be screened for their possible convictions, including all going out of this country.... yet you totally disregard that A8 migrants were less likely to commit crime than local group.

&gt;Sorry if it spoils your trip to Paris, but I value a child's life over your shopping trip.

In that case you should ban all knives, as after all it's what, top or second from the top tool used for murdering people. We should seek a system to BALANCE and that is exactly what is going on, even with H&amp;S regulations. Why not ban all guns? Just last week a child was killed by his/her father, who later took his own life. Why aren't you advocating for that ban? In fact, UKIP wants to get rid of the current small guns ban, saying it was introduced without proper reasoning.... even though guns are used only by police/army, some few people who do sports with guns..... and criminals. You don't need a gun to make a normal life. You often need to travel to work/holiday or whatever, without an unnecessary need to apply for a permit 3 months earlier.... and based on a single situation, when a Latvian guy murdered someone in the UK, where at the same time some Brit, could have done the same abroad.

&gt;We are not discussing which groups commit more or less crime, we are talking about wheather or not we should let people convicted of serious crime into this country or not.

And that again is pointless as at the same time British convicts go abroad to commit crime. I'm really surprised you don't see that as a good reason and disregard it. You would still have exactly the same number of ex-convicts, who potentially can kill a young girl.... but make huge costs and real struggle for millions of people who would like to travel in the EU.

&gt;If you want your data to be relevant, go and find some statistics on how many CONVICTED immigrants RE-OFFEND when they move into a different country.

&gt;Mr Hague insisted there was a ""very clear commitment"" to the Scottish reforms pledged by the three main UK parties, but he argued that the English question had to be resolved at the same pace.

&gt;""I think it would be inconceivable to go ahead with a further important stage and measure of devolution to parts of the United Kingdom, without addressing this issue,"" he told the BBC.

&gt;""Of course it's been an anomaly for quite a long time now that Scottish MPs can vote on everything happening in England, but we the English MPs can no longer do so in Scotland, and indeed nor can the Scottish.

&gt;""But it will become absolutely acute - it will become absolutely indefensible with further devolution - and I think people need to know at the time of the general election next May where we all stand on that, whether we've tried to reach an agreement, and if not, it's something they can decide on in the general election.""

&gt;BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the proposal to restrict voting rights for Scottish MPs could undermine a future Labour government - theoretically there could be a Labour PM who lacks a majority of English MPs so is unable to get health or education issues through parliament.

&gt;But Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at his party's conference in Manchester, said he would not allow the moment ""to be used for narrow party political advantage"".

&gt;Instead he announced plans for a full constitutional convention ""rooted in our nations and regions... to ensure decisions are taken closer to the families and businesses""

He's disagreeing with Cameron's plans but not disagreeing with further devolution. ",0,1411151904,null,0,false,0,ckmz0if,t3_2gv7jd,t1_ckmz0if,t1_ckmyyca,null,1426919215,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

That means you can vote once, but for as many people as you want. Doing this allows you to vote for who you really want to vote for, say, the Greens, but means you also have a chance to vote against the tories by voting for Labour at the same time. Likewise, you might want to keep fringe parties out, and only vote Labour/Tory/LibDem because they've done such a fantastic job over the last 30 years (cough).

If you don't get anywhere, only then should you write to one of the partners.  A receptionist being a little bit brusque isn't something to get particularly angry about.  

A GP surgery isn't a Tesco, so in my opinion  there isn't really have the same right to complain about ""customer service"" - only complain if think you are genuinely being deliberately denied an appointment.   If you are really unhappy then go to a different practice.  The unfortunate reality is that they are trying to sort out dozens of people a day and it's not always a completely smooth experience.

**Where did you purchase:** Tesco on BOGOF

**Product claims:** *""Dual-textured cloths gently cleanse and exfoliate skin in one simple step - no lathering or rinsing required. Anti-Wrinkle Wet Wipes are specially designed to gently cleanse your skin in one simple step whilst beginning to fight signs of ageing - no lathering or rinsing required. It contains a unique complex of vitamins and skin softening agents to begin your anti-ageing routine.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am slightly obsessed with niacinamide and it is the second ingredient. 

**Your opinion:** The sticky pad over the pack opening is large and reseals much better than baby wipes. The product handled waterproof mascara well, but after a few uses my eye area became irritated. My skin felt dry and stripped if I did not use moisturiser soon afterwards. I will not repurchase but would continue to use when travelling and recommend to those with more robust skin.

**Ingredients:** *""water, niacinamide, hexylene glycol, glycerin, panthenol, vitamin E, dimethicone, dimethiconol, DMDM hydantoin, acrylates/ vinyl isodecanoate crosspolymer, polysorbate 20, disodium EDTA, butylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, butylphenyl methylpropional, fragrance, linalool, ascorbic acid, geraniol.""*

I issue certain items of PPE to some of my team (not boots though), some is issued individually (prescription safety glasses) and some is communal (regular safety glasses and lab coats). 

There is no requirement that PPE be issued to individual employees, provided that there is enough to go around and that it is suitable for use. They must make reasonable arrangements if you have specific requirements (for instance I have one member of staff who wears a lab coat that is probably best described as a small tent - only because the standard coats don't fit). However I wouldn't have thought that communal shoes would be a problem (as far as the legislation goes). They don't actually come into contact with your skin (socks), and provided reasonable steps are taken to ensure adequate hygiene (some sort of disinfectant spray I would imagine) and they fit; I don't see you having a reasonable reason to refuse to work. 

As such I don't believe you would have much of a case to claim loss of earnings, in fact I could see your refusal to work to lead to potential disciplinary action. 

Your best bet would be to contact the HSE - http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/information-advice.htm#technical-advice. However note that they will only provide technical advice (is it okay to share shoes and what precautions should be taken to reduce infection risk if so). They will not be able to provide you with legal or work related advice. You could try the CAB, but I'm not sure that they would be able to offer this sort of specialist technical advice, you may wish to contact an employment law solicitor or your union (you are in a union, right?).

If he actually has a bad game, let's not try to justify his performance by commenting on his 'work-rate' or his 'desire'. 

It annoys me to no end when this sub gets this ridiculous group mentality going about certain players thinking they can do no wrong (i.e., Allen, Sakho, Henderson [though this one is completely justified], and now, for some reason, Borini). Please be objective with the way you look at players and don't throw out meaningless and vague evaluations like, for example, ""Allen really brought balance to the midfield,"" or talking about Borini's work ethic. Actually judge players on their performances and specifically state why their performance was good. Explain how Allen brought balance to the midfield or what benefits were drawn from Borini's work rate.

The only reason I'm throwing this out there is because IF Borini starts tomorrow, I know it's gonna turn into an ""all aboard the hype train"" day and people are going to offer skewed evaluations on his performance.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am slightly obsessed with niacinamide!

**Your opinion:** Like the hygienic pump bottle format, the amount dispensed is just right for face and neck, but I need two for decollete and hands. Texture is very lightweight, would not replace a regular moisturiser for me. Found the product very gentle/ non irritating, fitting with the short ingredients list including soothing allantoin and panthenol.

However, not being either a moisturiser or a serum, this never quite slotted into my routine and ended up at the back of the bathroom cabinet. It recently reappeared: a pump blends  well in the hand with a pump of Ishtar Skinlights retinol cream, and I am wondering if it will with Ishtar Skinlights Clarity-C lotion since the base of all three is not dissimilar.

Not really. It could still pass nation wide legislation. 

If say Labour wins in the UK and the Tories win in England then the Tories are responsible for English only bills.

By the way, I'd prefer a federal system, but the idea that Scottish MPs should be able to vote on legislation that doesn't effect Scotland is ridiculous.

**Price of product:** £1.65 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""The Simple Kind To Skin range offers everything from daily cleansers and moisturisers to occasional treats such as face masks. Formulated with vitamin goodness ...*

*A perfect blend of multi-vitamins and skin-loving ingredients to keep your skin clarified and refreshed. 100% alcohol free, perfect even for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am slightly obsessed with niacinamide! Also impressed by the number of humectants/ anti inflammatory ingredients in the formula.

**Your opinion:** I really like this toner and definitely will repurchase even at full retail price. I use it on face neck and decolette as a light morning refresh or after getting sweaty. It is gentle enough to cleanse but not immediately follow with a moisturiser.

**Ingredients:** *""water, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, panthenol, niacinamide, chamomile flower extract, witch hazel, allantoin, sodium PCA, propylene glycol, pantolactone, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, citric acid, methylparaben, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate, butylparaben, ethylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben.""*

Note that 'hydrogenated starch hydrosylate' contains sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (hydrating not drying), some bottles have sorbitol listed as the second ingredient. Also note that the old formula did not contain niacinamide and this is reflected in the out-of-date ingredients on the Simple website.

Tested with universal indicator paper at pH ~5/6.

1) Abolish the City of London. It can exist on par with other boroughs.

2) Bureaucratic invasion of Jersey and Guernsey. They either take the same status as any county, or get out.

3) UK Parliament moves to Isle of Man. Westminster becomes a devolved English national ministry. To thank the other nations for their contributions to Westminster over the years, England alone foots the bill for turning IoM into a fantastic federal capital.

4) Ring-fence the royal family. That ""their current status remains"" is the default option in ongoing decision making.

5) De-colonialism, world-wide. Places like Gib, Anguilla and Cayman Islands either shape up or ship out. On a global setting, the UK exists to promote ideals, in as far as we can without proselytising. We don't need shady tax havens leaching off our status. They become part of the UK proper, similar to French *departments*, and if they don't like it, feel free to hold a referendum.

6) Invite the RoI to join our nation with the benefits of the Barnett formula.

7) Time for a Citizen's wage. Every citizen over age 'x' recieves £x-hundred per month from the state.

It's funny how despite all the conflict and bickering we still haven't heard any side lay out what their long term plans for Northern Ireland are.

The level of support for an independent Scotland increased dramatically from the day the referendum was set until yesterday. It was because everybody was forced to seriously consider their future that support for a Yes started rising.

I don't think it matters how many Catholics or Protestants there are in the state. In order to achieve a vote for United Ireland there just has to be 51% of people who won't vote based on historic baggage or tribal allegiance but rather vote for which choice holds the best economic prospects for the future.

**Price of product:** £8 for 3oz (= 90ml)

**Where did you purchase:** Amazon.co.uk

**Product claims:** *""An ideal moisturizer for night-time use, developed specifically for the face. It helps restore and maintain the skin’s natural protective barrier with ingredients not commonly found in other facial moisturizers. Containing ceramides and hyaluronic acid, CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM increases the skin’s ability to attract, hold and distribute moisture. It penetrates deep into the layers of the stratum corneum to help to replace deficient levels of key lipids that are essential for an effective skin barrier. Taking skin care a step further, CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM also contains niacinamide, which may help reduce redness.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am slightly obsessed with niacinamide, and ceramides are not easy to find in reasonably priced UK products.

**Your opinion:** This moisturiser has a pleasant lightweight, non greasy texture so works fine for day or night. I use five pumps for face neck and decollete. It does hydrate my skin effectively and I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction. I'm non wowed by this product but it's a solid option for those who avoid fragrance or want a product with a known percentage of niacinamide.

**Ingredients:** *""water, glycerin, caprylic/ capric triglycerides, niacinamide (4%), behentrimonium methosulfate and cetearyl alcohol, ceteareth-20 and cetearyl alcohol, ceramide 3, ceramide 6-II, ceramide 1, phytosphingosine, hyaluronic acid, cholesterol, dimethicone, polyglyceryl-3 diisostearate, potassium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, sodium lauroyl lactylate, disodium EDTA, methylparaben, propylparaben, carbomer, xanthan gum.""*

I'm uneducated and asking this as a genuinely interest type of asking why, not with any agenda.

In my opinion, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should have their own taxes/budgets/what you can pay for yourselves type of a budget and do what the fuck they want with it. We should all chip in for trident and the armed forces and infastructure, I don't mind paying for roads being built above roads in London like some kind of new age city structure being built, even as a Northerner. As long as we can get an extra lane on the M62 so going to Manchester in the morning isn't STATIC TRAFFIC. I mean if there is constant STATIC TRAFFIC, we need better infastructure to handle it that's just common sense. 

And if there's roads in Scotland that have dead deers on them and moss on a road by the side of a cliff lol or whatever problems they have they have we should all chip in to sort that out as well. 

But if Westminster is saying 'YOU CANT HAVE LESS THAN 80 KIDS IN A CLASS IN SCOTLAND' then that kind of thing is WTF to me. 

I don't have a clue honestly. What powers does Scotland want? If they're asking for powers to spend more money than they pay in taxes then why should they get that? Or if they're asking to be able to spend the money they pay in taxes (minus the 'chip in' costs) why can't they have that?

&gt;Throughout the 1990s, the Northern Ireland economy grew faster than did the economy of the rest of the UK, due in part to the Celtic Tiger rapid growth of the economy of the Republic of Ireland and the so-called ""peace dividend"". Growth slowed to the pace of the rest of the UK during the down-turn of the early years of the new millennium, but growth has since rebounded; in 2005, the Northern Irish economy is estimated to have grown by 3.2%, almost twice as fast as the UK as a whole, and future growth is expected to be stronger than that of the rest of the United Kingdom,  though lower than that of the Republic. In April 2007 a [Halifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_(United_Kingdom_bank\)) survey found Northern Ireland's average house price to one of the highest in the UK, behind London, the South East and the South West. It also found Northern Ireland to have all of the top ten property ""hot spots"", with the [Craigavon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigavon) and [Newtownards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards) areas increasing by 55%.

I agree that it's unfair but honestly, I don't care. That's what Britain should be and why devolution shouldn't be a thing anywhere. In fact, if I had my way I'd do away with the assemblies completely instead of bringing in more of the things, but it'll never happen. We are definitely too far gone on that point.

true,BrokeMyFinger,null,null,"I've heard this from people that have studied economics at undergraduate level and, without sounding like a complete dick, I don't think they have the intellectual capacity to understand it beyond, ""my friends from uni think it should be no too"". Waving crap qualifications around when you can't explain it is not very convincing.

From what I've seen of the journalism in the FT and statements by supposed experts, the dots don't totally add up there either and they do tend to be quite one sided.

That said, and as a disappointed yes supporter, what Alex Salmond was saying didn't totally add up either.

I did think about this quite a bit and the main points seemed to be:

* The uncertainty leading to a devaluation of GBP
* No clear currency plan and other issues around the currency and national debt
* Capital flight

**Devaluation of GBP**
I think that while this would happen, it would be short term and we would recover. I see this as an acceptable short term risk.

**Currency and debt**
I think this is one point where Alex really fell short. I think that a currency union would have been the most likely outcome regardless of what the no campaign said. However, I think there should have been a better plan B than, ""we will just use the pound anyway"".

This argument would be fine if we could accept that we wouldn't get entry into the EU as one of the requirements for entry is having your own central bank.

I felt like this could be a viable short term solution until we either joined the Euro or set up our own currency and formed a central bank.

While these things would be a major pain in the arse, and joining the Euro probably isn't a wonderful idea, they are things that have been done by loads of other countries, it isn't exactly an unknown problem. Again I see this as short term pain for long term gain.

The other issue tied to this is debt, and my understanding might be weak here but as I see it national debt is serviced by the treasury issuing government bonds and the payment of the coupons and balance of these bonds is how the debt it paid off. If there were no currency union then there would be no shared central bank and no shared responsibility of the treasury/treasuries. So it would fall to the rUK treasury to pay out on these bonds. There wouldn't be a choice here, it is just what falls out of no currency union: no debt for Scotland.

Of course there would have been long negotiations and it would have been a bit of a dick move for Scotland to just refuse any of the debt, but then it could be seen as a dick move to refuse a currency union.

Then there are the pros and cons of a currency union for the rUK, some people would say there are no benefits and others would say there are only benefits. I think it would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would mean that trade between the nations was a lot easier, but also that rUK would run the risk of having to bail out Scotland, though I don't see why there wouldn't be a clause in any agreement that says Scotland would be cut loose if they fucked up.

I think that the issue couldn't really be resolved without getting to the stage of negotiations, because at the stage of a referendum the no people are too busy trying to scare us and the yes people are too busy trying to make out that everything will be fine, pragmatic suggestions and compromise at this stage aren't going to win either side any voters. From my point of view I would like to have gotten to the stage of negotiations.

**Capital Flight**
Given that a lot of no voters voted no because they were scared of what would happen economically it would seem reasonable to assume that these same shitebags would move their savings to England and hence weaken the Scottish economy, almost like a self fulfilling prophecy. Again, I do think of this as an acceptable risk.

So I've outlined what I think were the key financial risks and just said that I think it is worth the risk. And I have almost no basis for saying that, or do I? We do have somewhat of a precedent.

At some point in the 90s the nation of Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, they managed to have a currency union for about 20 minutes before that was abandoned. Slovakia having the weaker economy meant that there was capital flight from Slovakia to Czech and it did all go a bit haywire for a few years. Slovakia now has the highest economic growth in the EU, and though their GDP per capita is about half that of the UK, it has been as stable.

So we have, what I consider to be, a good comparison and an example of a similar situation that didn't end in total disaster. So that, along with a bit of faith in my fellow Scots and the fact that dozens of other countries are successfully independent, leads me to think we would be just fine. And honestly, if this whole thing is a problem that other countries have successfully dealt with and you just don't trust your own people to not screw it up, then you might as well just give up and let a bunch of warmongering expenses scammers run the country for us.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"I like the idea that the Doctor's coats or at least his outerwear is Time Lord enhanced which is why some of them seem to have pockets that are bigger on the inside and that he always wears them. The shirts and jumpers and sweaters are all just normal wear and he swaps them out when he needs/wants to.

And it seems like this season they are trying to stress that the Doctor is spending a lot of time alone, which translates to a change in outfit more frequently. Personally I feel that the clothes are changing with the Doctor's moods/situations. He first had the white shirt on when he was just coming out of his post regeneration haze. It was buttoned up but still appeared a little unkempt and loose. The purplish shirt looked much more no nonsense but still a bit loose. And then the sweater looks like he has worn it for a while and hasn't bothered to change in a while either. The greyish or blueish one he seems to be using for Time Heist seems to make him appear a little more authoritative and serious.

Capaldi has also already said that he wanted his outfit to be easy to cosplay. With a diverse array of clothes under his coat, people can probably find something in their own closet to wear or have a better chance of finding things second hand.

And if you look at the promo galleries for each episode he still wears the white shirt so it seems like they are grounding the outfit with the white shirt.",0,1411159067,null,0,false,0,ckn2pm7,t3_2gvxqa,t1_ckn2pm7,t3_2gvxqa,null,1426917420,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,Kesuke,null,null,"There's being less informed (which as you say wasn't an issue for anyone in this referendum) and there is being able to consider the consequences from an adult stance... Having adult insight if you will. The latter is what the OP probably means.

When you're 16/17 it's easy to feel like society is something that just 'happens' around you. 16 and 17 year olds don't stop to think about how mum and dad built a family, bought that home, the sacrifices and choices they've made. They don't contemplate what their parents will do and how they will survive as retirees... Let alone conceptualise the fact that one day they might get old or ill and be dependent on society for various levels of support. I would argue they also don't appreciate that society isn't something that just happens at all, but rather is the product of everyone's effort to create stability and prosperity around them.

From that stance 'yes' can seem like a no-brainer to a risk-free 16 year old pumped up on ideals about national identity. I would agree with OP that even 2-3 years can make a big difference. Having to embrace the wider world as an adult exposes you to some of it's harsher realities. You also realise that turning 18 doesn't really magically make you an adult. Really being an adult is something that happens over time and is the product if hard work and circumstance. It was on some of those realities that 'no' made a strong case. 

As you get older, have children, buy into things like mortgages etc. you go from being in the system, to being part of the system itself. Then your children grow up in the stability that YOU created for them. It's why it's trendy to be anti-establishment when you're 17. By the time most people are 27 they've realised it's easier to just play the game and be a part of society. And everything you do, from paying rent to taking out a mortgage to going going to work in a job you hate every day is effectively buying into society.

Certainly when I was still in school many people were for independence and it was very difficult to get a proper argument as to why, other than the rebellious crowd mentality. Whereas 18-24's are likely to be more independent and more informed about the implications on their life.

Invoking such language puts the onus on other people to prove their point whilst shifting attention from the shallowness of your own ideas (which is what we are actually debating). But just for fun...

 * Nuclear power stations take a very long time to build, it is hard to regulate output in two years time when the plant will not be finished for over ten years.  We still need wind and solar that can be brought online quickly.
 * Even though nuclear stations are great for base load most designs cannot be quickly dispatched to provide cover for fluctuations. You still need gas stations to cover.
 * Very little can be built ""anywhere"" in the UK.  Nuclear stations are usually built near a supply of cooling water which in the UK limits you to the coastline or large estuaries which can have ecological issues.  
 * When nuclear power stations break down they remove huge amounts of capacity that has to be found elsewhere.  This makes it hard to regulate supply.  Four reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool are currently offline due to fire risk.

Nuclear is probably a necessary option but the picture is complex.  Cliches about what science thinks do not help.

&gt; Under Rafa we had ‘the best midfield in the world’ which ironically involved Momo Sissoko.

**Price of product:** RRP £6.49, purchased on half off offer at Superdrug. 

**Product claims:** 

1. Freederm Oil-free Perfecting Moisturiser is specially formulated by experts to hydrate and misturise those areas of the face that need it most.

2. At the same time, it acts on spot-prone skin to help combat blemishes.

3. The moisturising ingredients are absorbed into the skin to smooth and impreove its texture and appearance without blocking pores.

**About you:** Normal to oily skin. Spot and PIH prone.

**Your opinion:** Hygienic packaging with pump bottle, faint smell. Too heavy for use with my skin type, I get a noticeable shine that does not go away. My skin does not absorb the cream fully. Does not work as a daytime moisturiser, but with overnight use I wake up with plump skin after only a few days nightly use.

I understand why people would be more hyped about him. Borini has virtually done close to nothing in terms of proving himself as a player other than a pretty good loan spell at Sunderland.  The hype is simply engendered from his Cinderella story of wanting to stay at the club (which is commendable but not enough to merit this obsession with him in my opinion).

I'm on my own, in a carriage full of pissed Pompey fans. They're chanting all sorts and getting pretty rowdy. I seem to remember one particular chap jumping in those tiny tables between 4 seats and breaking it. 

I'm 17. I'm pissed. I'm pretty sure I'm
invincible. So in a lull between chants, I stand up and start ""When I was just a little boy..."" 

I don't get far before I'm drowned out by abuse. The old man sitting next to me, who has been wondering what the fuck is going on the whole journey, has now shat himself. I'm considering doing the same but fortunately the abuse is more good natured than you'd expect (probably due to the 4-1 earlier in the day). 

For the rest of the journey there's some *fairly* good natured banter between me and the rest of this carriage. Before I get off one or two of the chaps shake my hand as I leave. 

I was such an idiot. They probably didn't get angry because it was so laughable that some stupid twat decided to try and rile a bunch of pissed up fans. Glad I survived, looking back.

The First Doctor's tenure was a bit more instructional and educative. The Second's a bit more spacey, action oriented, and focused on a base under siege dynamic. The Third's a bit more like a Bond movie with an evil mastermind, lots of gadgets, and the military/science dilemma. The Fourth's started as a gothic horror leaning science fiction show but then developed into more of an epic space opera bringing in the Guardians and alternate spaces (like E-Space) with the show arcing it up a bit with the Key to Time season, E-Space trilogy, and the Master Returns trilogy. The Fifth's dialed back the science fiction focus a bit and rose the stakes like an episode of 24 where even if you win you lose and somewhere at anytime a bomb could go off and destroy everything. The Sixth's and Seventh's started to become a lot more of social commentary bent and aimed to bring more of a mythos to the Doctor's existence.",0,1411163158,null,0,false,0,ckn4obj,t3_2gw6pa,t1_ckn4obj,t1_ckn3j1c,null,1426916504,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,littleblueengine,null,null,"* UK: Legal to drink alcohol over 18. US over 21.
* US: Get used to driving automatic cars. UK: Drive manual (you can get automatics, but at 150% of the rental cost)
* US: Yes, the US has a speed limit (in most places) - its lower than you think. For the love of god don't get out of your car if you're pulled over. You sit and wait for the police officer to approach you. They carry guns and tasers.
* US: Drive on the right, obviously, but that also means get out of the left lane on fast roads.
* US: Unless otherwise stated by road signs you can turn left on a red light. Come to a stop and if safe, you can proceed. UK: Red really does mean stop, always.
* US: Stop signs really mean stop. Not a rolling stop, not a give-way, and most intersections are stop signs. UK: Yar for giveway (US: yield) signs every where and roundabouts. So much less stopping and so much more having to watch what other people are doing so that you can merge. Expect lorries to give way to you on the motorway (US: trucks on the interstate giving you a big fat nope). UK: Also expect lots of ""slow"" signs, without actually telling you what to slow down to, oh and expect the speed limit to be defined by the distance between the lamp posts, I kid you not.
* US: Its really not like you think it is. They're not all loud, obnoxious and carry guns. There's actually lots of people who aren't like that. 
* UK: Its really not like you think it is. They're not all cocky-talkin' jolly fellows that grumble quietly, or football hooligans. Funny that how that's the same really.
* US: Cell phone. UK: Mobile phone (WTF is with ""mobe""? The extra IL was just too much to say?)
* US: Football = american football, soccer = what the rest of the world calls football.
* US: Hockey = ice hockey only, not the lethal game played by girls at school with sticks. Don't mention Canada. Don't equate baseball with ""rounders"" at school.
* US: Just pronounce it to-ma-ta. A surprisingly large number of people never understood what a to-mar-toe was. Similarly so wor-ter (waa-duh). UK: Reverse this speech pattern.
* US: Stuff is bigger. Just everything. Houses, food sizes, cars, roads, buildings. UK: Road size - be prepared for that oh jesus moment that you'll never fit through that gap with that on coming traffic, but your car is smaller, so you will. Also UK: You have to be polite and pull into the gaps between parked cars to let on coming traffic go by. Expect other people to pull to the side and let you get by in return.
* US: History = 200 years. UK: History = 2000 years so ""olde worlde"" has a different meaning.
* Chip-n-Pin cards have already been mentioned.
* US: Prices don't include tax. You pay more than what it says the price is. UK: Price includes tax, so you pay exactly what it says
* Tax free saving accounts: US: Roth-IRA. UK: ISA.
* Nearly out of date food, US: kept at full price then thrown out. UK: Discounted!
* US: 24/7 stores. UK: Shops close at 4pm on Sunday, even the ""24 hours"" Tescos. Many shops close at 7pm if not earlier during the week. May have a ""late night opening"" of 8:30pm.
* UK: 24 hour clock. US: people use am/pm, only the military (and transportation) uses 24 hour clock so it is sometimes called military time.
* Eating out: US: Bigger portions, refillable sodas, water is given by default, with ice and refilled. UK: fizzy drinks normally not refillable, ask for ""tap water"" otherwise you'll get bottled water that you have to pay for. Don't expect refills of your water glass without asking, and it is rare to contain ice (especially if you don't ask).
* Tipping: US: mandatory. Do not forget to add a tip of 20% of bill or you'll be considered seriously rude. It isn't really ""optional"", also taxis, if you get help, also room cleaning staff at a hotel. Less for other services. UK: Ha ha... they pay people to do a job, rather than expecting them to mooch extra money, so tipping is entirely optional. A cabbie will give you exactly the right change, so tipping is a nicity if you want.
* US: Working is about proving that you're better than everyone else and ""essential"" so that you don't get fired and so can't afford to pay for your huge house/car. UK: Hey, fancy a cuppa?

Edit: I've had a few (eleven) drinks so bear with me - while he's no Steve Clarke/Robbie Di Matteo/Alex Sabella/JFH... he has a dozen-ish trophies to his name. Which is more than our last 40 years worth of managers put together. Like Hockaday he's a huge unknown factor but I'm pretty sure Sturm Graz are a higher reputation team than bloody Forest Green. 

I genuinely think Massimo has learned from The Hockaday Mistake^^^TM and while - like every Leeds fan - I'm approaching this with a degree of caution, I'm more confident in Darko than I was when we got Neil 'seven promotions' Warnock in. The vital thing (for me) is that he keeps the likes of Redders, Sullivan and anyone else who has a clue about the current squad. 

At the very least, I don't think he's worse than folks like Sannino, Mel, Magath ^^^^(sorry), or even Pochettino - the 'trend' of foreign imports of the last 2 years or so.

true,RogerStrong,null,null,"Quebec can have another referendum any time it wants.  Immediately after the last referendum the separatist government declared that it would call another referendum within months.

They reason they haven't - in the 20 years since - is the Clarity Act.

In 1995 the separatists used a vague question about renegotiating a better position within Canada - and sold it to non separatists as exactly that. They told people that they'd retain their Canadian citizenship and a say in Canadian economic policy, and that Canadian federal government jobs would stay in Quebec.

Two polls before the referendum and an exit poll during, showed that even of those who voted YES, most either did not want to separate or expected to keep their Canadian citizenship.

And yet separatist leader Jacques Parizeau has since stated that with a 50%+1 vote, he would have declared independence the next morning without any negotiations.  (He had even told a group of foreign diplomats that what mattered most was to get a majority vote from Quebec citizens for the proposal to secede from Canada because with that, Quebecers would be trapped ""lobsters thrown into boiling water."")

This culminated in the federal government's 2000 Clarity Act which stated that any future referendum would have to be on a ""clear question"" - something like ""Should Quebec be an independent country?""

The separatists know that they can't win on a clear, honest question.

When the Parti Québécois started talking about separation in the Quebec election a couple months back, they were annihilated in the polls.

true,fozzy143,CupFinalsCrest,,"I agree with him that that FA Cup game against Watford was the turning point, but only because he was so shockingly bad. It wasn't just his body that was broken, his attitude  was quite frankly pathetic. I love Richards and only wish the best for him but that was the first game I saw where he appeared to have mentally given up. He showed no desire, no passion, he complained when things didn't go his way to the extent that around the 40th minute when we were 2-0 down and he had the ball around the half way line he just stood there and put his hands up as if to say 'What can I do'. It really was poor.   

The worst bit was he ended up passing it to Navas, the skinny homesick Spaniard playing in -10c Manchester, who proceeded to run the width of the pitch and then all the way to the opposition touchline and managed to get a cross in. When Jesus Navas is showing more passion than an academy graduate whose been with the club his whole career you know it's probably time for them to move on.

Couthinho and sterling as left attacking midfield and right attacking midfield both of whom drift infield and out wide as the situation dictates. With hendo in the middle. During the pre season sterling looked the most dangerous making runs towards the middle from the wings. Lucas gives gerrard more time to look forward on the pitch and relieves pressure from everyone. Last season Gerrard was the one making our team tick.
People looked at couthinho and saw him with the little flick passes etc. our whole team even with those flashy moves but alot of it was Gerrard creating space for the team. His positioning, where he flows into on the pitch is ideal for attacks to build. He sits that akward distance from the goal. Where he has his cannon of a shot, he demands to be closed down. But hes so far up that the opposing striker/ cam doesnt drop with him. Who closes him down? A defender. He steps forward out of the box to close gerrard, this creates a pocket of space where those little pass and move interplays occured. Those flowing goals we remeber so well from last season where our players were queuing up to tap it in. He allowed our strikers to recieve the ball to feet on the shoulder of the last man, on the half turn, which allowed a little one-two to tear open defences. This season he has played an even more defensive role than last. This has prevented him from filling those ""akward pockets of space"".
Against Ludogerets Balotelli wasn't getting any balls to feet on the shoulder of the last man, most were when he dropped deep/ hopeful chipped through balls.

It's more that it's not that different from the last in it's core ensemble, and the one part that's different (i.e. the shirt without a tie) actually changes episode to episode, giving nothing that we can really call ""12's own, distinct costume"".

Imo, the Doctor needs his own costume before he starts changing it up at all. And thus far, we've not really seen it. Yes, the red is nice, but it's not that distinctive all on it's own considering it's a part of the frock jacket that's similar to Smith's.

They were postal ballots. The envelopes are opened when they're received to verify signatures, then the ballot papers are placed in sealed ballot boxes until the count.

I'm not familiar with this one, but since the rejected ballots were 0.1% of the total, even if it's true it clearly didn't impact the result. The rejection rate was less than half the rate at the last general election, so there weren't even more rejected ballots than we might expect.

You mean the shot of ballot papers on a table after verifying that there were the right number in the ballot boxes, before the count had started? This one was even [debunked by the Yes campaign](https://twitter.com/YesDundee/status/512750627626049536).

&gt; There are also multiple investigations going on to other possible fraud cases that have yet to come to light. Ten of which were in Glasgow alone.

Similar cases come up every year. If there's any possibility of the fraudulent vote affecting the result then it can be discounted and the real voter's ballot counted in its place. The fraud is guaranteed to be discovered if the real voter tries to vote, so how many undiscovered fraudulent votes do you think there can be, where people have successfully impersonated people who they knew would not vote?

Now I agree, Borini didn't have the world-beating game that the sub thought he did. But what he did do is come on as Rodger's changed the formation to the diamond with 2 up top. And that meant that we started playing bettter, which people credited to Fabio.

Remember the Southampton game, when Lambert came on, and everyone credited him with changing the game? Same situation. They changed the formation, suddenly we look alot better, and Fabio is the one people credit with the change.

I agree that the video of his goal is overhyped and mislabelled as stunning, but personally I think that is the club hyping Borini so that he will start the next game. Same thing happened with Teixeira last season vs Fulham.

But if we play 2 strikers, Borini will play with Balotelli. Lambert and Balotelli are too alike.

She was a fucking shitbag. I'm sure she was only determined to survive so she could continue to attack the back of my legs and hang off my nightie. I was talking about her with my aunt tonight. When I were a nipper my mum's boss paid for us all to go to Miami and Orlando for a fortnight (note to self: must ask mum if they had a 'special' relationship) and my uncle was the poor sod who was tasked with coming to feed her every day. The nasty little fucker had him pinned to the corner of the kitchen; if he'd attempt to walk past she would viciously attack, claws at full mast. He learned to throw his jacket over her when opening the door, would dash to the kitchen, put food down and make a hasty exit. I asked mum recently if I'd traumatised her as a kid; perhaps pulled her tail or teased her too much, but mum said no, she thought she was like that because she was taken away from her mother too young :(

Evil little shitbag! I spent many childhood years with bleeding legs where she attacked me. 

Then mum met my stepdad and I think  he must've given her an ultimatum. I was told Lucy had retired to a big country house where she'd have a lot of space... haha, right :)

I had no work and spent most of the day dying and amusing myself with cats, dogs and the internet. We really need to arrange these meets on Friday nights in future.

But recent polls of the Welsh people, who recieve government papers in both welsh and english, showed that 95-97% of people preferred the English one and just threw the welsh one away.

&gt;And the reason its only 25% is years upon years of the English trying to eradicate it.

Bullshit history from the bullshit history merchants.

England and the English never tried eradicating it. They wanted one language in the administration, and thus taught the Welsh English at school in a similar way in which welsh children are forced to learn welsh (under harsh conditions) whether they want to or not these days (which is why 25% of Welsh people can speak welsh....).

The English never said the Welsh people could not learn welsh. They wanted one language in government and administration to keep costs down. It is not free to print everything twice in two different languages, especially not in the middle ages/renaissance.

As an example, the 'Northern English Assembly' would be made up of the Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria, Northumberland and Durham county councils, who would all be centralised in a single place, be made to have equal numbers of MPs and then manage the Northern counties, with the goal of developing and managing these counties, which would still be individual counties.

The local councils would answer to the county councils in the assembly, and they would answer to Westminster.

Similar assemblies could be made for the West Midlands, East Midlands, the South East and the South West.

They would have authority over most goings on in those areas, however the Central government would still be required to provide detailed and thorough advice and guidence, be responsible for making each Assembly cooperate with each other and also have power over foreign policy, military affairs and other major components.

As for the rest of the UK, the status quo should be retained for Wales and Northern Ireland as there is absolutely no drive for change in those areas. Scotland should be given the extra powers promised.

However, all subsidies should be ended, no matter who they go to.

But then again, most counties in England, if not all, are perfectly happy with the current state of affairs. I know for certain I dont want things to change up here in the North. The Northern Counties are growing and chugging along happily (i should know, I'm a Yorkshireman. The economy is booming!), the Midlands are doing fine and the southern counties are doing fine.

And should it be put to the vote, i would expect a 90+% NO vote, as it was the previous 2-3 times the Westminster lot tried this.",0,1411171228,null,0,1411171472,0,ckn82zt,t3_2guhsq,t1_ckn82zt,t3_2guhsq,null,1426914914,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;So, forcing a bunch of people to learn a different language to their native tongue in order to have everyone speaking the language they wanted isn't eradicating a language now?

Not when the English were saying that the Welsh only had to use English if they were working in a government position.

No one was saying they couldn't use it in their day to day life.

&gt; You're freely admitting they were trying to end up with a one language system,

*IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS*. Not throughout the nation in all forms and positions in every industry. Again, no one was telling the Welsh they could not use Welsh outside government positions.

&gt;but are saying they didn't do anything to cause the loss of the Welsh language?!

Sure, it contributed, but so did the extensive intermixing along the border, so much so that the Eastern half of Wales and the English border marches intermixed so much they are virtually indistinguishable (and the Welsh border regions are also greatly pro-union too, which is no coincidence).

&gt;And in the next sentence you talk about how kids are forced to learn Welsh now as though its an awful thing

Because they are being forced to learn it under penalty of being held back or punished in disproportionate ways due to not learning Welsh.

As for the Welsh Not, read this: http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml

Quote:""This period is associated with that most hated symbol of English cultural oppression, the Welsh Not, or Welsh Note, a means of forcing Welsh children to speak English at school. *A stick or plaque was given to any child heard speaking Welsh during school, to be handed on to whoever next spoke the language.*

At the end of lessons, the child left with the Welsh Not was punished. *Yet according to historian John Davies, it is unlikely that the use of the Welsh Not was as widespread as the mythology of the 20th century maintains.*

There is strong evidence of the Welsh Not in Carmarthen, Cardigan and Meirionnydd before 1870, *but it was never official government policy.* A number of school organisations used it, from the national schools of the Anglicans to the British schools of the nonconformists, *but attendance at these schools was voluntary and if a headmaster had a Welsh Not policy it was with the approval of the parents.*

The speaking of Welsh in schools may not have been prevented by law, but nor was it given any government support or recognition.""

---

&gt;There is disagreement over the applicability of the term *[British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles)* with relation to Ireland. The term is defined in dictionaries as referring to Great Britain, Ireland and adjacent islands.  However, the association between the word ""British"" and the United Kingdom  causes use of the term to be regarded as implying appropriation or overlordship of Ireland by Britain.      Suggested alternative terms include ""Britain and Ireland"",    ""Atlantic Archipelago"",  ""[Anglo-Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Celtic) Isles"",   the ""British-Irish Isles""  and the [Islands of the North Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_of_the_North_Atlantic).  In documents drawn up jointly between the British and Irish governments, the archipelago is referred to simply as ""these islands"".

Let's keep it simple, just England &amp; Scotland. We elect 59 seats, England 533. 592 total so to win a majority you need 297 seats. 

Let's say Labour win 300 and Tories all the rest. It's incredibly likely that about 40 or so of Labour seats come from Scotland. 

So when voting on *non*-devolved issues (military, welfare, etc) it would be all 592 would be available to vote. Labour 300 vs Tory 292. If everyone votes along party line the government can pass laws. 

However if you switch to then voting on a devolved matter you have to remove all the Scottish MP's from the house of commons (or have them sit quietly, whatever) so just the *English* MP's are voting on English only laws. 

But Labour have 40 seats in Scotland, with them gone. So the vote is now Labour 260 vs Tory 292. The Conservatives have a majority that Labour would find it really difficult to overcome.

So you find yourself in this weird situation where the UK-whole government is a Labour majority but the 'English' government is a Conservative majority.

The second was that moment when they're on the Segways and look at each other and just...crack up.  I did, too.  It was silly, they *knew* it was silly, and the *writers* knew it was silly, so they played it up.

One of the reasons I like ""Love and Monsters"" is because it provides a buffer of silliness between some darker episodes.  I like Runaway Bride because it serves the same purpose - a breath between the apparent trauma of Rose's departure, and the arrival of Martha and the opening up to her a little later about where he's from and the loss he's suffered.

My belief is that NI and RoI will both cease to exist in the event of unification. So it will not be a matter of RoI supporting NI but the entire island sharing it's wealth and debt together.

RoI is currently emerging from one of the worst financial crisis it has ever experienced. Yet despite all the hardship endured and cuts and taxes Ireland still ranks ahead of the UK in the [Human Development Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index)

Now remember this Index doesn't take in to account that if Northern Ireland were judged as an independent country it would be much much lower than the UK ranking. And also as /u/3hrstillsundown pointed out, Northern Ireland is poorer than the poorest part of the Republic.

In 10 years RoI will have overcome it's financial problems and NI will still be languishing as a dysfunctional state with a huge deficit dealing with sectarian problems totally reliant on how much England decides to give it. (I will take any bets on this)

The amount RoI has paid off in Bank debts is actually more than what it would cost to unify Ireland. However if we were to invest in doing this we would eventually see a return on the investment. Infrastructure across the whole island instead of just the southern half. The Northern half of the country with a large enough and skilled enough population to finally have it's own successful economy which can compete with Dublin, thus driving down house and rent prices in the Greater Dublin Area.

The people of the six counties would have a far greater say over their own affairs than they ever did with a semi-attached status to the UK.

In terms of UK public sector pensions for people in Northern Ireland, the UK government would still be obliged to pay these as the GFA guarantees full citizen rights for everybody in Northern Ireland regardless of any future decisions.

&gt;

&gt;The __Human Development Index__ (__HDI__) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income [indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics\)) used to rank countries into four tiers of [human development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(humanity\)). It was created by a Pakistani economist [Mahbub ul Haq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahbub_ul_Haq) and Indian economist [Amartya Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen) in 1990  and was published by the [United Nations Development Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme). 

&gt;In the 2010 Human Development Report a further [Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) (IHDI) was introduced. While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that ""the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality)"" and ""the HDI can be viewed as an index of ""potential"" human development (or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality)"".

All I see is the UK being slowly torn apart as if we're totally different people with entirely different political leanings and cultures. 

I don't overly want a change to the voting system. FPTP isn't perfect (putting it lightly) but it works. I wouldn't mind HoL reform if it was done properly (I quite like the retired civil servants serving terms idea, personally) but that'll never get done regardless of who gets in.
I definitely don't want an English assembly nor regional assemblies. I don't want the Scottish, Welsh or NI assemblies getting more devolution - I want Westminster to include them and give them the same sort of attention &amp; funding that London gets, so I wouldn't mind a certain amount of decentralisation without regionalism. 

We're not the US where we can go straight into the idea of states/regional governance  from almost the very beginning. Nor are we Australia where we're doing it with a geographically divided population. Regional devolution will only result in in widening already quite wide divides between the regions when we should be looking for a way to bring us all closer together instead.

The system isn't that broke that it needs replacing but it does need a bit of a touch up and some TLC in places. So no. No founding of a new UK for me, thanks. I have no want or desire for federalism, which seems to be the only option people talking about change have. Instead, I'm all for properly trying to fix the one already here.

I live near the source of the Frome so it has always held a certain curiosity for me. In the last 12 months we had a couple of high tides and it led me to spent more hours than I should like to admit reading about Bristol's problematic situation of having the Frome intersect the tidal Avon. I surfed around the web reading about the original course it ran, the flood plains and assessed risks by the EA and Wessex Water, the Northern and Southern Storm Water Intercepters and culverts, the special engineering and knowledge developed in fluid dynamics and advanced vortex flow controls to cope with the huge volumes of water that could land on us. 

Even some of the names, like ""The Motherload"" are just awesome. If anyone is as sad as me/interested to look, I started on the Wiki for NSWI,

 Prosecutors work for the Crown Prosecution Service; they are completely independent of the police. The Prosecutor looks at the file and decides:
 
 1. If the evidence is strong enough to provide a reasonable chance of conviction in court - The Evidential Test
  
 1. **If it is in the public interest to take the case to court - The Public Interest Test**
 
 These are called the two tests.

--------------------
Is it in the public interest to charge someone who stepped in to help police officers who have just been assaulted themselves, by someone fleeing detainment?

But did he 'technically' assault that person? 

-------------------------------------------
http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Civilian_Powers_of

A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances for the purposes of:

* self-defence; or
* defence of another; or
* defence of property; or
* prevention of crime; or
* **lawful arrest.**


Members of the public (other than constables) may now only arrest for ""indictable"" offences.

There are 2 conditions which apply:

* **there are reasonable grounds to believe the arrest is necessary for a reason specified and**
* **It is not reasonably practical for a constable to make the arrest**

The reasons specified are to prevent the person in question:

* Causing physical injury to himself or any other person
* Suffering physical injury
* Causing loss of or damage to property
* **Making off before a constable can assume responsibility**

&gt;The __BMPT__ ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): ""Боевая машина поддержки танков""; *Boyevaya Mashina Podderzhki Tankov*; literally: ""Tank Support Combat Vehicle"") __""Terminator""__ is a post-Cold war [armored fighting vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_fighting_vehicle) (AFV) from [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia).  This vehicle was designed for the unique role of protecting and supporting tanks and other AFVs to support tank and infantry operations in [urban areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_warfare).   The BMPT is unofficially named the ""Terminator"".  Due to its unique role, it is heavily armed and armored to thrive in urban combat. This AFV features four [9M120 Ataka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9M120_Ataka) missiles launchers, two [2A42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2A42) autocannons, two [AG-17D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGS-17) grenade launchers, and one coaxial [PKTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKTM) machine gun.

If you want, you can buy a larger bin (360L) for $120, and you also have the option of paying an extra $65 a year if you want it to be collected twice a week (for either 240L or 360L)

They provide way more services than my council did in the UK, and they also pay their workers really well. In addition to that I also get a ton of nice amenities, such as a monthly gardener who comes to prune our tree lined street. The state government runs constant surpluses, and in fact they had some money to burn by spending $8 billion on a 10 mile stretch of road to connect two motorways from both sides of the city to improve logistics for freight and to pedestrianise the city centre.

* In 1876, the **British** Lord Kelvin built an analog, mechanical computer to predict tides.

* In 1927, the **American** Vannevar Bush built what was considered apparently some of the most-sophisticated mechanical analog computers.

* In 1936, the **British** Alan Turing described a lot of the elements of the modern computer, introduced major chunks of modern computer science, and introduced some important ideas in artificial intelligence.

* In 1941, the **German** Karl Zuse built the first working electromechanical, programmable digital computer.

* In 1942, the **American** John Atanasoff and Cliff Berry built the first all-electronic digital computer.

* In 1943, the **British** Max Newman built the first electronic digital programmable computer.

* In 1946, the **American** US Army built the first electronical, digital, programmable, Turing-complete computer.

* In 1948, the **British** Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootil built the first stored-program computer (no physically moving wires around required to write a new program); in 1951, this became the first commercially-available general-purpose computer.

* In 1947, the **American** physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley develop the transistor, the building block for most future advancement in computers.

* In 1952, the **British** Geoffrey Dummer proposed the integrated circuit.

* In 1958, the **Americans** Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce created the first *practical* ICs.

* In 1971, the **Americans** Ted Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Federico Faggin (the last an Italian who immigrated to the United States) developed the first single-chip microprocessor.

&gt; A snap poll by Lord Ashcroft asking voters how they had cast their ballots found this age group had voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 71% for Yes.

&gt; However among the wider 16-24-year-old age group the Yes vote was 51%, according to the poll.

I dont think there is absolute info on votes by age, but I would say the above suggests it was very contentious amongst young people. If you remove the 16-17 year old votes from the info above, then it is very possible that you may see 18-24 year olds may have have been incredibly split, or perhaps have even voted no.

This is speculation of course, but that 51% indicates that it wasn't a clean 'yes' vote at all. I would love to see actual voting info by age, if any exists.

&gt;

&gt;According to the Hebrew [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the [Tribe of Asher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Asher)'s land.  However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation.  [*[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources)*] Normally, [*[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)*] Galilee is just referred to as Nafthali.

&gt;Chapter 9 of Isaiah states that [Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon) rewarded his Phoenician ally, King [Hiram I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_I) of Sidon, with the Galilee for ""the nations"", which would have been either the foreigners who came to settle there during and after the reign of Hiram I, or who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the [Assyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria). Hiram, to reciprocate previous gifts given to David, accepted the upland plain among the mountains of [Naphtali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtali) and renamed it ""the land of [Cabul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabul)"" for a time. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The region's Israelite name is from the [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew) root *galil*, an ultimately unique word for ""district"", and usually ""circle"", a noun which has standardized since antiquity in [Hebrew grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_grammar), to be in the construct state, and requires a genitival noun. Hence, the Biblical ""Galilee of the non-Jewish Nations"" is in Hebrew ""*galil goyim*"" (Isaiah 9:1). It previously had other suffixes and following the end of the Phoenecian Empire had different suffixes to the Hebrew culture and its derivatives interchangeably. [*[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)*]

It doesn't seem unlikely the video didn't start until commotion happened, i.e guy grabs flag from girl so we don't see that first sequence. The most logical explanation is that she held the flag, man grabbed the flag, girl grabs it back and finally man grabs it back again.

What is very unlikely is that a man would walk around with both flags in a gathering of people only wearing one type of flag, so we can surely say that wasn't the case.

It is also unlikely that she grabs it from a third party, she wouldn't be sitting down as she is on the video if that was the case. 

Sure there could have been things said prior to the whole flaggrabbing but my experience of the psychology of crowds hold it to be more likely that a guy wearing one flag just didn't like to see a different flag at the rally.

true,theinspectorst,null,null,"&gt;He can't just throw away core campaign promises and expect it to be overlooked.

The idea that the tuition fees policy was a 'core campaign promise' in 2010 is partly a post hoc construction and partly a confusion with Charles Kennedy's campaign in 2005. The Lib Dems absolutely did have a policy to abolish fees but it wasn't any more prominent than any other manifesto commitment - it just came back to bite them because they signed those stupid NUS cards.

The Lib Dem manifesto in 2010 however did list four key priorities (i.e. the non-negotiables), in the knowledge that the Lib Dems were at best looking to join a coalition, not form a majority government. These four were: 1) political reform (i.e. AV ref and Lords reform); 2) increasing the tax-free personal allowance to £10k to lift the lowest paid out of the income tax brackets; 3) the pupil premium, to provide extra school funding for poorer kids; and 4) green jobs. All four of these were part of the coalition programme, although Cameron couldn't deliver on Lords reform, so quid-pro-quo didn't get his boundary reform pet project.

Ultimately, the Lib Dems have delivered something like 75% of their total 2010 manifesto, which is remarkable for a party with about 10% of the seats in Parliament, and much better than the 0% of their promises they would have achieved in opposition.",0,1411193774,null,0,false,0,cknfpq3,t3_2gvudo,t1_cknfpq3,t1_ckn0115,null,1426911283,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

younger people are more willing to take risks.

older people are less likely to want to change.

this statistic, in no way, suggests that those same 16-17 year olds would vote the same way when they are 65+.

Bear in mind also that a majority of 16-17 year olds are naturally preparing to move away from the nest. that desire to become personally independent is predominant. 

Ask 16-17 year olds in a variety of contexts, ""would you like to have more independence?"" and they are going to say ""yes.""

To suggest they are not smart enough to make an informed choice, however, is ridiculous. you only needed to look at the televised debates to see how well informed these members of our society were. Their natural lean towards wanting greater freedom will obviously have an effect on their cognitive dissonance.

However, exactly the same could be said of the population at the other end of the age range; their natural lean towards keeping the status quo will mean they are more likely to listen to and back the argument that supports 'no.'

I'm glad it was a no vote but pleased that younger people got to vote, despite knowing which direction they would lean.

Maybe because Lambert and Balo are to similar- technically proficient, mobile target man, which would be a good point. And Borini/Balo have the italian connection as well. But I think, regardless of partnership, I'm more comfortable with Lambert than Borini as a striker (insert typical PL-proven comment to boot).

So, no organisation that actually wanted to produce a new treatment could operate in the UK.

As well as the regulatory approval side of things, a lot of early target validation relies on animal testing.  For example, you might find that a particular protein is over-expressed in certain cancers (i.e. the cells are producing unusually large amounts of it).  The catch is that you don't know if that over-expression is important in a mechanistic sense (and therefore a possible drug target) or if it is just symptomatic.  Genetically modified mice (knock-out mice) are used to determine this; mice unable to create the equivalent protein are compared to normal mice in order to determine the effect.

true,GlasgowDreaming,null,null,"&gt; people don't actually think those people represent ""no"" do they?

Well they obviously do, they are waving better together placards.

The question is what are the proportions in the no vote.

I would suggest that the proportion of 'no' these people represent is depressingly large, perhaps not the majority, but a significant minority. 10% maybe 20% of the no vote.

The Glasgow voting numbers are misleading, some of these Better Together people will be Greater Glasgow area Larkhall, Airdrie, East Kilbride etc.

It has been notable how little condemnation is coming from Better Together or how weasel-y the reporting has been (BBC has a headline 'both sides clash' - this is not what is happening).

Mostly the Better Together campaign wasn't overtly encouraging this, but they were noticeably vague about rejecting it - This is what is called ""Dog Whistle"" politics,  there was very little care taken by BT about avoiding inflammatory rhetoric (though it might have been ignorance rather then deliberate).  

But whether the BT campaign encouraged, or just let fester for 'useful idiot' voters, is now part of history, it has happened, the 'Scotlands shame' sectarian bigotry has been fueled and will get worse.

The scene is the final one in the barn, the Moment has just taken War, 10, 11 and Clara into Gallifrey in the form of a projection. They're ruminating on their inability to do anything but use the Moment - while still witnessing the projection. The projection ends, 11 voices a desire to change the outcome.

11 lowers the big red button down and off camera and War says, ""There's still a billion billion Daleks up there."" Now, you can be literal if you want and pretend we're talking about the barn. Or you can extrapolate that they're discussing Gallifrey.

As for the time-lock? Please, let's not pretend the rules apply here - War is in possession of one of the most dangerous, irresponsible weapons ever made in the form of the Moment. It has the firepower to commit genocide against both sides of a war, as well as consume part of the universe. It spontaneously and with no trouble whatsoever opened two time windows and facilitated cross-timestream interactivity on a whim.

This was in the days when we were a pretty 'likable' cup team, meaning we didnt get any of the jealousy we get today. And Barca were pretty shit at the time, it was the Galacticos era, and the year of Zidane and the 9th trophy. The most broken I have seen a man over football was after Real won 2-0 at the camp nou in the semi final (watched by us in Holland). I even remember him talking about Lionel Messi who was maybe 14 then, but already talked about by hard core supporters.

He went back to Barcelona and I went back to England, and every time I visited him and his family I loved the city and its people and went to many games at the Camp Nou.

I remember being so happy when they beat Arsenal in 2006.

Obviously we have a rivalry now, but there is no 'banter' about it between us, just a mutual respect. My 'support' of Barca is mainly in La Liga but I hope they do well in the champions league when they play against anyone but us.

I dont really get the rivalry, 2009 sucked but that was the officials, not the Barca team. And debts were paid in 2012.

I thoroughly enjoyed them schooling United in 2009 and 2011.

There are also a few players who have worn both shirts, Deco, Mark Hughes, Albert Ferrer, Petit, Zenden, Belletti (seen the boots he killed Arsenals dreams with), Guðjohnsen, Bogarde (ha), Quaresma, Eto'o and Fabregas.

Mourinho's personal rivalry with them is different. He feels betrayed by Barca but my friends always say its because he is a spurned lover.

I also think there is certain doubt that comes into people's minds when they think of putting the flag up. I remember when Labour were in power, there were always stories about how the police would come round to a person's house and say 'you need to take that flag down because we've had complaints from some people down the road who are a different nationality, saying that the flag offends them'.

This was repeatedly trotted out by Better Together - ""its not like a general election where you can undo everything"" - it isn't true.

I was voting in the 1980s. You want some wisdom from old people? Here is it, you can't undo the stuff that happens in a general election either unless you have a time machine. 

You think if Foot rather than Thatched had become Prime Minister in 1983 the differences would not be significant or reversible?

You can eventually replace the person making a mess (if the mess is impacting the majority of the electorate) but they will have limited resources to undo the mess. 

After a yes vote on the referendum some options would have not been possible (crawling back to England)- but there still would have been plenty other decisions to make.

And we can't undo the no vote either. The majority of Scotland seems to have voted for a massive reduction in the Barnett formula, which will force the Scottish parliament to reduce social benefits - ironically impacting the elderly proportionately more. They have voted for less power to Scottish MPs in National Policy, they voted because the wanted Cameron Milliband and Clegg to stick to an inconvenient agreement they didn't want to make, and a timetable that is alread being ignored.

So be it. There is no going back from the no vote. Scotland is much weaker for it (perhaps it should be).

 [**Twatt, Shetland**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twatt,%20Shetland): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Twatt__ is a settlement in the [Shetland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland_Islands) of [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). It is located on the Shetland [Mainland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland,_Shetland) on a minor road that leads from the A971 road to [Clousta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clousta), north of [Bixter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixter).

&gt;The settlement name originates from the [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_language) *þveit*, meaning 'small parcel of land'.

&gt;The name Twatt is similar to the common [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) [expletive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity) ""[Twat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twat),"" (a vulgar word for [vulva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva) and, by extension, an insulting term meaning a weak or contemptuous individual). For this reason, Twatt remains a source of amusement to people from outside the parish. Its name featured at no. 4 of the most vulgar sounding names in *[Rude Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rude_Britain)*, along with its [Orkney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twatt,_Orkney) namesake.

* Has income from a job which she gives to you

* If you've ever worked for more than a year I think that means you've made contributions such that you get JSA for six months.  After that you mostly don't, but there are complications if you have savings exceeding £5,000.
* The council can and will claim past-due monies at the point you first register.  Best talk to them about payment plans.   Not sure off the top of my head who is liable, your mother, you, or both.  It might be that as an adult you're liable jointly.

&gt; In July 2014, regulations obliging local authorities to permit members of the public to film and use social media in council meetings passed through both Houses of Parliament. These were the Openness of Local Government Bodies Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/2095). These were made under section 40 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014, and came into force on 6 August 2014. These regulations extend to England only.

&gt; 5.1 The previous regime

&gt; Previously, whilst many councils permitted filming, tweeting and blogging from their meetings, others did not. The relevant legislation was section 100A of the Local Government Act 1972: 

&gt; &gt; Nothing in this section shall require a principal council to permit the taking of photographs of any proceedings, or the use of any means to enable persons not present to see or hear any proceedings (whether at the time or later), or the making of any oral report on any proceedings as they take place.

&gt; In other words, councils were not obliged to allow filming, but were free to permit it. The 1972 Act does not oblige councils to ban filming. Neither data protection legislation, nor health and safety requirements, were obstacles to permitting a council meeting to be filmed.

Ghose and Sharkey should have ripped his arm off as he extended the hand of friendship.

&gt; Staggeringly, his offer of help was roundly ignored. Only with ten days to go was Farage prevailed upon by a desperate YES campaign to address some regional meetings. When he did, he was considered by most journalists present to be the star-turn.

true,teamyoshi,null,null,"As far as I know you have done nothing terribly wrong. Obviously this is going to come down to the technical fine print, and you should go down to your local [CAB](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) and find out what they think, as they know more than me, (you could also ask /r/LegalAdviceUK) but as far as I can tell:

* You have almost certainly not committed benefit fraud.

Your Mum is the one who is being paid into your bank account, not you. This should be easy to prove, as the money is presumably coming into your account via your Mum's employers, and has a full paper trail showing that she is the one earning it and not you. Like I said, you should go to the CAB and check, but I highly doubt that you are in any trouble on this front, as you can prove that the money is not a result of you working while on JSA. I suspect that the only consequence of this arrangement is that your mum's pay is technically yours as soon as it hits your account, but again, you should check all this with CAB.

* You are [almost certainly not liable for Council tax.](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/benefits_e/benefits_help_if_on_a_low_income_ew/help_with_your_council_tax_council_tax_reduction_e/council_tax_reduction_and_second_adult_rebate.htm)

Unemployed people do not pay council tax. Obviously your mum should be paying it but that is between her and the council, and the council will presumably have to join the queue with her other creditors. This is her problem, not yours.

&gt;I fear I won't be able to get emergency housing or DSS because of a bad decision I made when I was 19/20.

You should check all this with the CAB, but like I said as far as I can tell you have done nothing wrong.

The only other issue I can think of is the fact that if you don't pay your water bill, you may eventually get cut off, but if your mum has signed the lease on your house, it may well be her problem rather than yours, so again, find out what the CAB think.

If it is any consolation. I suspect that your mum is in far worse situation than you. Once you have been down to the CAB and satisfied yourself of your position you should try and find out what your Mum's exact position is, and maybe try and get her to go along too. Ultimately she is going to need to either pay back her debts, or go bankrupt and either way they will be able to help with this too. Bankruptcy will not be a fun process, and she will have to save up a few hundred quid to cover the fees, but if she can't afford to pay back the debt it is *by far* the most sensible choice.

All I can really say beyond that is in the name of all that is good and holy make sure that you are insulated from this process as far as is possible.

* London is actually by most measures (including $ per square foot) the most, or one of the most, expensive places in the world to live. I say that as someone who lives about 30 minutes outside of it. What is remarkable about london is how meteoric the prices have become in the last 10 years. What were slums 10 years ago (and in all honesty are still slums now) are worth absurd amounts of money. Its not right that you can earn nearly twice the national average wage and still be unable to get a mortgage. 

* I'm not denigrating an older generation by any means. I would make a specific point about ""The war"".... The fucking war. Those 6 years of sufferance have been twisted and contorted by that generation to justify an unparalleled life of comfort in modern history. The people who really suffered in ""The war"" were the poor cunts who didn't come back from it 70 years ago. I realize that sounds like I'm dismissing one of the most important periods in human history or peoples personal struggle - I don't mean to. My point is it was a long time ago and we all just need to move on. It was a different world. Most of the people truly involved in it are already dead and gone in the 1990s. Those that are left alive now were children or young adults at the time and are now in their 80s and 90s.

* The Tl;dr is I couldn't give a fuck how expensive Shanghai is, or how bad my grandmother had it in 1945. I don't live in Shanghai and my grandmother is a decrepit creature with Alzheimer's who couldn't tell you her own fucking name.

true,Carlswaen,null,null,"- The USA has a Federal Government and 50 states, for a population of 320 million.

- Switzerland has a population of 8 million, direct democracy with national and local referendums, spread over 26 cantons.

- The UK has a population of 53 million, a problem with convergent Westminster parties not giving clear water differences on certain key issues (some of which are also key issues in the other constituent UK nations Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland) and 27 county councils.

- Wales has 22 counties, or principal areas and an assembly.

- Scotland has 32 councils, and a parliament.

- Northern Ireland has 26 districts and an assembly.

Clearly England is not too large to devolve, and if some of the other members do think their constituent local authorities would struggle with local management because they're too small then they have devolved regional assemblies or parliaments to pass this authority back up to.   

Westminster parties have become convergent on central issues with no clear water.  Some issues apply to counties/councils as a whole.  Some issues apply to composite nations as a whole but not the wider UK.  Some issues transcend borders and are a UK issue as a whole.

We need a Localism Bill to empower local authorities with greater control over local services and greater autonomy with the same powers granted to the already devolved Assemblies and Parliaments, and to apply all existing Scottish devolution equally across the rUK.    

We need a Direct Democracy Bill for Local and National referendums, empowered by independent Royal Commission to provide expert testimony and legal cross-examination, limited by a minimum popular petition so only the most pressing, key matters fill the referendum in-box.  In this way rather than emerging new parties around key issues being restricted by FPTP, they can instead form effective pressure groups which would have avenues open to them to campaign for referendums and to force parties to engage with the issues.

We need a small regional assembly in England for the smaller counties to exercise their administration if they want to, much as smaller counties and councils in Wales in Scotland might want to pass up to their respective assembly and Holyrood.

Three problems with PR:

- It gives kingmaking power to small political parties which may hold extreme views. By virtue of being kingmakers, these parties have political power in excess of their share of the vote and can use that to hold other parties to ransom.

- It makes political parties even more of an integral part of the system. The rise of the party whip system is the biggest problem with Parliament, because in the past disagreement between Parliament and Government Ministers was an effective check on governmental power. This now happens only rarely (e.g. Syria vote).

An extreme example of this is could be large fleet operator (eg first or stagecoach busses), they don't have to buy insurance because they can prove the have the means to settle any likely claim. They would have ~£10million sat in a bank account ring-fenced specifically as a self insurance guarantee.

&gt;The __Good Friday Agreement referendum, 1998__ was a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum) held in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) over whether there was support for the [Good Friday Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement). The result was a majority (71.1%) in favour. A simultaneous [referendum held in the Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_constitutional_referendums,_1998#Nineteenth_amendment) produced an even larger majority (94.4%) in favour.

Private citizens were allowed to form militias ""in defence if the empire"" both the UVF and IVF could have fallen under this category. So bar the arms smuggling every thing it did was legal, if push came to shove actually fighting the army would probably be illegal, but fighting the army wasn't its aim, its aim was to ensure that Ulster, or a good portion of it was ruled by where its people wanted to be ruled from, the same thing the IVF and the Nationalists wanted.

The Ulster covenant and declaration were publicly signed by over 470 000 people, compared to the American declaration of independence which had 56 or the declaration of the Irish republic which had 7, so there was a great deal of legitimacy of the movement, I know of no other similar document with that amount of signatures.",0,1411210041,null,0,false,0,cknilfj,t3_2gur18,t1_cknilfj,t1_ckn9fz9,null,1426909900,0,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,0

Are you suggesting that ""something getting done"" is automatically better than ""nothing getting done""? Even if that something is bad? Was it better that the bedroom tax was passed than if the Lib Dems had stood up against it? Or the student loans stuff? 

I'm not suggesting that they block everything, but some things are more important than others. People voted for the Lib Dems for a reason, and that reason was not (I'm guessing) to help the Tories pass these kinds of legislation.

&gt;I never want to see the kind of deadlocks and close downs the US government suffers over here because of some stubborn foot-dragger. 

It's not stubborn foot-draggers that are the problem in the US. 

Was Wendy Davis's one-woman stand against the anti-abortion bill in the US unproductive for example? Should she have supported the bill just to make everything a bit easier for everyone?

The problem is party-obsessed contrarians with little in the way of actual principles. One side is typically not blocking the other because of a specific issue with that bill. It's simply because it's the other side who proposed it, pretty much regardless of what's in it. ""You want this new bill passing?

As a football fan  , on a online forum , opinions will be extreme. 

For some reason it annoys you when to see extreme opinions on Borini , you say the hype  for Balotelli is justified. 

The only thing ballo has proved till now is 1 he has talent and 2 he is trouble maker. 
The only thing borini has proved till now is 1 he has talent ( work rate bla h blah blah ) 2 he wants to be at liverpool more than anything 

Now people will make there choices on who they want to back and they will go crazy with there comments .. its a online forum at the end  of the day..  I dont see any sense in getting frustrated when ppl back borini or ppl back balo... ( there were comments on this sub which said Balo will be a liverpool legend  .. amusing isnt it ?  ) 




I generally take the extreme comments with a pinch of sallt on reddit.

Having  said that .. i do agree with your opinion that we should be more objective about analysing performance... there have been so many post match surveys where all players have got score of 8 because we won 4 0 or 4 1 . While people have come to this forum and called players shit very very casually.. but with the nature of reddit , i dont think this will ever change..

EDIT : Just something else to think about , many a time the hype players get on such social media may help the player specially for young players or academy players

Case in point : calling flanno scouse cafu.  It was and still is a ridiculous comparison but to have cafu tweet about it and then actually meet him when he was at Liverpool would definitely have boosted flannos confidence and encouraged him to go a notch higher..

Dirk also came to the club as a support striker but struggled at times for goals, although he did get the last minute winner against United in the cup and those two pens in the derby. At the time we Torres and played the 4-2-1-2-1. Kuyt reinvented himself almost as that box to box winger that we fell in love with.

Without getting ahead of myself or wrapped up in the moment, it's widely known that BR wanted to sell Borini but he wants to stay. Playing time and time up front for a striker who scores occasionally is going to be hard to come by for him. So maybe he'll need to reinvent himself a little the same way Kuyt did. 

Although we've only seen snippets of Borini so far, I'm watching and wondering can he do something to reinvent and play himself into contention. We know BR likes to give players the chance to prove themselves so why not make the comparison?",0,1411211382,null,0,false,0,ckniths,t3_2gvw09,t1_ckniths,t1_ckmzud5,null,1426909796,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Prannet,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"&gt;You might think its basically fine but the vast majority in scotland and a lot of people in the rest of the UK do not agree. Vague platitudes of Westminster paying the same attention they do to London mean nothing and offer no way to make it happen.

""Basically fine"" might be going to far but I think the foundations are there to build upon tbh. We don't have riots in the streets, we have fully functioning cities outside of London and fully functioning councils and services. There's no need to tear that up. You're right in vague platitudes do not help, but when I say the same sort of attention, I mean in terms of funding for infrastructure, for jobs, for services. I honestly think that, at least, part of the problem is that the rest of the country see London getting near limitless investment in pretty much everything but everyone else feeds off scraps. London gets Crossrail, London gets the Olympics, London gets a transport system covering every inch, London has the hubs for big businesses, London's the one that's constantly expanding, London has the seats of power, London's Mayor gets powers before any other. London, London, London! 
I'd love to go down the route of a fairer redistribution of funds and investment and maybe regional mayors given the same sort of powers that Boris has in London throughout the country before we go down the route of chopping things up.


This
&gt;That's the attitude we expect and hate from WM, the dismissal of opinions outside the group of powerful people living in london and the idea that all we really want is for the prime minister to say ""I love you Newcastle"" every couple of years while they take care of the complicated stuff for us.

I don't blame you for at all. It shouldn't be like that.
I'm actually with you on the Westminster dissolution tbh. I haven't had much faith in the system for a few years now myself, but the only way to change it is to be on the inside, which I doubt many of us are.

MPs have no more power over the council than me or you. Talk to your councillors. They're the people with the relevant vote. If you want to change their minds and the vote, you need to be lobbying them, just like the other side is. You can't complain about the result if you're not going to put any effort into change things, especially when other people are. If you're bothered about something enough, do something about it.

One of the main reason you get older people in politics is because mostly retired people have the time and money to get involved in politics and they are generally the ones with property that they care about the value of.

City used to be the Manchester side, the joke was that real Mancunians supported them, not United. They were non-threatening, decent but hardly ever any good. A bit like Aston Villa.

Chelsea on the other hand were disliked even before Roman came. People hated were the cool, vogue team in the 60s, the style of play in the 70s, the Chelsea politics of the 80s (waving wallets full of cash at Northerners, racism etc), and whilst we were rehabilited a bit by Zola, Di Matteo etc in the 90s in the eyes of the viewing public,  accepting Roman's cash and having the gall to win the league was seen as unnacceptable by Liverpool, Manchester Utd, and Arsenal fans. How dare we upset the hegemony. 

City's cash came later, people have already accepted that money/business is crucial (just look at the spreadsheet warriors who support Arsenal), and they were never particularly disliked - in fact they were admired as a local club - before they were bought out. 

Edit: It might also be because City had to spend lots of money on average players when they were first taken over - they were pretty hopeless, and it's taken a while for them to put a good squad together. Chelsea were attractive to players. They were in the Champions League, they were in London and they had a much better base squad than City did.

The fact is that the population has massively increased while the Government has sat on it's hands - it hasn't gone full laissez-faire as building regulations prevent many new developments and certainly new settlements from being established, yet they haven't started construction projects either - so the demand continues to increase meanwhile the supply is kept low.

It's one of the reasons insurers don't want to underwrite a policy fraudulently - they're still on the hook to any third parties once they've flogged the policy, even if it's cancelled a month later.

Note that this doesn't mean it's legal for you to buy a policy and let it lapse, it's just how the insurance industry deals with recovery for uninsured loss - and it's what they mean when they say ""uninsured drivers cause the premiums for insured drivers to go up"". It also doesn't mean you can find the last insurer and contact them directly - you have to go through the MIB.

The difference between Russell Brand and Katie Hopkins + Clarkson is that over the past few years Russell Brand's comedy has not really targeted people, only politicians and institutions. 

Katie Hopkins has said the most offensive bile about many people. Those many people probably have a better license to hate than the people who hate Russell Brand. 

I mean - this is an example of one of Katie Hopkins' jokes:

&gt; “I think Beliebers are sad lonely girls called Rebecca, that haven’t got many friends, that probably have issues with their weight, height and skin.""

Then you could also mention that Jeremy Clarkson was making fun of the plight of sex-workers getting killed on the road. You can kind of see  the distinction that if we in our country had a social scale: Hopkins and Clarkson would make jokes at the people at the bottom - Brand makes jokes about people at the top. Yet for you, Brand is more reprehensible for doing so. 

I do not know why you are expecting Russell Brand to build a roadmap for the future of the country - as a comedian he is there to observe and point out things. I could argue that he knows more than say a politics student because he actually has attended a lot of exclusive functions like at magazine awards and has met personally many times the people behind the institutions he is attacking.

Without any understanding of economic cycles and their causes, or any understanding of systemic risk in the financial sector (and others), and despite being briefed on both repeatedly by both the civil servants and the Bank Of England he genuinely believed that there would never be another recession. ""No more boom and bust!"" 

It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. 

Couple that with his utter ignorance of the Keynesian economics he supposedly admired. 

Keynes said you invest to create growth (true). So this is what GB did. 

The problem is, that's not ALL he said. He said you invest to create growth, and fund it through debt if you must, to *get you out of a recession*. Then, you *PAY OFF THE DEBT IN THE BOOM YEARS!*. 

GB had mostly boom years, and spent stupidly, funded through debt, for most of them. My personal favourite was the ""baby bonds"", he thought we were so rich as a country that we should just give every baby an investment fund (only allowed to be operated by a few select groups he picked) which they'd receive when they turned 18. 

He did this at the same time he had to fund a war. 

That's just stupid. It's a lack of understanding of even the basics of macroeconomic principles, and from a man who had been chancellor for 4 years at the time, that's unforgivable. 

So no, he wasn't a terrible PM, but he was a terrible chancellor and he'd already lost the respect of the public by the time he got into number 10.",0,1411216781,null,0,false,0,cknju5t,t3_2gxxyj,t1_cknju5t,t3_2gxxyj,null,1426909320,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; The problem is that to my knowledge she never declared either her or myself on the council tax

For two years? I'd guess that something has been being paid because I'd have expected to see notes with court dates &amp; similar in the meantime.

She might not have put you on it though, as if there's only one person you get a 25% discount.

With JSA and low salaries you should also get a reduction in the tax, possibly all of it but *you must talk to the council about this*.

https://www.gov.uk/apply-council-tax-reduction

&gt; she suggested that her income be paid into my account as debt collectors wouldn't be able to touch it

I'm not sure if that's actually true. 

&gt; Edit: also will I be in trouble for having mum's wages paid into my account whilst having JSA paid in there too?

As I understand it, JSA can be dependent on your household income, so make sure that your details are up to date. Other than that, this sounds like something that might cause problems if they think you're earning on the side but apart from hassle should be OK. I still heavily recommend splitting your finances!

https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility

Check to see if there are other things you'd be eligible for:

http://www.turn2us.org.uk/benefits_search.aspx

Also, go and speak to your local citizens advice bureau.

&gt; At this point I'm scared for my safety and future because I can't pay back anything if I do owe anything

First of all, breathe. Your situation is complex and admittedly not awesome but there are *lots* of regulations around debt collection, particularly around limiting what they can force you to repay based on income.

You have to break this down into more manageable chunks, a lot of which are just finding things out. So, the key things that come to mind here are:

1. What's the status with the council tax?
2. Are you eligible for other benefits?
6. Speak to CAB
3. Can you split your finances (get her income paid into her account)?
4. You mention debts, what are the debts, how much, who to and are there any interest/fees/etc?

It's obvious that our elected representatives are unable or just not interested in actually 'representing' the citizens that elect them.

What is misleading is using the stats to imply that they are just consequential of drugs being found during other crimes and the only targets being dealers. 

I have seen lots of people arrested for smoking cannabis and rolling spliffs in public. You go out in Belfast on a Saturday night and you see it regularly. The whole notion of ""only dealers are targets"" is false. 

&gt; """"fines"""" 

 in Northern Ireland ? (after going to court possibly)

**The police suspect you have drugs, they will stop you.** (they can stop you and search you anytime)

&gt; If the police stop you and you are in possession of drugs, it is likely that you will be arrested. The drugs found in your possession will be seized and destroyed.

&gt; If you're caught with drugs you may be charged with possessing (or possession with intent to supply - a much more serious offence) controlled drugs, whether it's yours or not. If you're aged 17 or under, the police are allowed to tell your parent, guardian or carer that you've been caught.

&gt; The maximum sentences for possession of each class of drug are:

&gt; * up to seven years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class A drug

&gt; * up to five years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class B drug

&gt; * up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class C drug 

&gt; Sentences can increase a lot more if you are found to be dealing in drugs or supplying them - even if it's just to friends with no money changing hands.

&gt; Cannabis is a Class B drug. 

&gt; In **Scotland and Northern Ireland**, anyone found in possession of cannabis will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal (Scotland) or Public Prosecution Service (Northern Ireland) where a decision on cautioning or prosecution will be made.



    

Holding up extreme cases of ""oh, those people are really bad"" doesn't justify all the cases were regular people who just happen to smoke weed and are arrested.  Claiming that the stats are misleading is false. You are trying to justify it because....... (in that situation....they are bad people being arrested anyway) 

I want bad people arrested too. 

  
   

Onto your hypothetical.

&gt; """"A fella who breaks into your house at night, assaults you and steals your stuff for example. If he was arrested and also had some dope on him he would be in your statistics yet you would probably not say that would be a waste of police time."""" 

Fuck the dope he had. That is irrelevant. He broke into my house, assaulted me and stole my stuff. I want the police to spend their time on that. NOT spend their time testing, analyzing, handling, arresting and prosecuting him for a bit of dope. (I don't care if he didn't have road tax for his car either, why should I)

The law is used against good people too. Can't justify it.

&gt; arrests aren't all due to someone being caught with a joint or two (which is dealt with by fines now anyway). Or even growing a plant or two.

Wrong in vast majority of cases and fines come ONLY after the court gives you it... in N.I.

First, we've seen evidence that the Lib Dems can pick the Tories over Labour - a Lib-Lab coalition in 2010 would have been unwieldy but not outright impossible.

Second, on some of the issues that matter the most to Lib Dems, the Tories have been closer to them in the last 20 years.  Civil liberties is the obvious one: think Blair's and Brown's compulsory ID cards, extraordinary rendition, 90 days detention-without-trial, DNA database, etc. Also decentralisation of public services out of Whitehall, albeit the Lib Dems focus more on empowering local councils whereas the Tories favour new mechanisms like police commissioners.

Third, look at the experience of other countries. The Lib Dems' equivalents in Germany are the Free Democrats, who generally join coalitions with the CDU (Conservatives) on the basis of the economic liberalism but who have joined SDP (Labour) coalitions in the past to pursue social/cultural issues. And there have even been CDU/SDP grand coalitions.

true,Evsie,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"It is the nature of capitalism (and, as yet, we have yet to come up with a better system than ""capitalism restrained"") that businesses and some people will try to make as much money as possible through whatever means available. Ethics/morality don't come into it. That's their role in the system. When they find a way of doing so, others will copy it, and bubbles are born (not all, just most of the serious ones). 

It is the role of government to step in to mitigate the risk. By it's nature it is a reactionary force, responding only to what others are already doing. 

So the booms are pushed by business, and only restrained after the fact by government. 

There are theoretical models which can cope with this better than the system we have, but we have to operate in the real world where globalism is real, where capitalism is often unrestrained and where the golden rule is shareholder value. 

Given all of that, there is no ""Ending"" the boom and bust cycle - only different ways of mitigating it's effects rapidly and minimising harm. 

I do like that quote but Keen annoys me. He's a critic, and some of his criticism is very good... but he never proposes alternatives, it's never ""this is wrong, and here's why"" or ""here's my elegant solution to problem x"" - it's ""you're wrong, and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot and not worthy of consideration"". I'm with Krugman, he's good for making you think and looking again at certain assumptions... but he's not really doing much else.

I never said all those stats were made up of consequential finds, dealing, growing and so on. Just that the way they are presented does not reflect the reality.

And yes it is mostly dealt with through fines, even repeat offenders are unlikely to receive custodial sentences. I work in the courts and haven't seen any minor possession cases for a long time that haven't been dealt with by way of fines. Last two drugs cases I've seen in court which have been dealt with by prison was a fella with 60k worth of drugs and scales and bags and a list of dealers, I'm sure you will agree it was right to prosecute him and a foreign national with 30k worth of heroin, again worthwhile of police time. Plenty of times charges of possession while committing other offences are either not prosecuted or tied in with other sentencing. I would recommend you go sit in on court a few times to see what really happens.

As for a guy complaining after he was caught growing cannabis three times? Well he should have fucking learned by now.

There's plenty of laws I disagree with but I don't break them, and if I did I wouldn't complain when I got caught.

Changing the laws you disagree with is far more sensible than breaking them and crying about it when you get caught.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"He's looking at the wrong stats, though. Guzan has faced less shots than any other goalkeeper in the league except Begovic so far this season. This points to Villa's defensive solidity; in that we are preventing opposition from getting clear chances. We didn't do that last season, but you won't get that conclusion by looking at our pass completion and possession stats, or how many shots we're having.

As a data analyst, I think most of the time, stats are misused in the media when it comes to football. Context is king, but we rarely see stats framed correctly. There are also metrics out there which take context into consideration but people don't understand them well enough to use them widely. People jizz over Xavi's pass numbers and completion rate... but when he makes 100 sideways passes in the middle third, no key passes and no chances created... what has he actually done to directly contribute to his team's win? Compare that to, say, Weimann, making 20 passes in the final third and completing 10, creating four chances. Who had the bigger impact? Yet stats will say Weimann's pass numbers are way lower, and less accurate, and people will say Xavi is more important. It's not that simple.

For example, look at the heatmaps for opposition against Villa. Not many passes or much possession in our final third. So... yeah we concede a lot of possession, and the opposition control the ball better than us... but it's mostly in non-threatening areas. Why do we need to have the ball in the middle third when we can break with enough pace to get from our box to theirs in less than 10 seconds?

TL;DR Savage uses stats to backup his biased opinion of Villa, completely missing the point of having them in the first place.


EDIT : Perfect example. Look at the stats for the arsenal game right now. After ~25mins, we've had waaaaay less possession, but same number of corners and shots (more on target). Yes, possession usually points to more chance of scoring and better chance of victory... but if you're shit when not in possession, it doesn't matter.

true,peetss,null,null,"I agree, poor form by Isla.  Does Onuoha play RB?  If so, I would comfortably slot him in ahead of Isla.  I would much rather that than replacing Ferdinand for Onuoha.  I think, ideally, our best formation is Traore, Ferdinand, Caulker and Onuoha at the back.  It will be interesting to see how Traore handles a top class right wing player.  His attacking qualities and pace are enough for him to remain in the starting XI however I think his style of play was more suited to the 3-5-2.  What do we do on the left wing?  Does Traore come all the way up, or do we play a left midfielder who slots into that attacking left wing role?

In the midfield, I think we stick with five.  Hoilett, Kranjcar, Barton, Fer and Phillips.  Kranjcar is dangerous, we saw that against Stoke and I think we will continue to see that, his fitness alone speaks to his resolve this season.  I don't think we need to justify why Barton deserves a spot, so onto Fer.  This could've really been Mutch or Sandro but I went with Fer because he's been in the starting XI and has looked good.  Phillips makes an appearance on the right wing and I think his pace, size, strength and crossing ability warrant it.  Ultimately he brings width to the team and we need that.  On the left, I put in Hoilett and that is the only area in midfield I wasn't sure about.  Who do we have who provides good width on the left wing, and can deliver a quality cross?  I think Hoilett is the guy, he is nimble and sneaky as well.  The problem is that Traore also overlaps in this role, being someone who likes to come forward and attack.  If Traore is more suited to being our guy on the left wing than maybe we switch out Hoilett for Mutch or someone who is better suited at covering left back when Traore goes forward.

Up front I think we stick with one.  Austin to start and Vargas to sub, but we have to be careful with our strikers as they are in short supply.  I was a tad worried to see both Vargas and Austin on the pitch against Stoke today because if one goes down, we severely hurt our chances going forward.  It is no surprise we are light at striker and for that reason I think we can only afford to stick one up front.",0,1411223688,null,0,false,0,cknlt46,t3_2gy86o,t1_cknlt46,t3_2gy86o,null,1426908332,4,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,4

true,albacore_futures,null,null,"Leverage. In addition to his personal capital and that of his partners (such as Lewis, whom some sources think made more than Soros' $1bn that day), he arranged for loans from banks on margin to do more.

Soros would borrow in pounds, then use the pounds to buy other currencies (dollars, DMs, Lira, Francs, whatever he could get). He would have to repay the pounds he borrowed, but when the pound went under, it became much cheaper for him to re-buy the pounds after it crashed. 

Hypothetically, let's say the GBP-USD was trading at £1.00, meaning that 1 US dollar buys 1 GBP. Soros borrowed say £10 million, and bought dollars, so now he has $10 million USD. The pound gets weaker as a result of the economic conditions (and his trade, which effectively floods the market with pounds), and as a result the GBP-USD falls to £1.20. That means that it now costs £1.20 to buy $1.00, or vice versa, $1.00 buys £1.20 pounds. Soros borrowed £10 million, so he now has to spend $8.3 million US dollars to buy that £10 million pounds. The other $1.7 million stays in his pocket as profit. 

Soros basically did that, but also borrowed lots of money from British banks to supplement his trade. One of his biggest problems was finding banks willing to participate in the amounts he required. So if he bet £10 million of his own, he might also borrow £50 million from other banks to supplement his trade.",0,1411224323,null,0,false,0,cknm15i,t3_2goocs,t1_cknm15i,t1_cknk170,null,1426908227,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; This sort of thing has happened since the dawn of football.

It's part of the ""home field advantage"" you as a player are supposed to know about the quirks and changes to your own pitch and know how to exploit them. 

It happens in virtually every major sport to some degree. Baseball teams will have the field manicured to tailor to their style (foul lines and in front of home plate that are packed down to increase the chance of a fair ball on a bunt, long or short grass in the infield/outfield to slow/speed up the ball for example).

Boston had 2 great examples of it when both the Bruins and Celtics were still playing in the Garden. The parkay of the Garden had well known ""Dead spots"" that could throw off someone dribbling the ball or bounce passing the ball, but all the Celtics players knew were they were and knew how to avoid or use them to their advantage (there was also a fantastic episode of Cheers that poked fun at this when they had Kevin McHale get injured while trying to count bolts in the floor during a game), likewise the Bruins playing in the same arena had a rink that was noticeably smaller than virtually any other rink in the league, it also had bizarre quirks in the boards (there is video out there somewhere of a player scoring by hitting a seam on the boards and it deflecting into net from a good distance away).  Teams just had to deal with these quirks when they played in Boston, just as Boston had to deal with entirely new types of quirks when playing on the road.

The fact is teams will adjust the pitch of their home stadium if they feel it gives them an advantage...like you said, it has happened forever and will continue to do so.

It is up to our team to figure out how to adapt to this.  We can't hide behind the excuse of ""the pitch was shit"" every time we play poorly....these guys are professionals, if they can't figure out how to play on a shit pitch then this season is going to be a fucking long one where we can only compete at home.

Defensive concerns. We have to introduce some competition in defence because something looks off between Rio and Caulker. A lot of goals have come from Rio's bad marking -- why not give Onuoha the chance to shake things up a bit? Isla, too, looked a concern today, with both goals coming from his side. 

Ref. Didn't get a proper view nor the benefit of a replay but it definitely looked like Crouch climbed on Rio for their first goal. Ref also let them get away with an unbelievable amount of dirty play in the box. Not to mention the amount of timewasting that he didn't seem to mind in the slightest. Which brings me to the next point.

Stoke. What a bunch of pricks. Dirtiest team I've seen at Loftus Road. Two substitutions used just on injuries. Don't even need to mention the corner defences or the shirt pulling either. Something is seriously wrong with the rules when Shawcross, from behind, can clatter straight into Kranjcar on the turn, and get the same penalty as Fer did when he tried telling Shawcross what's what. 

Goalscoring. Would've loved a goal from open play today: all three goals off set pieces is not a good sign. I gotta say it, Austin sort of looks out of his depth. His first touch is heavy and he loses the ball or doesn't distribute it properly too often. He deserves time to adjust to the Prem but it's not been an auspicious start I don't think. Pleased with Vargas's off-the-ball movement though.

Put it this way... How many drug raids per week do the PSNI do? (One or two, maybe 10 in a really big week) 

How many people arrested per raid... Zero to Three. Maybe an average of 1.5.

Those* are reasonable guesstimates. And the amount of people you hear of, arrested for simple possession would imply the vast majority are casual users getting arrested. 



No hope in getting detailed facts in N.I. ffs.. Even in the U.K it's hard to get actual facts.  


As for the Fine.... You have to go to court to get the fine. You are fined as punishment, NOT as a replacement for conviction as in England or Wales. The non-custodial sentences are mainly irrelevant. It is still a conviction for drug possession. It still ruins people's lives by being recorded even if they don't actually go to jail. And...If you don't pay the fine you go to jail. 

So as with not paying for a TV license, you can go to jail for it via the fine route too.


I disagree with your method for enacting change though. You have to disobey authority when they are wrong. If someone does something wrong and you are NOT ALLOWED to tell anyone.... you have to disobey.  The act of smoking cannabis has no victim and the law can be disobeyed without victims being created.

England is 83% of the population. There's no way to treat the member's ""equally"" in absolute terms without England being grossly under-represented on a per capita basis. Otherwise you'd end up with 15% of the population dictating how the upper house behaved, which is clearly undemocratic. Splitting into upper and lower elected houses does nothing to mitigate that fundamental inequality.

Excluding Ireland, which was effectively annexed and continued to suffer in various unpleasant ways, this system has worked pretty well in the UK, and I don't think it's the cause of the current independence movement.

The Scottish situation can be put down to a number of issues - dissatisfaction with devolution, widespread hatred of the tories, a far more effective campaign marshaled by the Yes, engaging the young (and allowing 16-18 year olds to vote).

He seemed to settle down a bit at the end, but his first touch when receiving a ball coming with any kind of power is woeful. I would've thought Hoilett would've been a wiser choice to compliment the Vargas and Austin partnership. The man can't cross, but when you're playing next to a poacher and a pace merchant his scrappy balls would've sufficed.

The midfield was like a gang of strangers for chunks of the first half. Misplaced passes and seemingly little instinct and confidence in moving the ball into dangerous positions.

I'll forgive Traoré most things as I like his attitude and his workrate is great. He is flawed though, and he gets mugged down his flank. I anticipate a lot of facepalm moments with him over the coming months.

""Let them play"" seems to be the plan. I can't discern any solid tactical strategy any more. It seems to me that the one thing we have in abundance is pace, and we could use more long balls. Too many spells of passing the ball around the box and never finding a decent moment to bank a nice shot. A bit of deja vu from last season, to be honest.

I think St. Charles Austin is a square peg in a round hole. He isn't a battering ram, he isn't a hold-up man, and he isn't a footwork wizard. To me he is a grafter...and I'm not sure he is suitable as the tip of the spear at this level. I'm still not sure what to make of Vargas, but I think I think he is still suffering from lack of matchtime with the rest of the squad.

Two questionably fit players had to be subbed off. I really wish they would take a look at why we keep getting so many soft tissue injuries.

I think Onuoha and Yun are getting screwed over by Redknapp.

Kranjcar hands down man of the match. Superb stuff from him - he just needs to keep it consistent. One of his passes came flying towards my corner of the ground and time almost slowed down as I gazed upon the beautiful spin that characterised the perfect weighting. Still would have been nice to have Taarabt on the bench to cover for him in an emergency though. Hope he recovers soon.

Also have to mention my appreciation of Karl Henry. Non nonsense player, gets on with the job, a clockwork defensive midfielder.

If I was Stoke I would be cursing the string of fouls at the end that gifted us that beautiful goal. With a bit of restraint they could've taken all three points. They had some nasty looking characters among their support. I haven't heard such focus and passion aimed at Sombrero Man before. Then the same characters surprised me by generously applauding the tiger cubs at halftime.

The problem in NI is the unionist politicians that are bible bashers that hold everything back. As a unionist I hate to say it but they are a huge problem.

From my viewpoint (from the courts) I would say there are a lot more than you estimate that aren't just simple possession cases (ill call those ""criminal"" cases) and you don't see many possession cases in the crown or county courts. Plenty in the magistrates courts and I agree that it harms peoples lives and there should be a better way of dealing with it.

I am fairly sure for a first time possession charge all you get is a warning and a formal caution, it only goes to court for repeat offences but I cant be sure on that and think it also depends on quantity. 

If you sit in on court you will also see that the judges do have a very common sense approach to cannabis possession, which is a good thing. Another issue we have is that many defendants claim cannabis addiction as a defence which does not help getting it legalised.

I hope with the success of Colorado it will be legalised which will help with the illegal growing, smuggling, dealing and so on but at the same time I think the penalties surrounding heroin should be increased, its scary stuff.",0,1411226511,null,0,false,0,cknmjpr,t3_2gp7r4,t1_cknmjpr,t1_cknmd2m,null,1426907987,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,TheAppleManSam,null,null,"&gt; England is 83% of the population. There's no way to treat the member's ""equally"" in absolute terms without England being grossly under-represented on a per capita basis. Otherwise you'd end up with 15% of the population dictating how the upper house behaved, which is clearly undemocratic. Splitting into upper and lower elected houses does nothing to mitigate that fundamental inequality.

Yes, it does.

England dominates the Lower House because it's the most populous state, it's balanced out in the Upper House because *all* constituent countries of the United Kingdom would be considered equal in that chamber.

England deserves the domination it has of the Lower House because of it's population. It's economic contributions and population would be recognized through that domination. 

&gt;Excluding Ireland, which was effectively annexed and continued to suffer in various unpleasant ways, this system has worked pretty well in the UK, and I don't think it's the cause of the current independence movement.

The Union was almost shattered. This isn't about the politics you chose it's about the integrity of the Union in itself. It's not about which way you lean, but how much representation your country gets in choosing that national lean. 

&gt;Despite all that, I don't think anybody in Scotland feels they deserve greater representation at national government - they just want more Scottish issues to be dealt with by a Scottish government.

That...that is a very big assumption you just made...and one I think is fundamentally wrong.

Yes, they want more autonomy, but they also want more say in the national government. Scotland wants more representation in Westminster, it wants England's influence to be checked more &amp; the national interests of all constituent countries to be more balanced on the national stage.

Many feel like they deserve it since the identity of the United Kingdom is based around Scotland being a equal member in the Union with England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland, not a lesser one.

&gt;It was almost - due to a confluence of unfortunate circumstances rather than any innate instability in the system. It's been pretty stable for 300 years.

A lot has changed in 300 years. 

Ireland has left, Scotland is almost gone, North Ireland was the site of mass instability for decades, the Empire is gone, degrees of autonomy has been devolved to all countries in the Union &amp; the House of Lords has been neutered and made almost-defunct.

&gt;I've spoken to many Scottish people about independence, and not one of them has suggested this. In what possible sense is Scotland a lesser member than Wales or NI? The idea has always been about individuals within each country being treated equally, not about the countries themselves being artificially over-represented.

Not a single Scottish person you've spoken to, online as well as in real life, who was voting Yes or seriously thinking about voting Yes, has mentioned being underrepresented at Westminster? No Scottish person you had a talked to to talked about Westminister being dominated by a single country or region?

And here's why, a 'country' is usually a sovereign state however none of the 'countries' of the UK are sovereign states...but they used to be. Northern Ireland is a statelet created by the UK as a part of itself hence if we use the term 'country' for Northern Ireland what we have is a country created by another country to be a part of said country...doesn't quite sound right. I believe Northern Ireland is indeed a geopolitical entity but I don't think it quite meets the criteria to be considered a country.

""A country is a region identified as a distinct entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.

Sometimes the word country is used to refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,[1][2][3] while other times it refers only to states.

It's not even a nation state when you think about it, Northern Irish is a growing term and I welcome that, but we don't really know what exactly that means yet and when you get down to it people are going to consider themselves either British or Irish one way or another.""

There are obviously ethical/social issues you just might not agree with them. And in what way do they economically make complete sense? There are a hell of a lot of economic and political problems with GMOs. This is something I wrote before;

GM for example; http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ditcted2012d3_en.pdf

&gt; Broadly speaking, countries making a substancial shift to GM crops are in a group where food secruity has either shown no improvement (e.g. United States), or where it is declining (e.g. Argentina).

&gt; The predictable pattern and quality of glyphosate herbicide use in GM agriculture has caused the evolution of resistance in weeds on a scale never experienced in the decades of glyphosate use prior to GM crops, leading to a return to tilling and the use of other herbicides for weed control...

This paper also argues that comparing USA and Canada GM crops with EU none GM crops ""...maize yields are very similar in the two agroecosystems, and Western Europes's rapeseed yields are about double those of North America. This trend has not changed since the adoption of GM plants in North America.""

And it talks about the problem of mono-culture which GM promotes and further problems.

There are also no studies that show GM has LONG TERM yield increases.

Then we can go on to the economic argument. GM is just terrible economics, giving the power of the food supply to a handful of transnational corporations [which have monopolistic power] (http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/CartelBeforeHorse11Sep2013.pdf)

[Lobbying is also a problem] (http://www.taxpayer.net/images/uploads/downloads/Political_Power_of_Farm_And_Crop_Insurance_Lobbies_Fact_Sheet.pdf) We surely do not want a handful of companies to have so much power over something as important as the food supply. It has not worked well in the banking sector, utilities, fossil fuels... Monopolistic power is terrible for consumers and great for corporations. We don't want massive food corporations that are too big to fail.

[Or the bullying of farmers] (http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/monsanto-lawsuits-from-family-farmers-zwfz1302zkin.aspx#axzz36IwTZWF7)

 [and this] (http://truth-out.org/news/item/16985-life-in-the-rural-police-state-of-monsanto)
 
There is a lot to be worried about including [our dwindling food varieties] (http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/food-variety-graphic) which GM does nothing to address and possibly increases the problem.

Some people have said that Scotland is fundamentally politically misaligned with the rest of the UK, but that's not the same as being underrepresented. If anything, Scots are overrepresented as their MPs vote on issues that don't even concern them i.e. the West Lothian question.

Most people don't see artificially incentivising Scottish people to remain in the union as a sensible or sustainable strategy.

But you'll often see NI being named as one of the *countries* (notice that it'll always be italicised in this context) of which the UK is comprised, so take from that what you will.


I don't consider NI to be a country, and I come from an entirely neutral political background (mixed marriages wahhhh).

I'm suggesting more of a compromise that keeps the system we have for 'business as usual' but includes a mechanism to invoke a referendum should the folks on the hill drag their heels on contentious issues of compromise. As they often do. The intention being the main parties would know that if they didn't settle the issue it would be settled for them, therefore through time there would be fewer and fewer referendums as the politicians begin to respond to this automated removal of power.

Probably my fav pub in Cardiff is the Goat Major. I really like this pub, its small and run by Brains so normally has some SA or Rev. James on:

http://www.sabrain.com/goatmajor


I normally like to go eat Faggots peas and chips in the market while people watching:

http://www.cardiff-market.co.uk/


Also the Pear tree is a nice place to have a beer, its not in the Centre though, however it is close to Roath park, which is really nice and you can take a boat out on the lake:

http://www.sabrain.com/peartree

If you go down the bay I'd suggest the water taxi trip as it nice to take in the sights. Also I'd go to the welsh cake shop, they are lovely fresh.

http://www.fabulouswelshcakes.co.uk/index.php

I also quite like Penarth, although its been a while since I have been down there. It has a nice pier:

http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-trust-special-places-penarth-7567603

Cardiff does have its own museum, its right in the centre but I have not been in a while:

http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff

St Fagans is good and people who come to Cardiff like it. We used to go there a lot for school so I've not been in a while:

http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans


If you go north of Cardiff you can take in Castle Coch an also Caerphilly castle. If you do I'd suggest popping in to Fagin's as thats a really nice pub (although the locals can be a bit clicky). Also really nice for a meal is the Gwaelod (this is where we normally go for special occasions as everyone likes it).

A bit further out is rest bay which is a nice beach that is normally quieter than Barry/Porthcawl:

I also really like Ogmore the beach is rocky though. The castle has stepping stones across it:

Because you are a Union of Countries, not a Hierarchy of Countries. 

Same reason the UK has a Veto on the UNSC just like China, just like Netherlands is afforded as many commissioners &amp; council members as Germany. 

You recognize the fact that there is a very real difference between being a citizen of a English county &amp; a Welsh country. You recognize the fact that the United Kingdom is a collection of nations, not just a collection of British citizens *(as hard a pill as that is too swallow)*.

&gt;Some people have said that Scotland is fundamentally politically misaligned with the rest of the UK, but that's not the same as being underrepresented. If anything, Scots are overrepresented as their MPs vote on issues that don't even concern them i.e. the West Lothian question.

So why do you oppose devolution? 

&gt;Most people don't see artificially incentivising Scottish people to remain in the union as a sensible or sustainable strategy. Sure, most Scots would vote No if they got 2 votes per head, lower taxes, higher public spending per capita and a free iPhone but it doesn't mean it's fair or a reasonable demand.

There is a very big different between a hand-out and equal representation in a Upper House.

-Not scissor kicking people while on a yellow

-Our wingers are fast, but not fast enough to knock it past the full back every time. Could have just been the circumstances of the game, but it was still poor to watch.

-Montero is wonderful, but he can't do it alone. Needs to pass more.

-Fullbacks are a definite weakness this year. They can't get beat like they did today against Everton. Lukaku will put those crosses away.

&gt; I'm not saying you should bribe Scotland; but I am saying Scotland's voice should be recognized as a country in union with England, North Ireland &amp; Wales.

As you keep saying. I still don't see why it's desirable that people's voices ought to be arbitrarily diminished or amplified in proportion to the size of the country they live in. If you can express that in any other terms than ""because they're a different country"" or some simile thereof, I'll be impressed. *Why*?",0,1411230117,null,0,false,0,cknnw05,t3_2gy3ct,t1_cknnw05,t1_cknnldm,null,1426907361,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

They're not natural bedfellows, the Spanish lot have their own clique, as do the young English players and the African lot.

Mignolet is far more likely to be mates with the older guys like Skrtel, Gerrard, Johnson, Jones etc, while Sakho is more likely to hang out with Toure and Balotelli.

They're prone to inaction and backroom negotiations because of this. Even an independent Scotland would have sought much closer ties to rUK than to Europe or the UN...


Oh jesus I'm not saying the United Kingdom should become like the United Nations pr European Union, I was only giving a example of how other countries could be considered equal.

I would've mentioned German states, Canadian provinces, Australian states &amp; American states, but people tend to get touchy when you compare the UK's constituent members as anything other than countries/nations...which...actually aides my argument...but I digress.....

&gt;As you keep saying. I still don't see why it's desirable that people's voices ought to be arbitrarily diminished or amplified in proportion to the size of the country they live in. If you can express that in any other terms than ""because they're a different country"" or some simile thereof, I'll be impressed. Why?

Because they are separate. But the people of each consider themselves to be equal to the others in supranational terms. 

How...how do you not understand this? How do you not understand where I'm coming from? lol

But hey, you know what. *You win.* This is completely healthy for the Union &amp; in no way will it *ever* backfire or make other countries strive for independence &amp; the fragmentation of the Union.

Ok so you sound like Sean Hanity just an absolute tirade of abuse one after the other hoping something will stick.

&gt;drug adled 

nope.

&gt;bohemian 

Oh god not bohemian!

&gt;champagne socialist

Really. Left-wing and successful. That invalidates everything he has to say. Unless he' gives away everything and lives in the gutter his desire for social justice is sickening.

&gt;dipshit 

Ah insightful.

&gt;lothario 

Really?? Really, really?

&gt;cunt 
..

&gt;with no real opinions and no solutions 

What do you count as an opinion or a solution? Let's hear one of your most heartfelt opinions and solutions - not a joke a real genuine opinion / solution .

&gt;who talks how stupid people think smart people sound

I wonder how well you'd do being browbeaten by journalists. I'm going to guess you're going to come off rather worse than Russell Brand. I'll give your last comment as evidence for that.

There was trouble in Glasgow. 

A devo-max option avoids this as it was a compromise with less at stake. It was clearly the most popular in polling as well, to prevent it was a poor move for a so-called democracy.

Odd that no-one had trouble with these ""complex"" polls with 3 options that you seem to think they would in a referendum...

Also, the idea that we could get a 33.33.../33.33.../33.33... split in 3 choices is only slightly more ludicrously improbable than saying we could get a 50/50 with 2 choices.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If you don't think that you're hideously ageist then you need to read up a little more. Your first line:

&gt;Hilarious point of view considering how out of touch old people are in the modern world.

Broad sweeping negative generalisation. I know plenty of over-65s who are very much 'in touch' with the world.  I know plenty of under-65s who barely interact with the world in any real sense.  My own mother, a woman who started collecting her pension years ago, runs around protesting, speaking out and organising peace forums.  She can out-talk me on many aspects of politics and environmental issues.  She goes out more than most people I know and has attitudes towards gender and sexuality that are certainly more progressive than the average.

..but then I wouldn't expect you to know her.  I'm currently watching a debate between Tony Blair and Chris Hitchens.  Hitchens, someone who no one with half-a-brain would describe as 'out of touch' was 61ish at the time of this debate.  If he hadn't of been struck down by cancer, he'd be collecting his pension now.

..or perhaps reddit's favourite oldie, Ron Paul who is **79**. Is he 'out of touch'?  Is he more 'in touch' than some of his younger peers?

The examples are endless and your statement is both ageist and provably wrong.

&gt;They tend to be conservative, holding on to the past when the past has become entirely obsolete.

- Black people in the US tend to be violent.  

- Western women tend to be neurotic.

There's stats to support both of the above statements so I can't be racist or sexist for making them?  Right?  I would hope you would be 'progressive' enough to realise *why* both of those statements are problematic.  I'd hope you'd be 'in touch' enough to understand concepts such as socialisation, racial/gender expectations and self-fulfulling prophecies.

Another source of ageism in *that same sentence* is the bit where you say that 'they' hold onto the past when it's entirely obsolete.  You appear to think that any knowledge that is gained in the past is wholey useless.  This is clearly incorrect.  Whilst there are plenty of areas where progress will make knowledge from previous years redundant, most areas this is not the case.  Does Helen Mirren (age 69 and being awesome) need to go to actress classes to learn all the new techniques?  Should Tony Benn (aged 88 when he died this year) have gone back to uni to learn how to be a proper modern politician?  Does my Dentist..still practising in his mid-late 70's need to do any more than the CPD he (presumably) already does?

&gt;Progress is achieved by the progressive, the young and those more in tune with modernity and freshly schooled.

The first bit is a ridiculous truism and not worth talking about.  I don't think you're daft enough to actually think that all progress is achieved by 'the young' - Nelson Mandela was aged 72 when he was released from prison - did he achieve 'progress' in the next 23 years?  BF Skinner, the biggest name is behavioural psychology was still publishing well into his 70-80s and was still a Harvard professor well past when he should have been collecting his pension.

&gt;This whole older is wiser bullshit is a product of a world that doesn't exist anymore

When you hit 65, I hope that the people around you aren't quite so willing to throw you out for rubbish as you are for them.

&gt;I'm 42 btw

He could be funny and just instantly turn into this Dark man who talks about death and how he will kill every single bloody dalek. On other hand Matt could do the other thing he could be Serious and funny at the same time he could be confused and understand the situation perfectly at the same time.
I also liked his style of fashion Cough cough^Bowties ^are ^cool
The hairstyle and the costume fitted perfectly on him and it was perfect for his style. There just was something charming about him.

&gt; **S. Dunn; H. Dawson (2000), An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Lampeter: Edwin Mellen Press**,*""One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-alphabeticalNI-6)


&gt; **D. Murphy (1979), A Place Apart, London: Penguin Books**, *""Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-placeApart-8)


&gt; **J. Whyte; G. FitzGerald (1991), Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford: Oxford University Press**, *""One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-interpretingNI-7)


There is no clear cut answer because NI exists at best as a **region** within the United Kingdom not as a Country. The truth of the matter is that NI will forever be in a transitory stage; forever contested; until the matter is fully resolved one way or another.

Just to add to the Ogmore recommendation.

[Southerndown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southerndown) is the next beach over to the East of Ogmore which is my personal favourite of the two. There's a nice walk around the old castle gardens and up the the top of the hill.

&gt;&gt;*The city of [Chester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester) was also historically called Caerleon. For the champion racehorse, see [Caerleon II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerleon_II)*

&gt; __Caerleon__ (/kərˈliːən/; [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Caerllion*) is a suburban village and [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(Wales\)), situated on the [River Usk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Usk)  in the northern outskirts of the city of [Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales), [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales). Caerleon is a site of [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological) importance, being the site of a notable [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) legionary [fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castra), [Isca Augusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isca_Augusta), and an [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age) [hill fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_fort). The Wales [National Roman Legion Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Roman_Legion_Museum) and [Roman Baths Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Baths_Museum) are in Caerleon close to the remains of Isca Augusta. The town also has strong literary associations, as [Geoffrey of Monmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth) makes Caerleon one of the most important cities in Britain in his *[Historia Regum Britanniæ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Regum_Britanni%C3%A6)*, and [Alfred Lord Tennyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lord_Tennyson) wrote *[Idylls of the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idylls_of_the_King)* while staying there.

true,Suttreee,lfc99,,"Hey everyone. I'm trying to learn a little more about the tactics of the game, so I have some questions I hope someone can give me some answers to(o?).

1. Everyone is talking about how shit Liverpool are at defending set pieces. Exactly what is going wrong? Is it the man-marking? As I see it, there are often areas that are totally uncovered by the Liverpool defenders, while the opponents that score, or at least become a danger, have their assigned Liverpool-player far behind them. Is this a fair assessment? This wasn't the case on the first goal today, but in the other matches I've seen this.

2. Liverpool changed to a 3-5-2 halfway in this game. Before that they seemed to be completely dominated in midfield, however it has been looking a little better now. But isn't this the same 3 man central midfield as before? What exactly changes and am I right to think that it has worked?

3. What kind of a player exactly is Borini? I think he's been the most active player in our attack so far this evening, although it hasn't amounted to anything. He still seems a little underwhelming, but in a though and physical game like this, he seems to be a valuable player, although perhaps one lacking some flair.

4. People are often saying that Lucas and Gerrard can't play together, because they both lack tempo. I think Lucas has been looking better than Gerrard so far, but generally I think Liverpool have been caught more on position than on speed. Does this seem fair?

5. Liverpool has opened slow both against Villa and West Ham, while these two teams have shown great amounts of pressure and will from the start. If this is a trend, could it be an idea for Liverpool to begin games by laying low and keeping players behind the ball, and then gradually move towards a possession-based game?

6. I think Skrtel is a really good player and I don't think he warrants to much critique. This isn't a question, I just wanted to say that.

Thanks for any answers that may come.

Not strictly?  It's not in any way shape or form.

&gt;Also for many people this is their tax money coming back to them

Which is the issue in the first place, lower the taxes, and they have more money to spend how they see fit.

Most people I know who are just entering the 40p rate, do not live alone, they flat share.  They will live in one room, sharing all other areas.  We are taxing them, they are having money they earn from work removed.

Meanwhile we have people who are in subsidised housing with empty rooms.  The issue, as I see it, is the way this benefit cut was implemented, the failure to understand between someone who once had children living there, and someone who has mobility issues etc.

Sturridge and Suarez had an amazing partnership but their relationship was professional and nothing more other than being on good terms. They certainly didn't seem to hang out together judging by social media posts.

Rooney and Scholes played together at United for nearly a decade, but don't even have each other's numbers.

I can have my opinion on limited information, so can you. You **do not** call me a cunt and insult my social life for no reason but for having a different opinion, especially as yours has the same (and that's being kind) factual basis.

Players form cliques in the team, you can't possibly debate that. Look at Enrique and the Spaniards, or Sturridge and Sterling, Ibe, Henderson etc. Gerrard and Carra both talk in their autobiographies about the African/French cliques in Houllier's Liverpool, both of which were regarded as insular.

I have no doubt that Mignolet and Sakho get on. However, based on social media posts from other teammates, their different upbringings and the far more likely candidates to be friends, I don't think they will be particularly close.

Your conclusion, meanwhile, is based on the idea that everyone gets on fantastically and there aren't any cliques.

true,RF20Lennon,null,null,"Series 1: 6.5/10. It was a great way to bring back Doctor Who without a doubt but it was still too cheesy, too character heavy and cliched plotting and downright horrible production quality for my taste.

HIGHLIGHT- The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances

Series 2: 7.5/10- David Tennant saved the show! The Stories got a little better. But the forced romance was getting on my nerves and series finale had DALEKS again.

HIGHLIGHT- Girl in The Fireplace

Series 3- 7.9/10- Again David Tennant was superb and I quite like Martha, loved the Master and the series finale was slightly better. Loved the YANA stuff and the storylines were generally a lot better and more fun. 

HIGHLIGHT- BLINK

Series 4- 7.3/10- Donna was awesome, liked the banter but finale had DALEKS yet again....and just too cheesy, bad production quality, cinematography just looked plain, soundtrack was alright I guess. Writing dipped considerably but still enjoyable. And the powerful ending of Doomsday was wrecked.

HIGHLIGHT- Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, Midnight.

Specials- Almost all of them were horrendous or god awful except Waters of Mars. End of Time was a terrible send off to David Tennant IMO.

Series 5- 9/10 HELL YEAH! Great opener! breath of fresh air! Matt Smith came out of DT's face and on the rooftop and said ""I AM THE DOCTOR"" and told the atraxi to basically run........that was just awesome. Writing was so much clearer, the arc was interesting, production quality was a lot better. Cinematography was very well with some great panning shots and quick short cuts and zooms. Direction was great. BLOCKBUSTER two parter- finale. Just awesome really!

HIGHLIGHT- The Eleventh Hour, Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang

Series 6- 9/10 Now I know I'm in the HUGE minority here but I actually like series 6 the best and probably because the arc was really suspenseful and I love River Song. Series starts off by The Doctor dying on Lake Silencio by being shot by an astronaut. What a way to start the show! Opening two parter was just Blockbuster stuff. Writing was pretty consistent but the second half did dip quite a bit. Let's Kill Hiter was meh. at best and Wedding of River Song didn't quite get there but still the suspense was just great. Soundtrack was fantastic. Just love it!

HIGHLIGHT- Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, A Good Man Goes To War, The Doctor's Wife.

Series 7- 7.5/10- All The Moff episodes were actually quite great. But the rest of them were just bland, cliched, cheesy and downright BORING. Interesting Ideas that never went anywhere. A season full of ups and down with no consistency and disappointing really but none the less Moffat had some great stuff.

I think you underestimate the amount of people arrested (technically may be called something else) just solely for Cannabis.  Without the data it's hard to tell the exact numbers. But I know personally of several people who have been arrested for such. A few of them were just ""cautioned"" (had to go to police station and be officially warned) due to cannabis being a class C drug at the time.  Now it's an """"arrest"""" (wait for letter, not always handcuffs and to the station with you) , court and possibly a fine. 

Also don't forget that anything with a court fine = possible jail. (doesn't matter how they spin it as ""not their problem"" or ""no you can't go to jail"" but if....)

Like the TV license people refuse to admit that single mums have been sent to jail for not being able to afford a tv license and admitting to watching TV without it.

&gt; You can't go to prison for non-payment of a TV Licence - the maximum penalty is a fine of up to £1,000.

&gt; A custodial sentence can, however, be imposed as a result of non-payment of court fines, including fines for failure to have a TV Licence. **This is a court matter though.**

&gt; Hope this helps clarify things.

&gt; All the best,

&gt; TV Licensing Support

&gt; support@tvlicensing.info 

Cannabis is the same at the very least. It's a class B drug now. Don't pay fine = jail. As long as the courts are involved, you can go to jail for a joint and first offence. 

If police officers suspect a person, they will stop them. If they have stopped someone already for another suspected offence or even just by chance, they can suspect and search them. Police ""stop and suspect"" or ""suspect and stop"", and then search more people than they ""catch and then search"".  Surely that is a logical reality. If not then what percentage of caught criminals(other crimes ACTUALLY committed) have dope on them?  We have an average 25%-ish  ""caught for committing a crime"" rate. (Going to use 2010 stats to show this)

* 109,139 crimes recorded during 2009/10 compared with 110,094 in the previous year, a decrease of 955 (-0.9%);

* Of these, the detection rate - an arrest resulting in someone either being charged or cautioned - was 25.8%

About 27,000 convicted crimes. You can weed it down further. How many crimes were criminals caught ""red-handed"" and hence searched? 

Point is... I really think you overestimate the amount of criminals who just happen to have cannabis on them. Sure there are bound to be some of them but I reckon the amount of people arrested purely for possession of drugs is greater.

  

Also (for context)....Name one other crime offence that is measured in just convictions and not acts committed? (failed convictions don't count) (I can only think of one type, resisting arrest type offence)

It's handy to have those drug arrest stats. Every other crime rate rises, detection rates fall but they are made up with drug possession convictions. The only major rise in convictions. (that is literally what has been happening)


  

As for heroin..  (Punishments and heavy criminalization will make it worse as cost to buy will increase)

* Fix the social problems attached to drug supply: [it should given for free to people. In a clinic, like in Holland.](http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/free-heroin-brings-everyone-a-bit-peace)

* Fix the addiction problem: Treat the people for addiction. 

You need to tackle both problems separately. The Drug supply and the addicted person. Both create other crimes and social problems if they are not dealt with. Criminalisation doesn't work. It never has and it still doesn't after years of trying.

She's bought over her typical yank attitude. 

If she'd gone up to them before hand, shown them a print out about the new law and said that she'd be filming the entire thing as per her right then there'd probably have been no real issue. 

Instead she just exercised her right with no explanation to those who don't even know that the right existed. 

Only reason to do this is to cause conflict. 

They're idiots for not knowing about a new law that applies to them, she's an idiot for going about it in literally the most confrontational way possible. 

She's just like those dickheads in America who walk around the street with their guns baiting police into confronting them so they can rant about their rights. 

She mentions 'The local audit and transparency act 2014' at the beginning of the video in text but she doesn't utter those words until she's already well and truly got their back up against the wall. She's clearly just trying to incite an 'I told you so!' moment. She tells them to call the police before she even mentions she has a copy of the law.

Contrast that with David Tennant who met Tom Baker when he was a child and declared that he would one day be the Doctor.

Also, contrast that with Tom Baker who was determined to one day play the Doctor and did so for a very long time. Peter Capaldi, another guy who had appeared on the show before (in different roles) and even Torchwood (I think?).  He might only be the Doctor for a season, but he's been involved with the show for years.

Paul McGann was the Doctor for all of an hour and a half and he still came back more than 10 years later to record a 5 minute mini episode.

Peter Davison came back to do a miniature episode.  Tom Baker came back to do a small part in the 50th.  I think that every other living actor to play the Doctor would come back and do something on the show again except Eccleston.

here is his very understandable explanation for leaving, 

“I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run. I didn’t like the culture that had grown up, around the series. **So I left, I felt, over a principle.**

I thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of shit. I’m not being funny about that. I didn’t want to do that and it comes to the art of it, in a way. I feel that if you run your career and– we are vulnerable as actors and we are constantly humiliating ourselves auditioning. But if you allow that to go on, on a grand scale you will lose whatever it is about you and it will be present in your work.

If you allow your desire to be successful and visible and financially secure – if you allow that to make you throw shades on your parents, on your upbringing, then you’re knackered. You’ve got to keep something back, for yourself, because it’ll be present in your work.  A purity or an idealism is essential or you’ll become– you’ve got to have standards, no matter how hard work that is. So it makes it a hard road, really.

You know, it’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals, you’ve got nothing to be compromised, you can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’. But then when that director comes to you and says ‘I think you should play it like this’ you’ve surely got to go ‘How can I respect you, when you behave like that?’

So, that’s why I left. My face didn’t fit and I’m sure they were glad to see the back of me. The important thing is that I succeeded. **It was a great part. I loved playing him. I loved connecting with that audience.** Because I’ve always acted for adults and then suddenly you’re acting for children, who are far more tasteful; they will not be bullshitted. It’s either good, or it’s bad.

Equating those thugs to the 55% of no voters is wrong, obviously. 

However you have to remember that for a *lot* of people in Scotland those loyalist thugs are the face of 'Britishness'. It might only have been 100 or so last night but there are many more like them and they've plagued Scotland for a **very** long time now. 

They've completely tarnished the image of Britishness in Scotland, they've done to it what the EDL or the BNP have done to the St. George's Cross. To the point that people don't call themselves British because everyone else just assumes you mean Loyalist.

Trust me, we know that the vast majority of people who identify as British aren't anything like these loyalist scum. It's simply that they have taken such complete ownership of it that when talking *within* Scotland (particularly Glasgow) they are one and the same. 

There is not a single person in Glasgow who openly identifies as ~~British~~ 'Proudly British' / 'Fiercely British' / 'British only' / etc who isn't one of these people, that's how bad it is, that's how toxic they are that literally everyone has given up trying to be good examples of 'British'.

All they had to do was say that by the time their term in office ends, none of the people receiving it would do so for an empty room... that gives those who really could live somewhere smaller half a decade to work with providers to get such accommodation and to put safeguards in place for those who do need two rooms* to ensure they get them.

I say we become a federal state by devolving power to the major English counties. Say those with above 500,000 in population, and the others are merged to create ones with 500,000 population or more.

I would give them a directly elected Lord-lieutenant each also with similar powers to the London Mayor or the Governor of a US state.

All of these counties or super counties (let's say 15 overall) have *exactly* the same powers as the Scottish Parliament will. From then, if any other section of the country wants more power to the other parts, they can fuck off.

Next, replace the House of Lords with a US senate style system, which would still maintain the traditions and conventions and would still be called a House of Lords. 'British senate' just sounds... Ew.

Anyway, let's say each of these new federal regions elect 1 to 3 Lords or a similar scale system. The smallest would get 1, the largest 3. 

This would still give the smaller regions better representation as the 8 million population of London would still elect the same amount of Lords as say, Yorkshire. 

Anyway, this new House of Lords must be able to block legislation and not just delay it, otherwise it doesn't provide a balance to the House of Commons.

Anyway...I think my Saturday so far can only be described as an adventure in self sufficiency...

Yesterday, I decided to cut my losses and murdered my remaining chickens as they haven't produced any eggs for the last 3 months - and quite frankly they never really lived up to my egg based culinary fantasies.  Unfortunately they were so old and ropey looking, there was no way I could be bothered to prepare them for the pot so they ended up in a bin bag.

So early this morning, I took a slightly hung over Mrs Dwair for a day out to a live stock market full of farmers and managed to score 4 new brown hens for a pound a pop.  The new chickens look a bit iffy - but at a quid each, who cares.  The also produced 2 eggs between them in under 3 hours of being here so I'm happy with my new chucks so far.

This afternoon - I cracked my beer barrel and discovered that neglecting it for 3 months has produced 40 pints of very present ruby ale at about 6.5% proof.  I am now a little drunk and filtering and bottling up a couple of litres of Slow Gin (Which of course has to be tried lest I over sweeten it) which can settle before Christmas and I sort out next years batch.

Midfield: Lucas doesn't need to be in such an advanced role. If he's in, he needs to be deeper than Gerrard, so Gerrard can push forward where his passes can be more effective. I'm starting to think more and more that we need to sign a true DM, someone that will sit back with our CB's during possession. 

Attack: We need more creativity, which I think could be provided by Markovic. Someone needs to be able to get the ball to Balo besides crosses. Lallana provided this a little bit when he came in, and we immediately looked more dangerous. 

I'm not ready to panic yet. Many of our signings are still trying to fit in, not to mention injuries. We definitely have work to do.

- **Borini** probably just played one of his best games for Liverpool. He was good all game except for when he had that shot from a stupid angle when he should have passed. He provided more of a presence up top that enabled **Balotelli** to have more space to work in. He's still learning, but I thought he had a positive game.
- **Balotelli** also had a good game. Way more involved than in any of his previous. Has been more effective at coming deep and moving the ball on. It's good to see him improving, can't wait to see him with **Sturridge.**
- **Gerrard** was once again *terrible*. I love the guy and he's given us some amazing moments, but his effectiveness is waning. He's too slow, doesn't move into space in the midfield and is a liability defensively. I actually think he's more of a liability to our attack than our defence. Because he doesn't move into the pockets of space in the midfield, it's often like playing 10 vs 11 and we struggle to pass our way through.
- **Lallana** looked good when he came on. I like him in the number 10 with **Sterling** out wide. He is was more effective in the middle.

I think we need to take out **Gerrard**, and fast. He is a massive weak link in our team and whilst he's been a great servant to us, at this level there is no place for nice sentiments.

Im sorry but this post reeks of, as you put it, ""glory hunting twat"". club over player. If he treats this club like shit, if he treats this club like merely as bank where he thinks he can withdraw and withdraw and never make a deposit, then he can in return be expected to be treated like shit.

Curious question how long have you been supporting city? because surely by now you would know that Yaya is the last player on the roster you would point to when exemplifying loyalty. Surely by now you are familiar with his ANNUAL whinge for money.
