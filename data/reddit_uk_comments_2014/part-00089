true,marganod,null,null,"It seems sick that someone can have a child as part of their covert ""disguise"". How the hell do you explain that their Dad isn't coming home to Mum any more because he was just using mum as a cover story? It has got to lead to all manner of emotional distress and abandonment issues for an innocent child, no matter what political brouhaha the mother has been involved with, that's not right. Let's not forget that at that stage of the operation, she will not have been convicted of any wrongdoing either, just suspected, so technically she is still innocent.

Ok, realistically, they might not intentionally have tried to father a child, but accidents do happen- broken condoms, missed or incorrectly taken pills (sickness, diarreah, antibiotics) and just plain bad luck sometimes (yes, I'm also aware that oops-ing is a thing too). Whenever you have sex you should be prepared that there is always a teeny weeny tiny winy chance that pregnancy may occur. 

The biggest problem I think is that if an accident happens whilst a woman thinks that she is in a stable relationship she's going to be more likely to keep the baby- if they don't know that their other half is a copper, she's not been presented with the full facts so that she can make a decision.

Even without a child, the whole thing is very similar to Rape By Deception. You aren't giving your partner the whole facts about your identity, then they can't really give consent. It's one thing to meet someone in a club and say your a music producer working with xyz famous person to have a quick fuck, it's quite another to let someone build their whole life around someone who is deceiving them. I've been with my husband for 10 years, I can't imagine if he turned around and told me ""actually, my name isn't Paul, it's Rodger, I'm a copper and I've done with my investigation, so see yah around"". I think it'd likely end me, and destroy my ability to have any trust in future relationships.

A lot of people argue ""well joe Bloggs may lie about his job to his girlfriend when he's actually on the dole"", and I think that we can mostly agree that it makes him something of a gigantic thundercunt. Why is it then ok for the police to institutionalise this thundercuntishness into their codes of behaviour? Surely, in an ideal world, the behaviour of the UK police force should be held to a higher standard that that of your average prick?

No, I'm calling them fascist because their policies are fascist.

Because their policies are textbook fascist. They wear fascist emblems and speak fascist thoughts. Your argument here has no merit at all, the links I provided earlier have extensive details on *why* they are facist. 

&gt; How does that in any way invalidate the movement itself?

Because historically when we aid a movement to overthrow a previous government we don't just stop there. We then make sure the ""right"" leaders take control, as is proven recently with the leaked ""fuck the EU"" phone call. It is no longer ""their"" movement, we call the shots and the people lose out.

This pattern has repeated around the world. I guarantee you that the people of Ukraine are going to spend the next 5-10 years suffering under ""austerity"", full privatisation of public services and all of the other crap the west/IMF is forcing upon everyone. That's the last thing their economy needs right now. But we don't care, we just want to remove them from Russian influence and put them under huge IMF debt so that we profit from their suffering.

So, after he reveals that he is an undercover policeman, and the last 4 years of relationship has been a lie, and now he is going back to his real life, you start thinking about the early days when the two of you first hit it off, and how you used to sit up late and talk about Henry James and how you first fell in love with him because he had such interesting views on 'Wings of the Dove', and then it hits you ""Fuck me, the only reason he said all that shit was because he had a file on me! - We were not just star crossed lovers, the reason he seemed to know me so well is because he was researching me, and then feeding me the lines he thought I would like so he could get closer to me!""

I mean, even killing you, even a judge saying ""We are going to put a rope around your neck and hang you until you are dead"" - it's a terrible way for the state to behave, but it's got a sort of logical sanity to it.

But for the government to say ""Yeah, you know your husband? That you have been with for 7 years now? The father of your child? Your lover? Yeah... well he actually works for us. We planted him in your life as an undercover agent 7 years ago because we had suspicions that you and your friends were going to break into a research lab and free a load of rabbits. We made up a back story for him that we thought you would find attractive, and told him what to say in order for you to fall for him a bit so as we could draw closer to the group and bug you and your friends. Anyway, that whole activism thing seems to have just been a phase of yours, and we are pretty sure that you're alright now, so we are taking him back. So, uh, goodbye. Remember to pay your taxes.""

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;to underwrite the debts of a country

National debt and currency are two separate things. The UK's national debt belongs to the UK government, not the central bank. Your whole argument is based on a deliberate misinterpretation fostered upon you by the media. There will be no ""underwriting"" of debt, that's not what a currency union does.

Yes, it *might* lead to a bail out at some point in the future if the shit hits the fan but that's a cross EU thing. You helped bail out many banks across the whole of Europe and this was done because you benefited from not having them fail. The EU is the biggest receiver of our exported goods and if they go down we go down. The bail out didn't happen out of niceness, it was entirely self-serving. 

Even without a currency union the English government would likely be happy to be involved in a RBS-style bailout of Scottish banks for these reasons if things got bad. The RBS bailout was a success and not only did they ""prop up"" the bank, the UK is going to make a profit from it. 

&gt;the UK? Not so much.

Then you clearly haven't considered the costs to English businesses which have sales and operations in Scotland. The cost/risk to English businesses of a split is far higher. They'd either have to just give up on those operations or rewrite their accounting procedures to cope. That's pretty much every single medium-to-large business in England.

The civil service has it's own bias, probably one greater than all political parties combined. They thoroughly oppose anything that attacks their status, of which Scottish independence is a major assault upon them. 

""Yes Minister"" is more of a documentary than a comedy, I urge you to watch it if you believe that the civil service are mere servants of democracy. ""Change"" is their biggest enemy, they don't want anything upsetting their absolute control over the nation. 

Scottish independence is a big threat to the service. It will require an ""opening of the books"" to go through the separation process. This is the service's worst nightmare, they don't want their accounts being placed under scrutiny. One side effect of independence (if it does come to pass) is that there will be dozens of scandals produced as skeletons get ripped from their closets. Part of me wants independence purely for the lulz in this regard!

&gt; Is the unequal risk faced by rUK should Scotland face financial trouble

What risk? Please explain in your own words what problems that would cause. 

The worst case is a revaluation of the currency but that's something that England may benefit from depending on the direction it takes. If Scotland goes bankrupt and defaults on it's debts there will be little direct impact on rUK. The real impact will be the overall harm to the economy, something that will happen with or without a currency union.

I'm sure there are plenty of good Muslim scientists, especially those who have done research in Western academic institutions,  but taken as a whole, their contribution to modern science has been practically insignificant given the number of Muslims in the world.

I know that's a rough thing to say and it makes me sound heartless.  But I'm not gloating - I think it's a tragedy that the Islamic world is lagging so far behind.

You just need to compare the progress of science and technology between Western countries and the Islamic world.  Practically every piece of technology, or every scientific discovery is made in the secular West, where we not un-coincidentlally value freedom of speech and democracy.  

Take a look at the laptop or phone you're using to access the internet.  How much of that technology was invented by Muslim scientists?  My guess is practically none.  Semiconductors, integrated circuits, the world Wide Web, hypertext, reddit and practically every other part of the technology you're using was developed in secular Western academic or government institutions, with hardly any contribution from the Islamic world.

And I suspect the same is true of just about any field.  As Richard Dawkins remarked, all the world's Muslims have fewer Nobel Prize winners than Trinity College in Cambridge today.

To start on the location, I come from Winchester which is near to Southampton and I spend a lot of my time when I'm back home hanging around Southampton. I would say that Edinburgh is infinitely nicer as a city to live in, but I can't say much about Sheffield, Newcastle or Cardiff.

For the flexibility of the course and course structure, navigate this site:
http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/13-14/dpt/cx_s_su748.htm

The housing situation: In your first year you'll be in student accommodation which varies in prices from around £80/week to £160 for the swankiest places. Check out this site:
http://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/

Activities wise, there are hundreds of societies at the university and you can get involved in pretty much anything you have time for. Here is a pretty thorough list of the societies avaliable:
https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/getinvolved/societies/findasociety/

There's everything from live music, through to Beer Society, Vegetarian Society, Ice Cream Society or subject societies like the History Society which I help to run.

Transportation is a bit of an interesting one because I'm not sure what you want to hear. Most people either walk or cycle around the city because there isn't much of a distance between student accommodation and the main university campuses at George Square and Kings Buildings.
Unlimited bus travel for a day is about £3.50 or £1.50 for a single, I'm not sure how much bus passes are but they obviously make things a lot cheaper.

The students/people in Edinburgh are hard to generalise about because like any community there are a great variety of individuals living here. You will meet friendly or annoying people wherever you go, but in general I have found Edinburgh to be a friendly and welcoming environment.

Any more questions or more specific things just send me a message, also have a look on Facebook for the University pages and societies that might relate to your degree and just ask them any questions you have. I am a humanities student so I can't really help you with questions about the course you will be taking. 

All the best

&gt; it would be nice to go out for a drink with her every now and then

Sounds like this wont really happen. I can't see there being anything wrong with going out with her, have a pint yourself and something she likes. Ignore the alchohol content and (assuming you both like it) going to a social location and drinking something you like should be fair game. People get too hung up on the pub being about getting hammered. The pub is a public house and should be there for everyone to locate together and enjoy others company. Getting her drinking alchohol in the pub seems a fruitless affair.

Try re-phrasing the question from another angle. What flavours does she enjoy and what new and interesting ways out there to enjoy those flavours. Here we're stepping into the realms of /r/cocktails. They might be able to find flavour combinations she can enjoy.

This kinda comes back to your [fish-dish metaphor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedLion/comments/21n9fy/the_girlfriend_doesnt_drink_what_alcoholic/cget6uw).

And yet don’t look too full of it, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not let dreams distract you;   
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Chelsea and with City
And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to watch the mistakes you've made
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the ball you blocked, deflected,
And dig it out with worn-out legs:

If you can make one heap of all your energy
And risk it all on one charge up the field,
And miss, and start again at the half way line
And never breathe a word about your misskick;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Play on!’

If you can ignore the crowds and keep your virtue,   
Or stare down mourinho—and keep the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all team mates count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the 96th minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the League and everything that’s in it,   
And—which is more—you’ll be Legends, my boys!",0,1396121826,null,0,1396123083,0,cgf3skm,t3_21ovp8,t1_cgf3skm,t1_cgf3g7t,null,1433123699,30,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,30

The 3 central midfielders obviously did not work. It left Brana and Azpi exposed. Lampard can't play his old position anymore. Matic and Luiz works when the pitch is more open and Luiz can utilize his long balls. 

It's been very obvious that this team can not break down a tight defence. 

For parked buses, I'd like to see either one of the following.

Either play with 2 strikers at the start or play Oscar further back.

Pair Oscar with Matic, move Hazard centrally, with Salah(Willian when not suspended) and Schurrle wide. 

With Oscar back, it would give Hazard more outlets to play off with. Hazard has to work so hard on the wings when he doesn't need to. When Hazard gets closed down when he is wide, he pretty much only has one option. If he is moved centrally, he has two on the side and possibly a 3rd with Oscar making a run.

Terry and Cahill had an overall good game. Ivanovic was playing well until David Luiz was taken off. David was our best midfielder making good passes forward and intercepting passes but when he left, Ivanovic kept going too far forward before losing possession and having to run all the way back into position. Lampard was struggling with the pace of the game and Hazard was not getting into open positions or making runs forward that would help be an outlet for Lampard. Hazard also lot possession so many times and instead of bursting forward to score, he would try and beat him man at a stand-still which did not work today. Torres once again played as if he was a midfielder and did not get into open space at all today.

If you want to know whether it's fair to criticize Islam (or any other religion), just replace 'Islam' with 'communism' or 'capitalism' or any other ism and see if those criticisms seem bigoted.  And of course - they don't.  The only reasons why criticism of Islam is taboo is because it's a religious ideology and because people confuse criticism of ideologies with that of race.  But these are both poor reasons to avoid criticism.  The fact that a belief is religious in nature is irrelevant and the fact that most Muslims are non-white is irrelevant because I'm criticizing Muslim belief, not their ethnicity.

Anyway, you seem like an unpleasant person - so feel free to vote me down and then insult me, but don't expect any more responses.

I knew the undercover cop Mark Kennedy well, or at least I thought I did. I considered him a friend and knew him for 4 or 5 years before he was exposed. I also knew another of them, although less well. Obviously the whole situation is a huge headfuck, but something that has really bothered me since is the blase comments by people on the internet regarding the sexual relationships that he and others had. They're usually along the lines of 'yeah but who hasn't lied a bit to get a shag, can't blame them'. I know its only online idiots but the magnitude of the point-missing is huge and depressing.

&gt;__[Liverpool F.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.)__ won its first [championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division) [title](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions) since [1946-47](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946-47_in_English_football#First_Division), thanks to a spectacular performance in its only second season in the top flight, following a lengthy stay in the Second Division. Manager [Bill Shankly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shankly) was hailed for the success, which meant the Scot had turned Liverpool from an average team in the Second Division to league champions in a little more than four years. [Roger Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hunt) scored 31 league goals, while partner [Ian St John](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_St_John) managed 21 and [Alf Arrowsmith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Arrowsmith) 15, the trio being vital for the side that scored a club record 92 goals in the First Division.

They will usually want you to do some kind of therapy, be it CBT or something else. Sometimes they do this in conjunction with anti-depressants if they think it will help. But it's ultimately up to you to decide how you want to help yourself- they will work with it with you.

From there you can discuss treatment and get referred to a psychiatrist/counsellor. Depending on where you live this may take longer to get than others (I've had great treatment but I've heard a lot of people having to wait ages to get a psychiatrist appointment).

**If you're looking for something more immediate- i.e. if you're having suicidal thoughts, then please phone the Samaritans- 08457 90 90 90**

If you want a taste of CBT in the meantime, then I'd recommend visiting [Mood Gym](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) and taking a look at the NHS pages for mental health. There are also some other subreddits where you can talk to people who are going through the same kind of thing- /r/depression , /r/Anxiety and /r/getting_over_it to name but a few.

That's a lot to take in but honestly, **get some help.**

It's nothing to be ashamed of and can only get better if you want to make the change. It won't happen overnight but asking for help really is the most important step.

So you're condemning each indivdual player for showboating and bringing us down. I thought Schurrle, Hazard, and Matic were the top performers today (Salah and Oscar moreso in the second half). So now you're only adding fuel to the fire

&gt;Defense was bad....[Dave] was bad, losing out to almost every single counter attack and iva was just as bad

So now you're bashing our full backs, after telling us not to bash each individual player. I don't agree with you there, because we only failed because Torres and Ba couldn't convert any of their chances Ivanovic and Dave provided on a silver platter. So again, you're adding fuel to the fire.

That said it's not exactly a formation the team is familiar with so...could have ended up as garbage any way.

Another thing that really disappointed me was that two of the substitutions were forced by necessity rather than tactical cunning; Hughes was simply ineffective and Hoilett had to come on to get some speed in the mix.

Every time we resorted to a hoof ball, Zamora couldn't win it. So much for his Indian summer.

Looking back to the season opener against Sheffield Wednedsay...that was a QPR team, for better or for worse. I honestly feel it is a little harder to get excited about such a loan-heavy squad.

The first thing is, if you have a family member or a friend who knows how you've been feeling, or has seemed concerned about you recently, you should give them a ring for a bit of a chat. Even if there's somebody who doesn't know about it but does care about you, they won't mind, and they might have some good advice. It doesn't fix everything, but sometimes knowing somebody cares about you can help just enough to get you through the day.

If you are thinking of harming yourself or anybody else, or have already done so, this is an emergency and you should take yourself to A&amp;E or call 999 if you can't get there alone. They might take a little bit of time because Saturday nights are quite busy, but you'll be perfectly safe and they will help you.

If it's an urgent or a soon, it might need to wait until Monday morning, I'm afraid. I know it seems like a long time, but I promise it will come. The first port of call will be your GP. Phone up first thing on Monday and make an urgent appointment. If they say they do not have any urgent appointments, explain your situation to the receptionist and ask if somebody can phone you back.

If you need to talk to somebody in the meantime, [The Samaritans](http://www.samaritans.org) have a 24 hour helpline, and [Mind](http://www.mind.org.uk)'s advice line is open on weekdays.

I think FGM and the veil is intimately connected with the Islamic ideal that women should be subservient to men.

I read r/islam, and discussions about the veil tend to always boil down to whether a woman should appear modest and do her duty to Allah and so on.  

Additionally, I think most /r/islam users are too well educated to support FGM, but neither have they shown much interest in condemning it.  

But whether you agree or disagree, I think these issues should ultimately be settled by serious academic research.  I admit that it's difficult to be certain how many problems affecting Muslims are due to their ideology, but I think we should be making a real effort to find out instead of always looking the other way.

There.

Edit: Oh. Are you sitting in the away end or not? If you're sitting with the home fans ignore all the above, except obviously going to the match and enjoying yourself. I've sat with the home fans at away games and it's fucking tense. If you're found out, odds are you'll get a bit of abuse. 

When I was little I sat with the United fans at Old Trafford. I was with my uncle and he explicitly tells me ""If we score, under no circumstances do you cheer. Understand?"" He was very stern. So. What happens? First half. Michael Owen goal. I don't move an inch. Cold as ice. My Uncle on the other hand had jumped up like he was electrocuted and cheered. He quickly realised he'd fucked up and sat his ass back down. He spent the rest of the match getting kicked in the back and threats whispered in his ear. If he hadn't have been with me (a kid) he'd have probably gotten a kicking.

So if you're sitting with the Palace fans you need to Solid Snake it. Wear nothing that will identify you as an LFC fan. Don't cheer if we score. Try and hold it in. You're behind enemy lines. If you want to make it out you need to stay sharp.

Lol. Quote me on where I said **we should**. What I said was what what I think will happen. Also, there have been plenty of rumours of us selling Lukaku over the course of the year. Where have you been?

&gt;So... You ARE jumping to the thought of selling him. You are straight up making these rumors up, and no one has said these things but you.

You aren't listening to what I'm saying. Read my post again. I'm not making rumours up, its a prediction on what might happen. Do you understand what a prediction means? Do you understand the concept of it? Quit your Lukaku dick riding and read what I'm saying for a moment.

&gt;Fuck right off. Don't be a condescending asshat, when none of your points had much meaning behind it other than saying my exact point.

If you're going to come in here guns blazing, don't you dare tell me what I should or shouldn't be like. 

&gt; I meant we'd sell Lukaku but keep Eto'o. You did suggest we sell off a star-in-the-making in Lukaku to fund a very unstable player in Costa, and keep an aging 34-37 year old (who was rumored a lot about leaving Chelsea after his one year deal)

What does Costa being ""unstable"" - as you hypocritically put it after your multiple rants - have anything to do with anything? So he gets a bunch of yellow cards. Big fucking deal. JT is hot headed too and the most controversial player in the league along with Suarez. He's spit on players over the years too. Want to get rid of him too? Drogba has gotten sent off for being unstable in big games too. Would you have sold him off too? Fuck. At least Costa isn't doing coke like Mutu or some stupid shit like that and **works hard** for the team and scores tons of goals. Costa is probably the best value for money striker available on the market. And he IS the kind of striker that we desperately need regardless of what opinion you may have of him. 

&gt;And you sound like someone who thinks he is right about everything, and any point someone else makes can't be correct because it wasn't yours.

I know you all want to see Eriksen in the middle of the pitch but I think starting him on the left gives him much more space/freedom when he does move centrally, it just means we have to rely on the left sided CM (in this case Dembele) to drag opposing players out of position when in possession and to cover the left side of the pitch when Eriksen is doing his thing.

Sigurdsson showed how effective he was against Southampton, and I would hope he gets the nod over Bentaleb this week against Liverpool as he will be needed to perform a similar role, although I wouldn't be surprised to see Dembele and Bentaleb start together.

true,Raskilinov,null,null,"On your first point - this is a really good question, and one of the worrying issues from the article. 

On your second question, this is something already present with existing hospitals, and is not something created by the Trade Agreement. So if care for patient goes drastically wrong, the patient can sue that company that provided the care (usually a hospital). 

Going back to your first sentence: 
The NHS won't simply stand back and let private organisations perform badly and consequently axe a contract. 

Currently within NHS contracts, there is an enormous weight put towards monitoring performance and quality of care on a regular basis by those in the NHS that hold the contracts i.e. NHS CCGs. 

The article unfortunately oversimplifies the issues if a company/provider performed badly. 

The NHS CCGs would work with the company/provider to identify where poor performance was occurring, and ensure that the company was put onto a recovery plan of sorts. 

A contract cannot be simply terminated, as you and I may do for our mobile phones. 
Currently NHS contracts are subject to 12 months notice period, however this can be shorter dependent on mutual agreement between the provider and buyer. 
Then there is the big issue of what to do with all the patients who have started or are in the middle of their care with the provider. 
Furthermore we cannot simply ship the patients to the hospital next door. 

Anyhow the point is, where poor performance is identified, the NHS buyers (aka commissioners, aka CCGs) will work with them to ensure they are brought back on track. This way of working already exists in the NHS, and there are some examples across the country, where the NHS has worked with the provider to ensure they are in a better state to deliver. 

Off the top of my head, I think George Elliot Hospital has come off Special Measures, and worked in fact with another UHB (Uni Hospitals Birmingham); testament that different NHS bodies will come together to ensure the poor performer gets better.

I highly doubt an actual shill would make posts like that.

Anyway if he actually is being paid to post he would do it a lot more subtly, the way he goes on a tangent about Snowden is far, far too stupid for someone who has received actual training in how to direct comments and going onto a forum where people treat Snowden like a hero and internet surveillance as evil and talking the exact opposite to what people want to hear is somewhat ridiculous, I have a fair few diverging views from this subreddit and the only time I mention them is when someone complains about the hivemind, someone asks for a Tory supporters view or on meta subreddits like CB or SRD where I can whine about things. If I can figure out not to post a contrary viewpoint I'm sure a government trained agent could figure it out.

I will agree that his point on Companies and Snowden is stupid but keeping on eye on other countries is the job of GCHQ and although its nice to think we don't spy on our allies I would bet £1000 that they do the same to us.

Other than that, you should make an appointment with your GP. They will probably ask you to fill out a questionnaire to help them assess what your troubles me. They'll then work out a course of treatment, which might involve medications, therapy, or both. 

There are some rubbish GPs out there. If you encounter one that won't help you, don't be afraid to see another. I had one that told me my illness 'wasn't that bad', and that no doctor would prescribe me antidepressants as a nursing mother. I was feeling suicidal at the time, and the next doctor I managed to see talked me through my treatment options and helped me a choose a medication that would be suitable for me while I continued nursing my daughter. Good, helpful and respectful doctors are out there.

urgh!

It's much more of a class issue than it is a racial one. 

I'm a 3rd generation black Briton, and I strongly identify with BRITISH culture, regardless of my race, and to claim that I am part of some sort of anomalous culture outside of the norm purely due to my skin colour, is nothing short of ignorance.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"We already know how this experiment ends; it's been tried in the US and it's failed their citizens, who pay more for their healthcare than most European countries which offer a far better service.

Marketising healthcare only adds to bureaucracy, makes services more inefficient and of course, blocks the poor and elderly from accessing the healthcare they can't afford anyway because their jobs are increasingly part time and their incomes are being squeezed. 

The charge may start out as £10, but it will steadily go up until it reaches the ridiculous levels Americans are paying. Then, when most people can't afford to see their GP and healthcare has been corrupted, charges will be applied across the board, with people being charged for ambulances and increasingly more care not being covered by taxation which will only increase as healthcare becomes more inefficient. 

Marketising healthcare doesn't work because people don't *choose* to get ill, it's just something that happens. The economics of rational choice doesn't apply, it's a smokescreen for the unscruplulous to get rich at society's cost. 

Healthcare is about social welfare and security. This isn't about money, there's always money when it's truly needed (case in point: the RBS and Lloyds bailouts and inevitable future bank bailouts).

It's been over 50 years since a player transferred directly between Liverpool and United; there's a higher likelihood of seeing John Terry in a Liverpool kit than there is of us signing Kagawa.

&gt; We desperately need a CB

Depends on whether Skrtel or Agger leaves. Kolo's staying; he's only got one year left on his contract anyway, he's a strong leadership and good dressing room presence, and honestly, he's a 4th-choice CB. Also depends on what Rodgers wants to do with Ilori, Kelly and Wisdom (Coates will be leaving, that much is obvious).

&gt; DM backup for Lucas, and a backup LB. What do you guys think?

We have to stop thinking about buying 'backup' players - the way forward for us now is to strengthen our first XI, thus turning the players in our starting XI into squad players, or players that are rotated (because with European football, we'll need to rotate our squad again). 

Besides, right now, Lucas is a backup to Gerrard at DM anyway. I honestly think DM is fine; we need at least one new CM; a more physical Joe Allen (Lucas isn't as good as Joe going forward, so he doesn't fit the bill), or a CM with more end product than Coutinho, Henderson and Allen have offered - someone like Mkhitaryan, who we went after last summer.

At LB, we have no guarantee that Enrique will come back at the level he was at before - and while the level he was at before was good, it's not as if we can't improve on that either. So a proper first-choice LB is a better signing to make than a backup to a player who we haven't seen since September.

Other areas - if Johnson leaves (hasn't been offered a new contract, high wages, if we're moving him on this is the summer to do it) then a new first-choice RB; and at least one new winger. I don't want to see us buy strikers and play them out wide; I'd rather buy a proper wide forward / winger.

Quick summary:

The War Doctor gets fed up with the War, decides to blow up gallifrey and the daleks. He steals the moment, but is stopped when 10 and 11 show up and they come up with their secret plan. 10 and 11 leave and War regenerates into 9. 

When the timelines untangle 9 forgets the events of the crossed timelines and thinks he killed everyone. At some point he shows up to help lock Gallifrey in a pocket universe with all the other doctors, but then that clarity fades when the timelines are uncrossed . Eventually Regenerates into 10. Near the end of his time, 10 revisits the end of the War with War Doctor and 11, once again prevents the destruction of Gallifrey, and once again forgets when the timelines untangle. Regenerates into 11. 11 still thinks he's killed everyone but it starting to get over it. 

When the portal opens in the gallery that links his various timelines together, the fog starts to lift and he remembers that seeing this portal before. He then catalyzes the events that War and 10 lived through, and once again saves Gallifrey, but this time he remembers the events (For reasons that are only nebulously explained, maybe it's because he was the eldest doctor, maybe it's because He was the one crossing into other people's times, whatever). Now that he has recall of this he gets to go about the rest of his lives remembering that he never killed them in the first place. At some point 12 (Or whatever Capaldi's number will be) Will likely remember that he's part of these events and return to once more help save Gallifrey with the rest of the doctors, completing this centuries-long time loop. 

TL;DR - Gallifrey was never destroyed, there was no changing of events, only forgetting. ",0,1396138278,null,0,false,0,cgfa55o,t3_21nxhc,t1_cgfa55o,t3_21nxhc,null,1433126692,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

When a group is viewed as credible by that individual, the individual sees it as unnecessary to independently verify information they pass on.

When the individual does not independently verify information from the group, but internalises and accepts as fact this information, *if* the group were to inform the individual of a thing that is not true, the individual may accept the claim as true, because they view the group as credible.

Bed isn't a full double, but a 3/4. Definitely big enough for two people.

I think the main plus is the staff, which might be different where you are. Unlike most uni buildings, you feel like it's your room. Rules and stuff are very loose. Some examples:

- In uni halls here, staff can drop in pretty much unannounced to do inspections and maintenance. Not the case in Zig. I'm always given PLENTY of notice before maintenance of any sort, and can ask for room-specific stuff to be done when I'm home. No invasions of privacy.

- In uni halls, you have to register guests, and can only have them for two/three days at a time, up to twice a month. At Zig, you can have whoever you want in your room, since it's your bloody room.

Staff are just generally very nice. When a package arrives, the residence manager has just brought it up a few times before her shift ends, so I don't have to wait until the next day to get it.

It's pretty harsh to have a go just because he's a product of his time, especially when he isn't going beyond saying he doesn't agree with it.

That, and saying his generation were responsible for the ""Crusades and burning Catholics"", is far more ignorant considering that the final 8th (sometimes called the 9th) Crusade ended in 1272, and the last person to be burnt at the stake for heresy was in 1612 (Death by burning for heresy was abolished in 1676).

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"I'm wary about an argument like this. Was there a time when prescriptions were free? 

I don't know, but if I was browsing Reddit and came across a thread like this, except instead of GP charges it was prescriptions not going to be free any more, I would come across people making the slippery slope argument that first comes prescriptions, soon as you know it they will be charging for essential surgery.

I hate the slippery slope argument, particularly on Reddit, because for whatever reason people love to use it and it rarely makes sense. I would probably tell them prescriptions being charged for isn't strictly use of the NHS and as long as it's capped and means tested it's fine and it's not strictly speaking breaching the principle of gratis healthcare at the point of use.

But this is. Charging for a GP breaches the free at point of use principle in such a gross way that it changes the system to create an incentive not to go to the doctor's, and that really does represent a real and slippery change in direction because an established principle was broken, and there is such an obvious problem with it. It sits very uncomfortably.

So I don't agree that a prescription not being free is a valid reason to permit charging for GP appointments. It would also validate slippery slope arguments and I can't be dealing with that.

I've no problem with his shooting as that'll come with time. I reckon he could pop a couple in with headers too though he's not gonna out-jump a centre-back.

OK, so I guess it's an attitude problem rather than a style problem with regards to the low pressing. May be indicative of our team in a way.

Don't you expect a midfielder to be able to do a fair bit of dribbling rather than it being an added bonus? I'm finding it hard to word my gripes with him, so it's not your fault for not understanding it to be honest! 

The point I think I'm making is that when face with someone in front of him, he doesn't seem to want to take them on often, and will opt for a pass back to the centre back. His ability to get the ball past the opposition, through dribbling and passing seems non-existent, and I kinda want reassurance that he can dribble and pass with the best of them.

It's a tricky one. I mean lets say, for example, it's 2012, I am a fairly successful businessman, and donated £10,000 to Alliance. Cross community party, not involved in violence, should be safe, right?

Then the flag riots kick off. Because my donation is public, I'm now in danger of having loyalist mobs target my home and business. And if that happens, one outcome is that I've to pack up and leave. Best case scenario is that I'm living in fear for months.

Transparency is usually good, but the tendency towards violence, and politicans egging on violent responses with a wink and a nudge, unfortunately adds an element of risk for local donors, to the point where some would be put off donating. And if that happened, parties would have to rely on out of province networks for donations. Which would give Sinn Fein one hell of an advantage.

Take away the risk of violence, and there is little excuse not to have transparency.

Banks took increasingly greater risks and instead of delivering healthy competition, we now have giant banks that are ""too big to fail""; banks which spend enormous sums on just the kind of lobbying you seem to be decrying. 

All that the marketisation of healthcare will do is repeat this process in UK healthcare. 

Healthcare isn't burdened because of entitlement. It's because people are becoming increasingly ill as a result of the inceasingly individualistic and materialistic culture that unrestrained capitalism generates (not to mention people living longer). 

People working increasingly longer hours for increasingly poor pay leads to them exercising less, eating worse and overworking themselves to keep their heads above water, which unsurprisingly makes people ill. 

The increased competition that is supposed to make the market wonderful is great for fat cat rentiers but toxic for those who actually have to do the hard work that keeps society going (everyone else). 

Competition has absolutely no place in healthcare. Caring for people's health, intrinsically, isn't about making money, nor can it be. 

It's not possible at all to put a price on people's health. The market simply can't do it, there are always externalities involved, because the price system is about determining prices for *voluntary* transactions. 

You don't choose how healthy you want to be, it's not something you can plan for. You can't make healthcare efficient, it's not possible in the real world. ",0,1396147034,null,0,false,0,cgfdiet,t3_21pcb3,t1_cgfdiet,t1_cgfc4wk,null,1433128347,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I'm not sure why this is important. Any investor is not pumping their money in because they believe Leeds United in the Championship is a sound way to make money.

The minute if/when Leeds get promoted to the Premiership, we're massively profitable, outside of how many fans we get in the gate each month.

If someone were to buy Leeds today, continue on at the same losses we're making now and bankroll the club for a couple of years with the goal of Premiership football, they could realistically make all of their money back within that first season in the top division.

One of Northern Ireland's most famous paedophile scandals was the Kincora Boy's home affair where William Mcgrath, the master of a home for adolescent boys, was raping his charges, but was also the head of a bizarre Loyalist paramilitary group. This was the early 1970s, so the security services blackmailed him, had him spying on all the other Loyalists, protected him from investigation for at least 5 years, and there are rumours that the home was used by many other prominent and even famous people at the time. There are even vague rumours that the British security services somehow colluded with the assassination by republicans of at least two Loyalists who were threatening to reveal details on the affair, but the mechanisms by which they'd have done that haven't yet been specified properly.

&gt;

&gt;The __Friends of Sinn Féin__ or __Cairde Sinn Féin__ is the name for five different [Irish republican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republican) organisations; located in [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), [Cairde na hÉireann](http://www.cairdenaheireann.info), [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), [Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), the [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) respectively.

&gt;Each FOSF is associated with the political party [Sinn Féin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in) in the [Republic of Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) and [Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), and works with the [Irish Scots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Scots), [Irish English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_migration_to_Great_Britain#Irish_in_England) [Irish Canadian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Canadian), [Irish American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American) and [Irish Australian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Australian) communities to foster good relations between the Sinn Féin party and the governments of those nations although they refuse to take their seats in the British parliament, and the goals of Sinn Féin (a [United Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Ireland), Democratic Socialism and the promotion of [Irish culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_culture)). The US organisation is one of the chief fund-raising sources for Sinn Féin. In 2008 it was reported that the United States remains a major contributor and a ""key source of funds"" for the party. 

&gt;Cairde Sinn Féin is run by Joe Reilly (Ireland) and Roger Locke (United States), a [Meath West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meath_West_(D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_constituency\)) councillor and Ard Chomhairle (executive body) member.

He still has that ""surprise attack"" style in his playing.  He likes to rush forward. But Spurs play possession too far up the pitch already. There's no opportunity for surprise.

I'd like to see Chadli in the hole, because he's done it effectively recently and has more size and power than any of our other attackers, save Adebayor.  I'd like to see Chadli pressing Gerrard and troubling their CBs from long balls, neither of which he can do out wide so well.

The one thing I don't agree on is another defensive player... Liverpool are most likely going to scythe through us regardless of whether we have one or two CDMs.  All playing a second CDM does for us is rob us attacking impetus up the pitch... our defence has generally not improved.  I'd rather attack Liverpool weak points than try to protect our own.  We're nearly inevitably going to get scored against (probably twice I'd imagine), so the job for us is to score more.

true,uk_finance,null,null,"I never think you should stretch yourself too much with a mortgage. I don't know what deals you've looked at but, unless it is a fixed rate you could easily see your payments increase within 18-24 months. You need to consider other costs on top of the mortgage, such as life insurance, critical illness insurance, income protection, buildings &amp; contents insurance. You haven't broken down your monthly expenditure but you said you save around £800-£1000 per month with a combined net income of £4800 per month, and this is when you are both preparing to buy a house. I always advise people to have an emergency cash fund of 3 to 6 months of expenditure, which is £1900 per month x 2 people x 6 months = £22,800. When your emergency fund is depleted on the deposit, tax and conveyancing (plus the other money you will need to find to meet these costs) how quickly can you save up £22,800? Basically, in my opinion, think not only of what you can afford now but what you could afford if one of you was made redundant or was ill for 9 months or interest rates increased by 1%. You have the big advantage of having two good salaries, so certainly make the most of them. Just don't over-stretch yourself.

Good luck with heading into NHS management though. Rest assured that if and when you get there you'll be in good company among a room of people who also want to improve obvious things like mental health provisions and consistency of care, because that's what pretty much everyone in the NHS wants.

First the bad news: If the item goes missing you won't be able to claim any compensation for sending the item in the post.  To send cash abroad (up to £100 only) you need to use a registered service such as (until April when the service names change) International Signed For or Airsure.

Now the good news: Very few items go missing in the post.  You will hear scare stories from the media and people who have lost an item but when you look at the statistics from the **billions** of items of mail worldwide that are delivered safely every day very few items go missing.  Postal workers all over the world are some of the proudest people working and the mail networks are not full of thieves.  Those that do steal from the post are usually caught very quickly and face prison sentences.  We don't tolerate it, it makes us all look bad.

So, where's your item?  Well if there was a return address on the back of it then you should get it back in the next few days with a big red sticker on it asking for more postage.  If no return address is on the back then it will go to our National Return Centre where it will be opened and checked for a return address.

It is VERY UNLIKELY to be sent on to Spain.  This usually only happens if there's at least enough to cover travel by land.  One first class stamp won't do it.

If you didn't put a return address on or in your item, then you should send a claim form into the Royal Mail and they may request a search at the National Return Centre to find it.  However, please be aware that you have no proof of posting and your request may be refused.

So, in the future if you need to send expensive items or cash through the post always go into a post office and request the item to be sent by a registered service (and make sure it covers what you are sending).

I think they fucked up on the Uni fees though - as really we need to either fund it via general taxation and restrict funding to those deemed economically useful (in effect the Government acts like a wise investor, investing in those who it can expect higher tax returns from).

Or we need to have harsher loan repayment schemes, because at the moment they increased the fees but made the repayment less severe, which has just created a financial black hole due to the fact that the Universities are taking the piss creating loads of shitty courses to get more money. But of course naive students sign up to it (4-years studying 'Forensic science' sounds so CSI! Or I can study criminal psychology and be like Dexter!) and then end up unemployed.

So the issue of student fees has now become a ticking time bomb that no-one really wants to touch.

Raising the personal tax allowance was good, although funding it mostly via a drop in the 40% threshold is worrying as it means you could have a large number of people paying no tax, and a large number of people paying a lot, in order to support them.

true,bruce_mcmango,null,null,"Ultimately it comes down to supply and demand. Demand for GPs has rocketed due to:

1. An ageing population. For example, somebody who would have died at the age of 55 from a heart attack 10-20 years ago now lives long enough to gather the sequelae of their health conditions eg diabetic eye, kidney + nerve damage, peripheral vascular disease, vascular cognitive impairment. These patients are hugely complex and require a huge amount of GP time and resources (for example, needing house visits because house-bound or in a nursing home).


2. Medical advances expanding the type of work that can be done for patients. For example, there was a time where having a stroke meant staying at home, having a daily visit from your GP until you succumbed to the inevitable. Now you go to hospital, have treatment depending on the type of stroke and are sent home with the GP to manage the hypertension/cholesterol/atrial fibrillation that caused the stroke in the first place as well as the disability caused by the stroke. This also contributes to number 1.


3. The shift of secondary care into primary. Between 1987 and 2008, 100,000 hospital beds were closed (http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/faqs#beds) - mainly in psychiatry, learning disabilities and geriatrics. These patients are now looked after predominantly by the GPs with some outreach input if they're lucky. These patients require a disproportionate amount of GP time and resources. Closing down general hospital beds means that patients are sent home pretty much as soon as they're medically stable and the GP oversees them finishing their antibiotics/recovering from surgery etc.


4. Patient demands/expectations. A lower threshold for seeing the GP/overly optimistic idea of what medicine can do to help. Having high standards for doctors is a good thing. There is however a huge amount of psycho-social problems (not illnesses) that people visit their GP with. Their unhappy and stressed because their boss is a dick. They're lonely. Friends/family/neighbours could help these people more than their GP can but due to all sorts of reasons it's easier to make an appointment with your GP who will probably feel sorry for you and sign off work for a week with stress. You end up becoming a therapist/emotional crutch for them and they will see you every week or two for the future.


As for supply, the Royal College of GPs estimates we are 16,000 GPs short of providing an adequate service (http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/2013/july/nhs-funding-black-hole-to-lead-to-shortfall-of-16000-gps.aspx). On top of that, funding as a percentage of the NHS budget has slumped to a pitiful 8.5% (bearing in mind GPs provide &gt;90% of the patient contacts) ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/23/gp-services-patients-funding-nhs-hospitals).


The idea of paying to see your GP is a bad one. If GPs get extra income this way, I will bet my right ovary that the government will claw back the difference in their funding. It may hope to address the supply:demand inequality my providing financial disincentive to seeing your GP but it will not work because it doesn't address the underlying factors. It won't even deter the time-wasters because they would feel that for £10 they have purchased their GPs attention to their frivolous problem.

Another key thing is to know your interviewer. Spend the first 5 minutes analysing there personality. If they are serious, remain serious. If they are laid back, throw a few jokes at them wherever possible.

Until 2002, the *AI* of a programme was calculated by [BARB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasters%27_Audience_Research_Board), the organisation that compiles [television ratings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_measurement) for the major broadcasters and advertisers in the UK.

The major difference in this example is the coaching quality between both clubs. We are where we are because of Rodgers, not because of the amount of money we spent on players. If Rodgers can bring in young and talented players into the club and nurture their development like he did with Coutinho, Sturrdige, Allen, Flanno, Hendo, etc., then we'd have consistency and stability for many years to come.

We have to look at how long Suarez can keep these type of performances, in comparison to the the number of years of consistency and stable results we can get from bringing in and nurturing young and talented players with Rodgers coaching them.

I knew this was going to be a sour subject when posting the original response, but I don't see how we can prevent a player like Suarez to go to a club like Madrid and Barca, if they come calling, when there are so many other factors behind it.

What are opportunities for career progression within the business?

The thing is, GPs should be able to manage a lot of this with a process of overbooking, that is knowing that roughly 10% don't turn up, they overbook appointments, using the time when no one turns up to catch up with the backlog.

There is another way they could do this, potentially charge for 'peak' slots.  My local GP have nurses on day at a week at 7am, the idea is for people that need to commute to central London for work.  It suites me because virtually no one books these early slots, so I can get a 20 min check up, and be left to my own devices and drugs myself happy.  However if you want the 7:30-10am slots, they are highly contested.  Maybe letting GP surgeries charge an average amount per day, with at least 30% free, the pricing of the others at the discretion of the surgery.  People who have chronic illness will be placed around the time spots for those trying to work or with kids.  The problem with something like this is you've started to create a tiered NHS system.  As is, I've got private health cover because we can't cope with me being ill (I've lost 12 hours of work due to a cold this last week, joys of asthma) what I really dislike is the message this sends to governments, that I am happy to have the NHS as a 'last resort' I'll use private one for preference.

I've assumed you're pulling in around £4800 a month and are looking at a property around £240,000. 

Unfortunately most mortgage lenders will only lend you 95% of the value of the house, so you'll need a deposit of at least £12k in that case. Plus you'll need money for stamp duty (£2400 in this case) and other moving costs

Anything higher then that you'll need a bigger deposit and a lot more money for stamp duty, e.g. for a property that costs £300k you'll need a £15k deposit and £9k for stamp duty

&gt;**Spoilt ballots** 
 
&gt;The number of ballot papers rejected at the count continues to be but a small 
fraction of the total cast (0.28%), and is hardly changed compared with 2010 –
see Table13. The bulk of these are because the voter has either not marked 
the ballot paper or made their intention clear. In just over a quarter of cases 
voters have chosen more than one candidate in a single-member election. 
The latter instance was especially noticeable in London this year where 
almost all electors were also voting in multi-member council wards. An above 
average 0.5% of votes was disallowed with ‘voting more than once’ the single 
biggest reason for general election votes being rejected. Northern Ireland also 
more provides something of an exception. An overall greater proportion of 
votes are rejected, more than half for voting more than once. It is likely that 
this is caused by confusion among electors who normally vote in Single 
Transferable Vote elections where they are invited to cast a preference vote 
for all candidates on the ballot paper. 

That leads me to believe that ballots spoilt with 'other' or something similar are either not counted or are a very small percentage of the total number of spoilt votes.  

With voter turn-out in the region of 65% for the last GE, I wonder how much was down to voter apathy and how much down to people not voting because they didn't want any of the candidates.  It's my feeling a truce democracy would at least have an (official) option on the ballot paper to say 'none of the above'.

If he were to play for Chelsea in which every team we face attacks us so that we can counter, I think he'd be a great addition.

He probably has a better goal ratio than our current strikers but teams come out differently against Chelsea than they do Everton. When we have huge amounts of possession against teams that are 'expected' to lose, we really need top notch players with great technique and build up play to breakdown a defence.

Firstly, I don't think we should see Suarez, I love him being at the club, he plays exciting football and is one of the best in the world. Liverpool DESERVE players like him. He is one of a kind.  
  
Having said that, If he is sold to Madrid or Barca for 100million pounds then it is not the worst thing in the world. We have PROVEN we can win without him. I trust our scouting department a FUCKLOAD more then Spurs'.
  
IF we win the league, It is hard to argue that Suarez has much more to accomplish in England. The Champions League is a continental competition and he can attain that glory elsewhere. 
  
Liverpool have been loyal to Suarez, and he has rewarded us with one of the greatest seasons a striker has ever statistically had. I want him at Liverpool, but he owes the club nothing. Loyalty is a rare bird in sport at this level and while immortalizes players, fans are kidding themselves if they expect it.

Probably has something to do with his 25 goals in 30 appearances. We need a striker who can score goals **now**.

&gt; I don't see why he was purchased

Investment? We do that a lot. This whole paragraph is just your confusion about why we bought him if we weren't going to play him.

&gt; Just a little bragging at the end. before the season I made a post about how Mata wouldn't fit under mourinho and how we should probably sell him with my deleted account yellowsnake. I got a lot of flack especially for saying he was worth 45m millions pounds. Just wanted to cheekily point out that some of you don't know as much about football as you seem to think. In tbr most friendly and leasy cocky way possible of course.

Don't see what this has to do with anything. Being right once does not make you right all the time or prove you know more about anything, and does nothing but to make you sound arrogant and cocky.

I haven't seen many people say that Lukaku isn't good enough for Chelsea, but I have seen a lot of people say he's not good enough to lead the line in every match, which is true.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"It's hard to tell.  The Telegraph appears to be more likely to run critical stories - but by the same token, The Guardian goes out of its way to avoid *any* criticism of Islam.

It's true, we don't know for sure what's going on with this particular case. 

Edit:  I'm being accused of bigotry as usual, but I completely stand by this comment.  The Guardian are failing dreadfully in their journalistic duty to question Islam in the same way that they should question every other ideology.  I've been reading The Guardian for 30 years and it's absolutely apparent to me that they have an in-house policy of promoting 'tolerance' to Islam and downplaying the reporting of stories that could make UK muslims look bad.

I think this really hit home when I read a few months ago of a Muslim school in which an investigation found that girls were being made to sit at the back of the class.  The Guardian have a massive number of feminist columnists devoted to finding sexism in just about every part of society and denouncing it - but strangely they appeared completely silent on this issue.

We then had the debate over Muslims who wanted gender-segregation in university lectures from visiting Muslim speakers.  Again - The Guardian columnists offered only the most tepid of criticism - with one feminist columnist  suggesting that people who demonstrated against gender-segregation were likely racists.

It goes on and on.  They recently ran a piece in the news section explaining that politicians who think that Islam is an *ideology* are parroting far-right views.  That's right - just referring to a religion as an ideology is enough to make you a member of the far-right now.

The left are failing in their duty to critically examine Islam.  We all know it's a deeply illiberal *ideology* but we're doing nothing to speak out against it.

/u/backtowriting said : 

"" The Guardian goes out of its way to avoid any criticism of Islam.""

Actual research says: 

""In recent years, however, we have seen the increasing importance of stories focusing on
religious and cultural differences between Islam and British culture or the West in general
(22% of stories overall) or Islamic extremism
(11% overall). Indeed, 2008 was the first year
in which the volume of stories about religious and cultural differences (32% of stories by
2008) overtook terrorism related stories (27% by 2008). Coverage of attacks on or problems
facing Muslims, on the other hand, has steadily declined as a proportion of coverage. In sum,
we found that the bulk of coverage of British Muslims - around two thirds - focuses on
Muslims as a threat (in relation to terrorism), a
problem (in terms of diffe
rences in values) or
both (Muslim extremism in general).
The language used about British Muslims reflects the negative or problematic contexts in
which they tend to appear. Four of the five most common discourses used about Muslims in
the British press associate Islam/Muslims with threats, problems or in opposition to
dominant British values. So, for example, the idea that Islam is dangerous, backward or
irrational is present in 26% of stories. By
contrast, only 2% of stories contained the
proposition that Muslims supported dominant moral values.
Similarly, we found that the most common nouns used in relation to British Muslims were
terrorist
, extremist, Islamist, suicide bomber
and
militant,
with very few positive nouns (such
as ‘scholar’) used. The most common adjectives used were
radical, fanatical,
fundamentalist, extremist
and
militant
. Indeed, references to radical Muslims outnumber
references to moderate Muslims by 17 to one. ""

Hate the Muslims as much as you like, but bollocks is bollocks and this due is spreading it. 


Edit 2: all right I have a sort of half apology to give to /u/unexpecteditem

A) I thought he was someone else. 
B) So some of the stuff I've added to this thread is wrong - I no longer think he's recycling Baron Bodissey et al ( that would be /u/backtowriting)
c) Thus I apologise for going postal on that part
d) I , however, don't think my initial comment about how the Press criticises Muslims and Islam all the time is wrong as is supported by research. 
e) I will be leaving the full thread as a record of what I have done wrong and an example to myself for contemplation

true,fergus783,null,null,"I'm a current Electronic and Electrical Engineering 1st year, so i'll give a shot at answering most of the questions you've asked. 

1. Engineering courses
Unless you are doing a combined degree (e.g electrical and mechanical), you get an outside subject and this can be pretty much anything you want it to be. You can change this each semester, or continue it if the course continues over both semesters.
I had a look at the higher level IB maths online (I'm from Scotland so have no experience of it) and it looks pretty similar to the maths you do in first year if that's any help to you.

2. The Uni/Uni life
I've really had no issues with the university so far, and it's been a great experience. There is a countless amount of societies, and i'm certain there's one for everyone, and if there's one thing I wish I'd done in fresher's week it would have been to join a few societies. They are a great way to meet new people with similar interests to yourself. 
Edinburgh is a very diverse university, and everyone is generally very friendly. 

3. Housing/transportation
I would strongly recommend applying for university halls next year. They are a great way to meet other freshers and the majority of self-catered are located very close to the central campus (where the majority of your 1st year will be). If you are more inclined to go for catered accommodation, all of that  is at Pollock Halls which is a 10/15 minute walk from central. 
You'll have to travel to the King's Buildings campus a few times in semester 1, but that'll get more frequent in semester 2 and once you hit 2nd year you're pretty much there for every class. It's around 2 miles from the central campus and the University provide a free shuttle bus that takes around 20 mins. Personally, I cycle there as it usually takes much less time than the bus (although I do arrive a bit sweaty haha).

Hands down the best part of the whole thing was classic Martin Allen in the pre match interview a few days prior saying 'the team will be the same as on Tuesday'. A team that did beat Hereford 2-0 but also included Jon Nurse and Harry Crawford two of the most lackluster players in the world. Also implying that our best 3 were still out, Jake Hyde, Mark Byre, Luisma Villa, and wouldn't be up for selection.

However.

On the day, Jake Hyde and Mark Byrne both started. It was fantastic, we controlled most of the match, we brought 606 away and were noisy as hell. [This guy got ejected but started chanting and dancing outside the gates so they sent out 2 met police to steward.](http://i.imgur.com/uYDTloL.jpg)

Those parties that know they are unlikely to end up governing for real (eg, BNP, UKIP, Greens) are much more gung-ho about what they put in their manifestos, and thus make over-generalised, simple statements that most people could agree with most circumstances.

The main parties by contrast have to be much more careful about what goes into their manifestos since there's a reasonable chance the electorate will be holding them to account over it. As a result, their policies are far more specific, expressed in detailed language that appeals less to the ordinary voter.

His best attributes are his work rate and selflessness, thankfully, because Mirallas and Deulofeu are making me crazy with their great runs with no end product at all.
Deulofeu could have set up about 4-5 clear chances for someone else and he didnt bother to pick out the pass, instead looking for a shot or senseless cross. 

Mirallas was his usual self, he scored the goal which was great, especially with the quality of McGeady's build up, but he is petulant. Complaining that Lukaku won't feed him through at every occasion and then going solo when he has 3 teammates standing in better positions than him. It's evident and I'm sure that Martinez will be working on it, because if we can get everyone playing for each other then the results won't be as hard to come by as it was today. 

Subs were perfectly used by Martinez. Disappointed that Ross came off, but it looked precautionary. Hopefully he isn't injured too badly. MOTM Naismith easily but John Stones has to get an honourable mention. He was absolutely immense today, he hardly put a foot wrong, which we needed because Distin was looking a bit shaky.

I think they've done a decent job with the economy, although they could have been a bit sharper in getting large projects kicked off.

I agree with the basic idea of having a single universal credit, but think they've been a bit impetuous / brutal in overturning some existing programmes. I see it as a bit damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don't, mind you, since they've also caught flack for not getting enough people to move quickly enough after implementing their spare room penalty on council properties.

I could see myself voting Labour, but they seem to be studiously avoiding having any sensible policies at the moment. I also think they would have ducked taking the necessary decisions, since it would have involved admitting how badly they cocked up their last term in office.

And you're lying about having an experience with ""bigots"" unless you're on one of ""Infidel groups"" who love to spend their time finding ways of putting something ""provocative"" on Youtube. 

The difference between us is that I've read JS Mill, Berlin and others all my life. The difference between us is that when Orwell was writing about I understood what he meant  unlike people like you who miss the point completely. Bigotry and fascism comes the ability of people to create an other and demonise, it comes from the ability of rational people to dehumanise other people.

You've really chosen the wrong dude to demonstrate your ignorance to and your lack of understanding. You've been outed as a bigot. 

Let's state this again - there is NO evidence of the lack of ""muslim"" media stories that ""No one will talk about"". It is a talking point introduced on far right websites and has been for a long time. 

Here is a quote from Baron Bodissey: 

""I’ll be covering the individual sessions in some detail in later posts, but a brief overview is in order. Like the meetings in Vienna and Copenhagen, the sessions were mostly in workshop format, with moderated general discussion in a roundtable format. Emphasis was placed on the fact that in the repression of the current politically correct regime, what we do makes us dissidents. A nascent totalitarianism — in which state control on both sides of the Atlantic is exerted through government social and financial benefits — will gradually force us into a kind of samizdat.

With these repressive conditions in mind, several of the sessions focused on working around the MSM to spread the truth about the dangers of Islamization. ""

Religion isn't some magic thing that appeared from nowhere. They and their teachings grew up and spread because those teachings were the ones people actually liked and that worked well. To whatever extent society took its morals from religion, you have to recognise that religion as a social construct *presented* morals that people found acceptable, and indeed which would help the spread of that religion.

Of course there are other factors, and certainly we can see even nowadays people basing moral structures on the stuff that originally got written down rather than whatever process guided those teachings.

* Midfield has been just as disjointed.  Bentaleb isn't doing anything really wrong, but he's just been there.  Siggy much the same.  Some poor giveaways and passes between them though, which is worrying.  

* Lennon has been invisible.  Basically non existent.  Chadli has gotten into some decent positions, but not really made anything happen.  Eriksen had our best chance of the game and looks less bad than everyone behind him, though he fucked up by not tracking Johnson's run on the goal.  Not a winger, but we all knew that.

* Soldado has been decent enough.  All over the pitch, been involved in some decent moves.  Forced a save on that curler from Migs.  

Overall, we look like shit.  A few decent attacking moves don't come close to hiding it.  Same old problem of no pressing in midfield to accompany the high line.  It's a basic concept, and really bothersome that we don't seem to have done anything about it.",0,1396194735,null,0,false,0,cgfovh1,t3_21qut6,t1_cgfovh1,t3_21qut6,null,1433133768,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

He's great vs. teams like Arsenal and Chelsea that aren't as quick or slippery as Liverpool. Those teams also pack the midfield, making Sandro more effective.

Why? If you have a chronic condition, prescriptions get really expensive, really quickly; and pre-payment certificates are as regressive as prescription fees. Even in the case of acute conditions, for someone who spends every penny they earn, £8 is as unaffordable as £80.

The only reason I can think of that people would be less likely to forego medication than a GP appointment is that people who can't afford medication are less likely to book an appointment in the first place, knowing that they will probably be prescribed medication which they can't afford.

You can talk about passion all you want and how you feel bad for him not being manager at the end of the season, but not once has he shown the results to merit the position. We're acting like manager is his divine right when in fact, he knew damn well this was a care taker job. Further more, he knew that Top 4 was the goal of the club at the end of the season.

Anyway, the main point is that healthcare is more externality generating than telecommunications. This is what I mean when I refer to failure: the failure of the market to fully price certain activities. 

[Healthcare isn't fully priceable in economic terms.](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/why-markets-cant-cure-healthcare/) When it's tried, it fails miserably - much more miserably than privatised telecommunications ever could, because of the distortions competition creates in healthcare specifically. 

Healthcare costs a greater proportion of household income than telecommunications, which means for instance, that in a privatised system, people that can't afford preventative care won't access it. 

I'm not talking about infrastructure. That's usually maintained by the state in any case, as it's too important to be left to the market, which would rather spend any excess profits on shareholder dividends or lobbying than investment in infrastructure.

We've got loads of midfield talent to sort out and discover what works (Sandro, Bentaleb, Carroll, Holtby, Dembele, Siggy, Livermore, Capoue). The only major issue is the back.

Sherwood is just picking up the broken pieces and how are you suppose Sherwood to get it to work? Doubt even Mourinho could do anything.

A lot of the players we bought in have serious problem adapting to English football. Soldado, Chadli, Lamela, Paulinho and more. We wasted talent like Holtby which is pretty decent. Adebayor is inconsistent. I don't see many people can do much better than Sherwood did.

Another big problem is how stacked are we in the midfield. We are so solid in the midfield on the paper. Sandro, Dembele, Erikson, Sigurdsson, Capoue, Holtby, and Paulinho. They are all decent players, despite some attitude problem might exist, but they are all very decent. We are so stacked and overlapped in the midfield that we can't fire up the players. They each get very limited time on the pitch to glue together as a team, how can they get fire up and get used to the system then? We haven't mention the wingers that we have in the midfield who are taking up the MF spots too. Only two of those decent players we can play in each match, and rest of them have to be a benchwarmer. This just won't work out.

I am not saying Sherwood is great, but look at the stats Sherwood got us and compare with those that AVB got us, it's about the same. I would say Sherwood is fit to be a mid-table manager too.

Sherwood won't stay after this season, maybe he will be back in the coaching staff, but I definitely don't see him being the head coach anymore with the type of person Levy is.",0,1396197270,null,0,1396197734,0,cgfptdd,t3_21r4li,t1_cgfptdd,t3_21r4li,null,1433134278,-1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1

true,kde01,king,,"There was a downward spiral. Looking at league results doesn't do anything, you know that. Saying 'we lost 5-0 to Liverpool under AVB and 4(+)-0 under Sherwood so they're both equal' misses *so* much.

AVB had poisoned the locker room and the back room. He had turned players and staff against each other, and everyone against him. Our team was absolutely lazy and lackluster on the pitch. 

We needed someone to come in and stabilize the club. Someone from outside wouldn't have been able to do as well. Sherwood was a very safe gamble. He'd be worth it even if we ended in 10th place. We were so destroyed mentally and physically (with all the injuries) that this season was over in mid December. The fact that people still thought we could get CL was extremely optimistic but the fact that it was a possibility until mid/last week says plenty about Sherwood. He kept us up there long enough, and now we're losing to the second best team in the league. 

To say Sherwood hasn't done well enough is a downright lie, and one that's very reactionary. Sleep on it and let me know what you think tomorrow, when you're not so worked up about this match. Whether it's repairing relationships in the back room at the club, restoring confidence in the squad, finally integrating new players, or anything else he's responsible for you need to realize Sherwood has done plenty.

Defending was horrendous.  Once again we let up early goals due to poor mental focus and individual errors.  We can't afford to do that against the lower sides, much less one of the best attacking sides in the fucking league.  Awful effort.  And as has been talked about ad nauseum, the high line with no pressure in midfield is not a functional strategy.  Never has been, never will be.  And I have to quesiton why we stuck with it with our two slowest centerbacks.  Kaboul can get going, but not at the speed Sturridge, Sterling, and Suarez can.

Midfield was disjointed.  No cohesiveness at all.  Sig and Bentaleb were absent, we really could have used Sandro instead of Sig.  Tow holding mids against Liverpool isn't just an option, it's more like a necessity.  Especially with Rose and Naughton as the fullbacks.  Eriksen's tracking is not good, and as always I question why he wasn't played in the center.  Neither he nor Chadli really looked good, but they sure as hell would have been better swapped around I think.  Lennon was invisible, though I don't think Townsend would have been too much better.

Soldado was alright.  He didn't have much to do, considering we had almost no meaningful possession.  But when he got the ball I though he looked active.  At least not bad, which is better than I can say for most of our performance today.

I was coming around on Timmy a bit before today. I still didn't agree on a lot of what he did, but he looked like he was learning from his mistakes.  He made some good changes over the last few weeks.  But then he did the same thing I got annoyed by early on.  He didn't tweak his tactics to fit his opposition.  Both in team selection and the actual philosophy he had us playing with.  And then when it wasn't working, he still did nothing.  Just sat up in the stands and hung out.  I don't understand it.

Side note, I fucking hope Vert and Soldado are okay.  I love Daws, but he's been a liability a lot.  Kaboul is the best partner for him I think, but still, I'm worried.  And Soldado much the same.  I like Kane, but I don't know if I want him starting right now.  Ade is still semi injured as well.  Plus, Soldado was looking much improved.  Again, hope they're alright.

Top four is basically gone at this point, we really needed a result here.  Should be able to hold on to sixth, and pray to whoever you pray to that City win the title and Everton pip Arsenal to fourth.

Cities will have more jobs/opportunities but cities cost more to live in. Living in the areas closest to cities may be more expensive than not because of the commuter market. 

I grew up in Yorkshire, which is probably one of the cheapest areas in the country for living costs and definitely house prices/rent. 

Heading near Manchester way I don't think would be a bad idea as plenty goes on around there without picking up the premium price of the south. There's always lots of random news articles about this sort of thing as everybody so have a google about. 

""where there are jobs"" is just the vague part - there's jobs everywhere but you have to find them, and be qualified/in-line with candidates. Probably best to try look online and find jobs and then look into the area, rather than the other way round.

* High line against Suarez and Sturrdige.

* Eriksen out wide?

Not to mention sending Holby out on loan when he has looked like one of Fulhams best players. Freezing out a lot of our midfielders.  Benching Soldado after he finally scored a goal. Making one substitution in the 89th minute and that was due to injury.  Has no faith in anyone on the bench.

Alleged Al Nusra arrested in Turkey with Sarin, borders Syria.

http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22720647

It's not difficult to smuggle weapons into Syria, tens of thousands of tons of weapons have already made it through to rebels. Just one example below.

Now check out the report detailing the doubt on where the chemical weapons attack in Syria came from by a former UN weapons expert and scientists from MIT.

It really isn't difficult to argue that it was possible this was an event staged by anyone other than Syria to get a response which it nearly did from the US. Considering Turkey have been caught discussing faking an attack on itself to justify war, and the faulty US intelligence, things might not appear as they seem.

we have player like Lennon with lot of pace but we are not using them. Why not pass ball infront of him, with his pace it will give defender difficult time.

No wing play at all. We used to be good at wings. When our player near wings no overlapping runs. Players does run to conner flag the to stretch the play and if defender does not run with him the player with ball can pass him and he can take time and put decent cross.

It's hard to say what would happen if AVB gets the squad that he wants, but realistically, are we going to get players like Hulk?

Yes, AVB may blame Baldini on this, but that's how it is for many managers out there and it's the manager's responsibility to deal with it. Despite Baldini's pointless purchases, AVB did managed to get few players that he wanted like Soldado and Chadli. We can perhaps make excuses for Soldado for the lack of creation in the team and he starts to lose confident. Chadli has a lot of opportunities on the field, and sad to say he was a disappointment.

AVB failed to create scoring opportunity for the team. His expectation was to bring the team into CL, but it wasn't even close. We were only winning against bottom half table teams by those penalties we were rewarded. I could definitely see why Levy wants a new interim to possible shake things up and which Sherwood did had a good run with Adebayor in the first couple of games.

It's hard to say how it would be if AVB stayed. Maybe we might be better, or we might be in a worse spot, but there are definitely enough reasons to have AVB removed at that time.

IMO, AVB's style is not fit for English football. His spell in Chelsea could most likely consolidate the theory of his style is not fit in England. He had a CL winning squad. Speaking of that, if we can't secure Van Gaal, I don't mind Di Matteo to be our next head coach as his free lunch is done this summer.

It was very obvious to everyone that he had an over arching vision for how the team should play. Not so with Sherwood. Does anyone really know what he's trying to implement in our squad? Looks like a central winger and... I guess thats it. Everything else is pretty much the same. AVB got shit for playing inverted wingers, and this Sherwood motherfucker has Eriksen playing on the left.  

&gt;He was hopeless, just as much so as Sherwood

Plain wrong. Besides what I've already explained, AVB had experience. What it comes down to is AVB's system failing, and Sherwood failing to implement a system. I think its obvious which one is better (although marginally).

You also casually dismiss our inability to be a top 4 team simply because of lack of management. **It is vital** to have competent management in a team that wishes to not only reach the top 4, but be strong in each and every match and provide a consistent challenge in competitions. Do you think the players do all the work? Are they the ones completely responsible for the success of any club's accolades? Have Sir Alex Ferguson's 27 years at United meant nothing more than the accomplishments of players like Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer, Teddy Sherringham, etc?

As far as ""next year"" goes, I, personally, am tired of hearing this argument. For one, it's a completely fallacious argument. Mainly, it's dismissive and ignorant of the problems currently at hand. This argument presupposes that the rest of the league will magically ""wait"" for your team to catch up. Subconsciously, anyone who makes this argument merely envisions a new season, or rather the current season at its beginning, with their club magically having more experience than before. Do you think Manchester United will not improve this offseason, whether they bring in a more suitable manager or allow Moyes to further gel with his squad? Do you think Chelsea will not improve their club even with the amount of talent they have already? Do you think Mourinho will not become closer to the players there? Do you think Roberto Martinez will learn more from this season after managing a club much bigger than Wigan, a club he accomplished so much with despite its stature? **Other clubs will also move forward, we cannot sit here pretending we will catch up simply based on the natural passage of time.**

Accept that we're not a top 4 team. If anything, it makes it much easier being a fan when you can manage your expectations, especially when they're based in reality.

I want to believe we can be top 4, but that's all we ever talk about. Why not top 3? Why not automatic qualification? Why not talk about winning the league? It's always just ""top 4"" because what we're really aiming for is 4th. The bare minimum. That's what disgusts Tim Sherwood; when he scoffs about the club talking about ""top 4 this and that"" and how we all need to ""wake up.""

So wake up.

If we were a top 4 team, we'd more than threaten to finish there. We'd certainly make a competition out of meeting other clearly top 4-worthy teams. I mean, jesus, how strong of evidence is that? We not only cannot beat top 4 teams, we get smashed by them.

That will allow Eriksen to stay farther upfield. 

Chadli in the center: That's where he plays for Belgium, and he's very good there. He's technically gifted enough to thrive in those tight spaces and strong enough that he isn't shoved off the ball. He's good at playing the pass for the wingers driving in behind the defense (he just couldn't connect today) and he's got a shot on him. He's great in the hole.

Gylfi plays in central midfield for Iceland. He did well enough there today. He's good at closing down channels, and can push forward quickly. He can pick out a great pass. He's not creative enough to be the #10 we need (Chadli and Eriksen are much better suited there) but he's great farther back or further forward. He needs to either play as a CM/partnered with another, more creative CAM/second striker. Those are positions he's shown that he can thrive in. 

Bentaleb is better than Sandro in many ways. Ball retention. Passing. Forward movement. Positive movement especially. In the last few matches Sandro played his forward movement was slow and labored, and he lost the ball often. He was a liability going forward. He's not good at maintaining possession, or playing the ball forward. He's not good at distributing. He's a hell of a defender but he needs to be played with someone that's better going forward to make up for his lack of offensive ability. This is why he's so good with Dembele. One lacks defensive ability, the other offensive. They cover for the other's problems and both excel in their own tasks. Bentaleb is much more of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none at the moment. He will develop his own identity as he matures and plays more. In my opinion, though, we should be trying to play Bentaleb as much as possible to help him find his niche ASAP. He may have a huge role to play next season if our next manager places faith in our youth.",0,1396203053,null,0,false,0,cgfs6nx,t3_21r5q3,t1_cgfs6nx,t1_cgfrcai,null,1433135394,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

Mainly what he does is makes the fallacy of causation all the bloody time. ""There's a problem, and look, the EU, see, they did it. Let's remove them and then all our problems will go away ^(now vote for me, plz, grr)"". Most of his ad hominem is focused on political mistakes, which is *kind of* ok to point out now and again, for instance pointing out that Nick Clegg said the same bad things would happen if the UK left the EU as when the UK was going to join the Euro. 

I think his main factor is that he's not a member of the establishment and is ostensibly against everything the public find distasteful about government. It doesn't matter that there's endless reasons the government is the way it is. The EU, despite being a huge benefit in terms of economic growth, improving democracy (both in the United Kingdom and by encouraging former fascist or Communist countries to democratise), living/working standards, jobs, global clout, human rights, et cetera.

Tiso also have a membership card which gives 10% off everything so it is worthwhile buying one (£20) if you plan on getting a few items.

There is [Nevisport](http://www.nevisport.com/site/location?id=11&amp;n=glasgow) on 261 Sauchiehall Street in the centre. This is a smaller store than the Tiso stores but still has quality equipment and helpful staff.

There is [Trespass](http://www.trespass.co.uk/) in St Enoch shopping center (at the bottom of Buchanan street). Cheap and cheerful own brand clothing and equipment. I would not recommend for anything other than light outdoor use.

There is [Mountain Warehouse](http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/) on 97 Sauchiehall St. Similar to Trespass, cheap and cheerful own brand clothing and equipment.

There is [Adventure1](http://www.adventure1.co.uk/) on 38 Dundas St (right next to Queen street Station). Military surplus store.

There is [Cotsworld Outdoors](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/) in West End Retail Park. Large range of well known brands. No experience of the staff as I have only used their online shop.

There is also [Go Outdoors](http://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/clydebank) in Clydebank which is outside of the City center but en route from Glasgow to Loch Lomond/Kintyre if driving.

There is [Boardwise](http://www.boardwise.com/) on 1146 Argyle St. Small store full with limited range but passionate staff who I've always found very helpful. (Not in the centre, out nearer the west end.)

Then there is [Xscape](http://www.intubraeheadleisure.com/braehead/concessions/ellis-brigham) at Braehead. Here there is a indoor [Ski/Snowboarding slope](http://www.snowfactor.com/info/other/xscape.php) with kit hire. There are also a couple outdoor shops. [Ellis Brigham](http://www.ellis-brigham.com/), [Snowboard Asylum](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/), [Evans Cycles](http://www.evanscycles.com/) 

Since I mentioned Xscape I might as well mention [The Glasgow Climbing centre](http://www.glasgowclimbingcentre.com/) on 534 Paisley Rd. Its an old church converted into a climbing facility. You can hire gear and climb or go downstairs and use the bouldering room. There is a cafe and it's easy to get to from the city centre by taking the subway to Ibrox and walking round the corner.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"You don't have to give a 3rd choice if you don't consider other parties fit for government. You don't even need to give a second option. How AV works is that all the votes are counted, if nobody has more than 50% of the votes, then the ballots for the party with the least amount of votes get checked and of those ballots (who voted for the least popular candidate) their second option is checked and added to the totals of the other candidates.

So say some guy voted BNP then Tory (like a true fascist ;). In the first round BNP recieve 1 votes, Libdems get 9 votes, Labour gets 40 votes, and the Conservatives get 50 votes (for a total of 100 votes). Not a single candidate has more than 50% of the votes (tories only have 50%), so the ballots of the least popular candidate are checked (BNP), and in this example that is the single vote for BNP then Tory. His vote is transferred to his second option Conservatives, and that brings the totals to 9 for LD, 40 for Labour and 51 for Tory. Conservatives win the election.

Using the exact same figures, should the BNP guy vote as if it were first past the post and only choose BNP. Then his vote is ""lost"" after the first round of voting (in exactly the same way it would be lost in first past the post), and the totals become out of 99 total votes, so 50/99 is greater than 50% (50.5% to be precise).

Likewise say that 50 of the voters put BNP as second 2nd option after Tory or Labour. Since BNP are eliminated before either Labour or Tory are, BNP never receives those votes, and even if one of them were, BNP had already been eliminated so the next choice on those ballots after BNP would be chosen.

It's not a perfect, since political boundaries still mean that parties whom receive 10% of the national votes may get none of the seats in parliament. That said, it's a significant improvement over our current system because people are more free to vote for the candidates they like rather than be forced in to voting so that the party they do not like does not get in.

Proportional Vote is another alternative voting system which tries to address this problem by having the number of seats in parliament determined by votes based off of party allegiance. If 10% of people nationwide vote Lib Dem, then 10% of the seats go to Lib Dem. While this is obviously a good thing in terms of fairness. It also causes an issue when power becomes too centralised, in that you could end up with an entire parliament filled with people who rarely set foot outside of London. Since you would be voting for a party, not an actual candidate, and the party would get to decide who gets their seats. While some might see this as a fair compromise, I think that we already see a somewhat unfair bias towards funding improvements in London while a number of cities (Manchester/Liverpool/Newcastle/York/etc) get left behind requiring private funding.

I guess I'd be open to a compromise between AV and a proportional system, splitting the seats 50/50 or something similar. But if the Tories were successful in their smear campaign to kill the AV referendum, I don't imagine there being any more success introducing another system.

My fear right now is that UKIP are eating in to Labours voters, and will leave the Tories winning the next election even though they may actually receive less seats than they did last.

it's also not so straitforward - some specials of animals (most cats that dont live in groups for example), will pace the edges of their territory in the wild as well, so them doing it in a zoo is nothing new. - [BIAZA](http://www.biaza.org.uk/animal-management/animal-welfare/) also make a good point that studies show having things to do is way more important than just having space to do it in.

true,mrmunchkin62,num9-away,,"I understand exactly what he was trying to do. And it was a plan that was doomed to fail from the start. 

**Eriksen**

Accomplished on the wings but there is absolutely no way anyone can argue he isn't a natural #10. 

&gt;The only issue with him playing there for us is that he needs to track back and defend if Rose pushes up

You are playing this down way too much. Liverpool found a lot of joy playing down our left, and last weekend the Saints did the same. What I don't understand is how anyone could think that a duo of a fullback that likes to push up and a winger (more like drifter in Eriksen's case) that doesn't like to track back could work. If you look at our right side of the pitch, Walker/Lennon works because Lennon likes to track back... as a proper winger normally does. Since our system relies heavily on the partnership of wingers/fullbacks, it can fall apart very easily. This has happened time and again under Tim, and I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't address this issue before the end of the season. For all the good Eriksen has done for use, he is dreadful at pressing and hassling the opposition (not to mention marking). That's not his fault - hes a #10. But Timmy puts him in a place where his weaknesses are exposed much too easily. 

**Chadli**

 The natural winger we need on the left. His crosses are deadly, and he can get around a man. Moreover, I'm sure he would be much more comfortable tracking back than Eriksen is. Don't know if anyone in their right mind could claim that they would prefer to have Chadli in the hole rather than Eriksen. 
&gt;He's good at playing the pass for the wingers driving in behind the defense

What wingers? Eriksen rarely makes runs that a winger would make, so I guess the pass would go out to Lennon, a player that cannot claim finishing or crossing as his forte. Eriksen is just as good if not better at making a killer pass so why not just play both in their regular position?  I'm well aware that Chadli plays in the middle for Belgium but it's apples and oranges as far as I'm concerned. Belgium's powerful midfield allow Chadli to have enough time and be forward enough to pick out a great pass and generally be threatening. Fellaini/Witsel cut out the ball in the midfield and dump it on Chadli who can run at the backline or make an incisive pass. This is the type of midfield that we needed against Liverpool today. 

**Gylfi and Bentaleb**

Our midfield was the fundamental flaw in our setup. Like you say, Bentaleb is a jack of all trades- good at a lot of things but not particularly great in any one thing. He is not particularly great at defending which is something you need when you are facing the deadliest strike force in the league. Sandro does not go forward and he should never be made to go forward, that is just not the player he is. But he's a phenomenal defensive mid that break up play, block channels, etc. Your bit on Dembele was spot on, so why didnt Dembele start? Siggurdson and Bentaleb looked like they had the instruction to press when the opposition passed the middle of the pitch and float around in attack. Yet Sandro and Dembele would have clearer objectives because they are so different: one is a box to box dribbler, the other is a ball-winning anchor. There is no way Sandro could play Dembele's role and vice versa. But with Gylfi/Bentaleb they just looked confused. If Dembele didn't start because he picked up a knock, then Sandro should have still started with Bentaleb beside. This highlights our major mistake today: we compromised our defensive capabilities for a midfield that can do everything ok. One thing you do not do against Liverpool this season is compromise your defensive ability, and everyone and their nan has known this since December. AVB is often criticized for lacking flexibility, but benching Sandro for Bentaleb against the best attacking team in the league is... I have no words for that. Playing Sandro would have also helped Chadli play like he does for Belgium, which is probably what Sherwood was going for in the first place (as you hinted). 

As far as Gylfi goes, you're right he did play well enough in his position but his situation is similar to Eriken's: Gylfi is just so much better when he plays in the middle, right in the space that Chadli was occupying. And my earlier point still stands, this was probably the weakest midfield we could have against a side like Liverpool. Shameful when one considers our options on the bench. 

These players and the tactical roles that Tim made them play are just the tip of the iceberg. Played the entire first 45 without pressing their defense/deep midfield. I don't even know how this is possible. A team that is known to be weak at the back, a team that has Gerrard, a player that can distribute long passes with pinpoint accuracy, should *always* be pressed. This is specially true when you are one goal down because you need to get out of your own half. But Tim decided it'd be best to stay in his perch and let his assistants deal with it. What a joke.

This is a common trope that is pushed by far right websites.. of which I've provided you an example. 

I've had enough of this , here's some actual research that make you a liar:


&gt; ""In recent years, however, we have seen the increasing importance of stories focusing on
religious and cultural differences between Islam and British culture or the West in general
(22% of stories overall) or Islamic extremism
(11% overall). Indeed, 2008 was the first year
in which the volume of stories about religious and cultural differences (32% of stories by
2008) overtook terrorism related stories (27% by 2008). Coverage of attacks on or problems
facing Muslims, on the other hand, has steadily declined as a proportion of coverage. In sum,
we found that the bulk of coverage of British Muslims - around two thirds - focuses on
Muslims as a threat (in relation to terrorism), a
problem (in terms of diffe
rences in values) or
both (Muslim extremism in general).
The language used about British Muslims reflects the negative or problematic contexts in
which they tend to appear. Four of the five most common discourses used about Muslims in
the British press associate Islam/Muslims with threats, problems or in opposition to
dominant British values. So, for example, the idea that Islam is dangerous, backward or
irrational is present in 26% of stories. By
contrast, only 2% of stories contained the
proposition that Muslims supported dominant moral values.
Similarly, we found that the most common nouns used in relation to British Muslims were
terrorist
, extremist, Islamist, suicide bomber
and
militant,
with very few positive nouns (such
as ‘scholar’) used. The most common adjectives used were
radical, fanatical,
fun1damentalist, extremist and militant. Indeed, references to radical Muslims outnumber references to moderate Muslims by 17 to one. ""

EDIT: I'm at 2005-06 season now, we had a 5 game win streak in January of 06 and it turned into an 8 game unbeaten streak in total (2 draws and then 1 more win before a loss to Chelsea in the FA cup). We had another 8 game unbeaten streak in the season afterward but it seems like 5 is the win record so far.

EDIT 2: We had an 11 game unbeaten run with a few 5 win streaks thrown into that season in 07-08, same in 2009-10, but nothing more than 5 wins in a row still

EDIT 3: So 02-03 season was the only season not readily available on Wikipedia so that was the only one I didn't check, and I just went back to check it last. Our streak during that season was 7.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"An ISA is just a savings account, like the one your mum opened for you when you were 5 years old and you used to put into it the £20 Aunty Mabel gave you every Christmas.

Then in a normal savings account, every so often the bank or building society pays you interest on the money in that account -- only what they actually do, because they're legally required to do so, is pay you interest and then take back some of that interest and give it to the taxman.

If you have your money in an ISA instead, then they pay you all the interest and don't give any of it to George Osborne.

And that's the only tax that an ISA saves you from -- the tax you'd normally pay on savings interest. It doesn't mean you pay less tax on your earned income, it doesn't mean you pay less VAT, it doesn't mean you pay less NI, or anything else.

Almost all employers will require your salary to be paid into a current account, not a savings account of any kind. Additionally even if it was possible, having your salary paid into an ISA is a very bad idea for one big reason: here is a legal limit on how much money you can put into an ISA every year.

At the moment that limit is around £5,600. Note this isn't the maximum amount you can keep in the ISA, it's the maximum amount you can pay in each year. So let's say your employer pays you £1600 per month net. After three months there's been £4800 gone into your ISA, and it doesn't matter that you've already taken that out and spent it on food, rent, and Reddit Gold, the law says you can only pay another £800 in. So on the fourth month your boss will try to pay you the money, the bank will reject it as it's over the ISA limit and then ... well then what happens to your money? You'll need another account for the rest of it to be paid into anyway.
