Well, [that's the surprising thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_effect), there's a statistically significant improvement for a wide range of diseases. [Patient psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_psychology) is important, having them ""believe"" they will get better can lead to direct improvements in some situations, particularly aches and pains. Sometimes it's through genuine physiological but disconnected things like simply eating better or getting more exercise as opposed to just giving up on life. But the bottom line is that, in certain controlled situations, ""it works"". 

I've done IT contract work for FDA clinical trial stuff where the placebo effect [has to be controlled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-blind_experiment#Double-blind_trials). If you don't then there's a real risk that any statistical improvement attributed to your new treatment is actually due to it. This is a very real thing that's considered in almost every formal clinical trial, it's not junk science or snake oil. 

The weirdest thing I've ever read is that there's occasionally a notable effect *even when the patient knows it's a placebo*. 

&gt; given the chance I would rather the latter.

Apparently [this is actually covered by a separate law](http://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/29qae9/the_sexism_of_the_uk_rape_law/cinibtr?context=3).

The reason for my confusion is that I recently read [this section](http://thisisabuse.direct.gov.uk/in-the-know) of the government's ""This is Abuse"" campaign, which states:

&gt; If a girl is drunk, she can't give consent - that's the law. It means even if she says yes in the moment, the boy is still putting himself at risk of committing a rape.

&gt; If the boy is drunk, it would make no difference in the eyes of the law - if there are any signs of a girl not wanting to have sex, it could be rape.

I am also certainly not challenging your loyalty or support, nor your understanding of the club's history. Your support is every bit as valid as mine. My tenure is not relevant in this regards. (And btw, I'm a septic as well, I just happened to live in London when I was a youngster.) What I am lamenting is the impending fundamental change that is coming. 

The club will be sold and will be repositioned as a global power, and it will have to do so at the expense of its roots. That's just the nature of the beast. Ask a Chelsea supporter of 40 years what they think of their Chelsea now. Most will say that they appreciate the product and the trophies, but that they miss the connection to their roots. In fact most probably can't afford to go to the matches anymore. Not long ago I got into an argument with a Chelsea ""supporter"" who had been giving me a hard time for supporting West Ham because of our general futility, over whether Chelsea had ever been out of the top flight. He was convinced they never had. Fact is that Chelsea only had a marginally more successful history than West Ham, and have spent their time in the lower leagues. In fact, for much of the 70's thru the Abrahamovic arrival, their existence frequently hung by a thread. It's the nature of the beast.

At any rate, the average age of the season ticket holder at West Ham is something like 40 years old. The club wants and needs to change that, which means that people like me need to be pastured, which is why they largely ignore the old timers. It is a changing game, and it's passing me by. I'm not happy about it and I'm going to howl at the moon about it. I will always love the game, at least I've got that, but when the club finally does dislodge itself from its past, I'll be hanging up my boots. I'd say I've got a decade left.

Culture influences religion a great deal, so it's not very useful to compare country to country. I am specifically talking about the role of religion in this country, as that is what is relevant. In that case, Islam is the religion which is the cause of the most problems. 

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10407559.

Again, i'm talking about this country. And the vast majority of the sex abuse scandal happened at least 30 years ago. It was a terrible thing, i'm not trying to deny what a horrible and widespread crime it was, but it was in the past, which shows improvements and progress has been made, which is a good thing. The problems with Islam on the other hand, are not being addressed, and no improvements made. 

&gt;There are over 140 muslim schools in the UK. So ~13% of muslim schools were given ""need improvement"" or worse. The national average proportion of schools that received a ""need improvement"" or worse was ~14% (ref).

What is the national average for the number of schools which need to do more to protect children from extremist ideologies? 
The issue of the schools was not how the curriculum was taught, but about how the students were taught and treated. Missing music lessons, segregation, being forced to wear head scarves, extremist speakers being brought in, lack of teaching about integration in the wider community. These are the issues that people are worried about.     

&gt;So someone came to your uni who had some views different to yourself - has he hurt anyone? Has he harmed society?
&gt;Why are you entitled to your negative opinion towards Islam, but he's not entitled to his negative opinion towards us?

He told audiences that homosexuality is evil, and that homosexuals should be thrown off the top of a mountain, stoned to death or just outright murdered. So yes, he is harming society, by spreading such hateful views. 

I personally see a difference between views like that, which are baseless, cruel and discriminatory, and my negative view of a particular religion.

They'll want to be rightly compensated for that. I hardly think we're just going to accept something purely to get him off our books, FSG and Ayre are way too smart for that.

That's ridiculous. Firstly, they're *Moffat's* monsters. *He made them up*, they're his creation. Secondly, he's the showrunner and head writer, so by definition what he's done is canon. I'd think that he has more right to do whatever he damn well pleases with his characters than anything any fan wants. Besides, as Zembob said, there are in-story explanations of all those points. 

You have to realize that monsters are characters too, and like all characters they evolve and change especially at the hands of their creators. For example if they never changed, Daleks would still be powered by a static electricity current running through the floor and bound to specially created structures. They evolve over time, that's just something you'll have to deal with.

Nowhere in there does it say that families should not take part in the care of their loved ones.

true,happlepaff,english,Stratford-Upon-Avon,"It's great, and there is room for improvement, but look at all the other countries which have varying degrees of privatisation and you'll see reduced accesibility and care quality.

There are a few factors which distort that particular value you've quoted. For example:

* Accessibility has it's downsides as far as mortality rates are concerned. People who come from worse economic backgrounds are more likely to have poorer health. In a privatised healthcare system, these people simply won't seek medical attention because they don't have the means to do so. On the NHS, they can all flood in. Which is fantastic, but it does mean the service is treating more, increasingly difficult cases with plenty of nice confounding factors.

* Further to the accessibility point: the NHS also can't refuse to treat someone if a treatment is approved and NHS available. This is something private healthcare concerns can do. Indeed, in the UK, you'll often find awkward/long-term cases are referred to NHS hospitals. This, again, means the NHS gets all the awkward stuff that private practices can deflect away. Furthermore, it means that private practices have the means to artificially inflate their own survival rates by bouncing the worst cases to charity clinics or simply stabilising-and-ejecting.

* Public health. The UK is not full of healthy people. By and large, we are fat, we drink too much, we smoke too much and we take too many drugs. The factor you have chosen is heavily influenced by national health in ways that the health service has very limited influence over, something the writers of the report make very clear:

&gt;The authors say that the healthcare system cannot be solely blamed for this issue, which is strongly influenced by social and economic factors.

That does seem to be the case. Even back in Blink, their turning to stone was predicated on the fact that they do seem to know they're being observed. The real question about their original appearance that you seem to be so fixated on is why they would give a damn about being observed by each other.

&gt;Why didn't they just take over the world way before then? That's my main issue, why would the angels focus on manhatten when billions of angels existed across the world.

Why *would* they take over the world? Winter Quay was a farm that they sent their victims to. For a species that survives on feeding on potential time or whatever it was, surely it wouldn't be any benefit to them to let their victims know of their presence, thus preventing the victims from attempting to live their lives to the fullest?

It's also worth noting that the criteria include diabetes, Ischaemic Heart Disease, Stroke and bacterial infections. Three of those are the degenerative diseases of a country with poor lifestyle. The manner in which the authors described 'amenable to healthcare' is also *very* suspect. For example, when determining the rate of amenability of ischaemic heart disease, they just took it to be 50%. No explanation for why 50%, it's just sort of there.

In the context of the Sexual Offences Act, the use of the masculine gender pronouns does not mean that only men can be convicted of rape. So long as you had a penis at the time of the attack, that is all that is required—not a particular legal gender identification. An intersex person with legal gender recognition as female but also a penis can't just say ""well, the legislation says 'he' and my birth certificate says 'female' so not guilty"".

(The clear statement of intent stuff is important because sometimes the gendered terminology *is* relevant—otherwise the introduction of civil partnership for same-sex couples, and the later introduction of same-sex marriage legislation would have been rather pointless because one could simply take the existing marriage law and say that the law already covers same-sex couples because of the Interpretation Act.)",0,1404415606,null,0,false,0,cinsnff,t3_29qae9,t1_cinsnff,t1_ciniy6k,null,1434536989,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt; But there are only so many coppers and so many hours in a day. Think back to the immediate aftermath of 7/7 and the failed copycat attack a couple of weeks later. It was all hands to the pump at Scotland Yard.

&gt; There were more than 1,000 officers investigating those two attacks, as well as taking part in an operation which successfully prevented terrorists blowing up planes over the Atlantic with the potential loss of thousands of lives.

&gt; Yet what thanks did they get? They got monstered for failing to prioritise allegations that some journalists may have been listening to Ulrika Jonsson’s mobile phone voicemails.

&gt; Has the pendulum now swung too far the other way? At last count there were 130 detectives investigating phone-hacking and assorted misdemeanours, and another 30 working on an inquiry into who leaked details of ‘Plebgate’ to The Sun.

&gt; Not to mention all those feeling the collars of ageing celebrities accused of ‘historic’ sex crimes.

&gt; I wonder if those Met officers swanning round Australia interviewing women who claim to have been touched up by Rolf Harris four decades ago could have been better deployed on anti-terrorist surveillance duties in South London.

&gt; It’s a balancing act and one which, to their credit, the police and security services have performed with considerable success.

He makes a very fair point. The police are currently putting a lot of time and money into investigating cases purely because of media led public demand. For example the 2007 disappearance of Madeline McCann, a crime that happened in a foreign country, but because of the extensive media coverage it gets and the vocal minority of people who are outraged at almost everything the Government doesn't do - the Met has been forced to continue the search. Maybe these police officers would be better used to prevent terrorism.

You really don't get to decide by committee that you're eliminating episodes from the show because you don't personally like them. They happened, they're official, they're recent. Is the fandom supposed to read your post and start a petition or something? What are you really trying to accomplish here? Until it is contradicted by an official source, it's very much canon.

6's technicolor dreamcoat is canon, too, in spite of the collective will of the audience. You're not wrong that the angels are a bit messed up and confusing right now. *It's true*. The response to that coat is the same as the response to this. Get over it and just hope that they do better in the future.

Not really. For me it happened because I've lived in the same place for 15 years, got married and had kids. 

So I've got involved in school stuff, helped pitch tents at guide camps, taken the kids to reading events at the local library. I've met lots of parents whose kids are friends with my kids. Some of them I've got on well with and we socialise and help each other out. 

There's stuff that helps: community space, and support for volunteers. The school and local hospital need a lot of volunteers, but to some extent they need to be managed and supervised by professionals. A small amount of funding can enable a lot of voluntary work, and conversely a small cut can destroy it all.

&gt;A police raid on his flat in Thamesmead had found a blank-firing gun, which someone was trying to convert to fire live rounds, as well as DVDs containing ""virulent anti-Western propaganda"" relating to Osama bin Laden and the allied attack on the Iraqi city of Fallujah. Also in his possession was a copy of a Sun newspaper article about Corporal Mark Byles, decorated British soldier, as well as a piece of paper with the soldier's former address; it was alleged that he had been planning to hunt down and kill Corporal Byles. He was tried before a jury under the Terrorism Act 2000, on a charge of possessing information ""likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism"". During his trial his defence barrister described him as an ""utter incompetent""; he was later reported to have an IQ of 69. He was convicted on 22 December 2005, and sentenced to six years in jail on 26 January 2006.

Now read this CNN article from 2012 where they claim that Abu Bakr Mansha is now a reformed cagefighter!

http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/22/world/europe/uk-caging-terror-mansha/

&gt;Raja knew he would have a challenge on his hands. He said Mansha had already been released once from jail in 2009 under strict conditions. But his attitude towards probation officers had been so bad that just a few months later he was assessed as still dangerous and recalled back to prison.

This man was caught with a blank firing gun that was being converted and a soldiers address, yet is released 3 years later! He then has to go back to prison for being such a fuck-up, then gets released a few years later, learns how to fight people in cages and almost kills two men. This man is going to inevitably kill somebody one day.

Samples are an incentive to try new items and they encourage customers to return because a) that product really is worth shelling out for the full sized product or b) that was so nice of them to give me a sample, I'm going to give them my custom again. I don't see how this can be bad business decision. I know that some customers can be a fucking nightmare but you're a business who has to make money, and not all customers are like that. Have a heart.

When I went to uni, there was a uni welcome pack which contained two samples (one perfume, one cologne) which I actually went on to buy the full sizes of because they smelled so good. I mean seriously. Samples are GOOD.

Your point about the Republican parades being a celebration of terrorism I'll not bother with. How ridiculously over simplistic it is to call the republican armed struggle Terrorism. I'm not getting in to that now. 

On Orange Marches being non-sectarian. That may be true of some, but it's not for many others. There is also the history of the Orange and what they've done. The behaviour at bonfires etc isn't abstracted as bonfire vs orange match. It's all seen as the same thing, Orangism. And you yourselves call it culture, so if you don't do enough to call out those people blatantly hating the other half of the community it's going to be seen as just that. 

And that attitude, why should nationalists fly the tricolour, it's not the flag of the country etc etc etc. It's that narrow mindedness that is rife. Perhaps it's not narrow minded? Maybe sheer stubbornness? You know rightly these people self identify themselves as Irish, as they have every right. Despite all that, that wasn't my point, my point was the she amount of flags and emblems on aforementioned streets. 

I'll give it to you another way, drive up around Windsor Castle in London and count the amount of union flags. Some time after you do that, drive down Sandy Row and compare stats. I don't think you'll be surprised but the numbers speak volumes. Is sandy row more British than the queen's home or are the people erecting said flags trying to convey some sort of message?

&gt;The __T3__ is a famous type of [tramcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram) produced by [Tatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8CKD_Tatra). During its period of production, between 1960 and 1999, 13,991 multiple units and 122 sidecars were sold worldwide, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union). Well maintained tramcars of this type are very reliable, a late 2000s survey conducted in [Prague tram system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_tram_system) has shown 98.9% [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(engineering\)), best of the Prague tram system fleet.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"As there are varying levels of knowledge posting here, I will try to decypher some of the footbally terms for the new fans:

&gt; We usually played a 4-5-1 team

This means we played 4 defenders, 5 in midfield and one striker (in a formation the keeper isn't numbered). The idea with this formation is to stifle the opposition by packing out the midfield and making it difficult for them to play. Under Moyes this was often the mission, but he also used wingers (players that play down the flanks) and pace on the sides of the pitch to stretch the opposition, and use the space provided to throw balls into the box, where strikers would attack from. 

&gt; two wing backs and two wingers overlapping one another often

As I said above (jumping the gun a little) he liked to use pace down the side of the pitch to stretch the team, but our defenders (the wing backs, or full backs) would be hugely aggressive, playing high up the pitch. Under Moyes however, it would usually be a case of attack down the left, whilst the right hand side was less free to express themselves- this has changed under Martinez however (more on that later). 

&gt;Moyes left last summer after 11 years at the club to manage Man Utd and is generally hated by more fickle Everton fans.

It is not that he left why he is hated- I wouldn't say I hate him, but I do think he is a cunt. I don't mind the fact he left, even to Man Utd- he would have been insane not to, but the fact that he tried to unsettle our players in an attempt to get them to join him at Man Utd was disgustingly underhand. Had he tried to buy Baines and Big Fella fairly, there would have been no issue, but it went beyond business to something personal. He turned his back on the fans way before they turned his back on him- I was there at the West Ham game applauding him off with a packed stadium of fellow Bluenoses doing the same. 

&gt; He plays a possession based attacking brand of football

This means we like to keep the ball. It is good for wearing down the opposition and holding onto a lead, as they are chasing the game a lot. There are disadvantages, mainly that it allows teams to get in a good defensive shape- rather than attacking when they don't have time to organise, but when it is mixed up with fast breaks at times- it can be deadly. That is why a player like Deulofeu was such an asset, beucase he provided the pace and urgency to an attack, even if his end product was often lacking. In an ideal world Barkley will take this mantle, as he is so good on the ball and so direct with his thinking. 

&gt; Last season we played 4-2-3-1. It worked pretty well considering this was a massive transition in style and footballing philosophies

4 at the back, 2 defensive midfielders, 3 advanced midfielders (2 down the wing and one behind the striker) and a lone striker. Unlike the Moyes system, we cannot naturally pack out the midfield as much, but rely on more organised pressing (ie. moving as a team towards opposition players when we don't have the ball). We also attack far more aggressively down the wings with our full backs (Baines and Coleman- ie our left and right defenders), but the two defensive midfielders cover the spots so well that they are able to be very attacking minded. 

&gt; for God knows why

Because he couldn't defend, and the Moyes system required far more defensive work than Martinez does. It was his shadowing of Hibbo that gave him the positioning and skill he needed to become a good defender- Moyes deserves a lot of credit, because he still played Coleman as a midfielder so he could get gametime, and he recognised the potential- but was too much of a liability defending. 

&gt;The two defensive midfielders would then sit back and cover for them.


I jumped the gun again... yea... what you said. 

&gt;Oh yeah, we also have Naismith who's also known as 'Scottish Messi' or 'Naimar'. Some have argued that Messi is just 'Spanish Naismith'.


Interestingly about Naismith is that he was one of the worst players I have ever seen in an Everton shirt under Moyes (although he did score against Liverpool...), but under Martinez he has been pretty decent. Will never be more than a rotation player, but is a damn useful talent to have in that regard. 

&gt; could pass

What? I never saw evidence of this...

&gt;I think he always played a 5-3-2

Bit more complicated than the others as this is also known as a 3-2-3-2 because there are 3 central defenders, 2 wing backs (wide players who cover the whole pitch), 3 midfielders and 2 forwards. It is a game that requires a hell of a lot of team understanding and tactical knowhow. It had bombed horribly in Britain whenever English teams have tried it recently (most notably Man City and Liverpool) because it is more of a continental style that is alien to English lads, which is why Martinez has not rushed into it. 

I think our shape is about right currently that we don't need to push towards changing the style- but if Martinez decides it is the way forward, then it is the way forward.  ",0,1404422264,null,0,false,0,cinvvsy,t3_29q4js,t1_cinvvsy,t1_cineiuc,null,1434538428,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

My head canon about that is pretty simple: They can only control things that are made by others to represent a living thing, an idea of a person or something that looks like something alive.

Not voting, or not voting for this specific party, or even voting for this party but under the impression they wouldn't do this, is still a part of that whole system. It still makes up the aggregate. 

When you're talking about aggregates you can use averages to give absolute statements that may not necessarily be true on the micro level.

We, the country, includes everybody within the system. The only people you can possibly make the argument ""didn't vote for this"" would be those who cannot vote, such as those who are underage, or in prison. 

If you are a part of a group and that group eats cheeseburgers, when people say ""Your group eats cheeseburgers"" then you are included, even if you don't specifically eat cheeseburgers, because you're a part of that group. The United Kingdom is a group, and as long as you're a resident and have the ability to vote, regardless of whether you do or not, you are responsible for whoever is currently a member of The United Kingdom's parliament. 

The British public (we) voted for this government. Saying ""I didn't vote for this"" is equal to saying you're not a part of the british public, which you obviously are if you're a resident. If you're arguing that the ""we"" only applies to ""The British public that voted, voted for... "" then that's a problem with language and the democratic system. I don't see that as a valid interpretation of the ""we"" in that sentence.  

""I didn't vote for this."" is a silly argument that tries to remove responsibility from a party that doesn't want to actually solve whatever the ""this"" problem is.

Don't be, you don't know something until someone explains it.

&gt; I googled and there's just so much out there...I couldn't find anything simple. 

You'll want a basic current account. All major banks will offer one, find one that doesn't have any monthly charges (most don't, but some do).

&gt; I have no idea which bank to go with

Any of the major ones will be fine. Remember, you can always switch banks if you want to later, it's pretty easy. For now focus on getting one opened with a branch you can walk to. 

&gt; can I just walk in and ask to open an account? 

Yep. You'll probably need ID of some kind, but you can always walk in and ask them about it then come back later or the next day with it. You can ask them all the questions you want, get them to explain anything that you don't understand (and don't be shy about this).

&gt; Do you need someone to be a guarantor like renting?

You may do, it depends on the landlord. Typically not though, I'd be surprised if you were asked for that.

I don't know what your housing situation is, if you have somewhere safe to stay but if you're worried about that please get in contact with shelter (https://www.shelter.org.uk/), they're a homelessness charity that focus a lot on stopping people from becoming homeless in the first place.

I'm fine with being in a multicultural society but my opinion is that Islam does not work here, and has been proven countless times by the alienation that is currently happening and has been happening for awhile.

Japan for example, Islam is frowned upon and severely restricted from being preached and their country is an extremely large atheist population. Surprisingly Japan haves the lowest crime rates in the world, more impressive considering their massive urban population and the fact they have almost 40 million more people than us. Maybe down to Japanese culture in general, but the absence of religious beliefs causing separation between the people is clearly playing a part. Perhaps you should criticise the Japanese for being intolerant and small minded also.

I suppose you're most likely another middle-class university student with primarily left-wing views in his mid twenties who thinks just because everything is A-Okay in their neighbourhood it isn't happening else where.

This country would be better off without religion intruding peoples day to day lives and you know it.

&gt;“The players we brought in last summer were young players and players to cover,” said Rodgers.

&gt;“This season we need to bring in starters. One of the things watching the Manchester City game the other night is they are bringing on Jovetic who scores the goal (£23-24 million), Fernandinho (£29 million) and Negredo (£20 million).

&gt;“That level of player to bring into the game is massive for you and I think this year the reality is we’ve been unable to do that.

&gt;“We have started games amazingly well. We have been up in a lot of games before the hour mark and not been able to manage the games through.

&gt;“There are going to be games next season in all the competitions, Premier League, Champions League whatever, when we’re going to need to be able to change the game.

&gt;“I have tried to do that this year with systems and different tweaks but next year it will be with personnel and that will be important for us.

I don't see where he says big names. Even if he did, don't you realise that stuff like 'big names' and 'top players' is really subjective?

Many of the Aspas related comment on this sub make me roll my eyes because you can tell that people saying this stuff don't watch football with a well developed understanding of how movement around the field affects things. At the risk of sounding arsey, I think a fair bit of experience watching football is required before you can pick up upon the wider context of the game rather than simply what's directly going on with the ball, and maybe some people haven't seen enough to pick up on that. 

In any case, it's obvious when you watch the wider game that Aspas is a good player, and in actual fact has been fairly unlucky in several of his few opportunities playing for the first team. His positioning has been consistently excellent, and had he received the ball on a number of occasions I think people would be talking quite differently about him now.

true,HenneyBuggyBand,null,null,"I think you're being a bit dramatic about it, but I can't help but agree with the general sentiment. We've spent the last couple of windows restricted in our signings because of lack of CL, and now we're back in it I feel we're not taking advantage.

None of the players we've signed so far are ones I feel would have been unobtainable if we finished, say, 5th last season. Moreover, the players we're most strongly linked with- bar Sanchez and Shaqiri- are also ones that hardly feel like a step-up from what we've been previously looking at. In fact the players we tried and failed to get last season strike me as more ambitious than our current targets. I'm also slightly baffled at our valuation system (IF it is as reported). I have no idea why we're willing to walk away from Moreno for an extra £4 million or so, get an inferior Bertrand for less money, but then use £7 odd million on an unproven player in Origi in a position we've got less need for, who won't even be playing for us next season. If it comes to pass it strikes me as a waste of funds in the way Alberto and Ilori have so far been. It's trying to be too clever about playing the long-game while ignoring short term needs.

This all wouldn't be as big of problem if we'd kept Suarez, but losing him means we naturally lose a lot. I'm worried we're following Spurs' example of losing a great player and replacing him with middling players, rather than what Juve did 10 or so years ago when they brought in Nedved and Buffon with the Zidane money. I look at our team and without Suarez, and with Lallana, it doesn't really look that impressive.

ALL THIS BEING SAID, it's still only the start of the transfer window, the players we're currently linked to are not necessarily the players we're going to sign. Moreover, I trust Rodgers as our manager and the system he's developed well to still allow us to be perform next season. We almost won the league last season without major signings so I have faith. Although its just this nagging feeling I can't shake. It's probably the residual memory of the last two times we finished 2nd, and shitting the bed the following season. It's been there ever since we fucked up last season. In regards to the league, Liverpool have had a habit of building me up and letting me down. I hope its different this season.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;It's the practical decision. You want to get up in arms about this? Absolve this girl of any responsibility to herself or others?

I've said over and over that the girl needs to take responsibility for her actions. But so does the club and the DJ, who regularly put on competitions like this to draw in customers. They pressure people into doing it because it attracts people to their clubs.

I really don't understand how people can say such vile things about a young naive drunk girl just out of school, and yet have nothing bad to say about the creepy, disgusting, DJs and promoters who prey on these young naive girls. This isn't just a one off, they plan this, they do this every day, they know they can take advantage of these girls and the do. 

&gt;All of this is assumption. Neither of us know for sure.

An yet look at all the horrible things that you and everyone else are saying about her, when you don't really know anything.

&gt;Assuming she doesn't regret it - who are you to say how we ought to feel for her, if she doesn't mind her self?
&gt;There are people out there who actively enjoy orgies or multiple sex partners in one session. There are women out there who enjoy the idea of being used by multiple men at once for nothing more than the sheer pleasure of it.


It really is amazing that people bring the idea of enjoyment into it, you've all been watching too much porn. These competitions are designed to get more people into the clubs, they are marketing tools, if they can convince a girl to do it the club will be more popular. So they offer rewards for doing it, they pressure, tell them they are being a prude, get them drunk on free drinks, tell them everyone will think they are so funny for doing it, its just a laugh. Like i said, this isn't a one off, they prey on lots of young naive girls. 

This has absolutely nothing to do with her enjoyment, and it's really fucked up to even suggest it. This is why I have been asking over and over again, try to have some empathy for this girl.

The best advice I can give is to cold call companies. Go onto Google maps in your area and input key words for your industry/area of expertise. Write a list of all the companies it comes up with and sent speculative applications to each of them. Often the companies are small so won't have a structured application process, so just send them a letter or email, telling them a bit about yourself and what you are looking for. One thing I would suggest that was given to me as advice, is address the cover letter personally to the boss (Managing Director, usually named on the website), not the head of HR. This makes them take notice, where sometimes the HR person will just put it on the pile.

Load Headcanon. Fire!

*So, the Doctor and the Master were childhood friends, two brilliant young Time Lords with successful lives within the Council ahead of them. But they both had a mischief streak a mile long. They encouraged each other more than anything. Sometimes they would steal a Tardis and run off to other planets - always nearby planets, in not-too-distant timestreams.*

*One location stuck with them. A shack in the middle of a desert, on a barren planet. Wild and silly with youth, and unaware of the tragedies to come, they promised each other that if ever there was an emergency, some threat to both their lives, they would meet at this place.*

*Time flowed on. The expectations of Time Lord society weighed heavy on them both. The Master became more reckless in his adventures. The Doctor and he began to drift apart.*

*And then, thousands of years later, the Time War begins. The Doctor decides to utilise top secret Time Lord technology to destroy both his own people and their enemies for good. Returning home for the first time in millenia, his thoughts drift back to his old friend. Their paths had crossed time and time again, but now, in his moment of need, the Doctor harbours a childish wish.*

*He would never admit to himself why he chose to take the weapon back to the shack in the desert on the barren planet. He couldn't listen to the hope in his heart. He refused to acknowledge the disappointment he felt when he found the shack empty. In all his life, he had never felt more alone.*",0,1404434258,null,0,1404434438,0,cio101b,t3_29s6gt,t1_cio101b,t3_29s6gt,null,1434541214,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

According to a policy briefing by the Brookings Doha Center last month, much of the charity-based and private fundraising for the insurgency in Syria focuses on particular areas of the country, most of which involve jihadists.

Until late last year, it was possible to find the international depository banking details for donations.

*Also known as the Hungarian Suicide Song, Gloomy Sunday was written by a Hungarian composer called Rezso Seress while he was living in Paris in 1932. This was during the Great Depression and political upheaval in Hungary. The lyrics called for an end to man’s inhumanity to man and a plea for God for justice. The song, recorded by Paul White, was very popular in Hungary but was linked to a rash of suicides. Hordes of people were jumping into the Danube carrying the sheet music. The authorities in Hungary were sufficiently concerned to ban public performances of the song. The whole world jumped on the bandwagon of this notorious Hungarian Suicide Song. It was translated into Russian, French and Japanese.

Many different versions existed in the English speaking world but the one we all know and love today was sung by Billie Holiday in 1941. Urban legends abound with this song with stories of suicides and bannings of the song. It was actually banned for a while during World War Two by the BBC as it was thought it was detrimental to public wellbeing and morale.

A terrific song to put on and cry your eyes out to, Gloomy Sunday is also an anthem for the suicidal and deeply depressed. Few other songs will make such a morbid impact on you (unless you listen to death metal) and a little tear might fall from your eye…*

Thats's the proble though.  With Sturridge in the squad, how often would he be the focal point of the attack?  Maybe if Sturridge was injured or if they rotated games?

Sure, you could move Sturridge out wide, but it's no secret that he prefers to play in front of goal and he's the type of player that thrives on confidence and getting a lot of touches.  If Benzema comes in and prefers to play as a lone striker, that is going to make at least one, maybe two, of our top players upset.

Now, I don't know the guy's personality or how he would play alongside Sturridge.  If he's open to the idea, so am I.  I would just like to see a striker come in who can float across the front three positions with ease, much like our attack was able to do last season.  I honestly haven't watched enough of Benzema to know how well he can do that, each time I've seen him play he has been playing centrally.

How do you think he would play alongside Sturridge without forcing either of them to play out of their favored position?",0,1404438546,null,0,false,0,cio2ppk,t3_29qe1o,t1_cio2ppk,t1_cinkyxx,null,1434541973,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Perfume samples: we only get them for new products or those on promotion, not everything, that's what the testers are for. Concessions will usually stock samples of best sellers year round so speak to them directly rather than the general shop cashiers (Dior, Givenchy etc)

Foundation samples: everyone gives out foundation samples! Show interest, say you're shopping around, you've heard good reviews, you wanna know what they recommend etc outright ask, polite yet genuine is the key! 

Other makeup samples: same as with foundations, you need to enquire and ask. These are less common though, you might get a smaller sample. Places more focused on makeup rather than skin care are more likely to offer them up (MAC rather than Clarins, for example). 

Skin care: most places have samples of everything, or at least the best sellers or the basics (moisturisers, toners, cleansers etc). Again, go and ask, tell them your skin type and ask for their advice, they'll recommend products and be all like 'here try it first'! The very high end lines are hard to obtain, simply because it's a waste to give them out to people who obviously won't be back buying. If you really seem genuine they won't have a problem, but don't lie you're way through to try and scoop samples of the Dior prestige line, they know you're not gonna come back for a £300 moisturiser so they'll save that sample for someone who will.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"**Bamford** - Read his article with [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/21/patrick-bamford-derby-county-qpr-chelsea). His wants don't seem to be in line with the prevailing thoughts on who is sticking around as the #9 next season. He's 20, he'll probably go back to Derby but I hope he gets sent somewhere like Ligue 1 or the Bundesliga to get hewn out. If that makes sense.

**Moses** - I don't think Moses is a bad player, he's strong and he's quick. He got underused at Liverpool which is sad because he had a really positive impact on the 2012-13 campaign scoring some important goals in Europe. I could see him sticking around and playing out wide as a sub, he's only 23 years old.

**Marin** - I want to believe, German Messi. Sort of a square peg signing in 2012. I think he'll want to leave to find more playtime elsewhere, he's 25 and he ought to play more. I heard rumours about him getting offers from Sevilla and Frankfurt. 

**Kakuta** - He's on contract until 2015 and has been loaned out 5 times in 4 seasons not really notching in a whole lot of appearances anywhere other than Vitesse (maybe Dijon). I remember a thread a while back about someone asking about him, and the gist of the reply was ""he was really good, but defenders sort of found out how to effectively shut him down out wide and he wasn't as effective anymore."" I really can't see him coming back, but I can't see clubs exactly knocking at the door for him. He's 23 and has something like 70 total career appearances to his name, and some serious gaps in his CV with clubs (0 apps on his Lazio loan, 4 apps at Bolton). He'll probably see his contract out if he's not picked up by one of the clubs rumoured to be angling for him.

**Oriol Romeu** - I really like Oriol Romeu. I thought he was physically strong player who was a really talented dedicated defensive midfielder. Considering the DM slot is hard to come by I think there's merit to keeping him at the club. Especially if you consider that there are always rumours that Mikel is on the way out. Everything I've read has said that he settled in well at Valencia and had a fairly strong games when he played with them. I say he'll stick around but it might be tough to see where he fits in considering Marco van Ginkel plays a similar albeit more versatile role.

**van Aanholt** - Other than the fact that he's been on loan all over England, and has played the last 3 season in Vitesse I don't really know all that much about him. At Left Back we'll have a strong starter in Filipe Luis for a few seasons (pending his signing), Azpilicueta can play on either side but other than that there isn't a great deal of depth in the position. Ryan Bertrand has definitely got more experience (and the added bonus of being English) than van Aanholt. I think he stays.

**McEachran** - Immediately I don't think he'll be sold because of his wages. He's a really talented midfielder but he's had shitty loans since he left Boro. Brendan Rodgers also really liked him during his tenure with Chelsea. Not sure what happens next. Club seems to be up to its eyes in midfielder talent, and has a lot of young midfielders in the youth system. He'll definitely end up staying until his contract ends, but conventional wisdom suggests he goes on loan again. Hopefully a good stint this time.

**tl;dr**: In order. Loan, sub. player, sold, leaves at end of contract, not sure, stays, loan.",0,1404438999,null,0,false,0,cio2w5i,t3_29qcqe,t1_cio2w5i,t3_29qcqe,null,1434542085,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

If Savile had ONLY abused underage girls in BBC dressing rooms, nobody else was involved (i.e nobody had a clue what was going on) and no more people were claiming to have been abused then I'd probably agree with woocheese.

But the scandal goes much deeper than that. We now know the abuse was sanctioned by BBC bosses and hospital executives. The mere fact that Yewtree is investigating others goes to show that Savile's systematic abuse was not an isolated problem. This can be exemplified by Savile pallying up with Rolf Harris to abuse patients at Broodmoor. 

New developments are constantly arising, the necrophilia accusations that have emerged being one example. Just this week dark rumblings have begun of his friendships with politicians, most notably Thatcher and her cabinet.

I went to England in 98 to visit some family, and most of my cousins were massive Liverpool fans, so i would watch the matches with them every week (my elder cousin even bought me a LFC kit to take back home). When I came back to Canada, I really wanted to see how Liverpool would do, so i started waking up early on match days to see the games, and ive been hooked ever since!

I've seen the entire illustrious career of Steven Gerrard, the prime moments of Michael Owen, the end of Robbie Fowler's great LFC run, The legendary 05 Champions League victory, The disappointing seasons, the glorious seasons, the rise of Suarez and Sturridge, and the list goes on, and will continue to go on.

true,jgms,newcr-1,"Kompany, Hummels, Silva, Stones.","Doesn't make sense for Chelsea to loan him out again for another year. He won't want to sign a contract after being treated like a second rate player when he feels he has been good enough for at least a year now to be the starting man. He'll have a year left when he comes back and wouldn't command a strong price in the market. The rumours seem to have come from some random journo without a source that was quoted and the rumour has since gained traction, so I don't think its true. Another thing is that Atletico like to bring in cheaper young strikers for low fees and develop them (Costa, Aguero, Torres, Villa, Falcao to a lesser extent) and Lukaku does not fit into their intensive pressing game as well as Simeone would want I think. That's my opinion at least. 

edit: There are also rumours of Atletico interested in Mandzukic and Negredo, who I really hope sign for them as it will mean Lukaku will look elsewhere. We know that Lukaku is Martinez's top target so we will likely have to wait it out as other clubs sort out their transfer situation so Lukaku can make a decision on where to go. We have probably already tabled an offer and Lukaku is just waiting to see what Champions League teams can come his way before making his mind up. I think we'll be in for a typically long summer transfer wise. 

Another reason why I think that this is BS is because Lukaku has said multiple times that he will only sort out his future after he is done with Belgium at the World Cup so to think that there has already been an agreement is likely wrong. Why would Lukaku so eagerly accept to go on loan AGAIN while he's still in Brazil? Answer: he wouldn't.

The whole muslim-panic thing should have happened in NI back in the 80s, but pointed out that these were religious-based christian nutjobs who had a wide reach into daily life.

I hope it's got better now; there were a fair number of kids I was friends with who just rolled their eyes - but there were many more who took it seriously.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Parliament consists of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

The House of Commons is the lower house, there are elections to it every five years. Those who are elected to sit in the Commons are known as MPs (Members of Parliament).

The UK is divided up into 650 regions known as constituencies, and each constituency gets to vote for a single MP to represent them in the Commons. Voting is counted on a First Past The Post system, which means that in each constituency whoever gets the most votes (even if it's not an absolute majority) wins the seat. There is no second round of voting or runoff or anything like that.

This means that an MP can be elected with a comparatively low amount of support. Imagine the following situation with the votes:

* Party A: 10,000 votes
* Party B: 9,000 votes
* Party C: 8,000 votes
* Party D: 5,000 votes

This means that the person standing for Party A will get elected, despite the fact that only 31% of people voting actually voted for him. 

Once all the votes have been counted in every constituency, the number of MPs elected from each party will be known. Whichever party has an absolute majority of MPs will form the Government. Very occasionally no party gets an absolute majority, and in that situation three things can happen:

* Two or more parties can join together, either in an informal alliance or a formal coalition, and attempt to govern like that (this is the situation we have currently)
* A party that is the largest, even if it doesn't have an absolute majority, may try to go it alone as a minority government (this last happened in the 1970s)
* Or if both of the above things fail to happen, new elections will be called (this last happened in the 1970s)

Once a party has been able to form a Government, they nominate one of their members to be Prime Minister. In practice for over 100 years now this person has always been the leader of that party, but there's nothing actually requiring that to be the case. It's important to note that there is no nationwide vote to directly elect the PM -- i.e. almost nobody will have Ed Miliband or David Cameron as names to vote for on their ballot paper.

The House of Lords is the upper house. Its members are appointed, not elected.

Appointed by whom? Officially the Queen, but in practice the Queen will not make anyone into a Life Peer (i.e. someone who has the right to sit in the HoL) unless the Government has recommended it.

Wait, you say. The Government decides the people who are going to sit in the Upper House? Isn't that a bit undemocratic and open to abuse?

Well yes and no. Although there's nothing to stop a Government trying to pack the HoL with their political friends, they know that once a different party comes into power they'd only do the same. Not to mention the fact that the media would kick up an enormous hue and cry about it. So basically it all stems down to -- as with so much to do with British politics -- ""playing by the rules"". It's just that the rules are not written down anywhere, and nobody can actually enforce them. But hey, it's the Mother of Parliaments, we can do what we want :)

Besides the Life Peers, there are a couple of other groups of people who are allowed to sit in the House of Lords. In both cases these are hangovers from times centuries past when Government was a very different thing, and democracy an unheard-of concept.

There are some Hereditary Peers permitted to sit there -- these are people who have inherited a title (i.e. Lord so-and-so) which permits them to sit in the HoL. This number used to be far higher but was reduced to about 100 or so 15 years ago.

Certain bishops and archbishops of the Church of England also get to sit in the Lords. I believe there are about 20 clergy who have this right: it stems from the fact that Church and State have been closely intertwined in the UK for at least 1,000 years, and it takes a long long time for things like that to change.",0,1404454428,null,0,1404463577,1,cio8and,t3_29sutx,t1_cio8and,t3_29sutx,null,1434544718,35,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,35

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Just to add to this excellent response, a note to OP about the process of getting bills approved.

When a minister wishes to raise a bill in the House of Commons (let's say this is a bill to increase the tax on [people who stand in water](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzr6wk7FVXE)) - the MP will table the motion. This is the complete opposite of tabling a motion in the USA - I understand in the USA this means to shelve a bill and not pursue it further, but over here it means to put the bill before the house to be debated.

Once the MP has tabled the bill, it will be debated and the members will vote on it. Because of the way the British political system works, the members cannot be told how to vote - this is by law. However, each party employs people called ""whips"" who are senior party members who keep order within the party and issue information documents on the party's official position on matters. These documents never tell the MPs which way to vote officially, but by underlining certain phrases (like your attendance at this vote is extremely important) a certain number of times, they tell the MPs how important it is for their careers that they vote the way the party wants them to. So you have one line, two line or three line whips, as they are known, which as I've said tell the MPs how important it is that they agree with the opinion expressed in the document they are reading.

So the MPs will debate the tabled motion (sounds like someone's pooed on a table but there you go, that's politics) and will vote on it. They vote on it by exiting the chamber through a pair of doors - the aye door and the nay door, and (iirc) by recording their names in a pair of books in the antechambers beyond - this way people can see which way people voted on a topic, and the number of votes can be counted from the books.

If the motion is passed by the House of Commons, it is put in front of the House of Lords for debate - the House of Lords is supposed to exist to take a long-term view of the situation as they will remain in their posts until death, in theory. So the Lords debate the bill and they can either pass it, which means it goes to the Queen to be ~~rubber stamped~~ given Royal Assent (the Queen isn't allowed to refuse anything any more because democracy), or they can reject it. In the old days if a bill was rejected by the House of Lords that was the end of it, it was considered over with. These days, because the Lords are not elected, if a bill is rejected it is passed back to the House of Commons for further debate. If it's passed again by the House of Commons and Rejected again by the Lords, the Commons can force it into Law without consulting the Lords by getting a 2/3 majority vote in favour of the motion.

Telegraph;
&gt;The Prime Minister said that farmers, cattle and badgers all faced “appalling consequences” if bovine tuberculosis was not brought under control.

&gt;He insisted a cull was an essential part of the measures required and that Government was determined to press ahead with two trials


Scientific peer-reviewed paper published in Nature;
&gt;Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.



So the big issue is : who do you trust? Who do you think has the better grasp of the mechanics of infection transmission?

Owen Patterson, with his BA in History from Cambridge, and 20 years experience in leather *sales*?

David Cameron, with his PPE degree from Oxford, and Conservative Party based history of employment?


Or


Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, BSc mathematics, PhD in movement-based models of livestock disease, 2 years experience at the Harvard School of Public Health researching the transmission of drug resistant TB, and now research fellow at Cambridge veterinary school.

And her two colleagues, Prof Gareth Roberts and Prof Matt Keeling, two experts in statistical modelling. More details on these two later when I don't have to dash.

I then remember an amazing cross by Gerrard to Cissé (I believe it was). Game was back on.

Then fairly early on in the second half, Gerrard is again at it. He scores an amazing goal, and the game is tied at 2-2. I then remember West Ham scoring a ridiculous goal not long after. A cross that was off target, but for some reason made it into the back of the goal. When the 90th minute comes along, I figured West Ham would win, but then Gerrard scores a fantastic goal from way out! 3-3.

true,throwaway5192,null,null,"&gt; It only doesn't do this if you define ""having sex"" as putting a penis inside something.

What is that even supposed to mean? The law you quoted, ""assault by penetration"", only covers instances where the **victim** is penetrated, and therefore does not apply to PIV sex between a sober female and an intoxicated male. The law for rape does cover this scenario between an intoxicated female and a sober male, hence the two laws are not the gender-reversed equivalents of each other.

I am not making any restrictions as to what constitutes sex here, I'm just giving one example that definitely does constitute sex and isn't covered by the law you quoted.

&gt; And as you acknowledge, there is a separate law against putting someone's penis somewhere they don't want you to put it. I don't see the problem?

You've come into this conversation all guns blazing and have failed to actually read anything I've said. To reiterate: I was only quoted that law elsewhere in the comments, *after* my first post in this thread. *Prior* to that I was under the misapprehension that there was not an equivalent law for the intoxicated male/sober female scenario, because I had read a government campaign which appears to imply exactly that.

So I accepted that the particular problem I thought existed does not, and now you're challenging me as if I still think it does.

Meanwhile, that ""This is Abuse"" page neatly illustrates my general point: when you call things by separate names people process them differently. In this case it means that even though there are two equivalent laws covering the same crime with reversed genders, part of a government campaign has been written as if only one applies.",0,1404460665,null,0,1404461291,0,cio9t1p,t3_29qae9,t1_cio9t1p,t1_cinwg4r,null,1435481491,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's busy but it's a very frequent service. I live in the North part of St Ives and I always get a seat in the morning. 

They put double-decker buses on some services so I generally try to get those and I get a seat to myself 90% of the time. e.g. the 8:05 ""A"" bus from Ramsey road in St Ives is usually a double decker.

It's a bit different in the afternoon, I normally only get a seat about half way through the journey. But that's OK because I've been sitting all day at my desk so standing up for a while is a nice change. :)

It costs me £85/month for the bus pass and that allows me to go on any Stagecoach bus between Peterborough and Cambridge.

Door-to-door journey takes me about 45min on average. That includes about 15min walk to/from bus stops.

The buses are clean, the people are quiet, the seats are leather. The buses have wifi (never could get it to work) and power points on the window seats. Overall it's the best commute I've ever had.

EDIT: also, the buses are fairly reliable and always arrive at the right time in the morning. Evenings are different though because the buses have to go through central Cambridge so the times are all a bit messed up.

I'll explain it to you again just so you are clear. These sort of competitions are put on all the time at these resorts. The more disgusting and sordid they are, the more people come to see them. Each club tries to out-do each other with what they can get people to do, and this is a predictable result of that. These sort of competitions should be banned because they prey on the young, naive and vulnerable. Again, I would ask you to try and empathise with this young girl, but is seems an unknown concept to most of the people here. 

&gt;You're just as bad as the people verbally attacking her.

In what way?

&gt;On another note women aren't aliens as you seem to believe. Their sexual interests are as varied and fucked up as ours.


As who's? Mens? Is that how you really see the world, as a binary place where you can group something as complex sexuality into two simple choices, what men like and what women like. You are very naive. 

As I have said over and over, these competitions go on all the time, they prey on the young and vulnerable. The reason the vast majority of young women take part is because of pressure from the people around them. Things like this happen hundreds of times a week during the holiday seasons at these places.

So currently a woman can be charged with ""assault by penetration"" or ""causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent"" rather than ""rape"" (excluding some specific circumstances).

In the past, a husband could be charged with ""indecent assault"" rather than ""rape"".

Giving a range of possible sentences proves fuck all. Just because there is a lighter minimum sentence does not mean that in practice women will receive lighter sentences than men, which is what you appear to be suggesting.

People much more qualified than you (i.e. actually having a qualification) have already established within this thread that women and men receive similar sentences for similar crimes under the law. You 'proving' that there is the *possibility* that women could receive a lighter sentence means diddily squat - because just providing 2 different ranges gives rise to numerous possibilities. Under those ranges, a woman could receive 19 years and a man 4. A woman 10, a man 7, etc. etc. In fact, the only thing solid conclusion you can draw from your 'evidence' is that the maximum penalty is the same, which supports my argument far more than yours.

true,frugilegus,null,null,"/u/buried_treasure gave an excellent summary of the way things are now. 

The relationship between the Lords and Commons is complicated, and based on about 750 years of history since Simon de Montfort summoned the first parliament in 1265. Actually the Lords go back before that, because the king has always had a council of advisors comprised of powerful nobles.

The Lords were hereditary, if a Lord was summoned to Parliament, they and their heirs would continue to be summoned to future Parliaments. (It's worth noting that a Parliament wasn't a permament thing, but was called by the monarch when new laws or taxes were needed). The monarch had the right to create a new peer at any time, but that usually (with a few exceptions) meant that the hereditary thing got established.

From a modern, egalitarian point of view it seems rather ridiculous that somebody should get a say in government just because of who their father was. However, for centuries it was viewed as an utterly normal thing. We still have the vestiges of that history in the House of Lords today.

Today, as /u/buried_treasure said, most Lords are appointed for life by the ruling government, but their right doesn't pass down to their children. This started in the 19th Century when people wanted the Lords to contain more experts on law. At the start of the 20th Century, the Parliament Act 1911 ensured that the democratically elected House of Commons could always ""win"" over the House of Lords where the two chambers disagreed.

The Lords has become a chamber mostly full of senior politicians, lawyers, some scientists and other specialists appointed for life, so don't have to worry about elections and petty politics. They take a more considered, longer-term view, can make changes to bills that the Commons then votes to accept or reject.

We very nearly got rid of the last of the hereditary peers recently, but that got lost in some messy party politics. In practice, they're mostly harmless, and relatively few people in Britain really care because the main business of government is democratic. In theory we're a monarchy that's also a partial theocracy and partially ruled over by an aristocracy. In practice, we're a modern representative democracy and the people we vote for do ~~pretty much the same thing regardless of who gets elected or what they said at the time~~ what we have elected them to do.

There is an appreciation that the Lords gives a view that rises about petty political arguments, and most discussions of reform are about how to keep that benefit while improving democratic accountability and reducing the risk of the government abusing patronage.

true,Alwaysfair,null,null,"&gt;You are suggesting that schools introduce an entry policy of ethnic discrimination!

I am, society is multicultural, our schools are not. Something which I believe is a problem, evident in the rise of groups such as the EDL,BNP,BF. As well as many of the race riots and attacks you see in our big cities where schools are very unrepresentative of their regions demographics.

&gt;In the second analysis, the geographical distibution of ethnicity across the country is very far from even. Presuming some-one were to countenance instigating such an immoral policy, they would be shipping kids hundreds of miles from their homes in the cities out to the country and wee islands to go to school.

I have now said this several times. A nationwide policy would not work, I have conceded this, hence why I have stated on more than once occasion that ethnic groups would need to be taken on a more local level, perhaps a county or borough basis. I have also added the condition, that children should not have to travel for more than 1 hour, something which is already common among many schools.

So I had a quick google from the source, and found a report covering 2011.

So some are actually down in terms of mean days since 2011, despite being up since 2010.  Considering we heard the other day how certain waiting times were now shorter (mostly the idea of a few people waiting a very, very long time had decreased).

The thing that is most puzzling is that fewer operations of these kind have been performed.  Meanwhile the NHS budget has been ringfenced from cuts.  Looking at the full data we can see places like London have been leading the way in increase in waiting time, we also know that the population there has increased higher than elsewhere too.  The question I have now is why are fewer surgeries resulting in longer waiting times, whilst the budget hasn't decreased.

Sure, it might be a fairly vague figure at bidding stage. We don't know exactly how much each component is gonna cost until the estimators have had a go at it, and even then it might be that supplier A goes bust and we need to use Supplier B in Germany instead, and that costs more, but I'm talking changes in the tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds on projects worth tens of millions - changes under 1%, mostly. For some larger projects sure, there will be a lot of changes and the budgets will fluctuate. One particular project my company built, a large one - over £100m - maybe fluctuated by up to 20%, thanks to masses of changes and a strict programme deadline when the programme was delayed by bad weather. Another project which was hit by the recession having been begun in 2008 had to revise down from over £300m to under £300m, a difference of about £80m in the end.

Now this is a double edged sword - some could say that simply *because* Reina doesn't have his years with him, he should get maximum game time for what he *has left*, while on the other hand, it could be argued that Mignolet *needs* this game time to develop for his coming years. 

It's not like Reina won't get game time though, with the tournaments we're in next season, Mignolet can't be at our every beck and call.

To my mind, the unionists' true allegiance is ultimately to Ulster, not to Britain. They use the Union and its associated imagery as a way to differentiate themselves from the Irishness of their republican/catholic opponents, but ultimately they don't feel terribly much allegiance to Britain *qua* Britain. If they could feasibly go it alone as an independent, protestant-majority nation, I'm pretty sure most unionists would be up for it. Dangerfield's ""The Strange Death of Liberal England"" has a whole section about the unionist movement, and he's quite scathing about what he saw as the opportunistic alliance between Ulster protestants and the Tory party around the time of the Home Rule debate - neither side really cared about the other, but they were in it for mutual self-preservation.


Probably the best illustration of this was the time that there was a proposal to name a street after the Queen somewhere in Belfast.

true,ashwinutam,lfc68,,"My opinion is slightly controversial regarding his move, but I honestly hope this is debate-worthy:

Suarez is a world class player, he's got (almost) all the right specifications for an attacking man, don't get me wrong, but seeing his move, deep down, I want him to move either back to Ajax, or an ""under the radar"" club, solely to sort himself out. 

The media constantly scrutinizes him for every action, and, granted he has made some errors the media capitalizes on, he is a very controversial character, yet a great player. I think that he needs to ""lie-low"" following his ban, and moving to a big a club as Barcelona, isn't going to do him favors. 

If he moves to a big club like Barcelona, which is looking more and more likely every day, or even a big club in La Liga in general, he's going to get even more media attention and constant ""rile-ups"" from other footballers, and we're not going to be able to back him any longer. 

Like you said, the main focal point will be Messi - how do you think he'll react to this, after coming from Liverpool, being the target man, to Messi, now being an ""assistant"", to some degree. 

He stated that his heart will always be at Ajax, and I think that should he move back there, he'd feel automatically settled, and less of this constant scrutinizing of his image would occur.

true,jnbarnesuk,UnionFlag,'04 Kwak ER5 - '99 ZR7,"Well, everyone is different. 

I can tell you that I did my CBT and DAS ~6 months apart.

Total cost was £722.50 for CBT, MOD1, MOD2, 6 Hours training and all the associated bike hire/transport etc.

Riding a 600 is WAAAAAY different from a 125. Its awesome. During the 6 months of riding the 125 I learned how to operate a bike, and how to ride it on the road.

It felt to me that the entire 6 hours I spent training on the 600 I was able to concentrate on getting used to the bike that I was going to take the test on. I didn't have to waste any time learning how to operate the motorcycle (whilst paying for the tuition).

I think I would have struggled going right onto a 100HP bike and would have required more training, which is expensive.

Honestly though, the best thing you can do is book a training session at the local driving school. Go for a ride with them, you will know very quickly if you are driving at test standards. 

Remember, being comfortable doesn't mean driving at test standards. You will lose points left right and center for missing obs, road position, timing etc etc. Little things that add up quickly.

Its also worth balancing that out by mentioning that the test isn't difficult either and as long as you are prepared and comfortable you can just go for a leisurely 45 minute drive and walk away with a licence.

tldr; I had 6 hours training with an instructor and ~3k miles on the road. I needed that 6 hours. The road experience was hugely helpful as the operation of the motorcycle was second nature by that point and I was able to concentrate on making sure I did what I needed to for the examiner. I wouldn't have passed without spending a few hours being scrutinised under test conditions. Its amazing what you miss. Motorcycles are fun.

Why is it so difficult to understand that the people who run these resorts, who take advantage of these people are in the wrong also, and they should be called out on what they do?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I've always wondered why the public sector is still using Microsoft stuff, and not something like Ubuntu.

Ask anyone that actually works in the IT industry.

&gt;It's free!

Free to install onto a desktop. There are at least a dozen stages after this, most of which will cost more than using MS stuff. Then there's support. Integration. It's a mammoth (and ultimately, non-money-saving) task.

&gt;It shouldn't be that complex

It is actually quite horribly complex. There are many, many factors you don't have to consider when dealing with just one machine.

&gt;especially when they can't fucking afford the alternative.

Using MS is actually cheaper if you buy all-in-one CAL's that allow connections to SQL, Exchange etc. Of course, nobody in the open source brigade wants to hear this, but the costing exercise has been done for Councils, hospitals etc. many, many times. Cloud-based desktop solutions currently cost 2 -3 times per-user what a desktop/ thin-client/ local offering would for big sites, so they're not really an option yet either.

EDIT: Downvote away, I'm not arguing an opinion - this is the reality. Easily verifiable from anyone actually doing it for sites of any real size. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble - go look at the IT contracting sites for how many desktop-linux support jobs there are....

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt;  In our entire history you can count the number of established stars we've signed on one hand.

Hard for me to really comment on players before around 1995, because I was too young to remember that era of football, but I would say that for recent history we've been doing this and we've also not had a great trophy haul as a club in the last 20 years. We've got some FA Cups, a UEFA Cup and a Champions League title that we kind of fluked as underdogs, but we've hardly been consistently bringing in trophies. I would say that constantly trying to find the next big thing but never being able to splash out on established big-name signings is actually kind of archetypal of clubs that are around the top of the table but never actually finishing in first place.

Man Utd? Bought Ferdinand for big money, Rooney, RVP, Van Nistelrooy, Dwight Yorke, Barthez... and they've won a ton of shit in the last 20 years. And I won't even get started on the likes of Chelsea and Man City...

It's hard for me to really make a conclusive argument because in a way it's hard to assess whether players like Messi or Xavi, even PL players like Yorke were all that hyped before clubs bought them or whether I'm just mis-remembering. And sure, sometimes big signings flop (Hargreaves, Veron, Torres to Chelsea) and sometimes less impressive signings turn out as big players (Hyypia, CR7 when Man Utd signed him, etc). I don't think only buying epic talent in the manner that Real Madrid, Chelsea and Man City have done, but I do think at the same time that picking up a huge-name signing every now and again isn't a bad way to strengthen the squad.

Also, as an aside, Torres was pretty contested when we managed to sign him, as was Suarez to a reasonable extent too. It's not like we were paying £20m+ for players that nobody wanted to touch.

Man United bought stars when they had more money than anyone else in the league (I'd only consider Veron, Ferdinand and Rooney to be in that category, RVP slightly different because it was more about them being willing to pay a lot for an older player who was deadset on moving to them and not City). City and Chelsea too. Do we have more money than anyone else in the league? Exactly my point when I said that the vast majority of 'big name' players are already at clubs like Madrid, Barca, United and clubs owned by billionaires.

Xavi/Messi have never been transfered. What are you talking about? 

Van Nistelrooy, Yorke and Barthez weren't stars when United bought them. Yorke and Barthez never became stars, either. Yes, Barthez was France goalie in '98, but even so was never rated that highly in France and certainly not a star player. Goalkeepers are rarely stars anyway. 

Torres was passed up by Arsenal, United and Chelsea before we signed him, no one would touch Suarez after his handball and bite + usual stigma of strikers who do well in Holland. Even Spurs turned him down. It's not that none of these clubs would have signed them, just not for their asking prices.

You do realise that if it wasn't for the IRA taking up arms against fellow Irishmen they could probably have negotiated better borders in Northern Ireland that would have been better for everyone? Instead the Irish Free State had to make concessions instead of defaulting on debt obligations thanks to the fucking IRA throwing the sprouting Irish economy into chaos. An Irish Free State that had won almost all the things the IRA griped about within 20 years.

The Catholic population in Northern Ireland was treated terribly, but all the IRA did was give people an excuse to do so! The British Army in Northern Ireland wasn't even sent in originally to protect protestants - it was there to protect the Catholic population. Of course they were eventually seen to be an occupying force.

The post-civil-war IRA didn't even pick its targets particularly well. They killed and maimed innocent men, women and children in Northern Ireland for decades - even the Catholic ones who may have been republicans but they just weren't republican enough for the IRA.

The original Irish uprising had legitimate reason for doing so - the IRA derivatives afterwards did not and did more damage to the Northern Irish Catholic cause than morons like the UVF, UDA and Orange Lodge ever could. People like yourself are free to sit in their armchair and see this as some great conflict for freedom with nice clean divides between two sides when it was in actuality an utter murderous mess.

As regards the teams that are fielded by the likes of Man City, LFC, rarely will they field weak teams against the likes of Crystal Palace, Stoke City etc. due to the respect they now have to pay them. 

Last season especially proved that any team can take points off any team in the league. Occasionally a couple of players may get rested when a CL game is on midweek but even this has proved difficult.

For example look at the results of Chelsea vs Aston Villa and others last season. LFC vs Crystal Palace, Man City vs Sunderland.

These are just a few examples and there are many more.

As you say, weak teams are fielded for FA cup / League cup games. Rarely for PL. The competition is too strong.

It could be argued that the top teams aren't as good as they should be but that is another debate.

Again....Implying implied implications, this time concluding with a logical fallacy. René Descartes would roll in his grave at the element of truth you built your theory on. I am not going to spell it out for you either. I implied something, though I think you may know that and are just looking for excuses to discredit someone on the internet lol. 

&gt;WHO'S THE RACIST HERE?

ALSO..... Classic name calling, thinking you can hide it via a question.

This involves the work scheme whereby people would have their JSA withheld if they refused to do specified unpaid work (i.e. stacking shelves at supermarkets for free). During 2012/13 this scheme was challenged in the courts, and the court ruled that it was illegal on very narrow grounds - the wording of the regulations didn't quite comply with the Act that authorised them.

While the appeals were ongoing (before the Supreme Court had decided), the Government passed a new Act retrospectively changing the law so the regulations would be legal. This new challenge (involving one of the same people from the first, plus a new one who did lose his JSA for a bit) argues that the new Act was incompatible with the ECHR as the Government was effectively changing the law to win a case on appeal that they had lost originally.

The Court found that the Government had done this, and it wasn't justified.

The Government are planning to appeal this - because throwing money at court cases is cheaper than having to pay back some JSA, and less humiliating than admitting that they were wrong.",0,1404475499,null,0,false,0,cioch8n,t3_29tkfb,t1_cioch8n,t3_29tkfb,null,1434546974,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Griezmann just had one outstanding season at Sociedad, and while I was pining for us to pursue him last summer (though it would've been considerably unsuccessful given that they had CL) did he instantly become an established star with that one season?

DON'T BLOODY SELL IT TO THEM AT THAT PRICE THEN.

You can't say ""don't buy the milk from the supermarkets that we sold to them at a price we didn't like"".

I understand that they can't do that straight off -- they've invested in growing the milk ;-).  Start looking for alternatives though -- direct sales, offer a better price to milkmen.  In the end though, if you want your client to pay more you have to (collectively) say ""I cannot supply you at that price"".  If someone else _can_ supply at that price, and is willing to, then they deserve the business.

The same is true for consumers.  If you don't like the watery shit the supermarkets are selling you, then you'll have to choose to buy the more expensive variety from elsewhere.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"As an example of FPTP's total craziness, it's possible for the party that gets the most votes nationally to get zero seats.

This example will by necessity be somewhat contrived, but it demonstrates the problem:

* Constituency 1:
 * Party A: 10,000 votes
 * Party B: 9,000 votes
 * Party C: 5,000 votes

* Constituency 2:
 * Party A: 5,000 votes
 * Party B: 9,000 votes
 * Party C: 10,000 votes

In Constituency 1, Party A gets the most votes so his its MP elected. In Constituency 2, Party C ges the most votes so has *its* MP elected.

So I don't think they made that choice to line their own pockets, I think the choice was made because of the US being a very large country compared to Europe (a much bigger difference in the 1940's than today), and because their nation is a collection of states rather than a single state. The lining-their-pockets bit came later, with the financial de-regulation that took place in the 70's and 80's.

Ultimately, one of the main roots of evil is people deciding that money is a resource in it's own right rather than simply being a method of managing resources.

We've already seen people in high and prominent positions turn out to be hardcore paedophiles who had to have had some help. The main problem I have with the idea is the number of people alleged to be paedophiles.

I could easily understand a complex and elaborate criminal network existing at the most powerful levels of society, involving people we widely respect, dealing in all sorts of things from drugs to dodgy financial deals, all so that these people can bolster their wealth and their power. Likewise, I could believe individual networks consisting of small numbers of paedophiles who work together to abuse children. I can believe MPs and other important people attending wild parties with no inhibitions, where drugs and prostitutes run rampant (the kind of stuff we saw in Wolf of Wall Street). And I could believe the security services keeping evidence as blackmail material to control powerful people.

But I have trouble believing in a vast paedophile network because it seems like such a minority interest. How can there be so many dedicated paedophiles around? People who have children themselves and surely have some instinct or moral compass that tells them defenceless children should not be harmed? And not just individuals who attended some wild sex parties with other big names where children were present and, under the influence of the drugs and peer pressure, engaged in some sex acts with children themselves; but individuals who, even in a sober state of mind, are very much attracted to children and actively engage in or at least facilitate the trafficking of children and production of pornographic material.

It's also highly dependent on what you'd do in, say, 5 years if it's tanked. If you're happy leaving it in until it rises again then it's less risky than if you have a plan to pull out in 5 years.

&gt;1: A woman said Harris touched her inappropriately when she was just seven or eight while he was signing autographs in Hampshire in the late 1960s.

&gt;2: Harris was accused of groping a teenage waitress's bottom at a charity event in Cambridge in the 1970s

&gt;3-9: A childhood friend of Harris' daughter said he repeatedly indecently assaulted her between the ages of 13 and 19, including once when his daughter was asleep in the same room. He admitted a relationship with the woman, but said it began after she turned 18.

&gt;10-12: Australian woman Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, said he fondled her three times on one day while she was on a theatre group trip to the UK at the age of 15.

1: how can a 7yr old remember anything about anything 45 years later? I call bullshit on that one. Children's minds routinely confabulate reality.

2: Groping waitress ass in the 70s? If she was too young to be groped, she was too young to be working as a waitress and shouldn't have been there, which suggests Rolf may have reasonably considered her to be of age.

3-9: It is acknowledged that the relationship was consensual. Inb4 youngsters can't consent etc. If that's the case, they shouldn't be forced to go to school as they can't enter into contract. Not to mention vaccines and circumcision.  Teenagers are sexually active from that age onwards.

10-12 We're talking about a young female that could reasonably be assumed to be of age at the time. No sex happened.

The laws used to convict didn't exist back then but have been brought in via Blair's Labour government/EU decree and are being applied retroactively where they shouldn't be.

The whole thing is utterly hypocritical and stinks of a political distraction and a witchhunt.

I used to be a statistical analyst in the criminal justice system and there were 5 reasons for sentencing (this was about 3 years ago so not sure what has changed since then):

* Punishment
* Deterrence
* Rehabilitation
* Protection
* Reparation

Some sentencing methods fit these really easily, fines and unpaid work (community service) are good forms of repaying the society. Drug / alcohol / anger treatment courses all help with rehabilitation. If someone is really a massive risk to society then prison sentences or curfews / restricted areas will help to protect victims etc. Other sentences are harder to fit.

Under the current guidelines it is difficult to see a sentence that really helps.

You doing the 'women are precious untouchable angels that wouldn't dream of anything dirty without being coerced or exploited into it by the big bad men folk' routine is just as bad as the people attacking her for being a 'slut' or 'whore'.

We already have three potential young world beaters in Sterling, Sturridge and Coutinho that improve by the day.  Two of whom have shown they won't disappear on a bigger stage (despite having inferior guidance from the manager).  We have a rock at defense in Sakho.  We have a brilliant veteran in Gerrard.  We have players who have shown outstanding form at one point or another in Skrtel, Agger, Enrique, and Lucas.  We have role players in Allen and Henderson (who is a shooting boot away from the Sturridge/Sterling level).  And we have tons of upcoming players still anxious to show their quality in Flano, Suso, Wisdom, Borini, Kelly and Ibe.  Now we're adding to that players who fit into those roles with Lambert being a role player, Lallana and Can being potential young stars, and looking to put more names onto those lists.  I don't see a problem with our transfers with this kind of core.  We aren't devoid of talent so we shouldn't be all that worried about not signing someone who's unquestionably at their prime.",0,1404479432,null,0,false,0,ciodd31,t3_29tgcb,t1_ciodd31,t1_ciod6z1,null,1434547367,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You doing the 'women are precious untouchable angels that wouldn't dream of anything dirty without being coerced or exploited into it by the big bad men folk'

I've said over and over that she should take responsibility for her actions, and again you are saying I am defending her actions, hence why you need to work on your reading comprehension. 

I don't know what her reasons for doing what she did were, and neither do you. What I do know is that these places prey on the naive and vulnerable. Maybe she did know exactly what she was doing, but can the same be said for the hundreds of women who end up doing similar things every week in these places. Clearly it is something about these places. 

The issue is not this person in particular, but the fact that these places exist, that the reps who work there are willing to take advantage of vulnerable drunk girls, just to improve the image of their clubs. Again, maybe she was vulnerable, maybe she wasn't, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it does happen to some people. 

I'm not commenting on the actions of this one girl, because I don't know the full story. But whatever it is, the resort has a lot to answer for, and my harsh words are reserved for the resort and its employees, not a young girl who I know nothing about. 

&gt; (I'm guessing deliberately) missed women unsurprisingly have a sex drive, just like me and you! When alcohol is consumed inhibitions which we had socialised into us from a young age (for example the idea that sex is evil or wrong) are lowered making it significantly more likely to occur.

Go and ask some of the women you know if they find the idea of what she did appealing? How many can you find. Now think about how much this kind of thing goes on in resorts like this. Either these resorts attract the only women in the world who enjoy things like this, or there is some form of coercion going on which gets girls who don't like doing things like this to do it.

It's Fuck Suarez. After the bite you could see on this sub the immediate reaction from the fans was sell, sell. At least 30% were saying sell sell sell. The 70% were thinking with their love for Suarex not Lpool.

Do you think as a business, LFC can really risk losing tens of millions because of that bite.

*Wages during suspension = £2,000,000
*Loss of Merch sales by not having our best player available for marketing. = £3,000,000
*Loss of prizemoney in Prem and Champ League by not having our best player available = £3,000,000
Brand Damage = £Can't put a figure on this but it could be in and around £10,000,000 as it compounds over time (Essentially, all these new global fans introduced to the sport because of the WC will never support the team with the dirty biter in it. All those lost fans over a lifetime would be close to £10m in merch revenue.
*Est cost based on chance something like this will happen again = £2,000,000

This are rough figures but essential the latest Suarez bite will cost us £20,000,000 GBP if he stays. If we can get a new marque signing, shirt sales and new fans will grow and we will do well in Europe as well as paying wages to an active player.

If we can sell him for £70-80 million now then good riddance and Thanks for the memories. ",0,1404480026,null,0,1404480626,0,ciodils,t3_29tft6,t1_ciodils,t1_ciobutt,null,1434547478,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Taking your reply in order:

Power is torque times revs; the three quantities are intimately tied together. If you're not revving harder, then you're simply not using some of the power your engine can generate. Further, it's power that's conserved through the transmission, not torque; the torque applied to the wheels is the power applied to the transmission minus transmission losses divided by the wheel revs.

To take an example, my current car has 350 Nm of torque from 1,800 RPM to 2,200 RPM, and 284 Nm of torque at 4,200 RPM. This translates to power figures of 66 kW at 1,800 RPM, 80 kW at 2,200 RPM, and 125 kW at 4,200 RPM; the more power I'm able to apply to the transmission, the harder I'll accelerate. This knowledge tells me that if I shift at 2,200 RPM (as torque begins to drop off), I won't be accelerating as hard as the car is capable of; if I delay my gear shift to beyond 4,200 RPM, I'm getting maximum acceleration (assuming I've floored it).

Your comment about ""having 420 Nm of torque from near idle"" suggests that you've never had to learn this for yourself, thanks to driving cars with enough excess power that you don't need to use full power for anything.

While it feels wrong to say that it's normally better to stop than to accelerate, it tends to be true - unless you're already fully in the path of the vehicle that's going to hit you (and thus are going to be accelerating out of its braking area), you're usually better off letting them swerve than accelerating further into their path. Also, if you're in their way to the point where they can't swerve, they're going to brake, too - a driver who successfully accelerates out of the situation is simply reducing the braking the other driver has to do, whereas one who stops leaves it at the level the other driver is already trying to manage.

A driver who attempts to accelerate out of trouble but fails runs two risks: 1) they could have swerved round you, but you've now accelerated into the space, and they've not braked hard enough to avoid a collision, or 2) you're still accelerating as the two cars hit, increasing the collision speed and thus the severity of the resulting crash.

Remember that the context is the least safe group of drivers on Britain's roads; they're *not* safe drivers yet. The goal is to get them the experience they need to become safe drivers, and to restrict them from getting into trouble before they've learnt enough good habits to be safe. And, of course, ""safe driver"" is prone to being ""no true Scotsman"" in this situation - many people would define a driver who's tried to accelerate out and crashed as ""not safe"".

Finally, an anecdote from my time as an insurance intern, told to me by an old timer who remembered the original Mini coming out. The Mini was originally priced for insurance based on the Morris Minor 1000, as the nearest comparable car. To the insurer's surprise, this turned out to overstate the risks; when they took the Mini out to a TRL test track, they found out why - the Mini was so light that if you panicked, braked hard, and steered, you skidded, but the car turned far enough that when you recovered control, you could avoid the accident. The Morris Minor, with its extra 100 kg of weight, didn't turn quite as far as the Mini while it was skidding, and was harder to get under control again. This meant that Mini drivers were less likely to get into a crash, because they'd have a scary loss of control moment instead. In turn, the scary loss of control moment trained them to Not Do That Then.",0,1404480211,null,0,false,0,ciodkch,t3_29nac9,t1_ciodkch,t1_cino4np,null,1434547516,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They will not listen to excuses. You cannot phone them to tell them ""bus is late"", you're pretty much screwed for anything unless you have a doctors note or letter. 

Anway, on the work programme. 

If I remember right, it was 2weeks to 1 month you where paid JSA to work at wherever you where put. 

The idea was you got some experience, work place got someone trained up. The idea was they employ you at the end. Just ... doesn't work that was is all.

&gt; If we can sell him for £70-80 million now then good riddance

 Ok, we will struggle without him a lot more, you'll see...

We simply cannot find an adequate replacement for Suarez that can offer at least 70% of what Suarez provided us in the game. He is worth more than money! I cannot think of a person we've been linked to, or that is available that can replace him adequately that wants to come to our club!

 Sanchez doesn't want to go to LFC, Shaqiri is great, but he is not even close to Suarez, we cannot get someone like Rodriguez or even Di Maria. I simply cannot think of a good world-class replacement.

 And also, I hate when fans are talking about how much money ''WE'' got from selling. No, we don't get shit, club gets money, we want great players! Who knows if we will even spend those next 70 million from Suarez sale... And also, who knows if we spend it, it will not be on more Lallana's etc...

Better than my Thursday went &gt;:-(

I was in Luffbrah this morning and now my work is finished for the day - yay for overpaid half days! - and head teacher is v. pleased.

I was in Loogabarooga yesterday as well, had a nice afternoon with a bunch of Italian students, packed everything up, pulled out of my parking space to leave and saw a couple of lads flash past on bikes. A moment later when I turned my head to check I was safe to move off I saw one of the lads in agony on the floor, wrapped around the remains of his bike, having clattered into a campus golf cart head-on and at high speed.

He was smashed up pretty bad - legs and knees bruised and battered, nasty head wounds, and a suspected injury to his windpipe - and the paramedic looked a little perturbed. I hung around 'til the rozzers and the ambulance arrived, gave a brief statement, and left. And that's when it hit me and I spent the entire rest of the day worrying about that poor young man.

People really need to realise how massive the gap between an u21 league, or championship team and a title chasing team are. I can only assume you're pinpointing Chalobah here, because Baker/Swift/RLC have barely if at all played for the first team, and it's unrealistic and wrong to expect them to make a jump no player at that age could handle. Also they wouldn't see regular minutes if they did play, kids at that age need games. Not places on the bench.

His (Tiago) short term contract won't damage their chances of progressing. it'll give them an extra season or two to be ready to make that jump and replace him.

Gerrard playing deeper is a liability and he was one of the sole reasons we conceded so many goals vs the lesser clubs, he just didn't seem up for it vs them but he performed excellently in the position vs the big teams.

Moreno is overrated, football fans always think the talent available broad is miles better than it actually is.

Flanagan is pretty overrated on here too, he did a lot better than everyone expected but there's no way he'll be our first choice LB/RB any time soon unless he improves a LOT. He's excellent cover though.

true,speelingfail,null,null,"Totally agree on the Lallana point and when I got that figure of £20 mill I did think well shit that is less than a Lallana.

The figures are out of my ass this is true but I am not a business analyst for LFC so I do not have the full figures.

Wages during suspension = £2,000,000 - **Not out of my ass that is his wages**

Loss of Merch sales = £3,000,000 - We turnover over £100m in merch sales and I would say a % or 2 of that is because of a kid who sees Suarez modelling a shirt. So I would definitely say this is a 7 figure loss but yes probably less that £3m.

Loss of prizemoney = £3,000,000 - This figure was low balled. A club gets 3.5 million just for qualifying for the last 16 of CL, forgetting about match result payments. Our chances without our best player is reduced greatly. Totally low-balled figure

Brand Damage = £10,000,000 - Even LFC have trouble getting this figure. What can we say, about 100million extra people global will go on to start supporting soccer now more regularly because of the WC. (Deifnately millions more Americans anyway (and they have money). I would expect Lpool to get at least 1% (1,000,000) of these as fans when the new season starts.. Considering these supporters are in their 20s or younger that will be 50 years + of being a fan and if the average fan spends £10 a year on Liverpool (which would be lowballed again), the bite causes us to lose at least 10,000 of those fans then. Over a lifetime we are looking at close to £5,000,000, with lowball figures. But yes probably less than £10million.

Est cost based on chance based on it reoccurring = £2,000,000.
For this I added up the total cost and said there is a 10% chance of it reoccurring. I think you will agree that figure is lowballed and a reoccurance of the crime or similar will potential bring a lifetime ban, which would actually cost us more than £50million. So this figure was also lowballed.

So ye figures were out of my ass but the fact is, if LFC paid someone to do a proper risk assessment the figure would be at least £20 million.

In terms of a replacement, yes we will never get someone of Suarez ability and this is a worry. The fact is though, we won't do a Spurs because we have CL footy and if we have to wait 1 or 2 transfer windows to find the next 24 year old Torres or Suarez to become available than I am fine with that, I think our squad is good enough for top 4 which is all that matters in the economic sense.

On top of that he wasn't settled, comes across as being pretty shy (from interviews/photos) and couldn't speak a word of English. He's had a season to adjust, is learning English and will have Poch as a countryman. A lot of people outright disregard what games he played for us, because he's been blanket branded as a flop, but he had some decent games.

[Just watch this for an example, v Villa](http://youtu.be/exsCOYDMk7g?t=20s) Lots of stuff to note, watch the whole thing. How he brushes off a strong DM in Sylla at 0.36, his creativity (that chipped ball at the start is sublime, if Eriksen did that and Kane got a shot away we'd be creaming). His strength at 1.57 is on show too and the run for Holtbys pass and shot was great, and *could* have been a goal had it not been for Steer. I know it's all ''what-if's'', but dude could have had 2 assists and a goal this game. 

Also he seemed to have a good partnership with Holtby and looks VERY dangerous coming inside. He strikes me as much more of a creative version of Bale, and speaking of Bale &amp; his speed? Lamela was the fastest in Roma (Zeman had them doing 100m sprints in Pre-Season, his time was ridiculously good even by sprinting standards). I would like to see Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela but I feel it may get too congested in the middle.

Did he personally really improve that much or was it the rest of the team improving that took us from 6th, 8th, and 7th?

No, I'm saying whether or not you call someone a ""rapist"" isn't controlled by what the courtroom definition of the word ""rape"" is.
Many words has different meanings in the courtroom to what they mean in the rest of the world, e.g. ""insanity"" (a word with a legal definition that has little resemblance to its common usage).

The media has no trouble using words like ""paedophile"" to describe certain offenders, even though that word has no direct meaning in law.

I can't say it would, remember I'm trying to tackle ethnic an racial barriers in society.

&gt;combating female genital mutilation

Now here we have a hope, I am going to make the assumption, that many of these such cases take place in schools with high groups of the affected ethnicity (Somalian, I think, I know there are others).

Children who might be at risk of such a practice would be exposed to many more cultures where such a practice is not common place, perhaps allowing them to get a better understanding of what is going to happen to them and hopefully raising the alarm. 

If none of your friends are having it done, why are you?

I know FGM has a lot of other issues associated with identification, but I think this measure could only help to catch it.

&gt;tackling glorification of gang-culture

By forcing children to meet and make friends with a wider range of society, most gang culture is concentrated with low socio economic areas, these children have perhaps never come in to contact with middles class children or the stable home those children come from.

University what is that? No one in my family has ever been and I have never met anyone who wanted to go. This is a very common attitude among children from low socio economic backgrounds, I would hope by them having exposure to other children who families have experience with higher education they would be more informed and not see it as unusual. 

Also such action would perhaps reduce the chances of children making friends with others in their local community, reducing the chance of gangs forming to begin with.


&gt;childhood obesity

Nope got nothing

I think if you have not experienced what it is I am referring to it is perhaps difficult to imagine.

Ask yourself why do children from schools in middle class areas do so well, when compared with children from schools in lower socio economic and ethnic minority areas. It's not the teachers.

So then the only real reason you'd play Lucas ahead of Gerrard would be if Steven is injured or if you're resting him, like I said before, I don't think Lucas would be happy getting 15 starts a season, maybe for one more year but not long-term so why not fix the problem now rather than wait around whilst his value drops.

Obviously Allen, Henderson and (probably) Can are going to get most of their games in the two ahead of Gerrard, but they'll be competing with Coutinho and (I'm about 95% sure) Lalllana as well, so that's 5 players for 2 roles, one of the three will almost always be available to cover if needed.

true,lipmak,EN,england,"I can only speak for myself. I'm from New York. I've had to drive to various parts of NJ for work in the past. Also, my girlfriend's aunt lives in NJ and an uncle of hers has a house in PA, so I still drive to/through a couple times a year. 

If you are in NJ driving out toward Delaware/Pennsylvania or in one of those states driving IN it isn't that bad. The only thing that might affect you is the tolls on the NJ Turnpike. If you decide to get off, though, God help you. You either have to pay to get off of the turnpike or pay to get on. I don't remember, but there are toll booths at every exit. Also, on many major roads you cannot make left turns. If you're on a big road and you see a place you wanted to go to on the opposite side you have to keep driving until you see a turn-off. Basically you make a right and loop around so you are facing the street you want to cross. Then you have to wait for a (usually long) light so that you can cross the road and double back to where you wanted to go. 
Also, a lot of road signs in NJ are confusing. I've had google maps tell me to turn on to a certain street and when I arrive at that street it has a completely different name. I read on reddit that this is a leftover from a plan from wartime to confuse invaders by changing roadsigns and a lot of States did it and NJ never changed back, but that was probably just a joke. 

Driving to NJ from NY is a fucking nightmare. 
First, it's extremely heavily trafficked. The roads are destroyed because of how much they're travelled daily. Road crews literally cannot repair the roads fast enough, and when they do, lane and road closures cause even more traffic. The ride is bumpy if traffic isn't slowed to a crawl. 
Second, the tolls are crazy. The George Washington bridge alone is like $13, which you have to pay when you go back to NY. then there are loads of other tolls in NJ as mentioned earlier. When I worked in Jersey the location I had to travel to was only about 20 minutes or so away from New York. I paid over $30 in tolls each day. (To be fair, there are more ways to get in than the GWB). 
Third, highway signs are confusing. They don't always contain the information your directions/maps are telling you. I've missed so many exits and wasted so much time because google maps would say exit onto such and such highway and there would be two exits next to each other and neither would have the name of the highway. 
I can usually remember how to get to a place without needing directions/maps if I've been there once. In NJ I need maps every time and I still get lost. 

Most people from NJ I've meet are normal and cool. There are a lot of nice places in that state and I don't mean to cast aspersions on New Jersey as a whole. But driving there from NY sucks, and driving there on the whole is way more complicated than any other state I've been to.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Power is torque times revs; the three quantities are intimately tied together. If you're not revving harder, then you're simply not using some of the power your engine can generate. Further, it's power that's conserved through the transmission, not torque; the torque applied to the wheels is the power applied to the transmission minus transmission losses divided by the wheel revs.

Yes, I know all of this. I don't know what point you're making.

&gt;To take an example, my current car has 350 Nm of torque from 1,800 RPM to 2,200 RPM, and 284 Nm of torque at 4,200 RPM. This translates to power figures of 66 kW at 1,800 RPM, 80 kW at 2,200 RPM, and 125 kW at 4,200 RPM; the more power I'm able to apply to the transmission, the harder I'll accelerate. This knowledge tells me that if I shift at 2,200 RPM (as torque begins to drop off), I won't be accelerating as hard as the car is capable of; if I delay my gear shift to beyond 4,200 RPM, I'm getting maximum acceleration (assuming I've floored it).

Again, I'm fully aware that more revs=more power.

&gt;Your comment about ""having 420 Nm of torque from near idle"" suggests that you've never had to learn this for yourself, thanks to driving cars with enough excess power that you don't need to use full power for anything.

Suggests I've never had to learn what? That putting my foot down will increase the power?

No, I'm simply making the point that all cars are different. I have no need to break 3k rpm in normal driving because I don't need that kind of performance and I'd like to keep some semblance of fuel economy.

I'm not stupid. I'm fully aware that there's more power to be had.

I don't see how having driven cars with low power would change my appreciation of how gearing works.

&gt;While it feels wrong to say that it's normally better to stop than to accelerate, it tends to be true

I don't see how you can possibly know this though.

And you're also missing my point. If in 5% of situations it is safer to accelerate, those with more powerful cars are going to be safer.

&gt;The goal is to get them the experience they need to become safe drivers, and to restrict them from getting into trouble before they've learnt enough good habits to be safe.

So put them through more testing. Make them prove their driving skills.

That doesn't mean you should force them to drive something utterly gutless.

&gt;Finally, an anecdote from my time as an insurance intern, told to me by an old timer who remembered the original Mini coming out. The Mini was originally priced for insurance based on the Morris Minor 1000, as the nearest comparable car. To the insurer's surprise, this turned out to overstate the risks; when they took the Mini out to a TRL test track, they found out why - the Mini was so light that if you panicked, braked hard, and steered, you skidded, but the car turned far enough that when you recovered control, you could avoid the accident. The Morris Minor, with its extra 100 kg of weight, didn't turn quite as far as the Mini while it was skidding, and was harder to get under control again. This meant that Mini drivers were less likely to get into a crash, because they'd have a scary loss of control moment instead. In turn, the scary loss of control moment trained them to Not Do That Then.

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"The seagulls in Bangor are right pricks but the sparrowhawks are what you really have to look out for. 

My ma loves putting out food for the birds and watching them come into the garden and munch the food. There was this lovely jet black pigeon one day and we were just watching it do it's thing about the garden. This pigeon was a regular visitor and could be picked out by his distinctly strange beak - but it never got in his way. Timid wee creature it would let you walk within a yard of it and not move an inch, clearly knowing that this turf was safe. 

So we're watching said pigeon and my mum notices a sparrowhawk sitting on the church roof behind us. We both know at this point what is about to go down and we can do nothing about it. At that moment of simultaneous realisation my mum releases the hound (quite literally) into the garden under the strict orders to remove all birds from the garden immediately. He actually understands this (we just say ""get the birds"") to him and he'll run about like an eejit scaring the birds away. 

But it was too little and too late. While Angus made a tremendous effort to scare off our black birdy friend so as to save his life, the sparrowhawk made flight, picked up altitude, made an almighty dive and took the pigeon before he even knew it.

And that was the last time we seen the jet black pigeon. Mother bear near died of shock. The dug even looked depressed. ",0,1404488336,null,0,false,0,ciogb7w,t3_29tnwy,t1_ciogb7w,t3_29tnwy,null,1434548954,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

She's not young and naive, unless she is lacking the mental ability to make reasonable decisions due to some sort of disability, she is a moron. I have no empathy at all for a woman who is willing to do this sort of thing for a free drink, nor do I think anyone should have. 

Places like that do prey on the young, I agree. But they don't pray on the naive they have a certain customer that they sell to, and it works - just like all other businesses. 
This woman was not naive, nor was she forced into it as far as we know - if she was then I certainly have sympathy for her, she was sexually exploited and that's despicable. 
She either knew full well what she was doing and did it anyway, or she got too drunk and did it anyway - doesn't really matter which, both are her responsibility.

Frankly I find it disturbing and even a little offensive that you think this is a case of being young and naive rather than being an irresponsible, and I'm sorry to say this but I'm struggling for better words, tart.

There are some pieces of evidence, such as the letter Rolf sent to ""defendant C""'s parents (C is the friend of his daughter who gave evidence anonymously) apologising for the harm he had caused to her. In addition the complainants are examined, eg one complainant suffered alcoholism since and this can be proven through questioning and medical examination. Thorough questioning should establish patterns and consistencies between the stories, given by four different people who most likely had never met before, concerning events that took place at different locations and points in time (in the max clifford case, his defence pointed out the differing claims as to the size of his penis as an inconsistency in this regard).

Certain parts of the stories can be supported by others, eg that C went on holiday with Rolf's family. They are also trying to build up a picture of the defendant's character and again any pattern between witnesses is important. Any flaws in the prosecution or the defence arguments can damage their side, such as Rolf's claim that he'd never been to Cambridge (one of the charges against him was for an event that took place there), despite the reason for him being there on that occasion was for a televised appearance.

If only one person made allegations against him then it would probably have been very difficult to find him guilty. That it was four separate people in this case, one reporting a history of abuse over a long time frame, made it easier for him to be found guilty.

The last war we had to fight on our own was in the defence of the Falkland islands, the Americans said it couldn't be done and refused to get involved. 
Without our carriers we'd have never been able to achieve what we did, without our carriers everything we are involved in takes place under the supervision, control and behest of other nations.

I'll agree completely that retiring our fleets of harriers was wrong, but this only strengthens the need for more funding to our, right now, poorly equipped Navy. 

Not only this but Britain could use some national pride, running a carrier is a show of what a country can accomplish and as a nation built on the history of the sea having a second rate navy should be a source of shame. Indeed our type 45 destroyers are one of the, if not -the- best equipped in the world, designed and built in the UK and it's a political blunder that funding was cut from an adequate 12 down to an embarrassing 6.

Having said all of the above, you still have my upvote because the topic really needs more visibility. The navy is so horribly afraid of public opinion that something like the naming ceremony today was barely reported, when it could have been something so much more grand.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Culture influences religion a great deal, so it's not very useful to compare country to country. I am specifically talking about the role of religion in this country, as that is what is relevant. In that case, Islam is the religion which is the cause of the most problems.

And what bad things have Muslims done in this country?

&gt; It was a terrible thing, i'm not trying to deny what a horrible and widespread crime it was, but it was in the past, which shows improvements and progress has been made, which is a good thing. 

I agree, so why not make the same improvements and progress with Islam. How do you think the progress was made 30 years ago with the catholic church? It wasn't made by saying Catholicism is evil or bad and should be discouraged, it was by arresting those who omitted crimes. 

&gt; What is the national average for the number of schools which need to do more to protect children from extremist ideologies? The issue of the schools was not how the curriculum was taught, but about how the students were taught and treated. 

Ofsted doesn't just deal with teaching of curriculum. Their scores relate relate to care and welfare of children, that's why they also inspect foster homes, nurseries and other establishments. So to answer your question about the average number of schools which need to do more to protect children from extremist ideologies: the answer is ~14%, again, slightly higher than Muslim schools.

&gt; Missing music lessons, segregation, being forced to wear head scarves, extremist speakers being brought in, lack of teaching about integration in the wider community. These are the issues that people are worried about.

all these things, bar maybe the head scarves and extremist teachers, happen in other poor schools which aren't Muslim.

&gt; He told audiences that homosexuality is evil, and that homosexuals should be thrown off the top of a mountain, stoned to death or just outright murdered. So yes, he is harming society, by spreading such hateful views.

We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one. I'm very much for people can say that they think if they want, as long as they don't physically harm or harass people. IMO, he's free to have his opinion, and share it. Uni students (adults, 18+) are independent and responsible for themselves and their own actions. 

If radical preacher A comes in and shares his horrible opinions, and impressionable student B goes and beats up a gay person as a result of A's words, B is in the wrong here. In this country, we judge people on their actions in society, not their individual opinions which they're free to hold. Otherwise, I'd have you locked up for your hateful views on Islam, you're telling us we should be out discouraging Islam and looking down and being weary of Muslims. I'm sure the preacher would agree if you swapped ""Muslim"" for ""gay"" because they're both hateful messages.

&gt; I personally see a difference between views like that, which are baseless, cruel and discriminatory, and my negative view of a particular religion.

You're basing them on your own values though, which is no different to what that preacher was basing his views on. Don't get me wrong, I sympathise a bit more with your views on Islam than I do with that preachers view on homosexuality. But ultimately you're trying to argue ""my subjective opinion on Islam is more valid and right than his subjective opinion on homosexuality"" which, given the nature of opinions and subjectivism, is pointless. That preacher probably hates all gays because a book or to told him to, and a gay person or 2 has annoyed him. I feel like you're saying we should dislike all of Islam because some papers told you so, and a Muslim or 2 has upset you.

I've never met you, so I don't know anything about your driving style. I do know that there are drivers out there (because I've met more than one) who've passed their test without understanding the link between revs and power, and who genuinely believe that there's no point revving much beyond 3,000 RPM in a petrol engined car because that just uses more fuel for no gain. It also teaches you to shift down in anticipation of needing power - you and I in our powerful motors can  just push the pedal a little further and get the power we need if we've misjudged our choice of gear (e.g. doing 30 in 5th instead of 3rd as you approach an uphill stretch), but in a less powerful vehicle, that sort of misuse of gears results in you slowing down and trains you to think about your choice of gear.

I can't find a reference for the statistics, which is why I'm not quoting numbers; however, my recollection is that the insurance company I interned at gathered figures using cars with black box data recorders that showed that accelerating out of the situation doesn't avoid accidents, and does make them worse (by having you accelerating while the crash happens). What it *does* do is change a situation where I'm going to be pissed off with you cutting in front of me and forcing me to brake into one where I'm not annoyed by you because you've cut in front of me then accelerated before I've had to slow down.

It'll be interesting to see if the telematics insurers publish their figures - this is something they'll be keeping track of.

And I'd have no problems with the equivalent of motorcycling's DAS; either you accept the restrictions, or you prove your driving skills in a much more challenging test, including (at least) some skid pan driving, the stopping distance demonstration with the cardboard wall, a high speed slalom circuit, and a long accompanied drive. Basically, prove that you can drive a powerful motor safely and at the edge of its controllability, or build up experience in a low power machine - your call.

The point I was making is that the original Mini was an underpowered car, but lightweight; because it was lighter than other cars of comparable power to weight ratio, it didn't get into as many crashes, giving inexperienced Mini drivers a chance to learn their limits and become safe drivers.",0,1404490838,null,0,false,0,ciohamn,t3_29nac9,t1_ciohamn,t1_ciofhes,null,1434549667,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,ggow,null,null,"The current defence arrangements in the UK do not emphasise being a superpower. The second-most-recent defence paper emphasized the need to work in a coalition when engaging in a large-scale war and the ability to wage two small-scale wars simultaneously. That has now been reduced. That is not the military capability of a super-power, pretendy or otherwise. Suez is not entirely relevant to today, it was over half a century ago and our defence needs and posture are radically different. 

&gt;Countries like Sweden don't get involved in wars

Sweden relies on other countries to bale it out with its defence needs. Denmark, which spends only 0.2 percentage points more of its GDP on defence than Sweden, had to respond to a Russian incursion into Swedish air space because the Swedish one was on Easter Vacation. Denmark, a member of NATO, also happens to be one of the happiest and richest countries in the world. As is Norway, which is even more militaristic than either Sweden or Denmark. 

&gt;My problem with this new carrier is we don't need it at all.

We may not need it on our own but we're likely to be working in unison with other allies. They bring the tanks, the soldiers, and other things. We bring the large-scale equipment and capability, both in the form of air-craft carriers and intelligence equipment. 

It's a matter of perspective whether our military is bloated. A lot of people think that its been cut rather too far. The army hasn't been this small since the Crimean War, for example. The Royal Navy has one of the lowest numbers of surface ships in its entire history, though they're significantly more capable than ever.

true,sausagedownatrain,eng-devon,Devon,"1/ I'm sure you're a lovely chap in real life.



2/ The Royal Navy has a huge amount of tradition. It bonds everyone together and a part of that is pretending that we're still religious, not really taken seriously. The difference between that and Ayatollah blessing something is that we don't wage war in the name of religion. Blair's world view aside, we don't use religion as a motivation for war.



3/ Our fleet has a large role in demonstrating that we still have some power left. All those things demonstrate our capabilities and we have always used warships in those ways.



4/ The Royal Navy and RAF maintain and use helicopters as S&amp;R frequently, they use them all the time. HMs ships are always involved in S&amp;R at sea if they are nearby. It's not why we build the ships but they are still heavily used that way. You say ""not a focus of our government"" as if the government is meant to declare absolutely everything we do and act as if it's a major thing. Just because Cameron isn't on the bridge for a photoshoot responding to mayday calls, it doesn't mean it's not a concern. How many politicians do you see spouting that traffic lights are a focus of the government? We still use and maintain them because they're necessary.


5/ So you see no need to try and encourage stability within and/or control over resource laden areas? The fact that unstable oil supply/prices have a devastating effect on our economy is irrelevant? Similarly for strategically useful landmasses. Your idea is for none of us to work towards helping the country? Just because something helps us it doesn't mean it's a terrible action.

The vision died along with the departure of Cortese, further evidenced by the club's current board deciding to sell all of their star players for more cash. It seems like the only way for players of his caliber to move forward it to leave which is what Lallana and Shaw are doing.

I think if we can guarantee Lovren a place in our plans for years to come, ambition from everyone in the club and goals for the future, Lovren would stay. Not to mention we have his former manager with us who was one of the main reasons why he moved to Southampton.

Early preseason is almost entirely about fitness, so teams actually like tours in warm environments playing against teams that are in the middle of their seasons. 

And honestly, if we decided not to tour or stay closer to home, we probably wouldn't have any bigger competition to play against because any team worth its salt will be abroad as well. 

There are often so many big clubs touring in North America that they have tournaments for them to play each other. Madrid, Man City, LFC, Barca, etc etc. Asia is also really popular for similar reasons. 

Furthermore any tour is a great opportunity for the players to bond, away from distractions. ",0,1404493187,null,0,false,0,cioi9m7,t3_29tzwx,t1_cioi9m7,t1_ciohbc2,null,1434550307,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2
