true,thebattlersprince,newcr-4,Hibbo is my Homeboy,"It's like Martinez embodies two of the club's nicknames - the People's Club &amp; the School of Science - in the most natural way. When you think about it, those nicknames shouldn't be compatible with each other but Bobby
Brown Shoes makes those cold and calculating decisions with a personal accountability that gives that sense of ownership to fans, players and staff alike. 

My enjoyment of football over the last year has increased due to not only an admiration of his tactical style, but understanding why he's implementing it at the club. It's that openness to the public that sold me on Martinez before the wins poured through. He won the hearts and minds of all of us not because of his ambition, but by how he wants to make that ambition a reality. There's only so much Martinez can do as a manager, short of running onto the pitch himself, but he's given the club the carrot on the stick it needed to move to the next level. The blank canvas at the top of the stairs at Finch Farm shows the understanding of where we've come from and where we want to go. Changing attitudes to training, knowing everyone (players, staff, fans, media) on a personal and professional level. These are the characteristics of a man with a genuine heart for the game and the people involved in it.

Obviously not my favourite win, but the 2-1 against Arsenal in the same season is a cherished memory. Neil Mellor scored a last minute screamer of a half volley.

That mad 7-0 win over Birmingham. The 5-3 v Luton with Alonso's goal. Beating Juve 2-1. The Ghost Goal semi. Being the only english team in ages to go to Camp Nou and win and Arbeloa had Messi in his pocket (Still think that's why Real bought him)

That crazy week with Real, United and Villa all being put to the sword.

Oh yeah and the 5-1 V Germany felt pretty good.

And obviously the Uefa Cup win v Alavés and the League Cup win over United.

Any win over United really, the 4-1, the Ngog game, Dirks hattrick and this most recent one. 

The win v Everton when Stevie got sent off, putting Chelsea out the FA Cup with a Garcia stunner, there's so many that I'm just sort of rambling on now.

I'm sure that the Arsenal, Everton and United games from this season will be part of my answer in 5 years time too.

I would ask why posts like this make them feel alienated, the only possible explanation would be that they either share those views or that ideology and are uncomfortable having them scrutinised. The tendency is to try to balance it out and pretend that there is an equivalent sentiment in the Nationalist/Republican community which is simply not the case. **You** have blatantly spread misinformation to create a false sense of equivalency.

I think /u/Lit-up is right to call out Loyalism on its inherent Racism, Sectarianism and its links to the Far-Right, if people are uncomfortable with that, they need to take a very long hard look at themselves. I am a Republican and proudly so, i have and will call people out on sectarianism or racism of any kind (even if they masquerade behind a republican or nationalist guise). If people want to discuss, debate and query my ideology, i am more than happy to oblige.

The ring road there encircles the town centre like a garishly-studded collar on an especially ugly-looking rottweiler. To traverse it on foot, you have to either go through a really dank, smelly underpass that looks like an ideal place for a mugging, or take your chances at a crossing over several lanes of traffic, where the lights will almost certainly change very quickly just as you are half-way across. I always felt they put the tower blocks at the Leeds Road side of the ring road in a pair, to look as much as possible like a couple of upraised fingers, and I don't mean 'V for victory' either.

&gt;__Scrum__ is an iterative and incremental [agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for managing software projects and product or application development. It defines ""a flexible, [holistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism) product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal"". It challenges assumptions of the ""traditional, sequential approach"" to product development. Scrum enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members and daily face to face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Which president are you talking about? The head of the European Commission (core executive) or the president of the Council of the European Union (higher chamber of the legislature)?. 

The head of the Council of the European Union (Van Rompuy) has no need to be elected because he holds little power. It'd be liked saying Bercow should be elected to be like saying John Bercow should be elected. You could say he should be, but ultimately he's just the speaker of the House of Commons and I'd rather that people who deal with him on a daily basis make a decision about such a minute constitutional matter rather than the electorate. The electorate aren't anywhere near informed enough to decide who the speaker of the House of Commons should be, let alone the president of the Council of the European Union. The job doesn't command enough power or authority for people to be required to care. 

The European *Commission* (EC) on the other hand is a completely different question. He does deserve to be directly elected because his job is analogous to David Cameron's, but at a European level. But fortunately this isn't a problem because starting in may 2014, he will be elected in almost exactly the same way David Cameron or Angela Merkel is. We vote for MEPs in the European Parliament who then vote on who the president of the EC should be like we vote for MPs in Parliament who then say David Cameron should be PM. It's slightly different because Angela Merkel and David Cameron *remain* members of their parliaments so it's much more similar to the US model in that respect because there's a clear separation of powers.

This is the first European election we've had since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect so this is going to be the first election where the president of the EC is elected. [There's going to be a debate between the different representatives of the major European politician parties in Maastricht on the 28th of April](http://www.eudebate2014.eu/). All UK parties are members of European political parties. The Conservatives are members of the Conservative group (European People's Party IIRC?), the Greens and Labour in the Party of European Socialists, or PES, and the liberal democrats in the Liberal group ADLE (Alliance of Democrats and Liberals for Europe).

Actually precisely one year and having a non-elected chamber is extremely useful as it allows expert opinions to be integrated into the legislative process. No other national assembly has this feature and many Parliaments all over the world are envious of it. 

If you want to talk about our lack of democracy then talk about QUANGOS, our awful electoral system which allows a government with forty percent of the vote to form a ""majority"" government, the fact we can't recall MPs who break promises, the West Lothian question which means that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs can vote on issues which only effect England because certain issues of have entirely devolved to the Scottish, NIrish and Welsh assemblies. 

I agree with you fundamentally though. The UK has far more democratic problems than the EU does (even though the HoL isn't one of those problems imo). Personally I think the EU is a *benefit* to democracy because it is an alternative outlet where we can express opinions as opposed to the once-every-five years Westminster elections. They have E-petitions which work better than the UK's and a fully elected Parliament in addition to the UK parliament.

Maybe it was the Debrecen match but I remember reading about an incident where the opposing keeper was paid off to let us win and we were supposed to score two goals.  The only problem was that our finishing was so bad we couldn't get 2 believable shots off that the keeper could let go by without it being obvious.

And secondly, and most importantly, spreading corruption to new leagues is how illegal gambling syndicates make their money.  They ruined their own local leagues so badly that no one will bet against them because they know the fix is in so they spread out.

Here's a bolded quote you son of a bitch:

**""All seven players were banned from playing for life in a decision handed down on 27 December 1915. The FA concluded that it had been a conspiracy by the players alone – no official from either club was found guilty of wrongdoing, and neither club was fined or had points deducted.[10]""**",0,1396741210,null,0,1396741618,0,cgl1nns,t3_229nij,t1_cgl1nns,t1_cgl091t,null,1433226468,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,dev13,lfcflame,,"MANCHESTER CITY are ready to make a “huge investment” to lure Luis Suarez from Liverpool this summer. The Uruguay international is aware of the interest from City and other leading European clubs and will decide his future at the end of the season.
Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football, knows Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko could ask to leave the Abu Dhabi-owned club this summer and has identified Suarez as his priority for the role of main striker. He believes the release clause included in the contract the Uruguayan signed at Liverpool in December makes a transfer viable if the player chooses to move.
Suarez wanted to leave Anfield last summer and was upset by the refusal of Liverpool’s owners to honour a contractual agreement that he could join a Champions League club meeting a fixed transfer fee. Last month, John W Henry confirmed that Suarez at that point “had a buyout clause of £40m”, which Henry and others within Fenway Sports Group, the club’s owners, chose to ignore. Fenway’s intransigence over an initial bid from Arsenal provoked a dispute between Suarez and Brendan Rodgers in which the manager accused the prolific striker of “total disrespect of the club — a club that has given him everything” and instructed him to train alone. Friends say Suarez regards his outstanding play this season as “a personal revenge” on Rodgers. His tally of 29 goals in 27 matches has put him on course to better scoring records for 38-game and 42-game Premier League campaigns. Suarez’s decision on his future will be informed by both his ambiguous relationship with Liverpool — he is appreciative of the supporters and captain Steven Gerrard — and the wishes of his young family.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; As a sole trader, all profit is counted as income and you're taxed the same way someone is on PAYE.

This is incorrect.

Firstly, under PAYE tax and National Insurance are deducted at source before you get the cash.  This means every time you get paid, you pay tax.  Under self-assessment you make a payment on account at the end of July and January.  *(This will usually be 50% of the tax due in the previous year)*  You then make a balancing payment *(if necessary)* at the end of the January after the tax year.

This has two significant consequences.  It gives much more control over cash-flow, which is a huge deal for many companies.  It **also** means you can be blindsided by a liability to tax if you don't pay attention, since you don't pay as you go along.

Secondly, the National Insurance consequences of self-employment are fundamentally different.  An employee pays Class 1 NICs at 12% of all earnings over around £5,000 up to around the Higher Rate tax threshold. **Additionally** the employer pays employer's Class 1 NICs at 13.8%.  *(This is not reduced at the Higher Rate tax threshold.)*

A self-employed person pays Class 2 NICs at a fixed rate of a couple of pounds per week and Class 4 NICs at around 9%.

To illustrate how huge this difference is, a self-employed plumber earning £30,000 will pay 52 x £3 *(I don't remember the amount, but I'm sure it's less than this by some loose change.)* £156 in Class 2 NICs and 9% of £25,000 = £2,250.  If the same guy paid himself as an employee under PAYE he'd pay £25,000 x (12% + 13.8%) = £6,450.

*(Feel free to argue that Employer's Class 1 NICs aren't paid by the employee, they're an employee cost.  regardless, if you run your own business it's a cost of taking remuneration through your own business or company.)*

Thirdly, the things you can claim as a cost of business as either a company or as a self-employed person is way broader than it is for an employed person.  This means that the amount that is taxable profit will almost always be lower than the equivalent taxable amount would be as an employee.

&gt; As a limited company, the profits are the company's and not the ""owners"". The company pays corporation tax on them. Now the ""owner"", usually the sole director/shareholder, can get paid in one of two ways (NB - this is simplistic for the purposes of aiding understanding):

&gt; 1) Draw a wage. You then pay tax on your wage as any employee would. The wage is a tax deductible expense for the business so it doesn't pay tax on it thus avoiding double taxation but it would pay employers NI.

&gt; 2) You are a shareholder of the limited company and the money is paid as a dividend. This is taken from post tax profit and is not tax deductible. You pay tax on it but then are given tax relief roughly equivalent to the corporation tax to avoid double taxation. The advantage of taking money this way is the company doesn't pay employers NI.

Up to the Higher Rate tax limit you *(in effect)* pay no tax.  The dividend you receive is treated as being 90% of the actual dividend and the whole is taxable at 10%.  Net effect is that it's tax free *(for the individual)*.  Once you're over the Higher Rate limit you pay tax at 32.5% on the whole.  *(Dividend plus non-repayable tax credit of dividend x 1/9th.)*

**However** there's an important caveat in that you can only pay a dividend out of profits or retained capital.  If your company doesn't make a profit *(or have reserves to pay the dividend from)* you can't pay a dividend.  

What you **can** do under these circumstances is to take a salary or a bonus.  

On top of all this, a dividend is paid in accordance with the rights of the shareholders.  If you hold 100% of the shares this is simple.  But, if you gave 30% of the shares to other people *(assuming all shares hold the same rights)* you can declare a dividend, but 30% of it goes to someone else.  70% shareholding would give you control and you could therefore vote yourself a bonus which while liable to tax and NICs under PAYE, but all the cash would come to you.",0,1396753362,null,0,false,0,cgl6ahu,t3_228m6p,t1_cgl6ahu,t1_cgkxv4z,null,1433228651,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"Think of it as six-pointer in financial term. We get CL 3 of our ""main"" competitors drop out. So we get CL money and they lose it, if we are successful (and they don't reach EL final) it might be 60M swing in finance. Arsenals revenues are 100M more than LFC and ManU probably 150M, so 60M swing would decrease the difference to 40M below Arsenal and 90M below ManU.

Everton on the other hand are overachievers, their loan deals have hit off and they have excellent manager, when they return to the mean and get new players with added games from CL, they will probably not keep up in the long run (next couple of years) much like Spurs. They might get lucky and get a new owner who will run them well, but as long as Kenright is there, we don't have to worry about them long term.

ManU will take a large hit, but nothing they can't recover from with their wage budget increasing when the old guard leave. Arsenal have only broken even due to player sales, and ""we've payed the debt"" legion don't understand their long term debt of 250M+ can't be fully repaid until 2030. So no big sales for them, and they will have to use that 100M cash reserve and pay high wages to get players.

CL plus PL TV revenue will give us (ignoring other leagues renewed deals) 70M swing, which puts us safely at top 10 over Milan and Dortmund. Among the top 10 we can only compete with ManU and Arsenal, the former only due to lack of CL. We got upgraded from competing with Spurs for players, we shouldn't wish to be competing with Arsenal (around same wage budget, probably higher transfer budget). We can fish for mid tier CL only players without having to pay obscene wages or get competition from other English clubs in our ""level"" below City and Chelsea.

When players want to go to the PL and they aren't top tier, we will be the biggest club under them, and lets face it, Wenger has huge reputation.

&gt;While Liverpool have 13 or 14 players who could challenge for a place in any top-flight side, Rodgers does not have the squad to compete with the likes of City and Chelsea.

&gt;A message, then, to Fenway Sports Group they cannot rest on their laurels during the summer transfer window.

&gt;Champions League football, as is looking increasingly likely, will put a significant strain on the Liverpool squad and expose any shortcomings.

&gt;The cash must be splashed. Otherwise FSG will discover the hard way there is no substitute for strength in depth.

And this is why I'm not so hasty to get ""rid"" of players like Allen, Johnson, Enrique, etc. We're going to need them *and more* to be able to compete well across all competitions. We've also been very fortunate - touch wood - with injuries (the lackthereof) and the impressive rise of youngsters like Sterling and Flanagan.

Gambler's fallacy - to my understanding - works more for, say, roulette or a coin toss: Each toss is completely independent of the toss before it. So, because 5 heads come up doesn't mean that we'll see tails next because there was 5 heads before hand.

It's a bit different with sports because of the thousands of variables (i.e. beachball) and adjustments.

He came here *probably* expecting minimal involvement this season, 10-15 games, maybe a few starts, all towards increasing game time in subsequent seasons. However nine months later what has he got to show? He's had 5 starts 8 sub appearances totaling 374 minutes in the league. (I can't find anything for the cups)

Even if the promise of a game every few weeks is granted what if his form isn't great (from lack of regular game time), do we drop him or persist with him?

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"The error margin is different for football, that's why they claim it is accurate to millimetres (for football). In tennis, the ball is smaller and moves at much higher speeds, allowing for compression at the point of contact on the court. A football moves slower, compresses less, and doesn't always make contact with a hard surface for the decision to take place.

Even assuming there is a 3.6mm margin of error in football, [the circumference of the ball is 680-700mm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_%28ball%29#Association_football) Assuming all other variables are constant at the worst possible marker... I make that a margin of 0.5% at worst.

[The fastest recorded shot was clocked at 114mph](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/14/theknowledge.sport) (~51 metres per second), given Hawkeye's cameras use 1000fps, that shot would have travelled about 5.1mm per frame, meaning the upper known limit for error margin in football is 5.1mm. Convert that to proportion of the ball circumference and we have an error probability of 0.75% (assuming the ball is the smallest it can be [680mm] and struck at the upper known speed limit [114mph]) ... compare this to the error probability of referees in similar situations, [given as ~10% here.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/23629154)

I'm all for personal preference, but I don't see any logical reason to prefer a human eye to a consistently accurate, objective system like Hawkeye. At worst, it gets things wrong less than ten times in every thousand.

&gt;[Law 2 of the game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football\)) specifies that the ball is an air-filled [sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere) with a [circumference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference) of 68–70 cm (27–28 in), a [weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) of 410–450 g (14–16 oz), inflated to a [pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure) of 0.6 to 1.1 [atmospheres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_atmosphere) (60–111 kPa or 8.7–16.1 psi) ""at sea level"", and covered in leather or ""other suitable material"".  The weight specified for a ball is the dry weight, as older balls often became significantly heavier in the course of a match played in wet weather. The standard ball is a Size 5, although smaller sizes exist: Size 3 is standard for [team handball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_handball) and Size 4 in [futsal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal) and other small-field variants. Other sizes are used in underage games or as novelty items.

In that case the Doctor's partially part of her, but it would be kinda more distant relative kind. Bonded dna to a recipient thing. 2. The Silence directly collected a specimen of the Doctors blood and broke the only part they could and fashioned River to be a temporal weapon...ie. she lives long enough, with regenerations, to become the Doctors killer.

Micky:Wait, the Tardis, we can't just leave it. Doesn't it get noticed?   

Jack: Yeah, what's with the police box? Why does it look like that? 

Rose: It's a cloaking device. 

Doctor: It's called a chameleon circuit. The Tardis is meant to disguise itself wherever it lands, like if this was Ancient Rome, it'd be a statue on a plinth or something. But I landed in the 1960s, it disguised itself as a police box, and the circuit got stuck. 

Mickey: So it copied a real thing? There actually was police boxes? 

Doctor: Yeah, on street corners. Phone for help before they had radios and mobiles. If they arrested someone, they could shove them inside till help came, like a little prison cell. 

Jack: Why don't you just fix the circuit? 
Doctor: I like it, don't you?

Today tactically will feel more like the Sunderland game, except we'll be playing away. They will get compact the way Poyet's team did. Also, Carrol and Downing will be up for this game I'm sure, and Carrol on set-pieces is very worrying. 

I hope to see Sakho get on the field, and potentially revert back to a midfield diamond featuring Allen. Not sure about Lucas' role, I doubt he starts - can't see how or where he would.

But, like most things in politics, if you really want to get something voted in it isn't the 18 year old student or the guy in the transit van you need to convince. It's the people you don't see screaming and shouting... the old age pensioners, the home owners, the people in professions etc. Basically, the *'steady majority'*.

Those latter groups actually make up the bulk of the **voting** population and tend to vote less on passionate grounds and more in terms of risk:reward... and for that group independence is probably going to present a lot more risk than it does reward. Obviously if you're an 18 year old student - or a transit van man in a council home then independence probably stands less chance of risking your relatively limited prosperity. If on the other hand you're financially and morally invested in ""British Society"" (for example having a UK Pension or a professional job in a large multinational company) then that risk:reward tips a lot more in terms of risk.

Anyway - I'm not trying to say that Yes Campaigners are right or wrong. What I'm trying to say is, there is an effect in politics where it can seem like everyone is shouting for the same thing. But it's largely a quirk of who you hang around with (i.e. most students for example spend their time socializing with other students or young adults). So there can be an outward appearance of unanimity when in actual fact, if you canvas the whole population that really isn't the case.

I must confess that I am active in boning the workers. Very active. I am even currently reading a book called 'The Second Machine Age', with a view to expanding my investment portfolio and entrepreneurship into automation technologies. I don't want to be part of the majority who has very little, and there's only one way to make sure of that, and that's by owning the means of production. Pretty soon it will just be the means of production that matter, because there will be no working humans involved. There will be no administerial work, there will be no accounting, there will be no driving, there will be no manufacturing. House building could even be done via 3D printing. 

Ultimately I want this to benefit everyone. And I am quite sure in the medium to long term it will. I just don't want to get caught up in the social upheaval in the mean time. I want to be a driving force in removing scarcity, which will require capitalism, not socialism. I won't actively fight socialists when it isn't too early. Socialism too early could well slow down the speed towards automation.

I think a Guaranteed Minimum Income will be the way forward. And I think people will vote for that. And within time it will be expanded and expanded. Otherwise Capitalism could quite well grind to a halt. At the end of the day it is always going to be capitalism that is harnessed towards the welfare of everyone. It has already led to a time of plenty the world has never seen before, and what we as a whole have and consume expands day on day.

true,SuperSheep3000,,Murphy's Law,"LUFC Cellino surprised McDermott hasn't resigned


New Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino says he is surprised manager Brian McDermott hasn`t resigned.

Cellino, who won his appeal against the Football League to take over at the club on Saturday, as sacked Brian McDermott already once at Elland Road back in January.

The eccentric 57-year-old who has a history of sacking managers during his time with Italian side Cagliari sacked McDermott on the final day of the transfer window in January only for GFH Capital to reinstate him the following day.

Results have continued to decline in 2014, the 1-0 defeat at Wigan Athletic on Saturday was a seventh in eight games, and they have now won just three of their last twenty-one games.

Cellino speaking in the Sun Newspaper admits he is surprised that McDermott, who has been in charge at Elland Road one-year on Saturday, hasn`t left the club by now. ""I have to get to work and fast.

""I want to call Brian now I have the chance to talk to him properly and find out what has been going on.

""""The squad needs work, yes, but seven defeats in eight games - It is unbelievable.

""To be honest I have been asking myself, 'why doesn`t he resign?` because Brian is a proud man and results have not been good enough.""

Cellino is set to arrive in England on Monday as he sets about rebuilding Leeds United as he looks for a way to return the club to the Premier League for the first time following their relegation in 2004.

Leeds are next in action at Watford on Tuesday and it will be interesting to see if McDermott will still be with the club for the trip to Vicarage Road. ",0,1396788470,null,0,false,0,cgle1d0,t3_22c83a,t1_cgle1d0,t3_22c83a,null,1433232368,9,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,9

The next general election is going to be a strange one - two of the three main parties are in an unpopular government, and therefore stand to lose seats, but the main opposition party has been decidedly mediocre about seizing on this. We could see very little change, or we could see long-held safe seats flipping. Everyone is expecting the Libdems to take a beating, but I doubt their voters will swing en-masse to UKIP. The ideological gap is too wide. If anything I'm expecting UKIP to pick up non-voters, and that's why it's so hard to predict how it'll go. 

I do expect them to win some seats this time around (although you never know: the Libdems were very popular in the run up to 2010 yet they actually lost seats) if only one or two. If economic circumstances stay difficult, they'll be a very successful reactionary opposition party. If the economy recovers, less so. Anti-European sentiment will go down. UKIP suffer from being perceived as a single-issue party. As for ending up in power... British elections rarely result in hung parliaments, even even more rarely do hung parliaments result in coalitions. If they end up as junior coalition partners it'll hamper their ability to achieve their goals, while discrediting them with the messy realities of government.

But it was a Guard. Guards are armed and the choice they face in these situations is to intervene or watch.

He could watch as the confrontation continues, and pray that nothing bad happens, or that the police officer quickly gets it under control. However despite being prepared police officers sometimes still come off worse if attacked.

If he intervenes he must intervene as he did. It might be heavy handed, but it brings the situation under control, and without anyone coming to harm. In deed, that man would more likely have come to harm had the officer tired to arrest him forcefully.

The reason we don't want the police armed is because we don't want a large divide between the police and the public, and because armed police will inevitably escalate crime and situations to the point that more people are killed.

Neither of that applies to Guards. They're soldiers not civilians, and they don't deal with crime or hundreds of thousands of interactions with the public everyday.",0,1396789240,null,0,false,0,cgle783,t3_22bsbj,t1_cgle783,t1_cgldfop,null,1433232510,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

This is true for the general public. You don't go pointing a gun in the face of the woman that cut you off in traffic, or spilled her coffee on you. But this is a soldier defending a high security government facility. The firearm signifies both his intentions, and the severity with which they are met. 

&gt; If the situation had really got to the point where an automatic rifle was necessary, the police officer should have got the man on the ground and handcuffed.

That is exactly what they're trying to avoid. Placing someone under arrest is a difficult and often very dangerous process. It is a physical altercation, and can easily lead to an officer being injured, as well as the person being arrested. Because this was such a high security scenario, the soldier's weapon let the man know just what his actions may provoke. Seeing what may come of your decisions will often help convince people to change their course of action before there is any danger of a physical altercation or anyone is placed under arrest and charged with a crime. Were this a traffic stop, a gun would be highly inappropriate. But this was a high security guarded government facility.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Yes a soldier is able to order a member of public to stop doing something or get shot, if what that person is doing is potentially endangering life. That soldier was a number of steps from a posture where he would be shooting. There is something called escalation of force in lines with the rules of engagement. 

RoE for ceremonial duty is quite different to those in Afghan. I don't know quite what they are, though; have you a source?

&gt; If you try going onto a military base you will have a soldier holding a loaded rifle (not made ready, just like in this case) in a similar posture.

You'll normally have the mod plod on the gates, not infantry soldiers.

&gt; The soldier is in a ceremonial uniform (restrictive with regards to movement), holding a weapon system(with no sling, in a secure manner with good trigger discipline), in the manner in which he was trained. If the butt of the weapon was in the shoulder, safety off, weapon made ready, soldier in a firing stance and a number of additional escalation methods along the way it would have been more of a story.

The point isn't that he wasn't in a position to make effective use of the rifle, it's that he was in a position to threaten somebody.

&gt; Remember you are an observer through an external source and don't and cannot know all the details.

Quite; I think there's some people claiming this probably isn't allowed and other claiming that it is but shouldn't be. I don't think the discussed point here is precisely why the soldier did that, but how it's concerning that he did.

The justification that this avoids needing to arrest him is dubious. It increases the severity of the situation from a dispute to a dispute with a fully automatic weapon involved. The chances of someone dying go from next to zero, to much much higher.

When signing on you have to apply for and record 14 job applications and searches per fortnight if you do not you get your benefits cut if you are 5 minutes late you have them cut.

It is stressful trying to make sure that you are not late for your 9am apointment when the first bus you are able to catch arrives at 0855 2 minutes from your local job centre is stressful, trying to find a job that you can do with a limited skill set is stressful especially as you're quite sure that the one job on the .gov job sounds eerily similar to the one on totaljobs, maybe they won't notice it's likely to be the same job, you think to yourself sweaty palms you arrive, breathless, the bus wasn't late and you made it, they look at your work search and give you the all clear, now it's time to try and relax before starting again next week.

What I suggest you do is go inside your local job centre talk to 5 random people and ask them why they're on benefits seriously while there are a few who do it because they think it's easier but the vast majority are just poor.

He was convicted of a crime and sent to prison for a term. He was an immigrant, so the Home Office started deportation proceedings. But there was some issue that meant he couldn't be deported quickly. The Home Office wanted to keep him locked up, but the Court pointed out that they had no legal grounds to do so (his sentence was over, and they couldn't justify the indefinite imprisonment pending deportation).

So during a hearing, the Home Office agreed to release him (and gave an undertaking, which has the effect of a court order), but when the next hearing came along it turned out that they hadn't done so in time - due to some screw up in the Home Office. So the judge found the Home Office (which is legally Theresa May) in contempt.

The same as any job so why mention it?

&gt; When signing on you have to apply for and record 14 job applications and searches per fortnight

That's one per day. Hardly a great amount is it? It'll take you what, 10-20 minutes per application at the most? Even if it takes an hour per application its hardly a lot. Fourteen hours a fortnight is less than I used to work in a day many times in my last job. And you're saying it like its some kind of massive feat? You're going to have one hell of a shock when you finally get a job.

&gt; It is stressful trying to make sure that you are not late for your 9am apointment when the first bus you are able to catch arrives at 0855

Why is the first bus you're able to catch only arrive at 8.55? Are there not any earlier busses no matter what time they arrive?

How the fuck are you ever going to cope with having a job? That doesn't just require you to be on time once a week or once a fortnight but every single working day and in many jobs, well before 9am. In some cases it'll mean catching a bus that arrives half an hour or more before you are due to start work in order to be on time. That's just something you have to do.

&gt; What I suggest you do is go inside your local job centre talk to 5 random people and ask them why they're on benefits

Because they're unemployed I would expect. I don't know where you seem to have this opinion I'm against people who genuinely claim JSA.

&gt; But I imagine your idea of poor is £10985k a year. i.e £6.50@32.5 hrs paid pw or is it more than that?

Nothing wrong with being poor, lots of people are. However being poor is not being in poverty nor does it mean you're actually that badly off in the 21st Century first world. Living in poverty does and very few people in this country are truly living in poverty. What they are is relatively poor, i.e less well off relative to others in this country. But whilst they've a roof over their heads, clothes on their back, can afford at least one meal a day, usually have a TV, a computer, a mobile phone they are far from living in poverty in the truest definition of the word.",0,1396791483,null,0,1396792324,0,cgleq6h,t3_22azjn,t1_cgleq6h,t1_cglekaw,null,1433232759,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As is the job of the Police outside the Palace. The police officer was doing his job when someone wouldn't stop shouting at him, and since such confrontations can turn violent, the guard was doing his job by supporting the police.

&gt;It's bullshit to say ""but but, he could have been a threat."" 

If I was a couple of feet from you, angrily shouting at you, I doubt you'd say I wasn't a threat.

&gt;People who are actually a threat to the palace and the Queen generally aren't just going to be getting a bit aggy with a police officer in the vicinity of the palace.

Just because a threat isn't planned, doesn't mean it isn't a threat. And it doesn't need to be a threat to the Queen, to threaten the Palace. The people guarding the palace, are also entitled to be protected by eachother.

&gt;What would have happened if pointing the weapon at the bloke didn't instantly calm him down?

You keep the weapon pointed at him. The weapon isn't there to force compliance, it was pointed to keep the police officer and the guard safe.

&gt;What if he slapped the rifle or continued to be aggressive? 

Keep the rifle pointed at him. If he tried to get past the rifle, stick it in him. The rifle's there to prevent him attacking either of them.

&gt;Should he have shot him?

A bayonet would stop him.

&gt;The use of the rifle implies that if you continue to do that you're going to get shot, and that certainly is disproportionate. And it's a sure fire way to turn an argument/dispute into a death.

It really doesn't, the guard is using the rifle defensively. ""You're not getting past this.""

&gt;The final match of the [1988–89](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988%E2%80%9389_in_English_football) [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) [Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_League) season was contested on 26 May 1989, between [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Arsenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.), at Liverpool's [Anfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield) ground. By sheer coincidence, it was the match between the top two teams in the [First Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division) and the teams were close enough on points for the match to act as a decider for the First Division Championship. Arsenal needed to win the game by at least two goals to take the title, while Liverpool enjoyed home advantage and had won the [FA Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) the previous weekend.

There was an investigation by a parliamentary commissioner, who found that because she had made a mistake rather than set out to intentionally deceive, they would only ask her to pay back what she received in error. If they had found malice in her actions, she would probably have received some stronger sanctions.

A Parliamentary committee of MPs later reviewed this decision and reduced the £45,000 repayment to a £5000 one. 

However, the committee also said that she had been uncooperative, unhelpful hadn't submitted all of the evidence asked of her when they were investigating the issue.

Imo it's this latter point that's more damning of Maria Miller personally - it's understandable that people might make a mistake, but being uncooperative is bs.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"&gt; Chelsea plays a style which does not suit striker like him.

This again.

New rule, if you decide to go on about how Chelsea or Jose's ""system"" doesn't fit Lukaku you have to elaborate. And your explanation of why a player doesn't *fit* the system has to look like [this](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01927/art18-1_1927022a.pdf).

The ""system"" defence is stupid, it's a platitude at this point. Nobody elaborates after they say it, it's just ""the system"". 

Clearly Chelsea's system is to buy players that fit the system instead of phasing and molding young players into it. 

Lukaku is more than capable start 10+ games in the league for Chelsea next season. If the club brings in expensive striker x, that person will more than likely start against teams in Europe and teams like Liverpool and City among other decisive matches.

It's a long season, we need change on the front line.

I have been called Stupid because at 13 I was unable to wash up without being shown how just repeatedly shouted at that I was doing it wrong, I have had to try and decipher what possible combination of actions for a given task are correct just by being bellowed at. I have tried to learn MSDOS while being told that Dos was dead, this was in '99 had I continued powershell would be a breeze. I had to learn to live without friends not because I wasn't allowed them but because there was no time in my life for friends or homework

I know hardship, I grew up with very little cash, little food and no real way of focusing on schoolwork, I remember my maths GCSE exam i failed i resat it 2 years ago and without any extra lessons breezed through the mocks wiith an average 98% on the foundation paper in about 20minutes, I hate the way I was brought up yet I see clearly when abuse is happening and I see clearly when someone is out of touch with reality I have always been on the outside I see all of societies participants ding what they do, what humans have done for thousands of years just with a slight twist. I hate what has been created of me though but I have to live with it I have cleaned, I have cleaned with people who act constantly stressed out, I have worked in IT support and had people in the same job also complain about the high levels of stress, neither is anymore stressful than the other. 

  I have moved from my home town which i love dearly just to be away from some of the people there, I have worked and educated myself just to be knocked back down due to circumstances I had no control over. I am trained and have experience in IT but yet on Tuesday i start at a sodding warehouse.

Don't tell me I haven't seen the world, I have it is a beautiful place with spots of anger and stupidity, just the other day I witnessed a girl being shouted by her Mother because the girl wanted to know about 'electric cars in the olden days', her mum told her to shut up and 'why are you asking me? I don't know so shut and stop talking about it'.

true,hamsalamibacon,null,null,"Could you explain why I'm completely wrong? Just want to her your opinion on this. 

Okay as for why I feel Lukaku won't fit in the Chelsea system: 

Chelsea's midfield (attacking midfield to be exact) in my opinion is the focus of the team. Maybe the reason why Chelsea is so stacked in this area? 

I think this midfield has not been giving enough service to our Chelsea strikers. Not saying that they're selfish (can't really call Hazard selfish!) 

Ever since Drogba left this midfield has been paired with strikers who have not excelled as well as we would have thought. In my opinion this is not a coincidence. 

Maybe Torres is exempt from this argument as he has seemingly lost his stride due injury or loss of form, etc. But Demba Ba? Even Sturridge (who we now see his true worth). I kinda see now why Sturridge played so selfishly for us because he had to bag a goal or two with his limited playing time. 

Now as promising as Lukaku is I doubt he will thrive in a team which is not focused on him. Maybe Mou will shift the way Chelsea play to rectify this but in all honesty i feel that the difference between Chelsea now and before is 1) we are tighter at the back and 2) we have a marginally more solid midifeld with Matic at CDM. 

Finally I don't see Mou of all people trusting in young promising talent. He's under pressure to get results and its no surprise he's looking to buy one or two top strikers. With that situation in all honesty Lukaku won't get a sniff in at first team football. Yet another sturridge situation. 

Finally I would like to apologise for not explaining this earlier. So how about your opinion? I'm all ears. ",0,1396795895,null,0,false,0,cglfz7h,t3_22cc8t,t1_cglfz7h,t1_cglfq3v,null,1433233347,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Lukaku's positioning in the box is fantastic. He gets on the end of Evertons crosses in the air and on the ground. He can goal poach AND he can create shots for himself. He will also make our set pieces much more threatining considering our Centre backs are a huge part of those set pieces and Lukaku has the size and strength of a Centre back. His hold up play and passing are lacking but he's so young that we should send him on loan, preferably to Everton if they get UCL (pretty sure we can loan him to Everton again because we can loan a player to the same club for two years, pretty sure that applies to PL Clubs as well). And that whole bit about our midfield not getting service to our strikers is bullshit and overused. Eto'o (while not banging in goals left and right has been pretty good) gets the service and he buries his chances. As far as Lukaku not thriving due to Chelsea not focusing the team on him, all I can say to that is that we are CFC. We don't build the team around any one player because we have so many fantastic players. Even Barcelona isn't built entirely around Messi. Jose not trusting in young talent?

true,minminsaur,MM,myanmar,"Terry, Lampard, Eto'o is who we should give new contracts to. 

Terry has been a rock in our defence, and his partnership with Cahill has been solid all season. There was once a time where he was the best centre back in the world and nowadays he looks more and more like who he was. Obviously given his age and our buying of Kurt Zouma he won't be playing like this for the next 5 years, so I'd give him a 1 year extension, after which I'd love it if he stayed on as a club ambassador/coach (bearing in mind he is the President of Chelsea Ladies Football Club, this is highly likely).

Lampard has been a reliable option to Ramires, and he still has what it takes in him to play at this level. Come next season I think he can be a mentor to Marco van Ginkel, given the lad's injury I think Lampard teaching him the ropes can make Van Ginkel the powerful box to box midfielder we bought to replace Lampard in the first place, whilst remaining a reliable backup to Ramires and Van Ginkel. I'd give him a 2 year extension, after which I'd love it he remains as a coach like Terry, thought he can also move to MLS. He has what it takes to be a successful manager, and I'd love it if he starts his managerial career as a coach/assistant manager in Chelsea.

Eto'o... He's a good striker no doubt, and I think he'll make a fantastic 3rd choice behind Mandžukić/Costa/Cavani/whatever names we're tossing around and Lukaku. Obviously he won't be happy with it, and even now as the 1st choice striker there are reports of him wanting to return to Segunda División side Mallorca (admirable, but unlikely) or move to a MLS side. Would give him a 1 year extension, after which he can leave with the blessings of the supporters.",0,1396798212,null,0,false,0,cglgr6f,t3_22ci59,t1_cglgr6f,t3_22ci59,null,1433233714,18,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18

true,saladinzero,cnty-scotland,Norn Iron in Scotland,"Honestly, no idea. But the guy I work for was called to them off the back of a (baseless) complaint and he said it was the most stressful and emotionally harmful experience he's had. And he was found to have no case to answer. It's very galling that MPs can be found to actually have committed fraud but have their 'punishments' commuted by their peers. 

I mean, in comparison to the expenses debacle, NHS dentists have just been got with clawbacks of overpayment of fees - the NHS screwed up their computer system. We get paid a small amount per patient registered with us monthly. If a patient moves to another dentist or practice, we no longer get that money. Makes sense. However, if someone made an error *at the other practice* (like marking down the patient's sex wrong but all other details right), the computer system would duplicate that person and both dentists would get the money. We would have no idea something had gone wrong, seeing as the government made NHS registrations last a lifetime, rather than 4 years (so as to massage their '% people registered with a dentist' figures'. 

So what do they do? Accept they screwed up and cut their losses? Nope. They sent us all letters claiming back in some cases thousands (like £10k+ in some cases), which had to be paid off within the month. They went after retired dentists, dentists who had died, whatever. Money that had accrued over years, and sometimes in many different practices, all had to be paid back immediately. 

What about with this MP's expenses? She had a massive bill, which was cut way down. It pisses me off. I'm a professional person, not a fraudulent person, but I get treated worse than the person who deliberately ripped off the taxpayer. It's not right.

true,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,"&gt; Even without the silly rent in a lot of places, it's very hard to be accepted as a tenant.

This is true.  The place I'm in had been vacant for a truly whopping three months; I viewed it, liked it, popped into the letting agent later on the same day to fill out the paperwork.

This was a month before starting a £31k job and I had proof of my contract, salary etc.  The letting agent said ""You'll need to be accepted by the landlord because they might have a better offer"" blah blah blah - the rent was £600pcm and why somebody with a £50k salary should be seen as better seeing as we can both afford £600pcm effortlessly is beyond me.

I got accepted for the flat and had to pay about £1700 up front for fees, one month's advance rent, deposit etc.  Then there were other costs associated with getting some extra essentials like a TV, various cooking equipment, bedding and so on.

Thankfully I didn't need a guarantor, but the rules behind that are ridiculous too.  My mate got knocked back for a student flat a few years ago because his father didn't earn enough money (£15k IIRC), but what's really funny is that his father is a millionaire businessman with no regular salaried income and just earns whatever comes in when it comes in (he could go unpaid for 18 months, then earns £2m, 12 months later he gets £400k and so on).  So, despite being worth a shade over £5m and parking his E Class Mercedes outside the letting agent office, he's not allowed to be guarantor because he doesn't have a payslip proving he earns £15k a year; meanwhile, somebody *only* earning £16k salary with nowt left over is happily accepted.",0,1396799352,null,0,false,0,cglh64y,t3_22cdjc,t1_cglh64y,t1_cglghoo,null,1433233910,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

1-How is the UK? Good for tourist to visit? Are the people nice? 

A mix of people same as everywhere. Big cities aren't especially friendly.

2-How are the ladies in the UK? Are they more approable than the ones of Canada?

It's fine to approach people in pubs and clubs. I've never heard of someone in the Uk being asked for a date or a phone number by a random stranger.

3-Which area as a lot of historical castles to check out?

You can drive the whole country in a day or so. In the UK we think things are further apart than Americans who might drive an hour to go out for a meal or something. London is a popular tourist destination. You will want to consider seeing Ireland Scotland and Wales while you're here. There are medieval castles all over.

true,nabbit,irish,London,"In West London, we have ""Mrs Smith"", [Anne Naysmith](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/heartbreak-of-the-rag-lady-6350554.html). She used to live in a car outside Stamford Brook station (for over 30 years!). She was a concert violinist who fled her home after family/money problems, living in the car she drove away from them until the petrol ran out.

She ended up on one of the more affluent streets in West London, yet was tolerated (in large) by the residents around her. However, Hounslow Council eventually took matters into their own hands after a small number of complaints and removed the car. She had been offered housing over the years by the council, but her independent streak (which, in part, lead to her living situation) would not let her take charity from anyone.

She now lives in a makeshift hut nearby - the council has again come under fire for [removing the flower garden](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9512913/Former-concert-pianist-battles-to-keep-home-in-Tube-station-car-park.html) she built around her new home.

It's a really sad story, but amazing to see her still wandering up and down the high street, shouting at people who ride their bikes on the pavement.

The UK is good for tourism due to its interesting history. I would say visit London and somewhere else. London is infinitely different from the rest of the UK. I live in Edinburgh, which is a pretty small city (although it is a treasure trove of culture and history). I would definitely recommend visiting a city such as this to contrast London.

London obviously has a vast number of historical buildings which are worth visiting but other castles such as those listed below are worth a visit if possible:

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"yet another brain-dead republican.....

The monarchy costs the average taxpayer 65 PENCE per head per year.

Presidencies, even for countries a fraction of the size of the UK, pay more than that to maintain their presidencies.

Also, the Monarchy is a neutral party in politics, a kill switch on tyrannical government. A president would not be either of those things.

""and where the armed forces, judiciary, police and other public services are in the name of the British people, not the Crown""

What something is called has no bearing on what it does. Whether the word 'royal' is in the name has no bearing on the effectiveness or goal of the thing that bears that word.

""a society where a class hierarchy of birthright isn't blatantly promoted""

Where is it promoted? Sources and examples please.

""underpinned""

Again, sources and examples please.

""and symbolised by a constitutional monarchy""

A constitutional monarchy does not symbolise a class system. In fact, it symbolises the opposite, a nation in the hands of the people and the parliament.

The parts on eBay are anything between £30 and £90 depending on your laptop model. A repair person would probably charge £100 - £150 for the replacement.

Sturridge was really poor all game. Completely invisible for the most part and whenever he got the ball anywhere near the goal, it was pretty much shoot on sight, even if there were better options. 

What a captains performance from Stevie, never panicking, just calmly dragging the team forwards. Again, he avoided getting a yellow, which was an added bonus.

Defensively, we handled them pretty well. Sakho and Skrtel fronted up to Carroll and gave as good as they got. Very happy with the performance from those two, and I think they have to start the game against man city. Hopefully this is a partnership for the next 3 years/whenever Skrtel can't hack it anymore.

Finally, it doesn't matter how we win boys, that scrappy 2-1 is worth just as many points as the 4-0 demolition last weekend. We seem to be finding ways to win, and that gives me a lot of hope. GET IN THERE!

New builds now usually have fresh mains water pumped into all outlets (because the mains water pressure is high enough these days), cisterns, boilers and sinks.  This wasn't always the case and some people still have cold water storage tanks.

I guess it's just a 'design' or manufacturing process we Brits (and probably Europeans) haven't moved on from.  Many of our houses are pre 60's and will still have old baths and sinks with separate taps.

&gt;When it is considered necessary to open fire on a subject, using conventional ammunition, police officers need to shoot to stop an imminent threat to life. The imminence of any threat should be judged, in respect to the potential for loss of life, with due regard to legislation and consideration of necessity, reasonableness and proportionality. Research has indicated that only shots hitting the central nervous system (which is largely located in the central body mass) are likely to be effective in achieving rapid incapacitation. Shots which strike other parts of the body cannot be depended upon to achieve this.

Guns are there to stop imminent threat to life.  No warning shots (paragraph 2). Shoot centre of mass.

Lampard is less certain to be resigned. He still has things to contribute, but ever since Matic arrived he's been able to get onto the pitch less and less. I think probably worth keeping him around for one more year to provide another backup if we don't sign a new midfielder and to help tutor MVG more.

Cole should not be resigned. He's dropped off this year and can't beat Azpi for the spot. If we're going for a new LB then I would say we should part ways with Cole and move that position over to the new guard.

Eto'o has his moments, but personally I don't think it's worth the money to resign him. We could get the same amount of goals out of someone much cheaper.

He also fits in perfectly in our squad as he has great passing ability which is really important considering our flank players are all very technical players as well (Hazard, Mertens, Mirallas). He also has what Lukaku has - raw strenght to manhandle any defense. 

Another important note is too how well Benteke can play in small spaces, just give Benteke half a second and he will have turned around and attempted to score such as seen in this gif; http://balls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VIL1-1NOR.gif

Lukaku is more about having space and outrunning his opponents, he scored two very important goals in our match against Croatia and both of them were identical, he was sent deep into space and he took care off the remaning defender(s) and goalie by running them off and overpowering them with his strength. He isn't bad by any means and he is improving at a great rate but still Benteke would have fit us more then  him.

""The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says Mr Barlow initially challenged the decision to stop his benefits but the appeal was withdrawn because, according to Mrs Westland, he felt too ill to fight the case."" 

The DWP tend to lean on the side of always screwing the claimant over rather than being lenient, this is why so many appeals are currently successful, i.e the original decision made by the assessors gets overturned because it was wrong. The trouble is those who are vulnerable are not very able to go through the long, drawn out process of appealing. Especially since they get no money for months.

Someone who needs a heart transplant just isn't going to be able to go on JSA. How do you apply for 10 jobs a week if you're in and out of hospital constantly? What happens if they miss their appointment? Sanction. 

Stories like this highlight a complete failure of the DWP to manage a benefit that the most vulnerable people in society are on. They gave ATOS ridiculous targets to meet in terms of declaring X number of people fit for work. They are quick to stop peoples benefit even if they know that the decision is unlawful and will get overturned. It's just a braindead way of running a welfare system.

&gt;

&gt;In [association football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), the position of __wing half__ was given to midfielders who played near the side of the pitch. It became obsolete as [full-backs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)#Full_back) have tended to become more a part of the defence.

Great, more pointless scare tactics. People who defraud the state don't tend to listen to posters or warnings.

Also that is not the gaurds job. His job is to prevent all possible threat. Not to eveluate the level of threat and judge if it is allowed.

The child is a potential threat. He was warned. He failed to respond to the warned. More to the point he responded then did it again. 

The warning was increased to the next level. 

So to answer your own question. Replace it with an adult why should an adult be stopped from climbing the fence and not a child. If the risk is no different as you indicate an adult can be stoped once he has gotten over as well.

Again that is not the guards job. His job is to stop everyone climbing. And children should not be there without adult supervision. When the child was stopped the first time. The mother should have prevented him from doing it again.

true,ForestedLands,null,null,"4th year Civil &amp; Environmental student, checking in.  Well, procrastinating, as I should be writing this thesis...

I was allowed two semesters of an outside course in first year.  After that, you are not allowed a choice until fourth year.  You can always audit courses, but the curricula become pretty demanding starting second year.  I was able to audit an Environmental Science class second semester of second year, and it had a major effect on my projected career path - so, it is possible, and if you have the drive, go for it!

Third year I'm not entirely sure about, as I spent it studying abroad in California.  It is possible to study abroad in engineering, and allows you a lot more flexibility in terms of course selection (as long as you meet a few requirements).  Otherwise, not much choice third year.

Fourth year has allowed a pretty good deal of choice, although most choices are restricted to the college of engineering.  Last semester I chose an outside course, though (MSc course in Environmental Sciences).  It must be somewhat relevant and an upper level course, but there's still choice.

If you're on the MEng track, then the last two years have pretty good choice I believe, although I cannot say for sure (BEng here).

I'm not entirely sure what a foundation year is, but if it's more basic than first year of Engineering, then you likely won't need it.  Honestly, most of my classmates have agreed on first year being a faff.  If you can handle basic calculus, then go straight for first year.  I'm not sure what higher IB maths entail, so sorry if I'm coming across as a jerk - maybe you don't have any calculus yet.  I think that some people in first year didn't, though, and still made it okay.

University halls for sure like fergus said for first year.  I stayed in Sciennes, it was ace.  Go for self-catered IMO...it gets you used to cooking, saves you money, and it will be easier to host parties as there are fewer RA's about (at least in Sciennes...that place was chill my first year, may be different now, though).

Word of advice...commute to King's Buildings.  If you go to Edinburgh and stay on, then always search for flats around Central, Bruntsfield, or Marchmont.  Commuting to KB is not too bad, and your social life is so much better if you stay closer to Central.  I walk, others bike.  Both are good.  30 minutes to walk.  The shuttle bus is also pretty good, I ride it occasionally.

People are cool here, especially KB people amirite?  Definitely join a club or two, they help you find mates.  Would suggest trying a few, then sticking to one or two that you like the most and really focusing on getting good at their activities.

true,beldaran123,null,null,"I live in Hertfordshire so property prices are fairly high. Luckily for me, my husband's job includes the rent of a flat. However, I don't think I can be the only person who dreams of a nice little three bedroom house with a garden for when we have kids. And surely it's better to buy that now, while I can still be in full time work, than wait until those kids come along and I become the primary care giver?

However, it's not just the property prices that prevent us from buying, it's the interest added on each month and the buildings insurance, contents insurance, life insurance, long term illness insurance, and all the rest that people should have to insure if the worst happens they won't lose their homes.

We have a deposit saved that the estate agents love, but the monthly repayments are just too much for us. We aren't the lowest earners I know by a long way, but unless one of us magically lands a job with twice as much salary, we're stuck renting. 

Perhaps I'm selfish, but I can't help but be jealous of those people who make their livings owning five or six or more houses and renting them out, rather than leaving the market open to those who want the peace of mind that they can never be asked to move out, can decorate exactly to their tastes, and can know that their children will always know a family home.

Sorry for the rant, is just find it frustrating.

There's some major gaps in the questions. You list Assassins Creed (Reasonably accurate? But not really..), Total War (They do their damn research), Civilization (You literally change history. A lot of the backstory to items and shit is well researched but it's not all that good for it) and Age of Empires (Really no), but you missed loads.

Thing is, what do you want to gleam in this report? What's the focus? The vast majority of gamers won't play games for historical accuracy, but if that's what you're trying to find out, fair enough, but finding it out using the internet as a survey tool is a bad idea. Using mediums like Reddit will skew the fuck out of your results, as the average Reddit user is 16-24 and comes from a generation where video gaming is normality. 

You've picked some rather cliche examples, where there are far wider examples out there.

 [**Glasgow effect**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow%20effect): [](#sfw)

&gt;The __Glasgow effect__ refers to the unexplained poor health and low [life expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) of Glaswegians compared to the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe. The hypothesis among [epidemiologists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) is that poverty alone does not appear to account for the [disparity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_disparity).  Equally deprived former industrial cities of the UK such as [Birmingham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) and [Manchester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) that have faced similar effects of de-industrialisation have higher life expectancies, and the wealthiest ten percent of the [Glasgow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow) population have a lower life expectancy than the same group in other cities.

Religion is actually a public mental health problem, and I'm sure will be seen that way in future. Just as a century ago we had widespread TB and polio, today we have widespread mental health problems where irrational beliefs run unchecked.

The government has a public health duty to help religious people get better. Sure, just as we couldn't kill off TB carriers, we can't outright kill or persecute the religious, but we should be able to take reasonable steps to stop the spread of religion. Inoculation through compulsory education, banning religious schools, circumcision, kosher/halal slaughter, and maybe banning churches and mosques. We're talking about the kind of proportionate steps a public health campaign should take against an epidemic.

true,GeneralThrob,null,null,"Fellow tea-drinking Yankee here! I'm definitely going to recommend the Yorkshire Gold! It's my favorite tea! Also makes the best iced tea I've ever had, by a wide margin. 

But Taylor's of Harrogate (the company that makes YG) is pretty damn good, all around. I like Yorkie-Gold because it's an excellent, generic black tea that I can drink five times a day without getting sick of it. I like their English/Irish/Scottish Breakfast, and their Earl Grey is an absolute MONSTER, but I like them better as a once in a while sort of thing. I get a little tired of it, after drinking it for a day or two, and I crave something a little more ""plain.""

But basically, I've never gone wrong with Taylor's of Harrogate, and it's well worth the extra cost, if you ask me. 

Also, be sure to let their teas steep for a good five minutes, or else you won't get the full flavor. And don't let it sit past the 6-7 minute mark, or else you'll be deeply sorry, flavor-wise. Also, while the tea-bags are excellent, they're not as good as the loose stuff. I recommend using tea sleeves/filters, as they grind the tea pretty finely, and I don't particularly like the grit that typically makes it through tea strainers and other metal/ceramic brewing mechanisms.

Presenting reasonable arguments is *not* a poor strategy.  It's the foundation of democratic free-speech societies.  Just look at gay-marriage.  We have gay-marriage today because, ultimately, the better arguments won out.

true,cathlicjoo,null,null,"I'm a bit conflicted over this game.  So glad we walked away with the win, obviously the big talking point is Carroll knocking Migs in the head but I don't want to see that be the big issue.  It felt like the first fifteen or so we were doing really well playing on the counter, and for the last fifteen we looked like we usually do and were making some chances, but in between there we just looked awful on the attack.

Luis' two chances were great shots by him, but let's be real, they were highly improvised shots.  I thought Danny looked poor today, I less concerned about the quality of his shots and more concerned about how he looked mentally on the pitch.  I don't want to see him being so frustrated just ~50"" into a match that we're level in.  He had the look of somebody that was just giving up.

That being said, I feel like Sterling made up for the lack of production from Danny, and I'm still impressed at how much effort he has put into tracking back and helping on defense.  He was providing creativity in a game where it felt we had very little.

Johnson looked solid at back again, very good performance, more importantly I think this is where Sterling came in handy a lot.  With his back tracking I think it allowed Glen to play relatively freely.  Flanno looked very good, still made a few mistakes but his effort helps him recover.  The thing that interests me about how he's getting beaten is that it isn't often just purely of the attacker's skill but more of him over committing to the ball and getting ran right past.  This is most definitely where he needs to improve.  On attack I'm glad to see he got to hold up the play and try to put a few balls into the box, it shows me that they trust him with the ball.

Skrtel was great today, we needed him to be physical against Andy and that's exactly what we got.  I was nervous about Sakho starting but he looked like he held his own very well, his passing movements are a bit strange but overall I thought he did well.

Bringing on Lucas did wonders for us, I don't think Coutinho played poorly but this was a great time for us to solidify our defenses and bring him on instead.  I was actually pretty intrigued that Lucas was more attacking than he usually is played, and he didn't do half bad either.  

Hendo put in a great effort, I think he's improving with his distribution too.  It seemed like most of the movements we had going forward once Coutinho was brought off were directed by Henderson in tandem with Sterling.  I thought they did just fine with it, but I'm more fond of seeing Suarez direct the offensive creativity.  It felt like over and over again we just needed a bit of a spark in the build up (other than the last fifteen or so) and I feel we really needed Suarez to provide that rather than mostly sitting up top.

Stevie once again had a solid performance, good on the buildup, great on the back foot, provided extra coverage where we needed it, and I'm reminded every single game he plays at how spoiled we are to have somebody that can pick passes with such amazing accuracy over and over again without fail.

Rodgers made the right decisions today and showed he isn't afraid to try something different again.  I wasn't sure if we'd see Lucas come on, I thought we might've seen Allen come in and just dominate the midfield with Hendo like they did in the United game, but maybe that's for another day.  Great substitutions at the right time, even though Kolo's back header just about made my heart stop just from the pure paranoia of us throwing the game.  Other than getting the three points, we finally made it to the City game with Gerrard not picking up a yellow.  I know he's a veteran and can handle himself, but it was still nerve racking for me the past few weeks!  So glad that we've got City at home next week!

He'd get a lot further than half a metre if the guard wasn't watching/aiming at him, possibly close enough to harm the guard. Shooting isn't a matter of point and click, it's easy to miss if the target is small and moving quickly.

Others in this thread have postulated the concern that a kid could be acting as a distraction for others to take advantage of. 

Finally, as mentioned much earlier, pointing the rifle is also a message to the mother to do something about her kid now, as she should have done 10 minutes ago instead of assuming the world revolves around them.

That's a pretty shaky foundation then, since vast amounts of psychological research shows reasoned arguments are very unpersuasive compared to repetition, branding, social cues and rhetorical tricks (hence the trillion-dollar advertising industry).

&gt; Just look at gay-marriage. We have gay-marriage today because, ultimately, the better arguments won out. 

This actually proves my point nicely. Gay marriage advocates spent decades making reasoned arguments about equal rights, which nobody listened to. What swung the case in US society at large was 

* having more people coming out and being visible, making an emotional connection that had nothing to do with a ""reasonable argument""
* the very *undemocratic* influence of wealthy, politically liberal individuals with political power (such as happened in New York and many US legislatures)

Basically what I'm saying is that almost all people are stupid animals. They do whatever everyone else does and have no thoughts of their own. Democracy is completely pointless, since it's just a proxy for the rule of a stupid mob.

Second, as was seen when the guard shouted at the kid, he knew what he was doing and could probably tell that he wasn't going to get over the fence. Even if he was appearing to get over the gate, the child would have to drop quite a distance and if the guard was paying attention he'd be able to grab him fairly easily.

I didn't say anything like that. The point I made was that the mother should realise that the guard pointing a rifle at the child meant it was serious time, time for her to get off her arse and sort the kid out. As far as I can see the timeframe is:

1/ Stomp about. 

2/ Shout at kid to get off fence. 

3/ Shout at kid again, point rifle. 

4/ we've no idea, I would put money on it not being open fire on the child, or anyone for that matter unless the guard can see weapons out there, I would suspect something like warning shots. I would also imagine that a very serious police intervention is on it's way. I don't see how you can say the mother could be unaware, considering the guard had previously shouted at the kid. It's not as though they spend all their time shouting, they are pretty much renowned for not making a lot of noise that way.

true,uk_finance,null,null,"Things to watch out for:

There is a big difference between ASU (accident sickness and unemployment) policies and Income Protection Insurance (IPI) policies, so make sure you know which one you are applying for.

ASU - think more like home insurance - short term contracts (typically annually renewable, like home insurance), premium fixed for one year but reviewable at each renewal, can be cancelled by the insurer, will have a maximum payout of 12-24 months.
IPI - think more like life insurance - long term policies (eg up to age 65), premium can be fixed at outset (it can only change if you have selected index-linked cover), can't be cancelled by the insurer (unless you stop paying the premium, of course), maximum payout normally up to the end of the policy, eg 65.

Both can cover you for illness and unemployment. Both will let you select a deferment period (this is the number of months you can go without the policy paying out - the longer you go, the lower the premium), both will let you select the type of cover (own occupation - higher premium because it is more likely to pay out, or any occupation - lower premium because it will only pay out if you are too sick to do *any* job). 

In my experience, both are good but for different reasons. Generally ASU is cheaper so I recommend it for clients on a budget. Usually IPI is the more suitable policy of the two. I have seen payouts under both without any problem. Please don't mix PPI up with IPI or ASU - PPI was a misselling scandal (it was sold to people who didn't need it). If you are in a job and don't have a lot of savings to fall back on then IPI or ASU is likely to be worth the money, as you are likely to need it.

&gt;The best players can cope with pressure, no matter how young they are

This is a false statement. Even in American sports, teams usually try and protect the younger players, especially in the NHL because its easy for young players to get carried away and/or have their confidence crumbled by the enormous pressure. You need only look at Arsenal, or even Josh McEachran, who has so much talent and potential yet he has yet to mentally adapt to the pressure. There are players who can instantly cope with any sort of pressure and those players come around very few times in a generation, such as Messi or Ronaldo.

Playing for Everton is nothing like playing for Chelsea. Once you start playing for Chelsea, questions are asked of you every single week and if you can't answer them in your performances the pressure grows ten fold. The period this season when Lukaku was out of form (went something like 7-8 games without scoring) nobody really cared. At Chelsea the media would bring it up every day and would really start questioning the his ability if he went 8 games without scoring. 

To be perfectly honest, if we sold Lukaku for £35m I would have no qualms about it.

[I threw together a workbook to do it quickly](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/89641339/2014_Prem_ResultOdds.zip) (large zip file in dropbox). It covers the league so I didn't do anything with the ""key points"" related to how many points we'd be ahead/behind but all the data is in there somewhere. The file is huge because I did it quickly with brute force instead of figuring out all the distribution formulas it would otherwise take.

To use this, you just paste the league table from espnfc.com into one sheet and the OddsChecker odds into a second sheet and it figures everything out and formats it for Reddit. It takes about 15 seconds to calculate on my iMac; it does the probability of every game combination (3^10 = 59,049 for a full weekend) as long as each team has either one or zero games listed in the odds.

Feel free to use this if you want. I don't plan on making posts; I just did this because I'm strange.

Here's an example of what it would produce if Spurs and Sunderland draw tomorrow (I mocked up the table for that) and the odds for just the eight league matches next Saturday and Sunday are pasted in.

*One note: I got slightly different odds than you for this week. The odds may have changed by the time I pulled them or we're adjusting out overround in different ways*

As are the deaths from capitalism - it's just we don't acknowledge nor talk about them.

The Black Book of Capitalism estimates it at over a billion since its inception, which may be deliberately provocative, but isn't orders of magnitude out - the post war capitalist regime of India killed more from hunger every eight years until the '90s than the entire Great Famine under Mao in China.

Think about it: before the advent (haha) of calendars and the like, how did people mark the passage of time? Through motion of the sun, moon and stars. In the northern hemisphere, the sun is lowest in the sky on the 21st and 22nd of December - the winter solstice. So, our agrarian stone age ancestors who have been living off whatever they managed to reap in their previous harvest have much to celebrate once they reach the solstice - it's the first sign that winter is drawing to a close, and that rebirth is on its way.

Christmas is just one incarnation of that winter festival which has successfully shifted the focus of the celebration from the rebirth of the sun to the birth of Jesus. ",0,1396828588,null,0,false,0,cgltev3,t3_22d3fk,t1_cgltev3,t1_cglrwlx,null,1433239811,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I had to rent straight after university as I had no family home to go back to. Granted I had a a couple of thousand for my deposit because I worked 3 days a week during university, but I live and work in London (zone 2), earn £12k a year and pay £700 a month on rent for a double room (which is a lot compared to most of my friends here). I don't spend money on anything but getting to work and food/household stuff. Every few weeks I might meet a friend for a pint or two. When I get home and on the weekends, I spend my time learning things that should help me get a better job soon. Over the past few years I've taught myself PHP/Python/HTML/CSS/JS and some C# for app development, I'm also learning a second (spoken) language, all online and for free. If I need a break from the computer one day a week I'll walk to a park/into central London and go to a free gallery like the V&amp;A and read a book. My life isn't 'comfortable', I can't afford to go shopping/eat out or go on holidays but I manage okay.

Anyone can afford to rent on a full time minimum wage job (more than I earn).

true,monkeysandpirates,null,null,"&gt;Happy for them to succeed as long as they're always below us and losing the derbies.

^ This :)

Although I also enjoyed it whenever Moyes had them battling relegation!

There are a few reasons i'd like them to get 4th this year. 

1.  I've always kinda liked Arsenal and Wenger for maintaining a top 4 position without spending money.  But then this year when he did get money he tried to take Suarez. So fck him and fck Arsenal too, I'm happy to see them lose their Champions League slot to Everton. 

2. David Moyes. As well as watching him fail with United, it's great to see that maybe, after all those years, it was him holding Everton back afterall :p

3. If Arsenal and United aren't going to claim that 4th spot, I don't want Spurs getting it either.   I want them to be a lesson in what happens when you cash in on your best player thinking you can buy better.  If FSG ever look at offers of crazy money for our star players, I want them to look at Spurs and see what could be. 

So yeah.  I want Everton to claim 4th spot, partly because I don't want anyone else to have it, and partly because I do have a soft spot for our non-threatening local rivals :)

'My mum was a Christian so I was born a Christian' is common one, as though religion is an ethnicity, rather than a chosen ideology.

Most Brits don't really give religion a second thought, or they just go through the motions when it comes to Christenings or Weddings.

What disturbs me most is how oblivious people can be about the gravity of their statement 'I am Christian'. It implies a belief system which, if sincerely held, would have a huge impact on their life choices and yet, I'm surrounded by non-Christian behavior every day. It's like they've never considered how powerful the meaning of 'religion' actually is.

I may be giving an impression of having no respect for Christianity; but actually I think it's a great shame that the many excellent moral lessons taught by churches around the world come packaged with unpalatable supernatural nonsense.

True Christians are well meaning and loving people, if nothing else, you have to have respect that. But, most of the self-titled 'Christians' in this country are either ignorant of what they are really claiming, or downright hypocritical.

In any real sense of belief, the UK is not a Christian country.

From Wikipedia:
&gt; On 17 April, during Liverpool's 1–1 draw against Arsenal at Emirates Staidum, Lucas played a pivotal role in ousting out Cesc Fàbregas in midfield, whilst showing a deft touch in the dying moments to earn his side a freekick in the last minute. His quick reaction time to then reach the loose ball from the resulting free kick, under which he was then tackled in the penalty area, earned his side a penalty, which Dirk Kuyt converted. Following the game, Kenny Dalglish praised ""...he may be the one who stops the guy (opponent) going past the first fella then sets us on our way (creates attacks)"", drawing growing comparisons to Xavi and 1994 World Cup winner and captain, Dunga. On 24 May, Lucas was voted the Standard Chartered Fans player of the year for the 2010–11 season, winning 40% of the 129,774 votes cast. He also made the most tackles in the top 4 European leagues in the 2010–2011 season.
