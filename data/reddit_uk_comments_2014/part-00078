(Shetland and Orkney were the two constituencies that had the lowest vote for devolution in 1999 and I think it was a similar story in 1979), without subscribing to any kind of Unionist ideology that an old firm football supporter or Northern Irish person would recognise - it likely hails from that historical, mild disdain for Scottishness rather than all that Reformation/Revolution/Jacobite Rebellion nonsense that informs the rest of Britain and Ireland. Shetlanders tend to be pragmatic and are pretty apathetic when it comes to abstract notions of nationality or ideology - pro-union without being union*ist*, if you like.

Shetland does have some links with other nations in the North Sea (more with Norway than the Faroes), just due to the geographical position, and obviously there's the odd little cultural hangover from pre-Scottish times.

**Chelsea**: Assuming you can bank 10-12 points for their four home games, and assuming they can easily handle CP and Cardiff away, it's really just the trip to Anfield and the trip to Swansea that they'll drop points. Let's call it 4-6 points dropped, putting them at 82-86 points [84 is in line with their current pts/gm]

**City**: City have several tough away games (Man U, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton). I can see them dropping anywhere from 4 to 8 points. They have tough home games against Southampton and Villa, but I think realistically, they'll drop 2 points, max. That puts City at 83 to 87 points [84 is in line with their current pts/gm]

**Arsenal**: Tough home games and tough away games. I can see them dropping 6-11 points total (Chelsea, City, Everton, Hull are all tough matches... they probably won't lose all 4, but I can see them losing 3 or drawing 3). That puts them at 78-83.

**Liverpool**: We've got the tough away matches out of the way. I see danger in the City, Chelsea, and West Ham matches. To get 87 points, we can afford just 1 draw in the last 9 matches. To get 83, we can afford 3 draws or 2 losses. Realistically, I think we'll need to (A) beat Chelsea and City to get them to the low end of their ranges, and (B) limit ourselves to 1 (max 2) slip-ups.

I can't believe you'd rather we stick with supporters on both ends getting screwed by viagogo/the club instead of promoting a solution.  Luckily you seem to be in the far minority.

The [Chelsea Supporter's Trust sums it up aptly](http://chelseasupporterstrust.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/statement-on-closure-of-cfctickets-and.html):
&gt;In recent years the club has entered into a commercial relationship with Viagogo (self-described as ""the world's largest ticket marketplace"") who have been the subject of unflattering publicity in the media and who charge both buyer and seller of Chelsea tickets a commission on transactions. Although this is a means for season ticket holders to sell their seats for games they cannot attend, many are clearly uncomfortable about the mark-up involved and last summer's CST Members' Survey highlighted the concern many supporters clearly feel about this relationship. Viagogo was also listing tickets for last season's Europa League final at highly inflated prices, an issue picked up by the national media.

&gt;A relatively new, alternative method for supporters to buy and sell tickets has been through organisations like CFC Tickets who offer a no-fee marketplace for supporters to offload unwanted tickets to other supporters, at face value. It is to be regretted that the club has seen fit to clamp down on this activity in the same week as e-mailing season ticket holders extolling the virtues of selling unwanted Arsenal home tickets through Viagogo.

&gt;It is also clear that CFC Tickets were experiencing problems with users attempting to defraud other users, but this certainly does not mean that the face value ticket exchange concept, in principle, is not a worthy one. Arsenal operate their own club-backed ticket exchange for unwanted season tickets, offering tickets at face value with a low handling fee, and this service is clearly best practice among Premier League clubs at this time.

&gt;The CST board firmly believes that Chelsea should operate a similar system, drawing on features of the service offered at Arsenal and also the experiences of CFC Tickets. A club operated system would also remove concerns about potential fraudulent activity.",0,1395187480,null,0,false,0,cg62cok,t3_20qgl6,t1_cg62cok,t1_cg61yu8,null,1432967467,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

However, while one reply mentioned Fraser and Gillick competence, I'm not sure whether they are the most relevant issue (disregarding the fact that Gillick was a case about a child's medical rights). It sounds- and correct me if I'm wrong- like they were trying to extract some kind of confession from you. Under the circumstances, you could argue that this confession( if they got it) was unfairly obtained so they could not act upon it. The case names escape me (though I'll find them if you're interested.NOTE: they're Scottish but English law is often similar, and if not, the cases are persuasive) but there are cases where intimidation and drawn out interrogations have made the confessions unlawful. It is the polices' job to find information, not extract confessions. These must be freely given, without duress. The threats to your education could qualify as such duress, so I'd be unhappy about that, as you seem to be. 

All of this ishould be nullified by the fact that you haven't done anything wrong. You are allowed to criticise people. Newspapers do it all the time!

Maybe it's because i look after myself &amp; don't require constant maintenance from the doctors of this country to look after me.
I'm also not a hypochondriac, so i rarely find myself at my local GP.
The NHS is also not out to make a profit. It is legally obliged to serve the people of this country (I think), not to make money. Thats the key.

No one could've predicted what has happened to him, but it's not out of the question that he could suddenly hit a rich vein of form, or have a blinder second season.

Capoue can be brilliant... he was one of our best players at the start of the season before his injury.  He's also got a clear role within the side - playing as an old school CDM capable of breaking up play and intercepting passes.

Chadli I'm less sold on... I would not be hugely fussed if he went.  I reckon a loan deal could be good for him, but I think he does have something to offer the team as a squad player.

Paulinho's different because I can't really see how he fits into the side tactically.  We do gravely need a midfielder capable of bursting forward into dangerous zones and adding a goal threat, but Paulinho doesn't seem to have the tactical discipline nor the intensity for such a role.  His shooting is largely awful, and he doesn't track his man well in defensive phases.

The players you've mentioned have not set the world on fire, but I can see them as being useful going forward.

The real shame is that the government are privatising bits of it so companies can make money, which goes against the whole ethos of why its there. But ""austerity"".

My main experience is as a gout sufferer. I have to take a tablet every day for the rest of my life. This costs me £8 every two months if I have a job, free if I'm unemployed. I've spoken with American gout sufferers who pay $300 a month for the exact same drug (allopurinol). My numbers are probably off as this was a while ago,but you get the point I hope?.

I barely even think about my condition and consider myself healthy, but if I lived in america, I wouldn't be able to afford my medication (unemployed at the moment) so I would be bed ridden, in severe pain, and unable to find regular work as a result (as attacks of gout can strike whenever they want).

Basically, you'll hear us complain about bits of the NHS ( I recently changed doctors because the old one never had any appointments available), but we are generally all aware that we have it about as good as it gets. We can complain about it as its ours, but won't accept criticism from outside. Sounds to me like your family member has heard what he wanted from a conversation.

&gt;

&gt;__Kevin Bernard Moran__ (born 29 April 1956) is a former Irish footballer who excelled at the top levels in both [Gaelic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football) and soccer. In Gaelic football, he is known for his time as a [Dublin senior team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_GAA) player, winning two [All-Ireland Senior Football Championships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship) with them, and in soccer for his career with [Manchester United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.) and [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team). He was the first man to be sent off in an [FA Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final).

&gt;Moran grew up in [Rialto, Dublin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto,_Dublin) until his early teens, before he moved to the Long Mile Road in Walkinstown. While there, he attended James' Street CBS and [Drimnagh Castle CBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drimnagh_Castle_Secondary_School) where [gaelic football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football) was the dominant sport although soccer proved to be the sport he played on the streets while growing up.  During the period in which he played Gaelic football for [Good Counsel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Counsel_GAA) and soccer for Rangers [(http://www.rangersafc.ie/history.html), Bohemians and Pegasus he had divided loyalties between the two sports, as both sports were then played on a Saturday.

Sorry if this is all redundant info... have you tried emailing the listserv for your program to see if anyone is looking to share a flat or is moving? The end of the term is coming up so people will be looking for replacement tenants. 

If you want to avoid a super student-y area (I'm with you), I'd avoid Selly Oak.

But I guess I'm really only a half scouser so maybe I'm completely wrong.

true,SausageSweatshirt,newcr-1,,"Fellaini.

I like Rodwell very much - he's blue through and through - but who would he replace right now? Certainly not Barry or McCarthy, and we are still yet to really see Gibson in Bobby's system who could and should challenge those two. Rodwell is decent going forward but if we continue to use the formation we do would you pick him over Ross? After the season so far I wouldn't.

Fellaini has come under a lot of stick at United, I personally feel that's mostly because Moyes ballsed up the transfer and paid what, 4 million over the top for him? Fellaini didn't set his transfer price. He scored a nice handful of goals and made a huge menace of himself last season and justified whatever price tag he went for. But that ONLY works when you play him off the striker like we had him playing off Jela, and right now they're starting games with Rooney, Van Persie and Mata up top. Fellaini can't pass the ball for shit to be a holding midfielder and it's almost absurd that Moyes seems to expect that of him. Still, when you go for a huge salary you have to start, Torres taught us all that.

Next year we'll likely be in Europa. Ross is still a kid and can't handle 60 odd games in the year. We'll likely need someone to play in his position as much as he will. With no guaranteed centre-forward lined up either, in your situation I'd bite your hand off if you told me we could sign someone that knows our players inside out and can hit the back of the net in the double digits.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am not anti-Ramires at all. Most of these things are already things most people know about Ramires. His strengths have always been tackling, covering and regaining possession. But passing, shooting and set pieces (both taking and being on the receiving end) have always been huge weakness' in his game.

All I am saying is that once he stops doing the few specific things that he is amazing at well, he will end up having really bad games because he isn't a typical ""well-rounded"" midfielder. He has a very specific job on the pitch and because of the fact that he is such an phenomenal athlete he can get away without having to have a great passing range or shooting ability. But once his tackling starts getting rash and he isn't doing what he usually does well there is nothing else he can bring to the midfield, which makes him look out of form.

Other midfielders like Matic and Lampard are much more dynamic and even if they don't have a good game in one department they can still excel in others. Lamps could have a terrible day defensively, but still whip in a great corner, or score a great goal/freekick or just help pass the ball and make the team more fluid.

That was Paulinho in Brazil. 

&gt;He can have him. Paulinho's been one of our most underwhelming transfers.

If you REALLY ranked them, in overall performance, I'm pretty sure Soldado takes the cake.

&gt;Capoue can be brilliant... he was one of our best players at the start of the season before his injury.

So was the aforementioned Paulinho. 

I would argue that Paulinho was our most consistent performer until Charlie Adam injured him. What's more, that was one of his few games under Sherwood, prior to his injury. Ever since that injury, our entire midfield, sans Eriksen, have been outplayed. Since AVB's sacking, our midfield has been gradually been getting outplayed each passing game. I think it has something to do with the strategy (or lack thereof?). The amount of long balls, as well as our tendency to try to hit the oppositions flank has left the middle of our camp lost.

Henderson's passing accuracy is impressive. He's such a tireless workhorse and he distributes the ball with ease, I hope he grows into being the Gerrard for this generation of players. What a turnaround he's had since he arrived. 

As for Sturridge being selfish, I'm not sure what he could have done differently in the chances that he missed. In the first half he got between the defenders to receive the ball at some narrow angle a few times. Vidic actually did a good job of keeping him away from goal during his best chance.

Wolverhampton council were forever trying to stop people from skateboarding at the Civic Centre to the point of hiring security guards. There were a couple of big problems with this.

Second, we got to know a few of them and even they agreed that it was quite silly and went on to tell us how often they would do their walk arounds.

Thirdly, at this point the council seemed dead set on not providing us with a skatepark near the city centre in an area we were unlikely to get mugged. It took a good couple of years before they actually built one, and while it wasn't fantastic, as soon as it was done, everyone went there instead.

I haven't seen that many foreign fans at football games (it is usually mainly scousers) but out of the common groups on reddit the ones you see most are Norwegians (presumably as it's much easier for them to get there than the poor Americans on the other side of the Atlantic). A problem with identifying foreign fans at Liverpool games is that Liverpool is an extremely multicultural city, so you can't tell if, for example, the Chinese people you see are from Liverpool or from further afield (for example, there are a lot of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia).

Quite often you see foreign fans taking pictures or videos during the games etc and it seems to bother some people, but I have absolutely no problem with it. It's a once in a lifetime experience for them to be at the game and so they're going to want to take as many pictures as possible to remember it and I fully support that.

When it comes to general feelings about foreign fans I think most people from Liverpool (myself included) love them. It's great to see such passion across the globe (you only have to look at the reaction to the United game in Bucharest for example) for our club is absolutely brilliant and it really creates a link with you and complete strangers. I remember distinctly, for example, having a great chat with some of the hotel staff when I went on holiday to Malaysia as they were Liverpool fans. It's great that so many people can be linked together by our relatively small city that wouldn't show up so much on the globe otherwise (except for maybe the Beatles).

I have to admit that I am quite partial towards American fans for the simple fact that football isn't a big thing there. It's great to see so many people from a country where football isn't a major sport support my city's team and it gives, for me anyway, a sort of significance to Liverpool as it would usually pale in terms of fame compared to massive American cities (like SF and NY), yet there are bars in such global cities filled with people watching and supporting my club from my relatively small city. It's a great feeling.

Your passion can't be denied having seen videos on youtube of pre season game atmosphere and pub atmosphere, if it be Bucharest of Boston. Also the dedication of getting up a silly'o'clock to watch a FA cup 3rd round tie against a possible non-league team. 

What home grown supporters don't understand is being in a country where the standard of footy is poor and not having big teams to follow, hence the need to support a team in a big league in another country.

At right back I like Brana because, even though his crossing leaves much to be desired, he's usually a rock defensively and playing him allows us to switch to a back three if we need to in a single sub (LB for 'x'). Also he provides yet another attacking threat on set pieces with his head. Then for depth we could switch Azpi over to his natural side and play Cole, hardly a drop in quality.

He had precisely one match - the Stoke one where he got crunched - where his pulled off a few flicks and looked to get involved stacks.  But, it was against Stoke.  The rest of the time he looked energetic, but his end product was pretty woeful.  Awful shooting, not much to his passing game, and defensive inadequacy.

When he was paired with Dembele (as he frequently was under AVB in a 4-2-3-1), our team's midfield was completely blunted by two players sitting deep who struggled to either get or pass forward.

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt; I love how you claim Wenger and Moyes will be dinosaurs

Have you read my fucking post? 

&gt;we're moving generally into a more Continental style, with a head coach, technical director, etc. Frankly, I think that's the future.

The era of dictator Frenchmen and Scotsmen are well done and over. From what I know, Wenger literally has control of the entire fucking system at Arsenal. He's in the room with the physios (despite somehow having an injury record second only to ours), he oversees transfers, Arsenal starts and ends with Arsene. 

Compare this to City, Chelsea, us, even Rogers didn't bring in Sterling. With year-in-year-out managers. There's a stable backroom who'll handle transfers, wages, salaries, all of it. 

Liverpool's hired a fucking psychologist, that's ""man management"" on an entirely new level. Brendan Rogers can be praised for all of his man management abilities (and he deserves it, frankly), but without a group therapy session of Stevie G and SAS, it goes way down. 

&gt;It doesn't necessarily matter where you have gotten your degree as much as it does on how you use it.

Go ask any businessman on the face of this earth on how they make a 30 million investment ten times its worth in ten years. You probably know just about fuck all in economics, but 300 million pounds (that comes out to ~$498 million USD), isn't anything to laugh at.

true,JamDunc,eng-yorkshire,ex-Yorkshire now Sverige,"If you have qualifications from college in electronics or hydraulics, then ROV's could be a good industry for you. And unless you live in an 'offshore' town, it's something you'll more than likely have never heard of.

ROV's or Remote Operated Vehicles are little unmanned submarines used in the oil and gas industry, the science 'industry', basically anywhere where there is a need to explore underwater. Major manufacturers or ROV's are Seaeye (http://www.seaeye.com) in the south of England and Perry Slingsby (just bought by FET, http://www.f-e-t.com/our_products_technologies/subsea-solutions/) in the north of England. There are also other manufacturers around the world, but Seaeye's are the 'standard' for inspection and the Triton XLX by Perry is arguably the best workclass ROV, (queue the arguments now!).

I've been doing it for just over 6 years now, my daily wage is around £400 (although I am only contracted for 150 days a year) and there is usually the chance to work extra days if you want.

Benefits are the wage, the time off, especially the time off as there's nothing like the quiet winter period and sitting at home relaxing for 3 months!

Cons are the hours, which are 12 hours a day for your entire trip offshore (can be up to 8 weeks), during busy periods, you can be expected to actually work more than 12 hours a day to get the vehicle up and running (most I have done is 42 hours in 3 days, in the middle of a 4 week trip so still had to do the 12 hours either side). Also you're away from family and although it's becoming more common, you may not have a phone line or internet connection to talk to family.

I wouldn't change my career for anything, even if sometimes I can get a stressed due to tiredness.

ROV Pilot/Trainee is the term to search for more info if you so desire.

Most recently, I waited a year for a neurology appointment, failed to stand upright at examination (the test was to see if I could stand upright with my eyes closed; I fell over three times), and was told I wasn't worth investigating further. I fucking hate the NHS, because being told I couldn't have healthcare because I'm a poor would be *better* than the torture they have put me through since I was 21. I could have had a family. I could have had a career. I could have had anyone, ever, get off their arse long enough to consider that there might be something wrong with me.

Having said that, the critical care unit at King's went to such effort on my dad's behalf when he was dying that I won't hear a word against them.

Is Massimo Cellino now likely to be barred from taking over?


Yes. The agriculture magnate and owner of Serie A club Cagliari has a signed contract to buy 75% of Leeds United from the club's current owners, Gulf Finance House, a bank in Bahrain. He has now been convicted by a judge in Cagliari of criminally evading €400,000 of import tax due in Italy on his yacht, Nelie. The Football League's ""owners and directors"" test, formerly the ""fit and proper persons"" test, bars people from becoming directors or 30% owners of a club if they have ""unspent convictions for offences of dishonesty"". It therefore looks very likely the Football League will bar Cellino from taking over.

Will he appeal if he is barred by the Football League?


His lawyer in Sardinia, Giovanni Cocco, said he considers the verdict ""unjust"" and they will appeal. Cellino is also very likely to appeal against the Football League if it bars him and his company, Eleonora Sports, from taking over. Sources close to Cellino cite three grounds: that the conviction itself is being appealed, that anyway this tax conviction in Italy should not be classed as ""an offence of dishonesty,"" and that Cellino himself is a minority shareholder in Eleonora Sports, which is owned by his family trust. The chances of such an appeal succeeding do not look convincing.

What happens to Leeds now, as Cellino has already put money in?


Cellino has paid more than £2m into Leeds to pay the club's ongoing losses, principally on players' wages, since he agreed an exclusive period of negotiation. GFH did the same when they negotiated with Ken Bates to buy Leeds in 2012 and David Haigh, still the club's managing director, formerly a GFH executive, paid in around £2m before his takeover bid with a businessman, Andrew Flower, collapsed. If Cellino and the Eleonora Sports takeover is blocked, GFH will have to fund the club again, and look for another buyer.

Could Leeds United now go into administration again?


GFH and Haigh say this will not happen. GFH have spent around £40m buying Leeds from Bates and funding its £1m monthly losses since, and they would lose all that if the club went into administration. Although they are reluctant to fund the club any more, as a bank they say they do have access to money, and will keep Leeds going until another buyer can be found.



 
Why do such episodes always seem to happen to Leeds?


Still considered one of English football's truly big clubs in fanbase, history and potential – and Champions League semi-finalists as recently as 2001 – Leeds United have never recovered since their financial collapse the following year. The club's then chairman, Peter Ridsdale, famously lamented ""We lived the dream,"" and the club's fate since has been a fans' nightmare. Bates took the club into insolvent administration in 2007, thus leaving £35m creditors substantially unpaid, yet after that the club made losses again and fell into financial difficulties. GFH took over, decided they do not want to keep funding losses, and say they had no firm offers from anybody with the money to buy the club until Cellino arrived. Now, that deal looks to be scuppered, for unpaid tax in Italy over a yacht called Nelie.",0,1395214246,null,0,1395261640,0,cg6cf1m,t3_20qvkg,t1_cg6cf1m,t1_cg6c8hp,null,1432972275,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

If you're a plastic fan who just claims to follow the club and only really takes an interest in games when we're winning, then I'll look on you poorly, but you get people like that all around England and in Liverpool too - it's not exclusive to foreign fans. 

If you know your shit and have followed the club for years then I'd happily have a pint with you and talk about football. Helps if you've got a solid reason for supporting the club (for so many Norwegian fans I've met it appears to be Vegard Heggem, which is decent enough though I don't really understand because I thought he was fairly pants) and don't come for a country like Germany or Spain where it feels there'd be obvious local teams to go for. But really if you're a proper fan you're a proper fan, whether born in Liverpool or overseas. 

Would be really hard to meet someone who knows everything about the club and has travelled hundreds or thousands of miles to get to the game and tell them they're not a ""proper supporter"".

Think about what you're saying. Its a city that might be 10x times the size of the one you are living in. When trouble flares, the chance of you being caught up in something like that is probably similar to the chance you'll win the lottery. 

Also, unless you're a boring unadventurous cunt, there are a million things to do in and around Belfast. Im never bored in this city. The city is almost always buzzing, and there are plenty of big events on throughout the year. The city is big enough in that plenty of niche interests are catered for too. Even at Queens there are something like 150 clubs and societies... You name it and there's a club for it. You just gotta get out there and get involved.

Depending on what you fancy doing (and the weather), I'd recommend  the following:

* [Botanical Gardens](http://www.sbg.org.uk/index.asp) - nice for a bit of a walk around, relax in the sun. They're close to some of the halls for both Sheffield Uni and Hallam (I think).

* For hanging out in the sun (hahaha), see also [Western Park](http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/museums/weston-park/home).

* For a drink or some food, I'd recommend [Bungalows &amp;Bears](http://www.bungalowsandbears.com/) on Division Street for anyone, the [Devonshire Cat](http://www.devonshirecat.co.uk/) or [Dada](http://www.dadabar.co.uk/Dada_home.html) if you like real ale, or [Forum](http://www.forumsheffield.co.uk/) if the weather's good and you want to eat/drink in the sun.

* For going out, avoid [Corp](http://www.corporation.org.uk/). It's dirty. Division Street is normally good for DJs, with the Green Room, Forum, Bungalows and Bears having random nights. The Harley is excellent for a mixture of music, also check out the listings for Leadmill, D&amp;Q, Plug to see if they have anything to your tastes. West Street Live used to always have shows for free, but they were generally pretty shit.

* Like museums? Check out the Western Park Museum or the Millennium Gallery. Don't forget the Winter Gardens and Peace Gardens outside.

* The peak district is very close-by and lovely. You can get a bus out to the [Fox House](http://www.vintageinn.co.uk/thefoxhouselongshaw/) and walk around for a bit.

* If you like history/industry, go for a walk down to Kelham Island and check out the [Museum](http://www.simt.co.uk/kelham-island-museum/), and the fantastic real ale pubs too (Fat Cat, Kelham Island Tavern).

After graduating, it took me about 5 months to get a job (luckier than others) and even I think that was because I volunteered with the RSPCA and I have a passion for literature (it was at Waterstones). But that was just a Christmas temp position. After that, it took me 9 months to get a job (finally got one at Sainsbury's).

Nurses, teachers, policemen, firemen etc all earn close to the national average as a starting salary, if you're a ward sister/head of year etc, you're earning a lot more. Which I think most people are ok with tbh.

As a local resident of the area the way they have held us to ransom over the NDP is despicable. We get that they're financial juggernauts but the way in which they've handled local businesses and threats to leave and ""kill the area"" are way above the mark. 

Now I don't expect you to know this, but supporting Spurs is more than something about Football with me. It's about living there, seeing it bring the community together and they have completely stomped their way through this. 

What stage are we at with the stadium? I keep getting letters coming through my door saying it's an issue with the steel works but that's been ""an issue"" for 3 years now. Surely they could have sorted this by now. This could have been further down the line if they hadn't bothered with the OS review. 

The point I'm making is whenever we're on the edge or close to BEING ABLE to grab our goal, they don't go for it. They don't buy when we have the opportunity and before you know it, it's too late. We could have been right up there fighting if they had brought that striker when we needed it, bought that left back when we needed it. Things like that.

does someone really have to point out to you that by replying to my comment you completely undermine your own position.

you see, if you weren't such a fucking moron and actually used intelligence rather than pedantry you would understand that for you to reply to my comments which did not follow the rules at all but has clear and coherent meaning you accept and verfy that the pedantic rules you are so keen to enforce are not necessary to express thoughts/ideas/meaning

so your argument is essentially, i should follow the rules because everyone else does. despite it having no actual impact on its meaning.

which then brings us to the point that ""the rules"" continually change and amend its called language you fucking moron, its not a law of physics.


language is constantly evolving and changing, if everyone was a sad moronic joyless pedant like you that would never happen as they think ""rules must be followed for rules sake""

It's not for them to determine whether its ethical for people to work for nothing, they simply say 'who has gone out and done some work' to determine unemployment.

&gt;In accordance with international guidelines, all those in government supported training and employment programmes are defined as being in employment. Such people cannot therefore be classified as unemployed as no one can be both employed and unemployed at the same point in time.

http://consentarchive.wordpress.com/avoidworkfare/stats/

They also class having a zero-hours contract as being in employment.

&gt;People who are on zero hours contracts count as employed. If they worked at least an hour in the survey reference period they would be counted in the employment numbers as usual. If a survey respondent did not in fact work in the reference period, the first question asked is whether they are 'temporarily away from a job' (they could be sick or on leave, etc..). Those on a zero-hours contract should reply to say they have a job to return to. In this instance they would be in employment but listed as having worked no hours

The season is starting to resemble some cliché horror flick device - awaking from a nightmare with that string of clean sheets and promising start, only for brief glitches to start gradually creeping in until it becomes clear we never woke up at all. If a sadist was scripting it, the grand finale would be getting absolutely embarrassed in the playoffs, with Mackie himself plunging the knife in. I didn't comment on the Crown &amp; Sceptre vox pop as I didn't want to play Mr. Negative, but the guy who said this is the dullest he has seen QPR in 40 years was for me the standout point of view there, and he didn't sound like a clueless fool.

As much as people will appeal to that 4th place spot as a silver lining, if we are going to play numbers you can appeal to the 21 points won out of 48 over the last 16 games. We have indeed had an obscene injury record, but we still had Barton, Kranjcar, Hoilett, O'Neil and Morrison playing last night. Even if Austin had been playing last night, I'm not sure it would have made a difference as the issues were much further down the pitch.

One thing that is concerning me now is all those contract/loan expirations playing on the squad's minds...presumably the club hasn't begun any renewal negotiations yet. The likes of Dunne and Zamora are probably wondering what level they'll play at next year, if at all. BAE is facing god knows what as he returns to Spurs. I doubt Kranjcar is relishing a return to Kiev in light of the fun and games unfolding in Ukraine right now. Morrison clearly has his issues at West Ham. Even the likes of Hoilett and Traoré, who aren't over the hill, are probably facing significant salary cuts on their next deal. The closer we get to those post-season knockout games, the closer these things will be looming on their horizon.

Still...the playoffs are indeed a lottery, so anything could happen. It would be nice if they didn't charge me 30 quid for the honour of having my seat for the game though.

The no campaign isn't targeting people who would vote with their conscience though, it's targeting people who are undecided, who care more about if they're going to be better off than whether they have a British or Scottish passport, who it seems are going to be deciders of the referendum.

All the yes campaign does for these people is promise the earth and makes unrealistic promises (and this isn't coming from me, this is what I've heard many undecided Scots say - they don't seem credible) whereas the no campaign isn't hopeful or glamourous but they are holding the yes campaign to account.

Lol. Can't really think of anything they could possibly do to prevent that. Yeah, they could possibly refuse to allow you into their 6th form (in my school one person was rejected because he had poor grades, not sure how much say schools have on ejecting folk from 6th form - suspect it's a decent amount of say, because it's not compulsory), which would mean either transferring schools or going to a college to do it, but that threat is so damn empty. Even if you don't get the best 6th form education, if you put in your all and do well, uni's a clean slate.

Like other people, I don't see any protection issue on that front - if they're CRB checked, then unless they were doing something dodgy in that respect, it's not an angle you can take. 

From this point on, I would refuse to speak to them without a witness/recording device present.

I think the blame is definitely on the Yes Campaign whose strategy seems to be to promise a panacea and then shout down any critics as bullies. It might just be my own bias there right enough.

&gt;Yes Scotland have never once touched the 'anti-English' argument of yesteryear, they have been relentlessly positive about everything.

I'm not buying that for a second. The has been some incredibly negative stuff coming out of the Yes Campaign trying to make the rest of the UK seem as different and hostile as possible. There is such a thing as dog-whistle politics where you don't overtly say 'the English are different and we would do well to be shot of them' but you get the message across.

Beyond that we've had senior Yes/SNP figures warning about the 'consequences of a No vote' and being as negative as possible about anything the UK does. 

This Yes = positive &amp; No = negative narrative is starting to really rankle with me. Apparently it's positive campaigning to blame child poverty on the UK, but negative campaigning to point out that we already have the ideal currency arrangement.

It sort of sounds like the locals think like those shop owners in the league of gentlemen. Hmm. I hope I don't run into too many small minded people there.

I'll definateley keep the secondary school in mind, I'd rather they got a decent education. I think there are two primary schools in Bala, one seems to have a better Estyn report, but it's a Christian school. I'm personally not religious and have a bit of an issue with my kids being preached to, so I'm sort of leaning toward the other one. I suppose I can visit both and see for myself which I prefer though.

Haha, what is it with (some) welsh people and their weird patriotism? I know a few people with similar tattoos. Also, loads of people down in south Wales have welsh flags on poles in their gardens? Bizzare.

Oh it doesn't sound as rough as we'd been told, we're not really the type to go out drinking anyway so we're not likely to run into any trouble. It sounds fairly similar to Carnarfon (which is near where I'm originally from). 

I'm quite looking forward to living by a lake, it'll be somewhere nice to walk the dogs at least :) the scenery where we currently live is a bit bleak.

The British police's attitude is to gather as much evidence as possible before making arrests, providing no actual attack is imminent. This is in contrast to some other countries where they'll arrest anyone on the slightest evidence and try to break things up and then see what they'll find and worry about proving anything in court later.

Intelligence will come from MI5, MI6 or GCHQ, then depending on how serious the suspicion is, the observation may be done by local CID, then escalating to the Met's anti-terrorist branch, then the SRR, which is a fairly new branch of the UK's special forces tasked with reconnaissance. Their role is probably what most people would assume DI5 to be doing and might have done in the past. SRR would probably also be able to change from recon to action very quickly if it became necessary and would probably be armed, but that's the sort of thing that's not really talked about.

If and when action needed to be taken in a planned way rather than a reactive one, the escalation level is based on the perceived threat level and may go from local plod picking someone up by asking nicely if they'll come to the station, through to an non-firearms police team that's moderately well tooled up with hitty-bashy things smashing doors down, then armed special branch police, and finally up to a full military response involving gas-masked SAS nutters swinging through windows. The latter would probably only occur if automatic weapons or explosives, or some other extremely nasty stuff, were on site, or someone had already been killed.

The club manager works with his players most days of the week (assuming they get a rest day).

The England team has less time playing together. At a club they know exactly how each other plays - they see it daily in training, just like their manager. 

I don't think you can make it a fair comparison, International managing is a tough job because you have to impose your tactics, training methods, etc. But you have a small scale of time to do it with. You don't necessarily know how players will work together (Lampard + Gerrard, prime example).

Yes, they have international training camps (I believe these are pre-tournaments), but that's taking you back to a short time scale to try and force a group of players into a team.

First thing's first... things will go wrong, and in that case don't panic. Think BEFORE acting. 

As for moving about - it really depends on how much stuff you have! If it's not much, then you can just shuffle yourself there. If you've got stuff that won't fit in a carload or two, might be worth having a word with your parents about renting a van (renting stuff under 25 is either not possible or expensive usually). Employing an actual moving company isn't worth it unless you have a shitload of furniture to move. Did the van thing when I moved into a joint house with my husband - both sets o' parents had a load of crap to get rid of, so there was a day of driving from house to house, to the tip, then from my parents' house to my new house :). 

Rent... you'll probably pay that by standing order. Or at least that's what I did when I rented - set up a standing order so the money gets paid at the same date every month. That way I didn't have to remember to pay the rent... though remember to cancel the standing order at the end of your tenancy ;). When you do rent a property I suggest reading what you're signing very carefully - ensure there aren't any ""surprise"" clauses in there. Also these days, deposits go into escrow. 

Council tax is easy - it's a monthly direct debit - as someone else said, you can just ring whichever council it is and they'll arrange the particulars. I'd be more concerned about sorting out utilities - take readings when you first enter the house, so you know what you should be liable for. Ensure the utility companies know of your existence and the bills are in your name if you're paying, so you don't get any surprise bills. 

I'd recommend visiting an area you plan to move into as much as you can. Get a feel for the place, learn where you would do your food shopping, what kind of things there are to do/see around the place. 

Living with people can be cheaper.... but there's upsides and downsides to doing that, so that's a decision you have to make for yourself. ",0,1395233972,null,0,1395234232,0,cg6fyh8,t3_20o8gy,t1_cg6fyh8,t3_20o8gy,null,1432974009,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

My niece goes to the other primary school, and they don't start teaching kids English reading and writing AT ALL until the third year, which I would consider a major concern.  You'd want to be as involved as possible in your kids education in order to mitigate any damage from that.

We could have payed 500,000 more dollars/euros and had moutinho. Villa was fairly cheap on the transfer side so we could have upped his wages, and hulk was certainly interested and within out price range.

true,xeraphine,lfc12,,"I think realistically, to win the league, we HAVE to accomplish the following:

* Beat Chelsea at Anfield (they have the easiest run-in)
* Draw (or beat) Man City at Anfield
* Drop no more than 2 points in the remaining 7 matches.

That would put us on 85-87 points. 

If Chelsea win out except for our match, they're on 87, but I can see them dropping 2 against Arsenal or Swansea. We HAVE to beat Chelsea.

City still have to go to Arsenal, Everton, and have tricky home matches against Southampton and Villa. If we draw them, we're counting on them to drop 4-6 points from somewhere. If Arsenal beat them, they just have to slip up against one of the other three I mentioned. I say that's reasonably likely given their inconsistency this season.

Of course, taking care of our own business isn't guaranteed. The last time we played lower sides (besides the 3-0 at United :P), we struggled to get the 3 points (see: Swansea and Fulham).

true,XlPoLaR04,num23,,"While i think that having spurs players out and about in brazil would be nice, i don't think it would change my opinion on the world cup. I'm still going to root against Brazil and Spain, and for the Americans and the Italians. 

Jan is probably gonna play deep into the tournament as i have Belgium at least in the quarterfinals.  Paulinho will probably be there too much to my chagrin. However it might get them back into better form and playing better football than the have been lately (more directed at paulinho) and if we reallydon't want them around any more can raise their values.

Hugo will probably be fine as he is a keeper and barring another Lukaku like incident at the World Cup, more time in front of net can only help. There is one player that had an outside chance before Diego Costa showed up and that is Soldado. Good ol Bobby needs more time on the field and needs to start putting the ball in the back of the net. So playing most of the summer would be wonderful for him. 

Lastly the only thing that I hope for out of the World Cup outside of what i have said already. Is that some of our key transfer targets, have awful showings. That way we spend less $$$ and maybe can pick up someone that might otherwise be out of our price range.

David Villa...we brought him in, he saw the training facility and met with AVB...he chose not to sign with us.

Hulk we were never going to sign, he was coming off a shit season with Zenit and while unhappy there Zenit was going to ask for as much as they could (they reportedly wanted £10m just for a loan fee) to recoup as much of they could of the £39.5m they laid out for him.  His wages were also higher than anyone we had at the club, it was never a realistic target.

Willian, we literally did everything we could to get Willian.  We had a bid accepted, we made a good contract offer that he was going to accept, he was at our training ground getting a physical and he chose to go to Chelsea instead.

We also did sign Paulinho who was one of AVB's players.

Not to mention that AVB wanted Baldini brought in to be the DoF and we did that.

So we fucked up on 1 player, 1 player was completely unrealistic (though we still did enquire) and 2 players (one of which was AVB's buddy) we made offers and brought in to meet everyone and they chose to go to another club. Not to mention that Coentrao reportedly wanted more wages than anyone on the club, Di Maria said no to a transfer.

We did try to get the players that AVB wanted it didn't work out, so we got some pretty damn good replacements.

I liked AVB but he brought a great deal of what got him sacked on himself. We can point and say that he didn't have the people wanted but if you take away Bale we still weren't scoring last season, he had fallen out with Levy and Baldini (who he pushed to get brought in), had banished Freund from the bench, froze out Ade, ignored Sherwood and the youth squad and from the sounds of it was losing the locker room.

Levy made some mistakes while AVB was with us that is not the issue...AVB is a likeable guy but he made a series of mistakes on his own while at Spurs and just like Levy/Baldini get flack for their mistakes AVB deserves criticism for his.  

At the point we sacked AVB it seems like there was no way back from the situation was from any side.

Chelsea have always been a famous club, but the last 10 years have really elevated us because of the winning culture that was established.  And I think we have to look at those core players who made it a reality.

When we look back, Lampard will have joined Zola and Osgood on that level, as you said.  JT isn't far behind.  His case is helped by the fact that he joined the club at such a young age and has been one of the most dedicated players on the pitch I've seen.

For Didier, it's funny you say ""people here seem incapable of taking a player's ability in context,"" because that's exactly why I think he deserves that legend status.  Lampard, by all accounts, is the better player.  Scored more, affected the game more, and has been more consistent over his Chelsea career.  Didier was prone to petulance and moaning at times, and wasn't what we would consider a ""world class striker.""  But contextually, he showed up when it mattered.  He was such a major part of so many of our trophies, and established that winning culture by (to be cliche), succeeding on the biggest stages, the most memorable being the CL win.  It was heroic what he did in that competition, and for me, joined with all his other accomplishments, gives cause for deification at Chelsea.

&gt;

&gt;The __Karaiskakis Stadium disaster__ was an incident that occurred on 8 February 1981,  in the [Karaiskakis Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium) in Neo [Faliro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faliro), [Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece), after the conclusion of a football match between [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) and [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC). It is the biggest football [tragedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_(event\)) in Greece's history,  and among the worst in sports history.

&gt;A total number of 21 people, 20 supporters of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos) and 1 supporter of [AEK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_F.C.), lost their lives while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the victory of [Olympiacos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) against [AEK Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC) (6–0). The accident occurred in the historic Gate 7 (Θύρα 7).  The stadium has since been rebuilt as a modern soccer football field (not a stadium).

&gt;There are still debates regarding the causes that led to the disaster. The main cause for the accident, according to the official police report, seems to have been a partially closed door. While exiting, some fans lost their balance and fell on the last steps. Dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming, making it for most of them extremely difficult to stand up or even defend themselves somehow. 19 supporters lost their lives within the stadium, while another two died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 more were injured, many of them with major injuries. Most of the dead and wounded were teenagers and young adults.

Sterling has been improving massively and consistently over the last few months and looks like he's loving his football. This is great. 

The one thing that is giving me the most encouragement about Sterling and his prospects for the future, though, is his willingness to receive posession in traffic and use his feet to wriggle away from opposition players and pass the ball on. This is a fantastic attribute for any player to have and it's been exemplified in these last couple of games where he's played in a central role. This is not an ability that many English players possess - even Gerrard requires some space and time to do something special.

Over and over again against Manchester United it looked as though the ball was in an area where it was very close to being lost - but Sterling was there to receive, surrounded by opposition players (oftentimes a big, physical player like Fellaini), before dribbling to safety and feeding a team mate.

Andres Iniesta is probably the best player in the world at doing the above, and if Sterling can make this a feature of his game it is so useful not just to him as a player but also to the team - useful as both a safety valve (like a checkdown in American football), and also as another way to attack an opponent.

My worry with Sterling early on was that he'd solely be a speed merchant on the outside, and one-dimensional.

Glad you said that.

Now look at these figures and tell me we actually reduced our spending during austerity...

http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/recent_spending


&gt; the first point depends rather strongly on the initial growth predictions being accurate. It also ignores other factors.

A plan can't be very good if the predicted outcomes are wrong. That's the point. The tory plan was to deliver x, what was delivered was y, and y is a nice substitute but it isn't x, it's half as good in fact.

So did the plan work?  Clearly not, as x was not delivered. Did something good happen despite the plan not working, yes, but they may have happened anyway.

true,TheDisapprovingBrit,England,Stoke - '03 Honda VT750 Shadow,"Plenty of people take out a loan/finance for considerably more than £5k for their first car, and it sounds like you're intending to use your bike for more or less the same purpose, so from that stance alone you can justify it. However...

Personally, I'd get through your CBT first - there's no point paying interest on a loan for a bike you don't have a use for yet, you can't test ride without a CBT anyway, and your CBT is only going to be about a month's worth of loan payment, so there's no real value in including in in the loan amount.

Once that's done, do a bit of shopping around, and get insurance quotes as a matter of course for everything you might consider. There's a good chance insurance will be cheap enough that there's no point putting that into a loan either (I've never paid more than £200 for a years bike insurance, even with just a CBT). Consider older japanese bikes - the age makes them less of a teenagers bike which keeps premiums low, and as long as they've been looked after there's no reason for them not to last. 

Gear doesn't have to be expensive - you can pick up an Oxford jacket for £30 from Ghostbikes at the moment, and the rest of the gear can be picked up for not much more. I usually aim at between £50-80 per item, and there's loads of choice in that range. Again, £200 can easily see you fully kitted out. 

That only leaves the bike itself. Spread the gear and CBT over a couple of paydays, make sure you get a bike with a full MOT, and there's no real reason to need more than a £2k loan. 

Shop around, make sure there's no early repayment penalties, and for that kind of amount, don't rule out credit cards with introductory rates. As for having spare money for 'eventualities', remember you're then paying interest on money that you're not actually doing anything with. I'd leave that off the loan and get a credit card for unexpected spending like that. ",0,1395246379,null,0,false,0,cg6kz8n,t3_20tiv4,t1_cg6kz8n,t3_20tiv4,null,1432976374,6,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,6

But if they do over-spend on one or two big players, the potential downside probably outweighs the upside.

I developed it because:

1. I feel that coinmap is too impersonal, clunky and intimidating to small businesses (especially those that aren't very technically capable). I love what they are doing, I just thought I could make something with a slighty better, easier user experience; I don't for a second think I have achieved that yet, but the site is still under development. I thought developing something which was slightly easier to use would give me a tool to approach businesses in my city and explain to them what Bitcoin is.
2. I felt that other directories weren't appearing in Google for some of the key phrases *I* would search for when looking for businesses that accept Bitcoins. For example, searching for ""places in london that accept bitcoin"" only gives you one directory on the first page, http://spendbitcoins.com, which is very much a US-centered directory. I thought developing my own to target such phrases might help the acceptance of Bitcoin in the UK.
3. I believe in Bitcoin and thought as a developer this is one of the only ways I can help, other than organising meetups, which I also do.

Some points:

1) It doesn't like high class memory cards, I had to downgrade my 32gig class 6 card (even though Amazon recommends them together) to an 8gig class 4. It'll do auto loop (i.e. overwrite the oldest file) but this may be pointless if you need to look at something earlier and it has been overwritten. It may work with a 32gig class 4, making this less of an issue, but I don't have one of these to test with.

2) As mentioned in another post, you are only looking in one direction, front on, and will have no vision of side attacks.

3) I think it has a motion sensor but this is a buzz word with dashcams. It is a motion sensor in the sense that if the camera is jolted it will start (if powered up), not that if someone walks by in the cameras field of view. Mostly, it is pointless.


As for continual power (i.e assuming you will turn the engine off) you could try a portable battery as the E-prance is powered from mini USB so it is fairly standard. This is going to be the part that is most difficult as I'm not sure how long a portable battery would last charging a camera filming at 1080p and will vary greatly depending how much you want to spend on a battery (£10 - 100+). 

I have a Aluratek Universal Portable Battery (cost £30 2 years ago) but I've only ever used it charge my phone. Some batteries that have about 4x the storage of mine say they can power a netbook for 6 hours but it really depends on usage.

If you were getting the nails during the day there are portable batteries with solar chargers, this may be a solution as long as it's sunny enough to charge while being used :\

1 - Not sure and can't be bothered looking it up either :D

2 - I hadn't heard it was just bingo halls they're trying to revitalise, but I'll take your word for it. 

3 - We can't tell their political make up without researching, however the Tories are either doing this out of the goodness of their own heart* .... or they're after votes. I am making an assumption it's the second. You also make the assumption that tory voters wouldn't be as interested in bingo, I make a different assumption that they MUST be, else the tories wouldn't be assisting that industry.

4. Using my assumption from 3, they're *already* tory voters. So it's appeasing them to keep doing what they already do. Not in a ""oh wow, the tories eased tax rates, fantastic! let's vote for them"" way, but more allowing them to continue with their current lifestyle, where they already vote tory.

• Discourage use of fossil fuels by bringing
back the fuel duty escalator, increasing duty
in real terms by 8% per annum and through 
a series of other measures in this manifesto

• Phase out nuclear power and resolutely
oppose any new nuclear power stations.
Nuclear power is expensive and takes longer
to produce than renewable energies.
In addition to its known risks, there is still 
no safe or affordable way of disposing of
nuclear waste.

• Introduce road user tolls for heavy lorries.

And there is the barmy:

• Introduce a maximum speed limit of
55mph on motorways and trunk roads, and
40mph on rural roads, to make them safer
for all road users.

• Reallocate the £30 billion the Government
has earmarked for road-building over the
next 10 years. Spend the money on a 
programme of investment in public 
transport over the Parliament.

• Ban night flying.

2. There are still sensible people who wouldn't waste their vote on this tripe.

true,vendettaexpress,null,null,"Accepting what you're saying. However, lets say Rodgers was the England manager, and Liverpool manager.

Bias would come in to play, more likely to use his system. But, if he is using the same tactic/system and bringing in players from other teams, he is now sharing his knowledge with top players for other teams. An obvious negative when it comes back to Liverpool.

Pretending he is England manager only, I get what you're saying, but I don't think those players would necessarily start. If we think of a 4-3-3. He'd need:

* L/RW - whichever side Sterling isn't playing.
* CM - assuming Gerrard as pivot, and Henderson also playing.
* LB - as much as I love Flanagan, I rate Cole and Baines above him at current ability.
* CB's and GK

Think of a 4-4-2 diamond (4-1-2-1-2):

* ST - to play with Danny.
* CAM - replaces Coutinho.
* Defence - as above.



This assumes he rates the Liverpool players in those positions better than all other talent in the country. Again if he was managing both club and country he may be more/less likely to pick Liverpool players based on upcoming Liverpool fixtures.

&gt; But considering half the starting XI **against Denmark** already play together in Rodger's system

The team will change before the next international match.

He's beyond great at tackling and moving the ball forward via dribbling, but every single other aspect of his game leaves something to be desired. 

Now, Paulinho was way overrated at the beginning of the season. I agree there, if I recall after the Espanyol game people were willing to let him piss on their children. But over the last few months, I guess amplified by what Sherwood thinks, many are thinking that Paulinho is some form of average-ish player in all aspects of the game. But I think that isn't really too fair on the guy, he does get into some great attacking positions, and imo can distribute the ball a lot better than Dembele.

true,therespoutineinmyear,null,null,"First, I would like to make a point that I can't believe needs to be made. City are not going to win all of their remaining fixtures, so can we stop posing that hypothetical, please? They will not win all of Arsenal (A), Liverpool (A), United (A), Everton (A), Southampton (H), and West Ham (H). They have four of the hardest fixtures in the Premier League calendar remaining plus a couple of very scrappy teams to fend off at home. 

Second, we don't need to win all 9 games. That would put us on 89 points and nobody's going to get that kind of figure this year. 

- If City match their peak 11-game form (10-1-0), they hit 91 points. But like I said, that involves winning 5 and drawing 1 of the aforementioned fixtures plus winning all the ""easy"" ones. They're not gonna land that high. If they fall on their average 11-game form (25.24 pts), they hit 85 (8-1-2 run-in) which is still going to be tough with those fixtures on a compressed schedule.

- If Chelsea match their peak 8-game form (7-1-0), they hit 88 points. Liverpool away and Arsenal at home are the only fixtures that jump out of their schedule, though away days at Cardiff and Palace could prove tricky this time of year. If they fall on their average 8-game form (17.96 pts), they hit 84 (6-0-2 run-in). That's very doable for them and could land them the title.

- If Arsenal match their peak 9-game form (8-1-0), they hit 87 points. That involves beating three of Chelsea (A), Everton (A), City (H), and West Ham (H) with only one draw in there, not to mention beating everyone else. It also has to be said that Arsenal's peak 9-game form came from fixtures 2 through 10 and they've been a long way off of that form recently. If they fall towards their average (19.86 pts), they're looking at 82 pts (6-2-1 run-in). I think that's a pretty reasonable expectation for them.

That leaves us. We're a bit of a tough one because we're hitting peak form now. Our best performance over nine games (the last nine, coincidentally) is 7-2-0 (23 pts). If we match that in the run-in, we hit 85. It would take some very big results but it's doable, I think. City would be hard-pressed to hit that number. Arsenal could get there but it will take a return to their early season form. Chelsea are the most likely to make it there of the those three, in my opinion. If, as a lot of us suspect, we are just beginning to see Liverpool at its best, then there's a very real chance but any of the current top 4 could quite conceivably do it. It all depends on who catches fire over the run-in and we're the form team...",0,1395249726,null,0,false,0,cg6mld2,t3_20su8i,t1_cg6mld2,t3_20su8i,null,1432977142,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

&gt; * Vs Theresa May warning of ""the spectre of Border posts and passport controls at Berwick and Gretna, and a heightened risk of terrorism""?

Not getting a Schengen opt-out would mean passport controls. That's what she said and that's also what is true. Funnily enough there's no guarentee that Scotland would get an opt out and if having to show your passport on the way to England is such a scary prospect then maybe you don't actually want independence after all. 

&gt;Independence is not about being anti-English, nor is it about wanting to be better than England or any other part of the UK. It's about wanting to make different choices.

Independence is a lot of things to a lot of people but what it is almost all of the time to almost everyone is the idea that being Scottish and/or living in Scotland plays a major part in what is good for you and what you want out of government. I want to make different choices, but most of the people who want the choices I want aren't Scottish and most of the people who are Scottish don't want the choices I want. 

I suspect that once all the flag waving is finished that is true of most people too and that that is why we aren't actually getting any reasonable picture of what choices an independent Scotland would actually have to make.

Why are you running before you learned to walk? It's called the housing ladder because you work your way up over a number of years and purchases. If you want a £300K house, you're probably going to need to do 1 or 2 rungs before you get to that step.

I don't know any middle aged people with a £300-400K house that hasn't bought a few shitters before hand. 

&gt;I'd rather house prices remain stable than rise, it would mean less borrowing and therefore less interest payments. 

We'd all like this, I think. It's just not going to happen though, so you can either complain about it and piss into the wind or buy a piece of shit and work your way up like everyone before you has. 

Also, I don't really think you've fully understood how the housing ladder works. You don't even need to move out of your place to progress up the ladder, really. Most people do, because they want a bigger place. 

But you can just remortgage, and since you now have more equity in the property your loan to value goes down, you'll get a better mortgage rates and you can pay off the loan quicker. 

Trust me on this, you're better getting on the first rung of the ladder than standing beside it and shouting at it. ",0,1395252678,null,0,false,0,cg6o15o,t3_20soqw,t1_cg6o15o,t1_cg6n2az,null,1432977821,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not even fussed about getting back in the prem or winning the league or anything like that, I just want a team where every player plays for each other like they used to.

Obviously he does make a few errors, Maribor in the Europa Leauge, Frazier Campbell vs Cardiff (he was out of the box I think), Downing vs Liverpool, and there are more out there. But he's saved our ass more times than he's spanked it. He isn't underrated, I think everyone realises he's a great asset for the club and possibly our best player. 

People talk about how Lennon's defensive work is great, and sure it is AT TIMES. But he very easily disappears in games, and i think he's quite remarkable how his game hasn't changed/adapted and how he hasn't developed in the high number of years he's been in the first team here. If you're a full back and you are coming against a winger with his speed you should be scared, but Lennon is very much a one trick pony against a full back. How many times have you seen him run to the line, and float a cross that is miles above anyone's head? He does send in a good ball every now and again, but not at the rate he should be doing.

true,TheDisapprovingBrit,England,Stoke - '03 Honda VT750 Shadow,"CGs are absolutely bombproof. Easy to ride and they take a ridiculous amount of abuse. Any example with a decent service history and full MOT will almost certainly do you fine. Check the service history for training schools though - ex CBT bikes will have been dropped a lot and used by people who have no idea what a clutch is. On the other hand, it will have spent is life plodding along at the speed limit and probably been well serviced, but I'd personally take a critical approach to such a bike. 

I took a gamble buying private on all my bikes except my last one, but then they both only cost £400 and I wasn't reliant on it for transport, so the price made it worth the risk. If you're looking at using it as your only way of getting around, a dealers warranty is a sound precaution to take. I'm not local to London so wouldn't have a clue about your local dealers though.

Edit: just noticed your concerns about reliability when buying older. I'd take a 20 year old Honda over a 3 year old Jinlun or other Chinese bike any day. Usually you can tell when an older bikes been well looked after just by appearance - lack of rust on the downpipes is an obvious one. Older bikes are also far simpler, so if you have any interest in doing your own maintenance they're a great place to start.

Our problem is that our midfield press is absolutely shit, was with AVB, still is with Tim. Unless we coach midfield to press better we'll need to start building a brick wall in front of Lloris as the only measure to stop leaking goals, no CB is capable of consistently tracking full-speed runs by AM/CFs on quality through balls.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Agree, i think the CB slot will be important to deal with this summer, at least adding some depth.  Really amazingly enough our whole defence could use a bit of attention.

I am less concerned with Jan possibly leaving than the media and a great deal of supporters seem to be. He really hasn't said he was leaving or looking to leave, in the first interview he said he would like to play CL football and when talking about the future he was focused on the season and then the WC everything else would come after that. Not exactly a damning comment. In his latest interview he said he would be with Spurs next season and wants to make CL with Spurs...this was dubbed ""a hint"" about his future in the media, seems a bit more than a ""hint"" to me but far less likely to sell papers or get clicks.

That said, really we are left with Jan, Dawson and Vlad...unless Kaboul really proves fitness i don't know that he will come back, the seems to be developing into the new Ledley...terrific when on the pitch but it is increasingly few and far between that he can play. Add to that Dawson has a injury plagued past, and Vlad and Jan have each have injuries this season and we need more coverage than Capoue (a natural DM), Fryers (a LB that has the ability to play CB) and Milos (who has yet to see the pitch for us). Honestly given the history we have had the past 4 or so seasons with our CBs getting hurt we should look at 2 CBs plus progressing Milos.

I still maintain we need someone at LB to compete or suplant Rose, i don't know that person is Fryers personally. We don't need to chase one of the best LBs in the world just someone who can push Rose so we can figure out is he the answer or not.

If Naughts leaves we need to figure out what we are doing with the backup RB, less a priority but worth at least a thought. Fredericks may be able to do it, but he is also a guy who was a middle of the road RM prospect who seemed to be drifting towards Dawkins career path before this season when we seemed to really focus on putting him at RB, we have no idea if he is good enough for the PL at this point.

true,txteva,null,null,"To put things in context - if posted on twitter that I thought that a co-worker should be sacked for doing a poor job then I would be the one who'd likely lose my job. I would potentially face disciplinary action for posting anything about negative about or any photos from work and many companies have the same sort of policy. This is not hypothetical - I know situations where disciplinary act was taken place.

It wouldn't surprise me if some jobs/universities searched on places like twitter and if they found you making statements that you think a teacher should be sacked for doing a poor job then I think they would think twice about offering you a place. 

On to your original question unless any/all of the men in the room were inappropriate towards you (touching or being suggestive or abusive) then you really can't try and claim there's a child protection issue - and be VERY VERY careful - if you start wrongly accuse them of being inappropriate you will seriously be putting peoples job and reputation on the line.

If this was a situation which involved inappropriate comments or behaviour e.g. you'd accused the person on twitter of such behaviour then yes it should have been sensible to have a female in the room. But being the only female in a room should not be considered a protection issue however if it was just you and a male then it would have been unwise as there's no one to back him up if you make accusations.

You might have felt uncomfortable with the questions because you were quite rightly in trouble. I am surprised they didn't involve your parents before the conversation but they might have wanted to deal with it internally. 

Frankly I commend your school for dealing with it proper and I feel sorry for the teacher who not only lost a student but then has also had to deal with bullying from students about it. How would you like someone to basically say that it's your fault someone committed suicide? 

Now your concerns about poor support for mental health in school is 100% valid and should be fully looked in to but you should have spoke to a staff member at the school (or even given in an anonymous note) about it not chatting publicly on twitter.

Also if you felt uncomfortable in the meeting then it would have been perfectly valid to ask if another named teacher (or even student/prefect/parents) could join you and they really should have spoken to your parents first. 

TL;DR You were very stupid in how you made your comments (the concerns however are valid) and the school needed to take hard action but they could have handed it much better than they did.
