I've said before that all benefits should be means tested, especially pensions. We don't pay JSA to people who have over ¬£16,000 in the bank, yet we pay the state pension to old people who clearly don't need it.

Pensions are the largest part of the welfare bill alone, and cost us 5 times more than JSA.

The problem is that old people are far more likely to vote, so any government attempting to cut that massive debt will be voted out at the next election.

An accurate comparison would be pensions.  They have paid into they system they get a UK state pension even if they live overseas, because everybody over a certain age is entitled to a state pension if they've paid in.     

Why on earth should they not have fuel assistance if other people get it.  If you want it means tested for all, fair enough.  If you want to scrap it altogether, fair enough.  At the moment you want to apply to prejudices based around a lack of knowledge of weather overseas.

Kane was laughably bad, jogging for most of the game, always too tired to get to balls or make decent passes or crosses. Chadli did okay when he came on. Lamela was his usual sub-par self. Eriksen tried a few things but never took the attack on full. Dier was embarassingly bad. Soldado couldn't make things happen.

Davies was great. Fazio was great. Lloris, as per usual (save Chelski) was fucking phenomenal. 

It's not necessarily that we need with. We need players, I think Chadli and Eriksen are two of them, Kane can be when not tired as fuck, that take risks and put the ball toward goal.

If I have to endure another 90 minutes of ""Let's see how many times we can pass back to our centre backs!"" I'm going to lose it. 

I thought Bentaleb did okay. He has to, like it's in his fucking contract, make a shit shot when we have momentum late into the game, breaking the momentum apart and making himself look like a right git. But that's his prerogative, I guess. 

I do think we have to remember that CP were playing 10 men behind the ball for most of the game. Did you see how they lined up in the opening graphics? They were all in the back. They didn't play to win; they played to tie. 

I was going to say at least we didn't do that, but it seems we have no idea how to play against a team who just sits back. Our CBs throw long curlers into the box which our tiny forwards can't head in against the 6'5""-ers they have in the back.

* Coutinho is much less effective when he doesn't have Studge or someone running onto his long balls.  As a dribbler, I think Lallana is a better option.
* Sterling both doesn't get the fouls he deserves, yet also looks for too many cheap, niggly fouls.

Verdict: 6.5/10.  A decent performance.  We didn't do enough to win, but we looked solid and decent.

That is the idea, we are not a Moyes team any more that sets up exactly the same every game- and couldn't beat better teams because of it. It was unpredictability that led up to getting three points last season at places we hadn't barely picked one up for 10 years.

1. Why has the tactic changed so drastically from pressing high up to sitting back and waiting to regain possession? There was one moment in the 2nd half where there was a turnover high up the field and we looked so dangerous. Other than Suarez's work ethic, is there any other reason for not doing the hard pressing we did last year?

2. The front 3 or 4 have literally NO movement once we get in the final third. Once teams have set up, our attackers (usually Lambert, Sterling, Lallana, and one of the LB/RBs) just sit on the shoulder of their defensive line and don't move at all. So we shift the ball across our midfield bank of 3-4 from Henderson to Lucas to Coutinho to the RB/LB that isn't on the leading line. There's no movement so one of those four try to force a pass and it gets cut out. I would estimate this happens 75% of the time that defenses have time to set up (which is most of the time because we don't push on the counter anymore, see above).

Any ideas on tactical/stylistic rationale for either of these things? I just find it unfathomable that it could be Suarez because one of the things that made our pressing so effective was that we did it in 3's last year. Obviously I'll concede Balotelli will probably never do that, but Lambert and Lallana did that at Soton. Coutinho's pressing last year came along well. Henderson obviously presses well.

We don't have a problem at goalkeeper and we haven't since we dropped Gomes. To be honest, even when we had Gomes we didn't have a problem.

Our weaknesses at present are 1) lacking up front 2) lacking in width (self-imposed).

We look so different with natural wingers, our play down the right against Everton was breathtaking at times. Why we dropped that I don't know. The team would probably benefit from some games with Lamela as a natural left winger if we have to shoehorn him into the side out of form.

Otherwise Chadli as the inverted LW and Lennon as the natural RW preserves width and threat.

He's got his age on his side, though, so hopefully he'll learn what he needs to to become the player I believe he can be.

Also, at this point I don't think it's fair to say that Chadli's cooled off.  Remember that he's been injured and hasn't seen a full PL match since november 9th, after scoring in two straight matches against Stoke and Villa.

Hopefully Walker/Yedlin can create some extra width on the offence, seeing as Pochettino seems to insist on playing inverted wingers.  I suspect the lack of a proper pair of wingback types to stretch the opposition's back line is one of the reasons why the inverted wingers, and the team as a while, haven't been able to create what Pochettino wants them to.",0,1417886389,null,0,false,0,cmn0odj,t3_2ogx7e,t1_cmn0odj,t1_cmn07qu,null,1425572651,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Read the article. It does, it just won't apply to warmer countries. So my point stands.

&gt;You just did yourself by assuming ""if they don't live in cold weather"".
The UK doesn't have a monopoly on cold weather.

Oh christ, its not that hard. Thats why I used the word IF. IF a country is cold you WILL get the winter fuel allowance. How on earth does that imply that the UK is the only cold country?

Jesus, you have such bad reading comprehension I really don't see the point in continuing this conversation.

&gt;n accurate comparison would be pensions. They have paid into they system they get a UK state pension even if they live overseas, because everybody over a certain age is entitled to a state pension if they've paid in.

Yes, so they pay it based on age. Thats what its for, that is the criteria.

&gt; At the moment you want to apply to prejudices based around a lack of knowledge of weather overseas.

Again read the article. The new system relies on measuring average temperatures. I don't think its a perfect system but if you look, all I am agreeing with is the principle that the winter fuel allowance should only go to those in need, not just because they have paid tax as you are suggesting.

&gt;Twas a silly comparison and a heartless argument.

Fuck off. The summer was a huge opportunity to plug the holes our team had, and solidify top four. We've made a number of poor signings, and haven't addressed our main needs at all, and it's down in huge part to the manager. If we aren't top four at the end of this season with the poor start all the contenders have made, then he doesn't deserve to stay in the job. If we didn't spend 100m then ok. But we have, and it's a huge amount of money. The teams we are putting out are embarrassing after having spent that much.

This all stems from Rodgers taking the piss and talking shit. As someone else also said, if Rodgers can't ask more from his players after that performance, then he should resign so we an bring in someone who can, because that was a dreadful performance.

If your GP is advocating oral antibiotics, it's likely your acne is too severe for cosmetic products alone to be effective. IMO make another appointment to discuss prescription topicals: a retinoid, azelaic acid 15% or 20%, niacinamide 4% or some combination.

Alongside that maybe work on your diet and lifestyle choices, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Bear in mind they are minimums/ maximums and serving sizes nowhere near optimal nutrition. If you are already doing that maybe progress to an anti inflammatory, nutrient dense wholefood diet. /r/skindietandnutrition/ has some useful information.

I'm not familiar with the skincare products you have linked to and there no ingredients lists so difficult to comment. In general AHA and BHA products need to be at the correct acidic pH to  exfoliate. For your skin barrier (keeps water in, irritants and bacteria out) your cleansers should have gentle ingredients and be at an acidic pH.

I love how people use the old slippery slope no matter if they agree or disagree with anything. If you're pushing something then it's all about ""slippery slope is nonsense lol fallacy"". And then when people disagree it's ""oh noes slippery slopes is slippery!"".

Get a grip, and some logic. These sorts of arguments are meaningless drivel. If you don't have anything objective to say then don't bother.

Your comment basically suggests that most people against this bill are aware that there's nothing wrong with it but don't like it because of the supposed source.

Now there's another fallacy - even if it was pushed by Christians, and if they were really outraged or if it was all a show - that is all irrelevant too. Not everything Nazis did was wrong just because they were Nazis, etc. Again, be objective or you are saying nothing.

The way he went into the block isnt really typical of how Cahill does things...he seemed a bit off.

3. Willian being to complacent in the final third and not clinical enough with his chances....I think if anyone needs to take a step back its him....He's a workhorse but I slowly see his role being looked at the in the transfer market to really make Chelsea a world class team.

Now your critique is interesting because with 2 of your 3 points, there was no consistency between episodes for a sweeping statement to make sense.

With regards to your exception to the script, that could be a perfectly valid and cogent criticism, seeing as they were all written by Charlie Brooker. 

But with regards to the 'plotting' and acting, well it seems odd that you could tar all the episodes with the same critical brush. The acting criticism seems immediately odd as each of the 6 episodes featured a different cast of actors, so unless you're saying that they managed to miss-cast every episode, I would think that at least law of averages would mean that at least one episode would have people who act.

As for plotting, well each episode had a vastly different plot, with only the overarching theme of invasive technology. For example, take The National Anthem, the infamous 'pig fucking' episode. That episode is a very 'low tech' or even plausible episode. While I personally didn't enjoy the episode, I found it's message about spectator culture very powerful.

Compare that to 'White Bear', the second episode of season two. That episode is much more science fiction than The National Anthem. It's personally one of my favourite episodes for it's way that it took a detestable character and made me empathise with them, through the message about the focus on reparation and punishment on the criminal justice system over rehabilitation. It's a vastly different episode from The National Anthem in terms of both plausibility and message, with the only corollary being the sympathies with the lead, suffering character.

And finally, you have episodes like Fifteen Million Merits and The Waldo Moment, which are borderline surreal, but have similar themes about the corruption of a message in a system that is broken to the point of absurdity.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying your opinion is invalid or wrong, I'm just very intrigued about how you formed them

*Vitamin E Intense Moisture Cream with 24-hour moisturisation has been specifically developed to help protect and nourish your skin, leaving it incredibly soft, smooth and radiant.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I loved the Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser and to find a budget moisturiser to recommend.

**Your opinion:**  A lot of product for very little money and the multivitamin complex is pretty high on the ingredients list. The cream smells like coconut and texture is almost grainy in the tub, tho it goes on smoothly and is not greasy.

I don't get twenty four hour moisturisation from this, it is just not *intense* enough to handle my dry patches post microneedling. Overall not particularly impressed with this as a face moisturiser, might use it up as hand cream.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, glycerin, shea butter, dimethicone, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, ceteareth-20, propylene glycol, sodium polyacrylate, vitamin E, alcohol denat, PEG-35 castor oil, polysorbate 20, horse chestnut extract, retinyl palmitate, inositol, calcium pantothenate, linoleic acid, biotin, fragrance, pentylene glycol, sodium lactate, lactic acid, serine, urea, sorbitol, sodium chloride, allantoin, carbomer, potassium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, coumarin, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone.""*

false,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"The referee was totally shocking. But we can't just blame him. Once again Martinez got the tactics all wrong. We played our normal formation of 4-2-3-1 and it just goes to show how little faith he must have in McGeady or even Atsu when he uses a right back instead of a winger. I've said numerous times this season, Hibbert should struggle to make the bench never mind start in a huge game like this. Total joke really and in his starting basically nullified Coleman for most of the game. Distin is the same and is only in the team due to injury to others. I seen calls for Garbutt instead of Baines, I think that's a bit ludicrous honestly but he didn't play well in the last few games in fairness. 

Barry was shocking today and I thought the fact he wasn't taken off for Barkley and Besic was, was a total disgrace to say the least. Constantly misplacing passes or keeping possession too long. 

Mirallas shouldn't have been taken off but it's not like it was much of a difference seeing as it was left so late because obviously why would Martinez try to fix something that is broken? Eto'o looked like the only one who gave half a fuck and yeah didn't have the best game ever but he certainly can hang his head high for the effort. Honestly I can't fault Lukaku either due to the fact he wasn't getting anything for the whole game and had to cope with the little that he received. 

All in all these performances were the types at the start of the season and I thought we had sorted them out but apparently not. Martinez has been horrid with his subs this year and his backing of severely out of form or just not good enough players. Obviously I'm the ultimate pessimist but if this continues there'll have to be some serious spending in January.

*Hypo-allergenic: Because all skin can have sensitive moments all our products are hypo-allergenic so they are kind to even the most sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I had a voucher and as a comparison to CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion PM.

**Your opinion:** The texture of this moisturiser is creamy and silky and it has No.7's characteristic scent. The best thing about it is the attractive 'glass' jar, which I will be repurposing! The cream is very moisturising and easily lasts all day, but being too heavy handed can leave a shiny finish so not ideal under make up or night treatment oils. To be fair it's not formulated for that.

I will use up this jar but have no plans to repurchase even with another No.7 voucher. Not because this night cream is a poor product, but because NSPA and CeraVe represent better value for money and are a better fit for my routine.

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on BOGO half price offer

**Product claims:**

*""Vitamin E Nourishing Night Cream with 12 hour moisturisation has been specifically developed to help rehydrate and nourish your skin while you sleep leaving it feeling soft, smooth and looking radiant in the morning. Enriched with naturally sourced vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant which not only revitalises and protects the skin, it also helps combat the damaging effects of free radicals and shields it against the environment. The rich formula also contains a skin conditioning multi-vitamin complex comprising vitamins A. B, F and H, which combined with horse chestnut extract, helps to care for dry skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I loved the Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser and to find a budget moisturiser to recommend.

**Your opinion:** A lot of product for very little money, and the humectant complex is pretty high on the ingredients list. It is only faintly scented, despite fragrance being the seventh ingredient. The texture is a light silky cream that leaves a matte non greasy finish so should work under make up.

IMO this night cream is suitable for dry, normal, sensitive and combination skin types but not rich enough for the worst of winter weather. I will use up this tub but have no plans to repurchase because I prefer the richer texture of the NSPA Ultra Hydrate cream.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, glycerin, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, cetyl alcohol, shea butter, cyclomethicone, fragrance, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, vitamin E, pentylene glycol, sodium lactate, lactic acid, serine, urea, sorbitol, sodium chloride, allantoin, polysorbate 60, carbomer, alcohol denat, PEG-35 castor oil, polysorbate 20, horse chestnut extract, retinyl palmitate, inositol, calcium pantothenate, linoleic acid, biotin, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/ C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, disodium EDTA, coumarin, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben, propylparaben, isobutylparaben.""*

We lost the match in the first half I think because we were playing against the ref. One blatant red, one questionable red... especially since the ref gave a pen on one of the softest challenges of the match. 

We made stupid mistakes and didn't capitalise on opportunities like we needed to. 

Some positives though:  
We played much better than we have these last two games.  
Barkley actually played well I think when he came on. Apart from him hitting the deck far too easily and some extremely dodgy handling and passing.  
Thought we were gonna get a Hibbo goal for a minute there and got some dodgy looks from the rest of the pub when I yelled (sole Everton fan is hard sometimes but I'll live).  
I was really happy with Baines today. He came across from the left a few times to mop up what the people on the right should have been doing.   
Mirallas did well too I think, apart from some dodgy passing.  
I do think we played well we just made too many little mistakes and didn't get the goal we needed. (Brilliant shot from Lukaku though and an unfortunately brilliant save from Hart)

I don't think Coleman had a good game today and nor did Barry.

Sadly yes it is .. please dont mention that it 'fights' for mens rights whilst it simultaneously ridicules masculinity .. or that it wants to challenge the constraint of gender whilst again simultaneously using the idea of man as the basis of female 'oppression'. When feminism had close links in the early years with liberal ideas of equality (see late 1800 U.S debates about voting) the idea of man and woman as similar was central to thought. Now feminism is adopting the animal farm scenario 'Some are more equal than others' and its females who possess this.

Furthermore, when women challenge this modern idea of feminism they are shouted down by much of feminism and/or accused of being a 'double agent' for patriarchal concepts. For example. Baroness Kennedy is a most awesome woman who has challenged the under valuing of the female criminal, especially the female sex offender. She notes how too much propaganda surrounds the sex offender and because they are deemed as atypically male gendered, the female offenders do not receive an equal level of punishment. 

Its issues like these that encourage the negative view of feminism. It fails to encapsulate all women (including those sex offenders for example) because it places too much value on woman as victim and man as reason for victimhood.

**Price of product:** ¬£4 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Exclusive to Asda, two for ¬£8 offer

**Product claims:** *""Apply before bed and let this rich and soothing cocktail of active ingredients nourish and strengthen your skin while you sleep. The cream contains ceramides to help repair skin and a combination of ginseng, natural vitamin E and sweet almond oil to replenish a tired complexion.*

*Dermatologically approved. Suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am impressed by the ingredients list, and as a comparison to CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion PM.

**Your opinion:** This cream is pale peach in colour and has a fruity-floral fragrance. It has a [dense balmy texture] (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a6TaE0S8u-I/UemSUMla2ZI/AAAAAAAABHI/NOgMArkRbMM/s1600/DSCN5266.JPG) which 'melts' onto the skin leaving a silky feeling yet matte finish. It is very moisturising and easily lasts all day, perhaps better for normal to very dry skin types than oily and for autumn through spring rather than the height of summer.

I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used on inflamed skin after microneedling. Despite testing other moisturisers I came back to this NSPA cream again and again until the pot was empty. This moisturiser is holy grail for me and I have now repurchased for winter use.

**Where did you purchase:** Exclusive to Asda, two for ¬£8 offer

**Product claims:** *""An ultra-hydrating cream developing to relieve dry skin, leaving it soft and smooth. Perfect to use when the changing weather can drain the skin‚Äôs moisture or when skin experiences dry patches. This light cream with ginseng and protecting vitamin E and pro-vitamin B5 will leave long lasting hydration without any oily residue.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am impressed by the ingredients list, and as a comparison to Eucerin Replenishing Cream 5% urea.

**Your opinion:** This cream is white in colour and has a very faint fruity-floral fragrance. The texture is a rich silky cream that leaves a satin rather than a matte finish. It is very moisturising and easily lasts all day, perhaps better for men and for night rather than under make up and for normal to very dry skin types than oily.

I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used on inflamed skin after microneedling. I really like this moisturiser and have now repurchased.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, propylene glycol, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, dimethicone, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, shea butter, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, cetyl alcohol,  cetearyl glucoside, fragrance, neroli flower oil, betaine, panthenol, allantoin, avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, pentylene glycol, sodium lactate, lactic acid, serine, urea, sorbitol, sodium chloride, panax ginseng root extract, DMDM hydantoin, glyceryl acrylate/ acrylic acid copolymer, polyacrylamide, C13-14 isoparaffin, laureth-7, alcohol denat., PEG-35 castor oil, polysorbate 20, horse chestnut extract, retinyl palmitate, vitamin E, inositol, calcium pantothenate, linoleic acid, biotin, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, linalool, alpha-isomethyl ionone, limonene.*""

The acting wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. As I went to film school, I'm probably far more critical than most. There was something not quite right between the direction, the writing and acting.

If I had taken notes at the time then I'd probably be able to better engage with you on what I didn't like. I basically didn't find the drama compelling or convincing.

Hehe. Sure thing. There's a lot of problems with arguments that are based on ""just logic"" - in other words, nothing.

As for your link... who are you arguing for? You're making a really good case for me; thank you for that. Dearest 05banks is complaining about not having enough jobs. You are demonstrating there ARE jobs. Plenty of them. If 05Banks is right, and there's such a desperation for work, even true-blooded Brits would jump on these jobs. The fact is, they don't. They prefer their benefits; which is NOT the immigrants' fault. It's the fault of the system that creates incentives for Britons to stay home, and live off benefits. The immigrants, on the other hand, take these jobs, and are productive. You can't expect high wages for shit jobs. So don't complain if other people take those shit jobs you can't be bothered to take. 

(You really should be careful with what you wish for; remember few years ago in the US where the fruit rotted in the fields because no Americans took the jobs the ILLEGAL immigrants were doing before they were chased away? Who's gonna clean up the crap after you?)
 
As for who pays how much for what -you are again getting into the whole lalaland. (The article was not the data I asked for, though. And don't make me open the Telegraph again, please. It makes me feel dirty.)

So two things:

1. You have unsubstantiated theories without any basis at all. I guess you say the same about doctors, nurses, or -biologists, right? You have ABSOLUTELY NO basis what you base your arguments on, and as I said ""logic"" is not enough on itself. 


2. You can't tell a private company how much they should pay. It's as simple as that. This is the neoliberal dreamworld you have created, and are forcing on the rest of the globe; you will have to live with it. They pay as much as they decide to pay in a free market. IF you don't like it, join the communist party, have a revolution, execute the royals, and found the Cheka. It worked out real well before; I'm sure it will work out splendidly this time as well.

* We don't mind the cheap food and goods but we rage at even the hint of a piece of legislation we don't like that, in reality, most people don't notice once passed.

* We cavort about Europe getting fucked up in Amsterdam or setting up little British Ghettos where we don't bother to work or integrate but we rage at even the idea of people from other countries coming to work, at least the poles fucking integrate.

* We've been underpaying for years but when this is pointed out we go throw a hissyfit.

* We complain about being 'poor and helpless' against Europe when in reality it's because our MEPs spend their time either sitting on their hands or playing to the gallery (AKA YouTube).

* We're constantly wanting more and more exceptions to EU stuff whilst taking full advantage of everything good we like about Europe ourselves.

* We're openly racist, running a campaign in romania saying ""You're not welcome here"" and as a result, getting fewer Romanian but only because people in Romania think we're racist assholes.

&gt;Bahrain under the Al-Khalifa regime claims to be a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy) headed by the [King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Bahrain), [Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamad_bin_Isa_Al_Khalifah); however, given its dictatorial oppression, lack of parliamentary power and lack of an independent judiciary, most observers assert that Bahrain is an absolute monarchy. King Hamad enjoys wide executive authorities which include appointing the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bahrain) and his [ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Bahrain), commanding the [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_Defence_Force), chairing the [Higher Judicial Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Bahrain), appointing the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Bahrain)'s [upper half](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_Council_of_Bahrain) and dissolving its elected [lower half](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Bahrain).  (p15) The head of government is the unelected Prime Minister, [Shaikh Khalƒ´fa bin Salman Al Khalifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifah_bin_Salman_Al_Khalifa), the uncle of the current king who has served in this position since 1971, making him the longest serving prime minister in the world.  In 2010, about half of the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Bahrain) was composed of [Al Khalifa family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Khalifa_family).

From the top of my head:


The French NT problems (a large stint) Most recently the controversy for not being called to Brazil WC. His GF didn't help either he called publicly Deschamps a shit manager (""Fuck france and fuck deschamps! What a shit manager"" notice the fuck france bit, not cool, one could argue that Nasri's GF doesn't represent Samir, but he did nothing to cool the situation)
After that, he quit NT (after not being called of course). He said French NT is not worth his family suffering. He blamed, the media, the manager and even his teammates (press said that some teammates didn't want him on the French NT, Nasri believed the press and said that he doesn't want to share the lockeroom with teammates that can't talk to him directly. Not cool. (I think he has some fair points, French media was a bitch with him, and his family was harassed -again, after his GF episode, no surprises here- but he could've worded it better.

With Arsenal he has repeatedly insulted the fans and the club alike. To be fair, Arsenal fans harassed him pretty badly when he moved to city. When he won the title at city with Mancini he said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""People at Arsenal tried to make out that I came here for the money, I hope they are watching me now, collecting my Premier League winner‚Äôs medal. I believe they have not won a trophy for many years now.""

Of course what he said I think is no lie and It's a fair point. But you have to know better, you have to be better. Not saying that footballers need to be role models, but just don't be a dick.

TL:DR If 1% of Samir talent could be swapped into speak his thoughts in a less confrontational manner and more judgement, specially when you are dealing with shitty press that will do anything to grab a headline.

&gt;The __Life in the United Kingdom test__ is a computer-based test constituting one of the requirements for anyone seeking [Indefinite Leave to Remain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_Leave_to_Remain) in the UK or [naturalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalisation) as a [British citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law). It is meant to prove that the applicant has a sufficient knowledge of British life and sufficient proficiency in the English language. The test is a requirement under the [Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality,_Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_2002). It consists of 24 questions covering topics such as British society, government, everyday life and employment. It has been criticised for containing factual errors,  expecting candidates to know information that would not be expected of native-born citizens  as well as being just a ""bad pub quiz"" and ""unfit for purpose"".

AQA science is amazing. I really enjoyed the course (and so I'm doing A level science too). I think that AQA really is an amazing board to do that, and I feel the same in A level (A level biology with AQA is a lot better than OCR chemistry or Edexcel physics). In AQA, they'll **always** ask a [6 mark question](http://i.imgur.com/inIPZQt.png). This one was from when I took it in Year 10, and honestly, I almost had an orgasm when I saw this. I was so happy. They even tell you how to get the marks**!!!!!** What I would do is always write out things for different topics as though I'd get a 6 mark question on them (such as things about homeostasis, namely sugar control). This gives you a thorough understanding of the topic - and also makes you prepared, should there be a 6 mark question on it. 

*Further additional*, I'm assuming you're doing the B3, C3 and P3 courses for biology, chemistry &amp; physics?

He put in some great crosses but he also didn't whip them in for the sake of it; he often played it back to the middle which allowed us to keep possession. Keeping possession is a key-facet of Pellegrini's game, and Kolarov can be at times too one-dimensional. Navas can be guilty of this at times too, which is why I though Clichy's creative intelligence was a nice tonic. 

From a defensive POV, Having two fullbacks bomb forward exposes our CB's. I dont think its any coincidence we've looked more assured defensively. Clichy's pace, and today his tackling, gave the side balance.

He or she will ensure you are fulfilling the 20 conditions (you'll find them on the DofE website) and also ask you questions about map reading etc.. They will usually visit your campsite in the evening as well, just to ensure that you're able to look after yourself and are respecting the environment. Often with gold, you'll be expected to do at least one wild camp away from campsites and other civilisation.

You'll be walking at least 20km per day over 4 days in usually quite hilly terrain, carrying a full exped rucksack, so you do need to be relatively fit. It is possible if you aren't, but you'll be arriving in camp in the dark and you won't enjoy it as much. The most fun part is just being out in the wild away from your day-to-day responsibilities and enjoying the company of your friends. 

You also need to think of an aim for your expedition - which could be anything, really. Some people look at things like the impact of tourism or farming, others might do photo journals or create camping cookbooks etc..

&gt; But the owner is often at risk of losing a great deal more - remember, he's often personally liable for tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands, maybe his home, because lenders require personal guarantees from directors for loans to small businesses.

You're not wrong, but you're the only person talking about very small businesses. Once these initial loans are repaid and the business is profitable and has equity, then the balance shifts massively. The owner is now in control of a significant amount of capital with no personal liability and with the supposed right to take dividends off the top while his employees sacrifice significant amounts to tax.

I agree the safety of the performers is a genuine concern. However, the BBFCs current regulations are so ridiculous that it's difficult to imagine they should ever be trusted to carry out that role. 

One of the things I found strangest about their regulation is that the biggest risk to performers is from sex without condoms, even when regular health checks are carried. But despite having ridiculously strict regulations, their mindset seemed so behind the times that this didn't seem to be on their radar. Instead they were more concerned with fully-clothed woman doing a bit of spanking or facesitting and a completely inconsistent ban on female ejaculation.

As for being taken seriously, the first series especially surely wasn't written to be taken entirely seriously. The PM fucking a pig? That's not exactly cutting edge, sitting on the edge of your seat drama. 

To me the show is as much a satire or dark comedy on the problems people face/perceive they face, and an opportunity to play with them problems with a bit of a humour (yet equally depressing on occasion) as much as it is a drama.

The people I was referring to seemed to think the PM fucking a pig wasn't supposed to be an utterly ridiculous storyline, and as a result the overlooked the actual point the show was putting across.

As for your point about party functionality, as far as I'm concerned this should NOT be something that requires a monthly subscription. Paying for online multiplayer/voice chat, on top of your purchase of a game, is not something which appeals to me.

The second was not his FAULT. This goal could have been prevented if IVANOVIC was there to help on the wings, rather than having Cahill out there on his own, trying to defend 2 players. 
The hate that cahill is getting on this subreddit is absolutely ridiculous, a couple of bad games has changed people view from 'future club captain' to 'benchwarmer'. 

I see that the main fault of this game is that mourinho did not rotate the goddamn squad. We have a large squad, why dont we use it? Hazard, oscar, willian all felt sluggish out there, and I don't blame them, they've been playing their asses of Chelsea. But why not give a run for luis who adds a different attacking dimension?

**Price of product:** ¬£8 for 75ml tub

**Where did you purchase:** Amazon

**Product claims:**

*""Eucerin Replenishing Cream 5% Urea plus Carnitine is designed specifically to give intensive moisturisation to dry, rough, chapped and scaly patches of skin. It is enriched with two of the skin‚Äôs own moisturisers, urea and lactate, to help restore the skin‚Äôs natural moisture balance. It also contains carnitine to strengthen the skin‚Äôs natural barrier and protect it from further moisture-loss. It is an ideal product for problem areas such as elbows and knees.*

*CLINICAL STUDIES*

*Eucerin Replenishing Cream 5% Urea plus Carnitine was assessed in a two-week dermatology study with 33 people who have problematic dry skin.*

*MAIN FINDINGS*

- *In 93% of cases the skin condition was considerably improved.*

- *96% of physicians approved the product as being suitable to recommend to a patient for dry skin.*

- *Patients also agreed the cream ‚Äúprovides long-lasting moisture‚Äù, ‚Äúreduces tension‚Äù and is ‚Äúsuitable for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased having read that dry and eczematous skin is deficient in urea.

**Your opinion:** This moisturiser has a rich silky consistency but is not as thick as the NSPA moisturisers. I used it daily after switching from the lightweight Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream and went through at least three tubs. The cream is very moisturising and easily lasts all day, but being too heavy handed can leave a shiny finish so not ideal under make up or night treatment oils. 

A solid option for those with very dry or eczematous skin who want to avoid fragrance.

**Price of product:** ¬£10 for 50ml tube

**Where did you purchase:** Amazon

**Product claims:**

*""Eucerin Smoothing Face Creme 5% Urea is a light and gentle everyday moisturiser for dry to very dry skin. Enriched with urea and lactate, two naturally occurring compounds that bind in moisture, it instantly hydrates dry facial skin, reducing the feeling of tightness to give it a smooth and supple feel. Rough skin is usually caused by a lack of moisture, Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream 5% Urea reduces this roughness by maintaining skin hydration. It is ideal for use under make-up or after shaving.*

*CLINICAL STUDIES*

*Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream 5% Urea was tested by 24 people with healthy skin. Moisturisation and skin roughness were the core areas for assessment.*

*MAIN FINDINGS*

- *Significantly increased skin moisturisation within 1 week*

- *Significantly reduced skin roughness within 1 week.*

- *No adverse effects were notice.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased having read that dry and eczematous skin is deficient in urea.

**Your opinion:** This moisturiser has a lightweight lotion consistency, and a little goes a long way. I used it daily when I was still dealing with combination skin, and found it eliminated flaking on the nose without appearing to worsen clogging. As my skin became older and drier I switched to the richer Eucerin Replenishing Cream.

A good option for those with combination, normal or dehydrated skin who want to avoid fragrance or fatty alcohols (only one present).

false,RealPool,lfc99,,"I don't get all the hate Brendan is getting here. He clearly doesn't fancy Balotelli, didn't want him in the first place hence in comments before the AC Milan friendly game. 

It's his head on the chopping block if the team does not do well but he feels like he didn't get the right tools in the summer to do his job right. Balotelli got a fair crack of the whip in our team and he was average at best.

Liverpool as a club have problem when it comes to Strikers and most of it is the creation of the committee. 

* We have 2 very immobile strikers who become very useless when they are alone up front (Lambert can at least hold the ball up properly), those 2 can't play together, because of no pace. 
* Then we have Borini who can run all day long but can't score to save his life.
* Then we have a world class striker in Sturridge who we can't trust to go 3 months without getting injured.
* Then we have 2 strikers (Aspas and Alberto) out on loan who were bought by committee thinking they would be good moneyball signings but they didn't look good at all.
* Origi looks decent but he can't be used this season anyway.

So after all this I can understand that Brendan feels frustrated that all his work from last year in setting team up to play fast transition football is going to waste because we don't have decent cover for Sturridge. 

We can all disagree on how he is treating Balotelli, but we also have to feel Brendan's pain, he does not want to be the guy to get Balotelli back in line, he wanted to stay away from it as much as possible, then Balotelli was thrown in his lap saying, go on, make him a world class player, unlock the potential.

false,mishagale,null,null,"I don't know what the requirements are for foreign students, since universities in England &amp; Wales usually give their requirements in terms of A-level grades, rather than a percentage. Usually, English/Welsh students (Scots do ""Highers"" not A-Levels and also start University at 17 rather than 18) take three A-Level courses and 1 or 2 AS-Levels (which is equivalent to half an A-Level, AS is a 1-year course whereas A is 2.) To get a grade A in an A-Level you need to score a combined 80%+ on your exams and coursework, 70% is a B, 60% is a C and so on with &lt;40% being a fail.

Universities set entry requirements for their courses according to both demand and the quality of students they want to attract. So for the most popular or most prestigious universities/degrees, the requirements are usually AAA or AAB. Unfortunately, in order for government to claim that standards in education are improving, the exams are getting easier every year, so that many universities have more AAA applicants than they have course places, and need to find other ways to differentiate the candidates. However, since government also strenuously denies that exams are getting easier, they can't start taking foreign students whose grades are lower than the equivalent British grades just because they had a more challenging curriculum, because we need to keep up the fiction that our curriculum is as rigorous as ever.

However, there are a number of less-prestigious universities which will accept lower grades, such as BBC.

Students will apply to up to 6 universities before they take their exams. Usual practice is to apply to at least one university with low entry-requirements in case you don't get the grades you are hoping for. The other alternative is to go through a process called ""clearing"" after the results come out. If a university has been unable to fill all the places on a course, it will make the spare places available to clearing students, usually taking those with the best available grades, even though those grades would be below what is normally required.",0,1417919221,null,0,false,0,cmnflf6,t3_2oifaf,t1_cmnflf6,t3_2oifaf,null,1425565565,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Anyone think he might be a little dangerous for football, period?  Wonder what Pellegrini had to say about that, or if any retrospective action will be taken.  Won't help us of course, though.  All that being said, the performance was a hell of a lot better than the last two, and hopefully we'll be charged up for the QPR game.

This by the way is the reason almost all of us should object to this. Unless your job has no human interaction then all of us could be replaced by someone younger and prettier and doing so would make the business more money. Bus driver? Blond woman with big boobs would have them queuing round the block for the Number 47. Financial adviser? ""what a nice young man"" say all the old ladies, fondly. Any economically rational business should logically hire more attractive people if they can get them for the same cost and if other qualities are equal.

This is a genuine social ill if it were allowed - people are already judgmental enough about other people's looks. Teenage girls often suffer eating disorders etc.

It threatens all of us. Even the young and pretty will one day no longer be young nor pretty and their livelihoods should not depend on that.

It's currently illegal to discriminate based on looks. (Well not precisely but you can't lawfully discriminate on age, race or gender so you can't legally recruit for ""blonds with big tits."") While it's a law often worked around it's still an important law and an important principle.

The way he approached the 1v1 was with the intent of making himself large and staying up as to not have the ball dinked over him like you have seen so many times before: see [here](http://balls.ie/football/gif-nanis-brilliant-dink-over-petr-cech/)

Courtois is exceptional on crosses, while Cech is positively dreadful. Which, when teams decide to smash long balls into the box, is actually rather useful. Additionally, Cech and Courtois have the same goalkeeper coach so I'm not sure the criticism there.

I assume the not catching it clean comment is directed towards the fact that he pats many shots down before catching it. Although I personally am not a fan, if thats how he see's fit to take the sting out of a shot and make sure he doesn't fumble the rebound UNCONTROLLABLY (it is currently in his control) then I have no complaints. 

Now addressing ""having Cahill's back"", I'm really not sure what you see he could've done differently... A deflected cross where it was delfected maybe 6 yards in front of him with pace? Not sure how he's supposed to deal with that. The second he cuts the angle and stops a clean breakaway and forces him to square it after a poor touch. Unless you expect him to grow from 6 foot 7 or whatever to 8 foot 11 I'm not sure how you expect him to get back and save that. 

The only qualm with Courtois is his distribution, it's probably not as good as it should be. HOWEVER, Cech is no Neuer either.

So no, I'm not too surprised. Seems like The Doctor has been getting better with navigating the TARDIS for a while now.

My own pet theory is that the shorter the jump (in space *and* time) the easier it is, and the more precisely he can perform it. For instance, jumping about an hour into the future without changing location (Kill The Moon) is not hard at all. Jumping exactly one year ahead and staying in the same spot, likewise fairly easy.

[SPOILER!](#s ""The TARDIS is a living creature (has a living consciousness at its core) and it does this on purpose."")

The episode is named ""The Doctor's Wife"" and was written by Neil Gaiman, which means it's a bit more fanciful/fairy-tale then some of the other episodes. Personally, I liked it very much.  However, you need to know Amy and Rory fairly well before watching it to get the full impact of some of the scenes.

&gt; The Doctor is ~2000 years old, and could easily live to be double that. Even if he had a relationship that lasted, say, 50 years, that would be like 2.5% of his current life span. It's virtually a blink of the eye, and he would watch that person get old and die in a short amount of time. He has a problem with that, and avoids it when possible.

false,Chukter,null,null,"I done my gold through the cadets so i think we walked a bit longer than the normal gold and it also counted towards my volunteering with the marching up and down the square. 

I also took shooting as a skill to improve so that was awesome and the school had an armory. In my expedition, the actual one not the training ones, we walked the Scottish highlands in the Grampian mountain range for three days with exceptional weather(none of that four day crap but that's the army cadets for you). The trip would have been a calamity if it was otherwise, if you have been camping over night in the highlands you will understand how rapidly the weather can change from sunny summer to kill you in ten minutes snow and sleet.

We had a single supervisor whom ghosted us at a distance of a couple of miles whom would catch up to us and ask us questions on map reading,basic survival and generally ask us how we were coping when we took lunch or camped. This only happened twice, once at the start and near the end of the trip. apart from that the six of us were on our own. Note that at the end of the trip they will quiz you (well they quizzed us) on everything you have learned do not get this wrong.

Total distance was around 85km or about 52-55 miles over rough mountainous terrain with no paths and lots of heather (small entrapping little bastard of a plant about ankle level...wear very good boots). However the scenery more than made up for the slog.


When they say relatively fit they mean a good level of fitness actually. I don't think i could do the same expedition in my current state without a couple of weeks fitness training in the gym to get myself back up to peak condition (uni life is like that you know beer carbs and all).


Only advice i can offer to make it as enjoyable as possible is these 
points.


1. Get a good pair of boots and wear them constantly weeks before hand to wear them in so you get as little blisters as possible.(we had a guy ,not in our group mind you and his one failed,who had blood smeared up his entire heel)


2.Be as minimalist as possible. Small stove,one mess tin,one spoon one change of clothes and two pairs of socks. You will not need two hats and two pairs of gloves ect. In fact you will most likely be in the same clothes for three days.(you will need a survival bag, thats the bright orange things, as a girl fell in the river on my silver and was prevented from freezing to death in -10 temperatures due to foresight to bring the bag.)


3.Get good food as light as possible and boil in the bag and some sort of powdered lucazade/energy.


4.make sure your tent is light, preferably get a two man to share the load frodo....


5.Mosquito nets for the head and arms. you will look an idiot until the blood suckers and ticks eat the rest of the group alive.


6.Dont fek about with water bottles, get a camel pack or something similar as it doubles as a pillow/ice pack and folds down when not in use.


7.Invest in a good waterproof jacket and trousers. I cannot stress this enough.


8.Aquire 1 thermos mug and many packs of blister plasters.


9.Chocolate! chocolate! chocolate and more f*ing chocolate!


10. do not go on the expedition with close friends. they will no longer be close after. Take people you usually do not hang out with as they will then become new friends after wards through shared agonies.


11. Take time to enjoy the scenery, leave the campsite at like 5 in the morning then you will reach your campsite before dinner time and be able to pitch your tent and just enjoy the wilderness and hang out for hours.


12. Take lots of pictures. bring a phone in case of emergencies (do not switch it on unless someone is injured).",0,1417929789,null,0,false,0,cmnkcfn,t3_2oi35l,t1_cmnkcfn,t3_2oi35l,null,1425563349,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

false,lepusfelix,null,null,"&gt;  they're not flashing their titties about

Personally I wouldn't flinch even if they were. There's a huge difference between getting them out to feed the kid(s) and getting them out to attract attention. Sure, discretion is always advisable, but I see no problem whatsoever if it's not used. I would perhaps not react so well to the mother pulling out a loudhailer and yelling 'I'm getting my tits out now!' through it and waving a placard. But hell with it, even if they remove a shirt and expose both breasts to feed one child, women usually do so in a way that needn't be the focus of my attention. Fair enough, that's not so discreet, but at the same time it's not for everyone else to stare at and be all disapproving about. Giving attention isn't the same as attracting attention, so just because you happen to see a breast, it doesn't mean that breast is being forced in your face.

I enjoy looking at breasts, but I have the common courtesy to not be invasive about it. If I walk into a woman's bedroom (which admittedly is never) and she's changing, I avert my eyes and get out. I don't rant at her about how she should lock the door or just never be naked. If I see boobs at a nudist beach, I'm not expected to look away, but then again, it's respectful to not pay too much attention to the surrounding nudity at one of those places. Just people being people... without clothes.

If I see a topless man walking down the street in the middle of Summer, that's usually quite offensive to my eyes. Yet I don't take it upon myself to give him a sermon about how flesh is evil, or whatever. I just choose to look at something else instead. My prerogative to kindly keep my own business to myself and not go into a hissy fit about other people's bodies. So by all means, ladies, bare your breasts while you feed your children. The only breasts I'll be looking at are the ones that are printed in the Sun, my partner's, and some sly glances at some fully clothed ones in public. I'm not going to stand and ogle you, because that's just invasive and rude, and I'm certainly not going to tell you off for having the audacity to be a loving mother in public. Cover up or not, that's between you and your baby, but all the excessive and unwelcome attention breastfeeders get amounts to sexual harrassment, in my opinion, because it's harrassment (unwanted attention) based on sexual grounds (the person committing it generally tends to see breasts as sexual objects, and justifies all these 'decency' arguments based on that).

EDIT:

I think it's quite funny really.

If a woman wears tight denim shorts and a tank top, nobody cares except for the guy who rapes her. That's his fault that he was somehow affected by the woman's appearance and didn't control himself.

If a woman doesn't dress provocatively, and gets a breast out to feed her baby with, the world goes up in arms because they're somehow affected by her appearance and don't control themselves... yet that's somehow acceptable.

It's the same invasion on somebody's right to be their own private person in a public space without intervention from other people based solely on the appearance of visible flesh, in my opinion.",0,1417930085,null,0,1417932040,0,cmnkgmx,t3_2ogo36,t1_cmnkgmx,t1_cmmybqc,null,1425563294,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Dipshits like you have been slagging Lucas for a couple of years with no understanding of what role a D-Mid performs in front of the back four. ""He sucks and should be sold"" or ""Bye Levia, enjoy Italy"" isn't a critique or a suggestion he needs to play better. He is the same player he was two months ago when he was second on the depth chart behind Gerrard, who just happens to be one of the best players in the history of the club. You don't go from being utter crap to one of the best D-Mids in the league. Short sighted and swept up in pissing on a very good player is the standard for this sub and it is losing knowledgeable posters because it has just grown tiresome.

Though not as a matter of staying outside a mosque waiting for my baby to get hungry so I can do so. But if I was female and a mother, I would feed my baby as soon as feeding was demanded, regardless of where I was. I would have no business being inside a mosque at all, because I'm not religious, never mind a Muslim, but outside is still a public place, and I would challenge anyone who gave me a hard time over it.

Speaking of Muslims, mosques and breastfeeding, I'm pretty sure Muslim women in the Middle East breastfeed.. I just can't imagine formula milk being a thing there. I could be wrong of course.

Though honestly, given the way women are subjugated in general in Islam (not so much in Muslim communities over here, but it still happens), I don't really see where following the Muslim example is going to get us anywhere, so this really wasn't much of an argument.

That's like saying 'You think we kill Jews? Go look up Hitler'.. killing people is still wrong, no matter what religion or how many. Just because someone else might have a bigger problem with something than you do, doesn't make your problem justified. Also just because a few Muslims in a few places have XX stance on something, that doesn't mean all Muslims do. If terrorism was really a Muslim thing, I wouldn't have survived school, because most of the pupils there were Muslims. They weren't secretly plotting to destroy me, they were just studying, like me. 100% of the Muslims I've met in life aren't actively trying to make bombs and kill people, they just want to live their lives.",0,1417932731,null,0,1417932931,0,cmnli56,t3_2ogo36,t1_cmnli56,t1_cmn1a03,null,1425562808,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

false,[deleted],null,null,"It seems like one, superficially. I upvoted his first post, because that actually was a good point. The poster is saying that there is *no such thing* as a terrorist organisation and that they are indistinguishable from a standing army of any government.

The main difference is rules of engagement (it's perfectly possible for an official government army to be terrorist - such as in Syria, right now). In the British Army, it is illegal to target civilians. A terrorist organisation deliberately targets civilians, by definition. Terrorists are military organisations whose aims include instilling terror in a civilian population by means of violence against them.

Has the British Army every targeted civilians? Yes. Sometimes within its own rules of engagement (Boer War, concentration camps, Kenya, India.. many times). Most recently, the RAF bombed the crap out of German civilians in an act of very dubious morality - but within the law at that time.

If today the British Army deliberately targeted civilians,  it'd be breaking the law. This has happened recently, in Iraq. And where it comes out, those involved are punished. One can argue quite strongly that investigations are not thorough enough, and that cover-ups occur. I'd agree. But that logic doesn't extend to ""joining the British Army is no different than joining ISIS"".

I can't see ISIS prosecuting their members for torturing or killing civilians: they are actively encouraged to do so.

The poster *must know* that there are differences. They have simply redefined the words to suit their own definition of ""all war is terrorism"". Which is a highly idealised stance but not practically applicable anywhere in the world at any point in history to date.

When I realised that the poster was basically just deliberately and obtusely redefining words to correct their bad logic, I felt it not worth engaging any more.

Overtly or not, it makes me a little uncomfortable, since I'm a red-blooded male and naturally I like looking at breasts. However, I'm also a bit chivalrous, and make every effort to respect a woman's privacy, which yes... *does* mean I should try to look 'anywhere but there' if I see breastfeeding happening.

And yes... It's that bad for me that even if I know there's nothing I could possibly actually see, I still won't look. I guess it comes from the social phobia and knowing what it's like to be extremely uncomfortable with being looked at. I can only imagine the experience is similar for a breastfeeding woman.

Do a bit of research on the EU and you'll soon find out that freedom of movement of people, as well as goods and services, within the EU is one of the fundamental policies of the organisation; it's a bit like saying Quebec should limit the number of people coming from Ontario.

The reality of the situation is a bit more complicated than that; migration within the EU is often people from newer, Eastern European member states moving to older and more economically stable member states, with all the associated arguments of economic migration.  The Conservative Party are also traditionally quite anti-EU and favour international relations with other countries, particularly the USA, so I suspect that plays into it; that's a situation that could even possibly turn out to be favourable to a Canadian citizen.  It's not IMO likely, but it's possible.

Also, I may be making a few assumptions here, but, if not now then by the time you move:  English is presumably your first language, and I should imagine you have a good standard of education, and likely some experience in your chosen career, as well as a proven work ethic.  The voter-pleasing policies are ones that reduce the number of immigrants with a poor grasp of our language and culture who come over here in the hope of taking advantage of our welfare, education, and healthcare systems.  I'm not saying people like you won't be the victims of collateral damage as a result of anti-immigration policies, but you're not the target of them.

If you're serious about moving here, work on your education (if you don't have a degree, get one) and career and save some money, learn about our culture and figure out why you really want to be here.

I absolutely agree that Skrtel is lucky to have kept getting chances over and over again, but him staying fit whilst Toure, Agger and Sakho have had injury problems has played it's part, in that sense he's reliable. He's also lucky to have escaped the critism/borderline abuse that Lovren is getting but that's what the lack of expectation and a ¬£20m price tag will do. I read a lot that Skrtel isn't a leader and needs someone who is beside him, but he really should be trying to step up and take charge as he's the oldest (29), most experienced and well versed with the style of play Rodgers wants in the back line.
Clearly some of the problem is the system as Skrtel and Johnson were both part of one of the best defences in the league (2008/09) and are now both part of one of the worst in the league. But what we've seen recently is Skrtel plays with Toure, and Toure becomes a clown to the point of ironic hero status. Skrtel plays with Sakho, and Sakho becomes a clumsy waste of ¬£17m. Skrtel plays with Lovren, and Lovren becomes the ""worst defender I've ever seen in a Liverpool shirt"". Our defence has been bad for a long period of time and whilst we've seen different set-ups along with personel changed around him, Skrtel has been a constant. I'd just like to see an extended run without him to see if anything changes.

____

All in all and for the long run, I'd like to see Lovren and Sakho as a pair, with Lucas sat in front of them. If the changes in the defence work but don't help Mignolet's confidence and performances improve, we should look for a more commanding Goalkeeper with a better physical presence.",0,1417950966,null,0,1417951857,0,cmnpvu9,t3_2oibqb,t1_cmnpvu9,t3_2oibqb,null,1425560638,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

When I had my CBR400RR, I crashed it after 2 months of owning it- at 60mph into a crash barrier. I really messed myself up doing that. I separated my shoulder, and did some nasty damage to my nerves as well. 

Recovery can suck, but always keep faith. When you get to the stage of having physiotherapy, do it, and work on those exercises as much as you can. 

At the time of my accident, I was told that I may never regain the ability to raise my right arm; yet here I am a year and a half later with no noticeable after effects. 

Getting back on a bike after something like that is hard; I broke into tears the first time I tried riding again- but you'll learn to love it even more.

The accident doesn't sound like it's your fault- so sue the living shit out of them. Get a good lawyer, and make sure you get physiotherapy 4 or 5 days a week, all at their expense.

Let me teach you something about discussions, your not going to convince anyone if you start your comments with insults. 

&gt; Being well trained doesn't really matter at all in this discussion, does it?

I think its a big difference, are soldiers are trained to limit the damaged caused, they are trained to use weaponry to make precised attacks on enemy strong hold to maximize enemy causalities, but minimize civilian ones. When things go wrong we inquire into and learn from it. ISIS and FSA don't they just kill for no reason. 

&gt; I'm sure British citizens that fight for foreign militias follow orders too.

Unlikely there only orders are too kill normally, they are then left to do what they want to populace they control. Our military does not it has strict rules it follows in order to protect civilians. 

&gt; ""Order of wars"" doesn't make any sense.

Geneva code? International laws, these to make sense and they are very important to follow when our soldiers engage with enemies.

&gt; And the British military has killed literally millions of civilians in its long history.

Yes, it has but these are very sad. But it has also had to fight enemies that use cities as fortress and civilians as shields. Its always in the modern times tried to construct itself to limit the damage it can do on the civilian populace.  The problem is, while the enemy hides within civilians its hard. 

&gt; Well, obviously is does not include accountability for their actions, since none of them are arrested and tried when they return to Britain.

British army soldiers are tried for there actions if they fail to up hold the international laws they are put under. There are enquirers into combat troops. But because are men are well trained it does not happen to often. 

&gt; And some British citizens have decided that those actions are wrong, and have decided to fight for groups that are currently not supported by our government.

If I think that law against murder is wrong, does that mean I have an excuse to murder people? No. However you feel towards your government you have to respect the social contract your society builds with your government. In the UK we have many avenues for people to express there views in a free way. There is no need to take up arms. And doing so will not  convince anyone. 

&gt; ""they do actions and move on"" is a simply stupid and meaningless phrase.

Why? They  shoot hundreds to Syrian people, because of there religion, huge mass of graves. They execute with no remorse and move on to the next village.  Open your eyes. 

&gt; So we should provide the same service for our tax-paying citizens that decide to fight for their own causes.

And we do its called Jail, jail is more then a punishment, its a rehabilitation center, they will serve there time and be rehabilitated. 

&gt; Is my tax money spent on turning people into weapons and then back into people? That is fucked up.

Yes, because if it didn't we would all be speaking German and giving Nazi salutes. It must be hard to imagine because we live in peaceful times, but the army is a national defense force. It serves to keep us protect from bad people, like the Nazis, like the Soviets, like ISIS. 

It is a key part of the state and the refusal to see that is fucked up. With out are military we would be invaded some time ago and been forced to serve some other groups will.

This it what makes him seem greedy, and is what separates him from quality players. 

Take Hazard, for example. It would be hard to argue that he is not a better dribbler than Lamela. Yet how often do you see him try to beat two men, inside his own half, whilst ignoring a simple pass? The answer is: you don't! A clever player realises the ball can move a lot quicker than they can. You can play a simple pass then RUN without the ball past your man, thereby beating your man, without slowing then pace of the game down.

The finished product is fairly quiet and fluctuates in parts, requiring the listener to have to change their own volume to compensate for the changes. Assuming this is being recorded with microphones plugged into a laptop, have a look for some software that will show you how loud everything is. E.g. http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/meter_toolbar.html (the software, Audacity, is a good all-rounder)
so that during the session you can keep an eye on things and try to keep it consistent. 
Also you can use software afterwards to limit the volume of the recording so there are no bits that come out deafeningly loud. For example if someone very close to a microphone laughs very loudly.
Giving some attention to technical aspects like these can be (IMO) the mark between a professional sounding podcast and an amateurish one.

Now, there's glimmers of fact in all this stuff, but taken as a whole, its overblown, exaggerated horseshit.

MOST claimants are just getting by, or as shown in the article, NOT getting by.
MOST claimants are honest, decent people, who've become unlucky.
MOST claimants are you or me, one month after a bit of bad luck, so many of us only need to lose our jobs, or have an injury or illness and we'd be in the same situation.

Yet we've lost our empathy and our compassion, sold for a pittance in exchange to feel contempt each morning when we open the newspapers.

I've said it before, I don't care if each of One Direction has a few million quid at the age of 19.  Good, if they're careful they'll never have to work OR trouble the DWP.  It does bother me if they're using accountants to shuffle that about so that money spent on them from regular, tax paying people, who need what society offers, ends up shoved out of the country to dodge tax.

I also do have a problem when someone has fifty billion or more, money is power, and we all know you can buy a lot of influence with a political party.
