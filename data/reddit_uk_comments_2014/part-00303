But, if it were the case (which it's not), they'd do business for the same reason over half of our non-domestic trade is outside the EU - because that is where the business is.

What to reside?  For the same reason there are hundreds of thousands, millions even, of middle class Brits buying properties in Spain and France and Italy, etc. etc. and we have a different type of migration to immigration.  More money, more expensive housing, stronger currency.

Cough replaced with a UK Bill of Rights.  The ECHR was based around UK common law.

Apprenticeships are a no-go because the employer is expected to foot the training bill of anybody who has a degree, thus making university graduates unemployable. So basically David Cameron's proposal to fund 3 million more apprenticeships becomes worthless for me because I wasn't young enough to know better than to do an arts degree.

Entry level jobs are a no-go because they'll see I either have a degree or haven't done anything for the last four years (if I omit this) and deem me unqualified and unpassionate enough to be qualified for their position. Plus this leaves me exposed to pyramid schemes like any company affiliated with AppCo.

Graduate level jobs are a no-go for me. There aren't that many of them and a lot of them demand me to have 320+ UCAS Points in my top 3 subjects (excluding General Studies) and will tell me in the politest terms possible to fuck off because I only got 260 when I was 18.

Going back to college and university to study a STEM subject is a no-go for me because I can't get student funding as a graduate and would have to pay international student rates.

Getting a Masters degree or PhD isn't an option because I have to pay for it with money I don't have and can't get because I'm unemployable.

This has NOTHING to do with me talking about Capaldi's acting skills, other than he's completely blowing me away with how amazing well he's doing it. His Tom Baker voice is nearly perfect. Last week he was modulating it with a Scottish accent in some scenes as he switch back and forth. He has the facial expressions DOWN, as well as the gestures and character tics.

Most of the actors playing the Doctor have done callbacks to previous Doctors either intentionally (story point of post-regeneration side-effects as things stabilize), or unintentionally (scripts written for a previous Doctor were used, and they went with the flow).

This is new. In Mummy on the Orient Express, he *had a conversation* with his 4th self. That hasn't happened before in the TV series. About the closest we've come was how they dealt with the 6th Doctor in the Virgin book series.

Something big is afoot. This isn't a slur on Capaldi's acting, so stop treating it like I'm making one. I think by the end of this series, the Doctor will have full-on multiple personality disorder, and things are going to come to a very interesting and potentially ugly head.

It finally makes sense of why Capaldi has seemed so... *off* though. Looking back through previous episodes again, in Deep Breath when he wakes up in his nightgown, he's Tennant, even down to jumping onto the horse. He was either Davison or Baker in the restaurant when he talks about giving away the watch. Last night he was walking around acting like Troughton, and wearing a Troughton-callback costume.

Again, this must be arc/plot. It's not just tips of the hat. Something is wrong with his regeneration. Something fundamentally broken in a way we've not seen before.

(And Capaldi is masterfully pulling it off... his ability to slide between them is amazing. At one point in Kill the Moon, he was doing the gestures/mannerisms of one Doctor, while doing the voice of another. THAT is an insane degree of skill).

I guess this is my biggest problem with devolution, it is left to 'someone else' to decide what is best to devolve or not. And it will always be constrained and often difficult to work. The problems the SNP had trying to implement the Local Income Tax are a great example of this. 

It is almost impossible to properly structure devolution to avoid these inconstancies and it leads to so much wasted time dealing with arcane constitutional issues, and these can (and are) be exploited very easily for political gain by both sides. 

I don't see how these fundamental inconstancies can be fixed without a federal UK and a written constitution. Both of which are so far away within the UK political discourse that we are more likely to visit the moon than have them implemented.

As others have pointed out. Formation is different. The way we attack is different. We practically don't cross this season for example.

The article doesn't even get our initial formation right. The only thing this article vaguely clings on to in the hope of validation is the mentality of the team and the players and the similarities of the personnel changes.

But it seems quite obvious to argue. 

A) Players get older, the squad has to be rotated and replaced, this had to happen regardless of what manager is present. It might be easier for Mourinho given his history at the club but it had to happen. 

B) The mentality Mourinho fosters is a winning one and a fighting one and a pragmatic one. He doesn't do anything else regardless of where he. That's an innate similarity that happens whenever Mourinho is your manager and the players understand him

He's a lot like the second half of last season's Eriksen in that sense, that in the case that everyone is off-form, Siggy has had to work overtime.

I think the implication here is that Siggy never should've left, which I don't agree with. For one, I don't think that he could've been that good in Poch's system. He's a goalscorer, first and foremost, and what we needed was a Lallana-esque creator in the mold of Eriksen.

I don't see a federal UK within the next 20 years. 

There isn't really any a massive call for it from people in England (or even a particularly large majority in favour in Wales!). Or at least if there is some hope for at least some devolution, e.g. the city devolution proposals, there is pretty much zero call for a federal structure. 

There is probably more people likely to campaign in opposition to a written constitution than there is any calls for it. 

UKIP shows that there is significant disenfranchisement with the major political parties, but even given this it is not being targeted particularly at federalisation, or even devolution.

The OP's bad enough: 

&gt;About a year ago, this place was a green party/communist echo chamber, where you couldn't voice an opinion without being told to use proper Marxist analysis or some crap like that

I was posting on /r/ukpolitics (on an old account- alas, easily linkable to my identity. Now deceased.) for ~5+ years, easily. It's never, *ever* been like that. 

Amusingly, the only time in its history where the overwhelming majority of the jerk has rounded on people for anythingi related to ""marxist"" analysis has been over the past ten months- where standing in opposition to somebody equating mixed-race relationships with ""white genocide"" is simply a manifestation of ""Cultural Marxism""- as you'll be told, over and over and over again by the same few keyboard megaphones. 

There was even one delightful case where a certain user whose name escapes me at present was screaming bloody murder about the injustice of Citizenship education in schools' being horribly biased thanks to their leaving Cultural Marxism off the curriculum. 

**Edit**: [Ah! Found it. Here's the thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2ctgwy/where_can_i_find_unbiased_information_regarding/cjivxxh)

That was more or less when I gave up on the place.

(Again, as I've mentioned before- we'll be having an open review of policy as implemented so far when we hit 1,000 subscribers. If anyone has a problem with it, bring it up then? So far, we've only had about two or three of these in the past four months- at a rate this low, I expect we're probably alright.)

**Edit**: Say. A touch self-serving, and all- but, if folks are advertising this place elsewhere in comments, any chance people could make a point of citing it as a link? Easier for people to find their way here when they jump ship, and all- ""/r/BritishPolitics"" gets converted into a link, while ""/BritishPolitics"" doesn't. We're still growing right now- once we hit four figures, we should be in a position to start advertising more heavily, but for now? We're more or less limited to growing through defectors from /r/ukpolitics and people so disaffected with the place that they find their way here through meta subs. Every time we're cited in a thread like that, our userbase tends to jump by ~50-100 within a day. The more people we get along, the more enjoyable this place'll become.

false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Partly I agree, but I'd say businesses are the ones leading a subsidised life, without welfare they'd have to pay someone enough to pay full rent, council tax, all their living expenses, travel etc, to work for them.

But we make businesses pay people NMW, which is enough for those things.

&gt;Lots of us do lead a subsidised life, but not thru choice, I'd say.

Oh of course, everyone would rather be a millionaire, I wasn't passing judgement on the desires or status of people there, I was just pointing out a fact.

&gt;I know you're not being anti JSA, but I do think a lot more people pay into the system more than they take, or we'd not have a government or any public services.

Oh, no, most people don't pay nearly as much as they get from the state. The reason we have public services is because businesses and those who earn the most (around the top 25-40%, off the top of my head) pay a very significant sum of money in taxes, enough in fact to pay for not just themselves and all the services they use but often enough for several other people too. Someone earning £80,000 is also, via their taxes, paying a nurse's salary every year in income tax alone.

It's actually really interesting that those who earn the least often have least perception (It's been studied, read a great article in the economist a year or two ago) of how much the government does for us all, hence explaining the widespread phenomena of very low earning Tory voters in some regions of the country.

&gt;I guess I'm just saying your last line, they're often the same people.

I see what you're getting at, and I understand the tendency to view the JSA as a right earned through regular contributions over a long period of time. Viewed as insurance rather than a hand-out, but ultimately speaking if it were an actual form of private insurance then either the premiums would be far far higher or the payout would be far far lower.",0,1413153640,null,0,false,0,cl7pqq4,t3_2izzrd,t1_cl7pqq4,t1_cl7ph7f,null,1426559188,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

In Germany, much of the training at the academy level is in a futsal format to prevent this very problem (better at honing ball control and quicker vision in tighter spaces). Sometimes players become too reliant on abilities in certain situations, and then don't adapt as managers at top levels have immense resources and personnel to plan to counter even single player's abilities. Managers have known since the beginning of last year how easy it is to counter us by simply compacting the box quicky and cutting off our few supply lines forward, and Siggy just could not adapt to such a different format.

Education, for example, is a devolved issue. So when my MP (Labour) goes to Westminster to vote on Education policy the outcome won't actually effect me because it's something decided for me in Edinburgh by my MSP (SNP)

Effectively English MP's are competing in votes against MP's who don't actually have any constituents involved in the issue.

For what it's worth the outcome of a 'devolved issue' vote has only changed *21* times over 5,000 votes since devolution because of Scottish MP's. So it's not like our MP's are king makers dictating policy but still it's an issue that should be solved.

The Tories really don't like it because they never get the benefit of it, since we never elect any of them. Flipside obviously is that Labour do quite like it because they've got 30-40 extra votes on something they shouldn't (if they can whip the members into voting with). Also why it has never been solved.

Cameron linking it to the Scottish powers vow post-referendum was a clever move because it was Labour who were pushed out on stage up here to promise us more powers. Linking them means that Labour are pretty fucked. To deliver our powers they've got to lose the voting advantage *but* if they don't give us the powers they'll lose the seats anyway because the SNP are right behind them even in quite safe seats and will hammer them on it.

----

There's a further problem. 

If you solve the voting issue in the most basic way, banning Scottish MP's from voting on devolved matters, then it's entirely possible a Westminster government is voted in with a slim 20/30 seat majority which means a situation where on non-devolved issues they have a majority but once Scottish MP's are removed they are a minority.

A loan spell at Bolton where he scored 8 in 12, that is far more proven than a kid in a lower league.

&gt;Again, you seem to have no memory or knowledge of this at all. Coutinho was Inter's prized prospect that they gave up on and sold to us because they thought he wouldn't reach his potential. How does playing in Serie A at 19 years old make you proven?

I'm not saying he was proven but he'd played in serie a, for Inter Milan and clearly had potential. Also he wasn't as young as Dele Alli is.


&gt;Henderson was god fucking awful when we bought him and that was another ""overhyped overpriced British talent going for around 20m."" You just name three players who were bought for the future and not because they offered something right now.

Henderson had a decent season for Sunderland in the Prem, Dele Alli has had a few games in a lower league. Theres a huge difference.

&gt;I think I get it. You're simply going on what league they play in. Hendo played in the PL so obviously he must've been proven right? Well El Hadji Diouf also played in the PL and he was shit. Fernando Morientes was a proven star and he was shit. We bought Kevin Keegan from Scunthorpe. If the kid can play it doesn't matter where he comes from.

El Hadji Diouf? Were going back to him? How does that prove your point? Also Morientes? Completely irrelevant. Kevin Keegan signed for us in the 1970s, how is that relevant to Dele Alli?


Also you still haven't explained why I should support City.

Siggy's passing was never great. It was serviceable, but left something to be desired. In my ideal system, he would make some simple pass or another to Eriksen, Chadli or Lamela.

Batman and the Doctor have had a lot of adventures and saved entire worlds. But all good things must come to an end, and while the Doctor doesn't age, Batman does. He's going to have to retire, and before he does, he asks the Doctor for one last favor: to take him back to that night in Gotham when his parents were murdered, so that he can stop their murder from having ever happened.
The Doctor objects, of course: it isn't a fixed point in time, sure, but changing the events could be disastrous nonetheless. If Batman interfered and saved his parents, his younger self would be put on a different path. Without that trauma, he would never have had the drive and the will to become the Caped Crusader. But in the end, the Doctor can't object: he knew how painful it was to lose friends and family over the many centuries he'd been travelling, and he knows the guilt and the self-loathing that Batman lives with because of that first failure. Saving his parents would cause a paradox that would erase the current version of Batman from reality, the Doctor warns, but Batman accepts this. He knows that the Laws of Time are not forgiving of this type of paradox, but he doesn't care.

It's late one night, and a young Bruce Wayne is walking home with his parents along a dark alley when a man steps out of the shadows and points a gun at them. Just as the man is about to shoot, a strange sound is heard a few yards away: a blue box appears out of nowhere, and a man dressed as a bat rushes out of it, stopping Joe Chill from firing. Batman assures his former self and his family that they would be safe, and walks back into the TARDIS. He shakes hands with the Doctor and prepares to be erased from reality.

But nothing happens! His costume changes slightly, but he's still there! Then, the memories of the altered timeline come flooding in: as he grew up, Bruce Wayne trained in body and mind, with the support of his loving parents. He readied himself for the day when he'd find a blue box waiting for him, and he fashioned himself a costume with the motif of a bat: not out of fear or hatred or loathing, but out of love and gratitude for the men who had saved his parents' lives so many years ago.",0,1413155357,null,0,false,0,cl7qki8,t3_2j1qyo,t1_cl7qki8,t1_cl7kcg8,null,1426558744,93,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,93

You say he's got a system built around him at Swansea, but our side is similarly built around Eriksen/Lamela.  They have much the same positional freedom that Siggy has at Swansea, being able to roam and swap positions at will.  He may have less defensive responsibilities at Swansea, but it's much of a muchness really.

You also say that Siggy's ""having to work overtime"" because he's their attacking talisman at the moment... but isn't Adebayor doing as poorly as Bony right now?  Other than Chadli, no one else is banging in the goals, and even Chadli's contributions are not really proving enough to consistently beat our opposition.

Ultimately, I think Eriksen is a better player, but Sigurdsson has proved himself to be a quality EPL player everywhere but here.  He never really got much of a run in the side week-in, week-out, so it makes you wonder... was his relative lack of impact here due to him not being suited to us, or to us never giving him the opportunity to really make that impact?

I don't know, for example, that he's a worse option than Chadli, even regarding the latter's current purple patch.

Unless they could prove reckless driving/excess speed on your part, overtaking on a straight road with no major junctions in site, is perfectly reasonable. I am not a traffic lawyer, so don't take my word for it. 

With any overtake, the best thing is to get around them as quickly as you possibly can. That is advice handed out by police advanced instructors.

From 'The vow'

Promises
Guarantee One

&gt; New powers for the Scottish Parliament.

&gt; Holyrood will be strengthened with extensive new powers, on a timetable beginning on September 19, with legislation in 2015.

&gt; The Scottish Parliament will be a permanent and irreversible part of the British constitution.

Guarantee Two

&gt; The guarantee of fairness to Scotland.

&gt; The guarantee that the modern purpose of the Union is to ensure opportunity and security by pooling and sharing our resources equitably for our defence, prosperity and the social and economic welfare of every citizen, including through UK pensions and UK funding of healthcare.

Guarantee Three

&gt; The power to spend more on the NHS if that is Scottish people’s will.

&gt; The guarantee that with the continued Barnett allocation, based on need and with the power to raise its own funds, the final decisions on spending on public services in Scotland, including on the NHS, will be made by the Scottish Parliament.

&gt; The Scottish Parliament will have the last word on how much is spent on health. It will have the power to keep the NHS in public hands and the capacity to protect it.


To me this seems like they seem to converging on Labour's 'Devo Nano' proposals. 

You can't possibly argue that a proposal that allows you to raise but not lower income tax, and to do so you must do so across all bands at once isn't 'hamstrung'.

Even the conservatives proposal to allow control of all income tax is incredibly difficult to use. Income tax is an incredibly blunt tool if you can't use if to offset or replace other taxes. See the fiasco of trying to implement the local income tax for how this can be a massive problem.

I have a food budget that comes to about £3.00 per day for all three meals and I'm huddled away doing physics during the daylight hours. Often I wont get home until between 6pm-7pm and I often will have some errand or assignment to do when I do get home. For my entire time at uni, I could probably count on my fingers the number of takeaways I've ordered out of convenience (as opposed to a treat, like at a house party, or when drunk, for example). Stress being a detriment to long term interests isn't a legitimate argument in my opinion; I manage it with more erratic hours and take-home work than would be typical of a full time minimum wage job. 

I was also terrible at cooking. In my first year I almost exclusively ate pasta, pesto and hot dog sausages. Now I'll cook a pot of chili, curry, bolognese, bigos (polish hunter's stew), or occasionally something a little fancier like enchiladas, portion it and freeze it. When I stumble through the door in the evening, all I need to do is place the frozen meal in the microwave and boil an appropriate carbohydrate. It's far far quicker than getting a takeaway (unless you're talking about the chippy), much healthier and much cheaper. For quick meals, pasta with pesto and cheese/tomato/pepper etc., carbonara, egg foo yung, fried rice w. chicken are all both quick and cheap. The argument of it taking time to learn how to cook isn't legitimate as far as I can see; I was there. The only thing preventing me from eating well was me being a lazy bastard.  

It comes down to laziness ultimately. People who are genuinely poor cannot afford to live exclusively on takeaways; one takeaway meal costs up to several times more than my daily food budget. If people want to eat takeaways that's up to them, but nobody is forced into doing through low income.

false,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;You say he's got a system built around him at Swansea, but our side is similarly built around Eriksen/Lamela. They have much the same positional freedom that Siggy has at Swansea, being able to roam and swap positions at will. He may have less defensive responsibilities at Swansea, but it's much of a muchness really.

Yes, but Siggy seems to be the only person at Swansea with that kind of freedom. The wingers (there's a very quick one from Central America, I can't remember him now) in their system seem to be very direct and pacy, giving Siggy space. 

The other thing is that Lamela and Eriksen are smarter as players, IMO. The 1-2 from Eriksen to Lamela and eventually to Chadli against Arsenal hint at this. I think that if was on the end of that pass from Eriksen, he would go it alone and try to open up space for a shot. I have nothing to back it up, but like /u/Chrisischan has said, he's a player who thrives in space. 

Fundamentally, with the amount of pressure we'll ideally be playing with once everybody buys what Poch is selling, there won't be too many open areas in the final third. Which means that Siggy would either have to change his game to be more...Chadli-like (and thus lose the free role that's brought him so much at Swansea) or be happy with getting shots to break in the first team via Europa or the cups. 

&gt;You also say that Siggy's ""having to work overtime"" because he's their attacking talisman at the moment... but isn't Adebayor doing as poorly as Bony right now? Other than Chadli, no one else is banging in the goals, and even Chadli's contributions are not really proving enough to consistently beat our opposition.

Keep in mind that we're with a new manager, while Swansea's fairly acclimated to how Monk wants things done. I don't think we've seen Lamela at his best (in fact, I think he'll go on to be around the top 5 assists board near the end), and without him at his best, we're also missing the impressive goal tally that he put in at Roma.

Health lives, which measures preventable deaths, outcomes, and conditions can be treated, the UK was 10 on the scale, America was 11. Seems strange that if it were the best possible system in the world outcomes would be so bad. Other countries have the same lifestyle problems (like Australia which came 4th), so it's not the fault of individual Brits.

The UK also has the worst cancer survival rates Europe.

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29501588 This has happened and still people are ignoring it.

You'd think people would want an NHS that works, but apparently anything even slightly negative about it must mean you want to destroy it, ignoring the problems will make them go away because the NHS is the best in the world and there is no way to improve or fix anything. I, personally, don't want the NHS to be privatised, I just want people to notice and discuss the problems so they can be fixed. So nobody else has to face what I had to face. So there aren't unnecessary deaths. So that something like Mid Staffordshire doesn't happen again.

But people seem to think it's more productive to just talk about ""our beloved NHS"" all the time and shout at anyone says anything that isn't praise, literally treating it as a religion, it's not even a stupid and annoying little joke like it that phrase used to be, that is how it is being treated, even while people working in the NHS can see these problems.

I mean look at the discussion here ""the European system"", which European system? All the countries have different systems. ""They wish they had the NHS"". Literally nobody I know in Norway, Germany and France wishes their systems were like the NHS. And their governments are not trying to turn their systems into something like the NHS. 

I suppose I should be glad that people are at least acknowledging that the rest of Europe exists now, instead of pretending to only other alternative is the US.

At this rate maybe the British public will care enough that there is enough pressure to improve things in 20 years time. If standards of care continue to decline what you're going to end up with is a middle class who get health insurance through work (like I did when working in the UK), who use the private system, and while relatively healthy still won't hear any criticism of what remains of the NHS because ostensibly it's still there if they need it and for the poor, which is a lot more like the US than the European systems, and you'll get there by ""defending"" the NHS.

It's quite ingenious really, using the fondness people have for the NHS so that they'll defend everything about it even as it's intentionally run down, funding cut in real terms, contracts given to companies like G4S for ambulance services, and entire NHS hospitals run by private companies for profit (http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-29383247) - then eventually standards of care will be so low, and waiting times so long that people will be forced to take out private insurance if they don't want their health to suffer, and it won't be an integrated system like the rest of Europe or Australia, it'll be a choice between private or the NHS, it will be like the US with their terrible public healthcare for the disabled and poor and insurance for everyone else, while those waiting for NHS services, still have to go through the same procedures, the way of being forced to only use the most local one, even while a private company runs and profits from it.

My instructor did teach me to move a little over to the left for left turns. As this blocks off other motorbikes and cyclists, preventing them from coming up your inside. 

The procedure was double mirror check, left life saver, indicate left, move over, left life saver just before you begin the turn left. 

Do not turn too quickly after the 2nd life saver as it affects balance and just remember to keep out the gutter to avoid leaves and other crap. 

Just remember, mirror check and life saver before any change in road position. Make sure you mirror checks involve head movement, so the examiner sees them. 
They love you to use the rear brake to stabilise turns (needed for the Mod 1 stuff anyway) 

Remember, they also like to see you making progress, confidently. I managed to lose my examiner several times leaving junctions. (He was in a 4x4) I figured he couldn't mark me down if he couldn't see me.

Bono was famous for indulging in tax avoidance to a disgusting degree for years, before it was particularly unfashionable:    
Ex. February 2009:  **[U2 frontman Bono's tax avoidance 'depriving poor'](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/u2-frontman-bonos-tax-avoidance-depriving-poor-28509721.html)**

&gt;""Tax avoidance and tax evasion costs the impoverished world at least 160 million US dollars every year. This is money urgently required to bring people out of poverty.

He was specifically talking about Scotland, in this context, because of the independence debate - but then there is the situation that on independence, had it happened, Scotland doesn't have an electable party to governance that is willing to talk in terms of necessary cuts and austerity.  Call them the nasty party if you want, and I don't blame you after what they did by trying to road test Poll Tax in Scotland first - but Conservatives and UKIP talk in terms of slashing spending (not that the current Conservatives have been successful at it.)

It doesn't mean that you're unemployed and on the benefit scrounge.  Most people qualify and receive benefits.  Child benefits, for example.  You can be on a £30k salary, own your own home, and receive state benefits.

The irony is that the cost of living; housing prices, food, energy, means that the state is subsidising to compensate for a disproportionate cost in living.  It all still costs the state, and it all has to be paid for in taxation.    

From a capitalist outlook it makes sense that somebody on an average salary should be able to pay for their roof, their food, the children's upkeep, and not to have to have state benefits because they always have money left over at the end of the month.

It's a fact.  Most people on benefits are hardworking people where a 'living wage' still needs subsidising.  It remains that a state in such a position needs to pay for it.

The Corporation Taxes Acts apply to the UK.  He was talking about RoI.

&gt; First £300, 000 is taxed @ 20 % If over £300, 000 but does not reach £1,500, 000 the first £300, 000 is taxed at 20 5 and the excess is charged at a marginal rate of 21.25%
&gt; We have a main rate of 21 % which operates when a company's profit reaches £1,500,000 - the rate is applied to all of the company's taxable profits.

Although it doesn't matter much since it's only a difference of 1% it's actually significantly more complicated.  It used to be much more relevant, since up to 2007 the main rate was 30%.

Firstly the £300,000 lower limit and the £1,500,000 upper limit are divided between associated companies.  So, for example if Company A has one associated company both limits are halved.

As soon as you're over the lower limit you pay tax at the main rate.    
The tax may then be reduced by Marginal Rate Relief.

More or less the relief calculation is:    
The amount the upper limit exceeds the total profits including dividends x % of profits not from dividends.

The dividends thing is a bit more complicated since it's only UK dividends and a tax credit of 1/9th of the dividend is added.  ",0,1413160114,null,0,false,0,cl7ss6r,t3_2j1h53,t1_cl7ss6r,t1_cl7mc2f,null,1426557674,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; The problem is it takes time, and effort, a bit of knowledge and being able to spend what you need to, when you need to.

This is one of the things that drives me nuts every time someone starts off on the, *""Eating healthily is incredibly cheap, you people are just lazy!""* tirade.  Not your comment specifically, to be clear.

I know someone who until a couple of months ago was working three separate, slightly better than minimum wage jobs.  One of these three jobs had a split shift.  This resulted in close to four hours a day of travelling on public transport.  Depending on shifts this was six or seven days a week.

*(The work was care work for the elderly subcontracted out to the private sector.)*

She was essentially exhausted **all** the time.  Working and travelling for upwards of twelve hours a day and only ever getting Sundays off makes trundling along to a local market an impossibility.  It's still possible to buy food cheaply from a supermarket, but I don't believe the, ""I made a delicious, nutritious pie and veggies for 37p a head!"" crowd take this sort of time pressure into account.

I acknowledge this isn't typical, but it's not as uncommon as a lot of people might like to think.  

The underlying issue here isn't really the cost of food anyway.  It's a broader cost of living issue that mostly relates to housing costs.  If the total cost of living reduced people wouldn't have to work like dogs to earn enough to pay the bills.  This would leave more time and more people could spend time making cheap, delicious, nutritious meals.

I agree Sky and the cinema aren't in reach for most people either on benefits or minimum wage, but in my experience they're not using them.

George Orwell touches on this very same subject in his book [The Road to Wigan Pier Chapter 6](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79r/chapter6.html) with a slightly different angle:

&gt; Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn’t. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty’. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let’s have three pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and we’ll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don’t nourish you to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the English-man’s opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.

 [**Cellular respiration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular%20respiration): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Cellular respiration__ is the set of [metabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism) reactions and processes that take place in the [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology\)) of [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) to convert [biochemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy#Energy_and_life) from [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrients) into [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) (ATP), and then release waste products.  The reactions involved in respiration are [catabolic reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism), which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process as weak so-called ""high-energy"" bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an [exothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction) [redox reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox) which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although technically, cellular respiration is a [combustion reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_reaction), it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell due to slow release of energy from the series of reactions.

I was at a friend's house for their Halloween Party. A friend of mine and his wife decided to dress up as the 11th and she wore a TARDIS dress. Well, at this point, I had been drinking quite a bit and bumped into them at the party. I was commenting on their costumes and I turned to my buddy and made the ""Oh, she's dressed as the TARDIS, is she bigger on the inside?"" joke.

He laughed hysterically and understood the joke. He even gave me a drunken high five. Unbeknownst to me, she didn't know much about the show and didn't understand the reference. She got super pissed off at me. (She kinda knew about the show, but mainly dressed up so they could have a similar themed costumes). It took my drunken brain a few seconds to realize this, and then I tried to explain to her the joke. Didn't succeed well and probably made things worse and awkward. She just shrugged it off in a *""whatever""* type of way. I think she eventually got over it, but some part of me thinks, deep down inside, she hates my guts.

So when you make that joke, make sure the person you're saying it too actually watches the show and would understand the reference.",0,1413175752,null,0,false,0,cl7zqrs,t3_2j1gpg,t1_cl7zqrs,t3_2j1gpg,null,1426554415,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

false,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"Yeah, i won't deny the temptation for the quick and nasty fix and I'm not saying my house is empty of all convenience food, but Orwell would not think I'm normal. A good crust of brown bread and a couple of raw carrots sounds much more tempting to me than any of the alternatives he mentions there. He can keep the dripping though. Ugh.

It's about despair, I think. And resignation. being unemployed, seeing endless weeks of emptiness stretching ahead of you. Eventually it grinds you down.

The reason I do things the way i do them is that i don't easily give in to negativity. There are people I know who get very frustrated that i can always see the positives in a situation.

Take convenience food: All of the big supermarkets do handmade pizza while you wait. I know that Asda's is £3.70 for a 14"", because I bought one last week. When I got it home, it got cut into eight BIG slices, wrapped in foil and frozen down. With a bag of chips and a tin of beans, that's three day's food for the kids. Is it fresh, healthy and wholesome? No. Is it filling and satisfying for a couple of hungry teenagers? Damn right it is. 88p per meal.

When they were little - and I heartily recommend this to everyone with kids - we'd have the usual problem of nag power when taking them shopping. They'd always get hungry looking at all the nice shiny food, and why wouldn't they? What we'd do is head to the fresh veg aisles, break a carrot in half and give them that to gnaw on while we shopped. Now, they treat carrots and fresh peas as sweets and my eldest counts broccoli as one of her favourite foods.

There's an expectation to be miserable and downtrodden and depressed when you're unemployed, like it's the only attitude that's socially acceptable. I don't agree. We might not go on as many day trips as someone who works, we may not be able to afford the latest and brightest stuff, but it's just stuff. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter, it could all go away with a flick of a switch. Our house is usually filled with laughter and joking, when we go away on a rare holiday, we have a great time, we tighten the apron strings from October onwards in order to save a little each week and slowly stock up on Christmas presents.

As poverty stricken as we are, and I'd be willing to bet 90% of people who find out how much we live on would wonder how we coped, we have as good a life as I can manage to give us. I've had offers of budget assistance and money management over the years and they've invariably gone away shaking their heads, admitting defeat because they can't improve on how we run things.

Not everyone has a choice of how to react to being unemployed, but if you do, you owe it to yourself and the people around you not to lose...what is it? Hope? Positivity? Don't lose sight of **life**.

Police officers already have different rights from everyone else. They have rights to detain people, to point weapons at people, to enter people's houses uninvited, to use violence against people, to decide where people can go, to question people, to search people. They are not civilians, they are not normal people in the eyes of the law already. They *already* have different rights from the rest of us.

But because they have powers they can use against other people that nobody else can do, and also because their function is to protect people and maintain order and justice, they have responsibilities that come with those additional rights. Responsibilities to not kill people in custody, for example. The fact is, if someone dies in police custody or as a result of police action, it is a rarity that the police officers in question will face prosecution, let alone conviction. Yet it is impossible that all those police officers are entirely blameless. Something needs to be done to prevent police officers from getting away with murder. And one way to do that would be a simple change to prevent police officers from talking to one another after an incident before they make their reports, so that we actually get as close to the truth as possible about what happened instead of what a bunch of officers have talked through and have agreed is a sound story that will keep them out of trouble.",0,1413178053,null,0,false,0,cl80i4y,t3_2j0lpc,t1_cl80i4y,t1_cl7orak,null,1426554060,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For starters, this isn't a zero sum game, and suggest so is as dumb as the right wing retards who suggested that having AV was going to murder kids or something.

Secondly, define fucking actual child poverty, as I'm relatively sure that people who are in actually in poverty (Such as Africa, east Europe, Asia, etc etc) would fucking love to be part of the ""Can only buy 3 xbox's a month"" version of poverty we have here in this country. First world poverty isn't something that can be ""fixed"" due to the definition of poverty always increasing inline with living standards, and while it's always nice to have something to aspire too, frankly using the word ""poverty"" in this country outside of the homeless is just taking the piss.

Secondly, that you could divert all the money from Trident into ""Child poverty"", and it would do nothing. Fuck all. Because Trident doesn't cost that much. I love seeing liberal hippy stalin fuckers quote numbers like 83 billion and 20 billion, and then use that money to pay for literally everything. Aside from the fact that these numbers generated are over a period of 20-50 years. You could pour all the money spent per year from trident into the NHS, and it would amount to slightly less than 2% the the entire budget, and far less then we spend on ""fighting child poverty"" (Maybe we should declare war on it or something?) as it currently is. The fact is 1 billion a year is the fucking spare change found in the queens sofa in terms of countries international budgets.

And there's the argument that as a Good to cost ratio, Trident comes out far in positive. I understand that liberal hippy twats have issues with complicated ideas due to being stoned on 8Kg of weed a day, because of which they believe that MAD is a breakfast cereal. However for those liberal hippies able to actually read, seriously go read some history. The advent of nuclear weapons created one of the most peaceful times in human history, forcing all the big boys of the world to stop fucking warring with each other, and mostly stop warring with smaller countries. But then again, this is the same group that were actually surprised when leaving Syria to fester caused ISIS to appear; I'm certain that in the past a environment of complicated and messy civil war has never caused a extremist military group to appear and take control, except for every time that happened ever.

Now you could make the argument that the UK itself don't need nuclear weapons, and you are right to some extent. However someone would have to replace our capability, in order to stop the theoretical possibility of any one western side having all the nukes (Such as America). Ethically we'd have to pass that duty onto someone with a stronger economy, and there's basically Germany, and that's it (France already has nukes, Japan could be a second contender), which means to leave our nuclear capabilities would cause a country with a weaker economy than ours to take on this mantel of responsibility, very unethical behavior from the UK.",0,1413178267,null,0,false,0,cl80kgn,t3_2j2l1x,t1_cl80kgn,t3_2j2l1x,null,1426554029,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

&gt;__Xenophyophores__ are giant [unicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicellular_organism) organisms found throughout the world's [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean), at depths of up to 10,641 meters (6.6 miles).  They were first described by Brady in 1883 as primitive [Foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera),  and later they were placed within the [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_sponge).  In the beginning of the 20th century they were considered as an indepedent class of Rhizopoda,  and later as a new eukaryotic phylum of [Protista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist).  A recent genetic study suggests that xenophyophores are a specialized group of monothalamous (single-chambered) [Foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera).

Also, with theories on the engineer- Could he have planted/learned the phone number for the TARDIS?  Is he working for Missy?  I know some people have theories that he's tied to who/what Gus is.  And since Gus is such an obvious hanging plot thread, I feel like it has to tie in to the finale.

On a similar note, that makes sense as a tie-in.  One thing common with Moffat's seasons is that almost all episodes have some kind of tie-in with the finale (either as character moments or as plot relevance).

Deep Breath had the Promised Land AND a the villain go to Heaven.

Dalek had someone go to Heaven.

Sherwood had a reference to Promised Land

Time Heist currently has an unclear connection, but my guess is Psi and Saibra are in the finale (especially since Moffat has writing credits on this episode, which implies that something in it factors heavily into the season arc.  I can only assume that means Psi and Saibra's characters are major parts of it)

Caretaker has someone else go to Heaven, and implies something is wrong in Heaven.  It also starts setting up [](#s ""Clara's exit at the end of the season"")

Kill the Moon continues setting up [](#s ""Clara's exit""), but otherwise has no bearing on the story (which I'm fine with cause I HATED this episode).  It's also possible those random astronauts will be in Heaven, but we didn't see it.

I'm all for improved cycling paths in London - but *not* at the expense of roadways.

Tunnelling, elevated cycleways - these are things that should be seriously considered. But I don't see them being considered. Nor am I seeing a serious effort to license and register every bicycle and cyclist. With the obsession to mix cycling with traffic I'm astounded there is no requirement to be tested on the road rules.

But instead he dumped 10,000's of documents indiscriminately to journalists at the Guardian and WP (who are taking great pleasure in using them as a political weapon against a political party they dislike) and then fled to Russia - which is a hilarious choice of country if you think about it, for somebody who supposedly cares about the state having too much power.

We have a system that does not work, because when deaths in custody happen, they are not investigated and those involved are not prosecuted. It is impossible that in all situations the police officers are blameless, but they just have an internal investigation most of the time, when they're allowed to confer as much as they like, and nothing ever comes of it regardless of the weight of evidence against them. Police officers who are responsible for deaths in custody do not face justice. That is the problem. They cannot, statistically, all be blameless, yet they never end up in trouble for it.

I don't know why you bring nurses and doctors into it, it's irrelevant. People die after police officers hit, push and manhandle them in custody. There is security footage of these deaths and what the officers do to them. And yet the police officers responsible do not even lose their jobs, let alone end up in jail. They don't get thoroughly investigated. They don't get put on trial. Someone dies, and because it was a police officer who was responsible, the police close ranks and nobody faces justice. Families are left bereaved, their loved one dead, with no explanation, no justice. Is that right?

It's an incredibly high-risk play, investing in commodities like gold. There is very little ""utility value"" (i.e. what it's worth to industry), and a large portion of its value is literally just what other people are willing to pay.

For this reason the price is pretty volatile [\(chart\)](http://www.kitco.com/scripts/hist_charts/yearly_graphs.plx).

You also pay an ""opportunity cost"" - whilst you own gold, it doesn't produce an income. Your money invested in the metal could alternatively have been earning you interest or dividend income in other assets.

The Motley Fool wrote a [recent article](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/13/why-warren-buffett-hates-gold.aspx) on the (possible) follies of gold, which includes one of my favourite Warren Buffett quotes (Warren Buffett, if you didn't know, is probably the world's most successful investor):

&gt; (It) gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.

They probably have to deal with shareholders and clients directly and deal with all manor of issues that most regular employees are not involved with. That is what it is like to be a director.

Where is it supposed to stop? 2x your salary? Is that ok? 1.5x? 10x? It's a completely ridiculous 'issue' that is raised all the time these days and it simply comes down to jealousy.

Imagine you're earning 100k a year - that is an amazing salary no matter what job you're doing. Now imagine your boss is earning 1M a year. Is it 'fair'? Who cares!

We have faith schools. We have an immigration policy which is based almost entirely on where you are from, not what you contribute. We have these mosques where we KNOW extremism is bred. Internet forums too are absolutely full of muslim extremism. Maybe we just leave them there to keep an eye on people, or maybe people are scared to do it (fear of backlash or accusations of racism), or maybe it's political (like the guardian covering up rapes which were inconvenient to their narrative) - but I do find it shocking that we don't close them down and prosecute people.

Viviane Reding has stated that it is 70%. But browse the google results and the general answer you will get is 'no one really knows'. Personally, having any percentage of our laws being decided in another country feels wrong. 


Would you defend the party's current use of statistics or do you feel they could improve? 


Sometimes they are exaggerated, but the point behind them is clear. When Farage says ""We have an open door to 485 million Europeans"", YES it does, to some degree, play on people's fears. But at the same time, he isn't wrong.

As Boris Johnson said:

""We don't have the same border arrangements. We do have a different dispensation already, so the principle of uniformity across the European patrie has already been breached in our case""


""It's a wonderful thing to try to create a union between the European countries, but when that vision was first put forward there were far fewer countries and you've now got 28 countries with very different wage rates, very different benefits systems so it seems to me to be quite reasonable to have some sort of system of control""


In the context of all this do you understand why some people might be worried that UKIP is now dictating the terms of the EU debate? 


Perhaps, but like I just mentioned, while what is being said is a slight twist in words (we do pay around £50 million per day membership, but we do also get millions back). He has been called out on this before but has still made the point that we are losing £30 million or so per day. 


Do you understand why some might be worried that certain members of the British public will make a decision in the election or referendum that they wouldn't have made had they been better informed of conflicting opinions or statistics?


Yes, but while the fear might be exaggerated to a degree, presumably to get more voters who don't know any better, the point behind them is the same. I know its' not the EU question, but take the armed forces for example. UKIP want's to increase spending on them. People say ""why?"" and he says it's simply a good insurance policy in an uncertain world. Yes that is playing on people's fears to some degree as we are unlikely to get attacked,  but at the same time, our armed forces have gone through the biggest cut's that they can remember and I'd feel a lot safer knowing that the people who defend this country have precisely what they need to do it.

I disagree. Maybe some people, but there's no pleasing some people. But you might have noticed - we've had a crap time of it the last six years.

People have had to tighten their belts, to lower their expectations, to cut back on the little luxuries that make life worth living and scrape by on the barest essentials. And yet the people at the top, the CEOs, don't have to cut back. They're still getting payrises they deny the rest of us, they still get bonuses. They don't have to cut back on anything.

If the ratio of average pay to CEO is 120, and it was 120 last year and the year before and the year before, and will be next year and the year after and the year after, that's fine. Whatever the ratio is, if it stays the same - if CEOs cut back when things are hard and get payrises when things are good, just like everyone else, that's fine.

Obviously quite a few of these are never going to be done by anything other than car, but even if 20% of the people doing these short journeys start taking a bike instead, it would have *massive* positive ramifications for everyone in the country.

The rest of your comment suggests you are probably a pretty good (at least conscientious driver), so this isn't meant to be directed personally at you. But a lot of time, the attitude that 'traffic= cars' (and nothing else) creates an automatic sense of priority and even superiority on the roads.

This mindset can lead to dangerous behavior on the road. For example a driver is behind  a cyclist who is sitting in primary position to avoid being hit by a parked car.

A driver with the idea in his head that the cyclist is not legitimate traffic, and has no right to be there, won't think twice about executing a dangerous overtaking maneuver. A driver who acknowledges the cyclists right to be part of traffic will just wait until it's safe to pass.

What about the extra farmland which appears in Canada and Siberia? What makes you think the net effect is negative?

And that movement of farmland is dispersed over a century, where most buildings are torn down and rebuilt several times, crops replanted, etc. The cost of movement is fairly dispersed. Remember the standard we are aiming for here is ""huge effects"" and ""our kids will be mortified"" - a minor cost to some countries balanced by a minor gain in other countries doesn't cut it.

IPCC latest report writes: ""With these recognized limitations, the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2°C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (±1 standard deviation around the mean)""

And that's a worst case scenario, it assumes farmers make no adjustments on what crops or where they plant them, over the next 60 years. Is between 0.2% and 2% less enough to make our kids ""mortified"" or to call it a ""huge effect""?

Siggy played for Spurs in the CAM role a few times and he did not do well. He isn't starting quality for Spurs' offense, sorry. He's a very good player with a ridiculous shot on him and he can see a pass, but he's B-grade compared to Eriksen.

We have already achieved substantial improvements in general cycling safety, in the last 15 years there's been ~60% reduction in the deaths per mile cycled.

One of the biggest contributors to the increase in safety is what's called the 'safety in numbers' effect, where an increasing number of cyclists using the roads trains other road users and cyclists to expect other cyclists, and to use the road appropriately and safely.

The biggest problem I feel is the perception of cycling as a life or death past time. Cycling is for everyone, from children to college students to working people to pensioners. The vast majority of these people complete these trips without incident.

That needs to be the message that goes out, that cycling *is* safe, that we are making it safer and better, but that it's already great - that the health benefits far outweigh any potential risk of an accident.

Why not? We have no idea on the make up of these laws. I would also suggest that we have been making our own laws for much longer and there may only be a limited number of modifications that we continually have to make. Whereas EU laws are relatively more recent and they may have a much larger number of issues to legislate for right now. 

&gt; The EU has competency (by our agreement to the EU treaties) over the regulation of cross-border markets in goods and services within the EU and cross-border movement of money and people within the EU. That's it. Plenty of issues come under those headings but they should respect the domestic UK arliament's right to legislate on things that are domestic only and not cross-border. 

What have they legislated on that doesn't have cross border implications? 

&gt; Education is a good example - domestic education of domestic children is a matter for the UK government only. Education of children from other EU countries in the UK becomes an issue the EU will have partial input on because it is cross-border with one state educating another state's citizen. The EU can then, as it does with university fees in the UK, ensure that citizens of other EU countries are not unfairly treated compared to British citizens. It's up to the UK alone to set it's own tuition fees rate even if it's different to other EU countries as we did in 2010/11. The EU gets involved only to ensure that those crossing borders to travel are not discriminated against.

I don't see your point. That's exactly what the EU has done. So they are only making laws that have international implications. ",0,1413194434,null,0,false,0,cl83zfn,t3_2j19kc,t1_cl83zfn,t1_cl7m0fe,null,1426552366,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Average traffic speeds are less than 20 mph in London. Transport for London's latest figures state that for the first quarter of 2011/2012 the average traffic speed on major London roads for the 12 hours between 7am to 7pm was 19.33 mph and over the same period was 8.98 mph across Central London.

Even the most unfit cyclist could keep above 8.9mph. I don't think it's cyclists that are blocking the roads...

This is a comment thread about the need for special paths for cyclists. So I'm not sure why you're bringing this up.

false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Maths to prove you wrong.

First, 10 million euro/unit is unit cost, not installation cost. Offshore wind costs £3mil/MW (""Great Expectations"", UK Energy Research Centre). That's 3.8 million EUR/MW.

Therefore your 31Bn Euros buys you 8.157GW of Wind, versus 3.3GW of Nuclear.

3.3GW*0.9 (capacity factor) = 2.97GW per hour on average

Per year = 26,017GWh = 26TWh

In 60 years = 1560TWh

Even if you assume capacity factor will decrease over time as ageing equipment results in longer downtimes, the nuclear plant still blows wind out of the water in terms of power output.

8.157*0.3 (average UK wind capacity factor sated in DUKES Chapter 6, DECC publication) = 2.441GW per hour average

Per year = 21,436GWh = 21.436TWh

In 25 years = 535.9TWh
(Assumed for 60 years = 1286TWh, 82% of what nuclear gives you in sheer power output, but you'll have to replace your wind turbines twice in that time, so triple your costs there.)

Over the lifetime of each, the Nuclear power plant produces around 3 times more energy.

If you want wind to last 60 years, you're building less than half of those wind turbines up front because you need money to replace them in 25 years. You're getting 34% of the energy output for 42% of the lifetime. That means less efficient.

Your case is extremely misleading:

* It assumes unit cost = installation cost. This is not true, as proven by UKERC.
* It assumes nationwide 40% capacity factor. This is not true, as proven by DECC.
* You rely on ""baseload myth"" sources that are outright incorrect, and I'll detail why if you want.
* You sound an awful lot like UKIP by pointing out EDF is ""foreign"". Do foreign MWs do less work? Is there no such thing as foreign wind turbines?

I do think they are right to strike, the NHS has had it's funding cut away at the edges and pay settlements are becoming harder and harder to reach. 4 years without a pay rise for those not on incremental pay rises, and even for those on incremental pay rises, 3% a year has NOT kept up with inflation. So for four years now all NHS staff have been having a pay cut. Note also that this much vaunted 3% pay rise about half of NHS staff have does depend on them continuing their on the job development, it's not automatic. My honest opinion is that the 1% pay demand is the straw that broke the camel's back after years of below inflation pay rises, someone from UNISON said that overall pay for the average NHS worker has fallen 10% in the last four years compared to inflation.

Pedestrians are safe, because they use a contraption called a pavement, where cars are not allowed to drive, which is also true for cyclists. Thus cyclists have to be on roads, the same as cars. If you refer back to my previous paragraph, this can lead to accidents, which can be caused by negligence (that is, neither party giving enough care than they should) on either the driver's side or the cyclist's side.

The best solution then, is to corner off a small part of the road so that cyclist may have a little more room between them and the cars passing by, so that we can help lower the amount of accidents.

I was right fucked off. It took me four months to get my money back from them, I sent them screenshots of the address pages, the reciept e-mail you get the whole shebang... Apparently it was my fault as I'd moved and ordered too soon... 

Seriously, I got a big 40x40x40cm box with an invoice at the bottom. Confused the hell out of me.

In any event, they should not be permitted to influence the feeble-minded or vulnerable people who might believe such nonsense!
Whilst most of them look and sound incredibly stupid to those with more than two firing synapses, one can only assume these thieves they simply don’t care because they are making so much money,.
Trying to con others is one thing but, if you are trying to fool yourself, you need urgent help.
(Incidentally, if YOU are one of the many people who genuinely believe in such garbage, I defend your absolute right to believe in whatever nonsense you chose, no matter how stupid. However, it is highly recommended you seek urgent help immediately.)
NOW, at last, YOU can actually DO something positive! Click the link above and sign the petition!
Join the campaign to stop these evil individuals stealing from so many such unfortunate individuals.  Email your M.P. and request the issue be raised in parliament to prohibit these thieves from advertising or performing.
If ALL thieves should be imprisoned, why does the government condone this huge (and growing) group of con artists stealing with impunity? They should also be imprisoned and their vast profits applied to support victims. It’s nothing short of legalised theft!
The truth is posted everywhere that these con artists should be in PRISON like ANY con artist so isn’t it strange why they never try to sue me if they claim they really possess such a supernatural skill ? !

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;Well, exactly. It's empty rhetoric.

It's literally not.

Empty rhetoric is if he said that lobbying is really bad and all forms of lobbying should be stopped, but then does nothing about it. 

Instead he said ""I think lobbying is good in general, but we need to stop secret lobbying"". While I personally feel that secret lobbying probably does go on, I have no proof that it does. 

So far, he's done exactly as he said he would (or at least it looks that way).

&gt;This is the very reason UKIP have such support now - because the public are sick of politicians saying one thing when they mean another, tricking them, and screwing us over in general.

The reason the public support UKIP so much is because we don't bother to educate our children in politics. They don't understand how important it is to not only vote, but to vote based on facts rather than rhetoric. They don't know how to see how their local candidate has voted or what they stand for. They don't understand economics, immigration, and international law.

Theres a reason the majority of UKIPs supports are old or have relatively low levels of education, or both. They are the type of people to believe rags like the Daily Mail despite the fact it's full of misleading information and factual accuracies. They are the people who genuinely believe a lot of the lies told by UKIP and, increasingly, the right wing Tories. They are the people who listen to Thersea May's speech about someone not being deported because of a cat, but then will not be bothered to research it or be interested in the follow up story that showed it was a total lie, yet they will continue to use it as an example of how Britain is falling apart.

The better question isn't how do you find a politician who doesn't lie (because they don't, even UKIP does *gasp*) but it's better to ask why they lie. For example, no government has ever been elected in the UK promising to raise taxes, yet everyone will hopefully agree that, sometimes, raising taxes is necessary. The general public *in the same opinion poll* will favour both increases in public spending **and** tax cuts  **and** cutting the deficit. 

Furthermore, not only do the public make unrealistic demands (because they don't understand the intricacies of running a country) but they don't actually punish lying politicians by voting them out. You can name any number of politicians that ""lied"" but the people still voted them in instead of saying ""No, this guy lied to us, let's vote for someone else"".

People get the politicians we deserve, and since there's a lack of political education, the general public doesn't have realistic expectations and doesn't actively engage with the political process, we deserve pretty shoddy politicians.

82% of 10,000 midwives voted in favour of this strike. How many MPs got 80% of the vote? Hell, there's 26,000 midwives in the RCM, and funny enough, that works out as about 31% voting in favour of a strike.

The only thing that's for certain is that the Government will have at least one of the two main parties, and I think it's fair for one debate to reflect that. A debate between two people is also much more valuable than a debate between three or five. 

It would be good to have a way of encouraging viewers to watch at least one of the others, but ultimately most people will be interested in whether they should vote Labour or Conservative.

Also, last time the debates were split between home affars / foreign affairs / the economy, with one debate dedicated to each.

Just because the owner seems nice when you view it, doesn't mean the bike hasn't had a tarnished past (owner prior to the current one might have dropped it, raced it, crashed it etc).

Other things to check are the condition of the chain, brakes and how the engine sounds when it starts. Any clunking or sounds which raise concern are dead giveaways that there is something amiss in the engine - even on a 125 it should be smooth and uniform. Expect a few high revs for the first 5-10 seconds of starting it as the choke may be on longer than normal (especially in this weather) but after that the engine should simmer down and be very smooth; no shudders, sounds of metal hitting each other, struggling to keep revs up etc.

Make sure the bike goes up and down the gearbox okay with no problem and goes back into neutral (bikes are notorious for being awful to get into neutral. Takes a bit of practice but as long as it goes in on the first 3 or 4 tries there is no problem). Personally I would take any bike for a test ride now, but if this is your first bike you may not feel confident enough which is fine - just pull the clutch in (and hold it in!) and shift up through the gears and then back down, with the engine on of course.

My YBR had no high beam until about 3 months in to me riding it when I realized with the darker nights drawing in that high beam was worse than dipped beam!

Please direct your outrage in the appropriate direction. Yes, bad cyclists can be annoying, but in terms of real damage done, they are not the ones you should be mad at.


edit: and if you're interested, figures for pedestrians hit on pavements - 

45 pedestrians a year (7.5%) are hit and killed on the pavement or verge by cars

0.25 people die a year from being hit by a cyclist on the pavement, so 1 every 4 years.

&gt; Empty rhetoric is if he said that lobbying is really bad and all forms of lobbying should be stopped, but then does nothing about it.

&gt; Instead he said ""I think lobbying is good in general, but we need to stop secret lobbying"".

My dictionary defines *rhetoric*, approximately, as [""effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of speech and other compositional techniques"", but also ""…often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content"".](http://i.imgur.com/8NLjR4O.png)

It doesn't matter that you think he's *technically not lying*, he still spoke condemning sleazy lobbying, nevertheless doing the same thing himself now.

In case you didn't notice, [my previous comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2j3lq7/lobbying_camerons_deleted_speech_and_his_jaw/cl84dk8), ""we all know how it works, though. The lunches, the hospitality, the quiet word in your ear, the ex-ministers and ex-advisors for hire, helping big business find the right way to get its way"" - the comment you said you agreed with - were Cameron's own words, copy-pasted from the article.

I do agree with you that we should teach our children to support evidence-based policies and politics, and you might've taken the rhetoric right out my mouth when you wrote that we ""get the politicians we deserve"".

But equally I do feel that view is a little utopian - I've given up, because I can't make the electorate punish bent politicians - and in the meantime, *not being cunts* would help.

I think it's at least the duty of politicians not to be cunts as it is ours not to vote for cunts, and saying ""lobbying is another big issue that we can no longer ignore - it's the next big scandal waiting to happen and we must be the party that sorts all this out"" (quote near verbatim) and then going ahead and doing *exactly the same thing yourself* is indeed pretty cuntish and hypocritical.",0,1413201972,null,0,false,0,cl85byz,t3_2j3lq7,t1_cl85byz,t1_cl84yo3,null,1426551736,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Drogba made a lot of assists, he finished with the most assists one season, second most another season and 4th most in another, which is brilliant for a striker. Also one of the things that makes Drogba one of the greats is the fact he was the ultimate big game player, he's scored 9 goals in cup finals and pretty much all of them were the winners/crucial.

Costa is great but unless he breaks the goalscoring record this season it's unfair to claim he's better than Drogba until he can replicate Drogba in the big games.

it sounds very much like an excuse for the state to put their hands in private individuals pockets...  

There's a public sector and it's absolutely every citizens and government's job to monitor and be involved with it on some level. Even if it's just keeping up to date with what's going on with it. 

Your line of argument feels like the left coming up with excuses to tinker, fiddle and control, which has never ended well for private enterprise and the nations economy has it? if where honest with ourselves... 

Big business's weren't ""ever thus"" they grew from small business's and the people that built them aren't faceless capitalists twisting a moustache and hatching plans to ruin peoples lives..

false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;My dictionary defines rhetoric, approximately, as ""effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of speech and other compositional techniques"", but also ""…often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content"".

I would agree with that definition. Since he didn't exploit figures of speech or compositional techniques, I hardly think that qualifies. He literally said he supported lobbying and didn't like secret lobbying. *It is literally right in his speech*.

So while his speech may be rhetorical (i.e. persuasive speaking) it is not *empty rhetoric*. Empty rhetoric is the Lib Dems promising not to raise tuition fees and then doing it, empty rhetoric is George Bush saying he will not raise taxes and then doing it, empty rhetoric is Obama saying that there will be consequences of Assad using chemical weapons and then doing nothing about it. 

&gt;It doesn't matter that you think he's technically not lying, he still spoke condemning sleazy lobbying, nevertheless doing the same thing himself now.

I do not ""think"" he is not ""technically"" lying. He is *literally* not lying. It is **you** who *thinks* he is technically lying.

I can copy and paste the bit where he literally says he supports lobbying. Can you copy and paste the bit where he out and out says he is against all forms of lobbying? No.

&gt;In case you didn't notice, my previous comment, ""we all know how it works, though. The lunches, the hospitality, the quiet word in your ear, the ex-ministers and ex-advisors for hire, helping big business find the right way to get its way"" - the comment you said you agreed with - were Cameron's own words, copy-pasted from the article. His own fucking words condemn him.

His own words show how the average person will listen for soundbites instead of listening to the content. That doesn't condemn him, that condemns the average person. If you listen to his entire speech the context of his words is obvious. The *secret* lunches, the *secret* hospitality*, the *secret* meetings.

The fact you've chosen to read or listen to the first 3 sentences of his speech and then switch off isn't his fault. The fact he knows you're likely to do it and uses it isn't his fault either, ANY speech shows that audiences are most alert and receptive at the start and the end of the speech. If I was writing a presentation condemning the abuse of children in the middle east I would write it the same way: A good hook at the beginning and a good finisher at the end. 

&gt;I think it's at least the duty of politicians not to be cunts as it is ours not to vote for cunts

When the democracy votes for the dictator though, is it any less democratic?

Seriously, I am not a pro-cunt person, I dislike cunts as much as the next man (wait, what?). If the will of the people though is to elect liars, either traditional liars like the big 3 or new liars like UKIP, then who are we to stop them?

&gt;saying ""lobbying is another big issue that we can no longer ignore - it's the next big scandal waiting to happen and we must be the party that sorts all this out"" (quote near verbatim) and then going ahead and doing exactly the same thing yourself is indeed pretty cuntish and hypocritical.

He was clearly referring to ""secret"" lobbying though if you read the speech in it's entirety. I actually think a lot more needs to be done about *recorded* lobbying not just secret lobbying. The average joe public has no idea their local MP is a director for an arms company and voted in favour of giving arms to the rebels in Syria, not because it isn't recorded, but because they don't know where to find it and the media doesn't really report it. 

I would prefer Cameron not to be in charge, I don't like his politics and I don't agree with his ""vision"" for the UK. At the same time though, if I was a politician would I go into the election with a realistic slogan of ""Well things might get a little better, or a little worse I suppose, but generally not much will change"" or would I go with ""Vote for hope!"".

It also requires that the action committed is one that a reasonable person would do (determined by the jury). There must also be a ""qualified trigger"" that caused the action to take place... Oh and the entire law on provocation only really applies in the case where the victim was killed and is used to determine whether it was pre-meditated murder or manslaughter...

I've had many football (soccer) players and other fans of football in classes through the years. The number one club supported by Americans based upon my informal but almost random sample (some sample bias due to location) is without a doubt Manu followed by Liverpool and Arsenal. I always tell my students I'm a Spurs fan and they look at me inquisitively as if to say ""who is Tot'num and how do you spell it?""

For the first time this year, I met a kid who was 18 in our neighborhood who supports Spurs - the reason: Gareth Bale. I soon met another - same reason.

I wish that Levy and his fellow blokes had any idea how big the BPL was going to be over here, because if he did, he would have never sold Bale. Americans pick their football clubs the same way they pick their NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB clubs. They pick the club that is on TV all the time, that wins, and has fantastic players for whom they look up to. Many of you in London may not realize this, but last year before the season, NBC took out a billboard in Times Square to herald their new BPL coverage and the picture they chose was Gareth Bale. 

Selling Gareth may go down as the biggest blunder in Spurs history. Times are different now and clubs are global. Levy should have given him 200k quid per week, told him that he's building a championship side, AND SPENT 100 MIL ON ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING PLAYERS. Spurs could easily have become the ""Dallas Cowboys"" to America and merchandise sales would have gone through the roof. With the new NBC coverage, many Americans are just now getting into the sport and picking their teams and the big investment would have been chump change compared to the eventual returns from American followers. 

When I went to see Spurs play Liverpool in Baltimore 2 or 3 summers ago, I'd estimate that red fans outnumbered us Lilywhites 3 or 4 to 1. If I needed any more proof of the numbers, the first morning show on NBC at the start of the season last year began with the sprinklers watering the grass at ""hallowed Anfield"" and Rebecca Lowe probably spent 1/4 of the show talking about Liverpool. That could have been Spurs with Gareth Bale. Now, Spurs are rarely in a featured match on TV. We usually have to watch them on NBC's online streaming site. But, you can always watch Liverpool, Manu, Arsenal, and Chelsea. Those will be the clubs that Americans support for many, many years.

Aid often comes with strings-attached - usually this involves high interest rates, or an unfair advantage over other countries when competing for business deals.

Africa pays more in interest than it receives in aid each year, it really goes to show how much development aid plays a part in the global economy. Without aid, I fear, the UK would not be able to secure lucrative business deals, after all other countries are not going to cut off their aid budget because the UK stopped theirs.

Also other ex squaddies I've spoken to (the guy who picked up my car when I broke down, now working for RAC... and more) have found it hard to find work and more importantly to adjust. Those listed jobs have a lot of solid structure which will help with reintegration.
* Slashing foreign aid... Sorry but I don't mind if they cut it, its a small part of the budget yes... but we are cutting Britains out of jobs to save money, I don't think we need ""influence"" in countries that can't even sustain themselves, we aren't an empire anymore, nor are we a charity. Especially when said countries are sending rockets into space. We don't even do that.
* Withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. I would like this to happen. Too many rules coming down from the EU meaning we cannot deport terrorists for example. I would of course like to see said British bill of rights before voting on it though... Just dislike the rules being made in EU.
* Businesses should be able to discriminate in favour of young British workers. - Not sure I pick up the racist tone on this one like you have, British can be black, white, brown or anything, just born in Britain (Which also includes Northern Ireland). Still, despite the fact I Don't find this racist I don't agree with it either. I think we have plans in place, apprenticeships ect, that help Brits get into trades and incentivise employers, we should improve or expand those plans rather than create any discrimination based on nationality alone.

This led him to believe that the flag must have been something they also put on the armor, and that the mummy was a soldier who died in battle. The soldier was ""repairing"" himself because of the device in him, which was somewhat like the chair from earlier that episode. The device held the mummy in life, but to heal the mummy needed energy. He got that energy from the victims, draining the victims from their energy took 66 seconds. In those 66 seconds you could see the mummy because you didn't have the energy that blocked him out of your sight (or something like that, I'm not sure). The heart attack was just a side effect, which led the doctor on board of the train, the not-the-Doctor doctor, believe that the people just had heart attacks. A soldier won't kill you if you surrender, that's against the rules of war, so when the Doctor realized he was a soldier he surrendered so the mummy wouldn't be able to kill him, which caused the mummy to not have enough energy, which is why he died. Then the Doctor took the thing inside the mummy that kept him alive, and tried to disable it, while the train was being drained from air. Next scene they were on that planet, where the Doctor explains that he tried hacking Gus out of the TARDIS so they could leave the train, but that made Gus explode the train.

lying

ˈlʌɪɪŋ/Submit

adjective

not telling the truth.


Here is what he said in his speech:

&gt;What’s more, when it’s open and transparent, when people know who is meeting who, for what reason and with what outcome, lobbying is perfectly reasonable.

...

&gt;It’s important that businesses, charities and other organisations feel they can make sure their voice is heard. And indeed, lobbying often makes for better, more workable, legislation. But I believe that it is increasingly clear that lobbying in this country is getting out of control.

...

&gt;We don’t know who is meeting whom. We don’t know whether any favours are being exchanged. We don’t know which outside interests are wielding unhealthy influence. This isn’t a minor issue with minor consequences. 

...

&gt;I believe that secret corporate lobbying, like the expenses scandal, goes to the heart of why people are so fed up with politics. 

...

&gt;We can’t go on like this. I believe it’s time we shone the light of transparency on lobbying in our country and forced our politics to come clean about who is buying power and influence.

**THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID**

No where there does he say he's against lobbying, and in fact goes to lengths to support it. No where does he lie and say he's against lobbying and then does it. 

He SAYS he is against SECRET LOBBYING and that his party should ""do something about it"" and then says they should ""come clean"" about who is buying influence.

Therefore, if he is recording all the people he meets and that information is publicly available, HE IS DOING WHAT HE SAID.

I'm sorry but you're the one who has some weird definition of lying not me. At no point in that speech does he lie. 

My personal opinion is that even ""above board"" lobbying has too much say in this country, but it is possible for me to think that and also think that Cameron hasn't been hypocritical in this speech. You know why? Because he hasn't done anything other than he literally said.

There are a million things you can beat Cameron round the head with, so I don't see why you're trying so hard to make this one of them when, sadly, it's not. ",0,1413207730,null,0,false,0,cl86x1i,t3_2j3lq7,t1_cl86x1i,t1_cl869oe,null,1426550997,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,spiffytheseal,England,Bristol/Bath - YBR125/CBF600,"You can ask!

I am 22 and only just started riding my YBR 6 months ago. For my uses, it's absolutely fine - I haven't encountered anything where the YBR struggles. I frequently use dual carriageways and it holds its own in 60mph traffic. I have taken a passenger off the public highway and it doesn't struggle with that either (I expect it would when I get up to motorway speeds, but my experience is up to 30mph, which it actually deals with fine). So on that account - a 125 for my purposes at this moment is perfect. Cheap, cheerful and gets me where I want to go in a fun and thrilling way (and that's what it's about!). I would like to give short lifts to a pillion and do away with the L plates - my main drivers for wanting to do some type of license.

The main reason I am not taking an A2 is that I am not looking to use a school to do it. Whereas an A2 course will set me back £450-£600 with the schools around here, taking the A1 on my YBR will cost me ~£120 fully inclusive of theory, Mod1 and Mod2 test costs. Even if I fail Mod1 or Mod2, I would still come in less than half price of the cost of an A2.

Because I am not looking to upgrade my bike because I feel my YBR is more than sufficient for what I use it for, it seems a waste of my money to do an A2 course only to do DAS in a year and a half when I have 2 years riding under my belt. The A1 will only be temporary - as would the A2 - because I fully intend to do DAS when I can and have a much bigger selection of bike to choose from.

&gt;Lowering the top tax rate this is actually a good policy. People forget that a lot of welathy people actually provide jobs.

The less they are taxed, the more they can spend on expansion and creation of job jobs. There's no point pissing off all the wealthy people, as it just hits the poor employees eventually.
This however won't make any difference if we keep sending the jobs to China.

&gt;Abolishing the Department of Energy I totally agree with this. emissions are being phased out anyways by the hydrogen cars being phased in. Theres little benefit to tax the hell out of people for the next 25 year when we are already elimiating out emissions anyways.

&gt;Slashing Foreign Aid. Another thing I agree with. I personally think foreign aid is sent to stop those countries for prosecuting us for the Slave trade. 

On top of this Africa has been just as poor, and even worse in the 70 years we have been sending money, most of it is embezzled, and it has never made any change.
If you want to help Africa, they will have to help themselves. send them spades and vegetable seeds. it funny how all these starving people have mobile phones but no food?
Send them tools, not money.

&gt;Withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court
It doesn't matter which party you vote for in this situation, hey are all going to change it. I only hope the new version will be better, but as any native Englishman knows.. that not going to be the case.
I don;t think some part of the act should be changed. Like that terrorist who spent 10 year screwing around with the justice system before we actually managed to deport him.

&gt;businesses should be able to discriminate in favour of young British workers Yes, we are unfortunately not a charity for the whole world to live off. Charity tats at home. We do not owe jobs and a high standard of living to the entire planet. they have their own countries to go and develop. I'm not saying immigration should be stopped all-together, but we definitely need to stop the people taking the piss.

As for the jobs for soldiers. hmm.. I don't agree with it. We all have problems finding jobs, not just soldiers. and whilst I respect them for defending the country, you have to be realistic and look at the situation of all people.

I do agree with the 2 child policy. If you don;t have money then you should have thought about that long before you brought a child into a life of poverty. It's shameful and despicable in my opinion.
we have contraception, and abortion. I also think abortion should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances. and they people who have kids should take responsibility, and even be castrated if they repeatedly have children, knowing full well that the child will suffer in poverty.
(I would even call it a type of abuse). which sounds harsh, but look at the life the kid will have. a constant up-hill struggle, and the whole system stacked against them. That's a horrible thing to do to another human being. and there's no excuse for it.
I probably sound like the SS now, but I do honestly admit, that I take a hard line against people who can;t be bothered to look after their children properly.

One other thing. I'm really angry that India gets aid from us. They've just financed a space mission, and have millions of poor people. our money was not given to be spent on space missions. this is a prime example of how our aid is badly abused.
Not to mention corrupt authorities stealing medicals supplies in Africa.

I know immigration is a sensitive thing, but I place my opinion here as I really don't care about down-votes.

Immigration can be good. but I think it's been abused by Europe. Germans have even admitted to telling people to go to England, and I know for my jobcentre friend that some people are ACTUALLY PAID to come here.

England has been used as a dumping ground for shitheads that don't want to work. and therefore countries in the EU have been using it as a way to get rid of their non-productive citizens.

I am not saying this is all of them, In fact I've met some really good Polish guys who just want a better life.
but despite this, almost 70% of foreigners I have met in my city, are definitely here just to live on benefits and work illegally. that's got to stop.

People should be allowed to come here to work. but you will need to speak the language (even for health and safety reason) and I don;t think you should get any benefits or healthcare until you been paying in for 5 years.
The way we know you are committed. There's nothing to stop foreign people buying medical insurance as they often do in their own countries. and coming here just to have children is yet another costly example of how people are taking the piss.

I also think this rule should be applied to everyone, even America.
A lot of Americans want to come here, with good intentions to work, and they are hindered by the EU  immigration quota.
The policy is messed up and it needs fixing badly.

I also think if you want to marry a forgen person, it should be fine, but you will have to look after that person and feed them regardless of how much money you make. IF you can feed them, send them home. if the government has to deport them, they will be black listed until they pay the deportation price.

They should be given work permits, but no benefits until they have been here for 5 years.
The policy should be the same for everyone. but it should also be reasonable.

&gt; Edit    
I challenge anybody who down-voted this to express your own opinion, and explain why you weren't happy with it. Only gimps down-vote without discussing it first.

I'm sick of Reddit shit hiding behind their keyboards.

It's true.  He levels exactly the same criticism at Westminster.  

They just announced in the UK they would want to cap future families to child benefit for 2 children, that the welfare safety net has turned into 'a hammock' for some.   At the same time they plan to slim down excess labour so there are more jobs, increase personal allowance beyong any of the other 3 parties, significantly cut energy and food prices - so wages go a lot further so benefits can come down.

The UK gets exactly the same treatment - but again, this was to an American audience.

&gt;__Guillain–Barré syndrome__ (__GBS__) (French pronunciation: ​[ɡiˈlɛ̃ baˈʁe], English pronunciation: /ˈɡiːjænˈbɑreɪ/), sometimes __Landry's paralysis__ or __Guillain–Barré–Strohl syndrome__, is an acute [polyneuropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy), a disorder affecting the [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system). [Ascending paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_paralysis), weakness beginning in the feet and hands and migrating towards the trunk, is the most typical symptom, and some subtypes cause change in sensation or pain, as well as [dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia). It can cause life-threatening complications, in particular if the [respiratory muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscles_of_respiration) are affected or if the [autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system) is involved. The disease is usually triggered by an infection.

Labour fucked us
Tories fucked us
Comdems fucked us.

Farage seems to be the only one who MAYBE remotely honest. and his policies are hardline in some cases, but quite reasonable in others.

I drive a car for work, so obviously I;m not going to vote Greenpeace, as i can;t afford £9 per liter, or what-ever they will charge.

So, the best solution (with good logic0 is UKip.

all other parties are a bit too hardline. I;m not a BNP or EDL supporter even though, I do actually agree with SOME of their policies.

the truth is that England is pretty much fucked now, and the only alternative I have to the lying deceitful snake Cameron, is UKip.

For the vast majority of the ""ordinary people"" they claim to represent, Inheritance Tax isn't an issue. Inheritance Tax provides ~0.8% of government income, so eliminating it isn't a good idea.

- **Lowering the top tax rate by making a new 35p rate and lowering the existing rate to 40p.** Again this does not have any benefit other than to assist the wealthy and lose further government income.

- **Abolishing the Department of Energy and Climate Change and scrapping green subsidies, as well as scrapping the climate change act (2008).** This is largely against concensus, aimed to appeal to those who know no better.  Scrapping the Climate Change Act and DoE would be ridiculous. I do think that there should be a re-evaluation of how ""green subsidies"" are actually utilised.

- **Guaranteeing those who have served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years a job in the police force, prison service or border force.** There's not reason to suggest why those who have served in the Armed Forces would make good police officers, prison guards or border workers. I think another attempt to latch on to the ""Help for Heroes"" type sentiment.

- **Slashing Foreign Aid.** I notice they've moved on from wanting to abandon foreign aid entirely to just ""slashing"" it. I think it works out on average that the Foreign/Developmental Aid budget costs a taxpayer about £1 a week. Combine that with a bit of education about what the foreign aid budget is used for and people should be more inclined to support it.

- **Withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights**. Any British Bill of Rights would likely be identical to that of the ECHR but with the caveat that it's responsibilties can snaked out of a lot more easily.

The aid doesn't go directly to the government, what happens is UK NGOs get given the money so they can go and provide services to improve people's lives. It actually is just an injection into the UK 'third sector', and all the contractors / employees / UK based services they use. So we are paying ourselves to help other people.

We shouldn't have to do this, but India's government doesn't. And if it wasn't aid, we'd probably just inject it into another exercise such as the military industrial complex.

The original theory behind it was that countries like india were dirt poor and there was plenty of opportunity to improve their economies and the people's lives - building roads, hospitals, etc. - but they just couldn't afford it and were already borrowing as much as they possibly could.

Nowadays it's more because these countries don't want / don't care about helping themselves, so prosperous nations continue to invest to improve people's lives and futures.

* ""Introduce binding local planning referendums on major decisions, such as out-of-town or large-scale supermarket developments, wind turbines, incinerators, solar farms, major housing developments and transport schemes like HS2.""

There's a summary of UKIP's localism policies on [this page](http://planningblog.planningresource.co.uk/2013/05/03/ukips-planning-pledges/), the quote above is verbatim from the full [2014 local manifesto PDF] (http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5308a93901925b5b09000002/attachments/original/1397750311/localmanifesto2014.pdf?1397750311).

This basically means that central government would be unable to build railway lines or solve the housing crisis because UKIP promises to give NIMBYs the power to veto all developments.

How could central government ever build a motorway or a power-station? Who wants a sewage works in their backyard?

UKIP doesn't want us to live without power stations or new towns, but they're basically promising they won't build them, either. 

The UKIP circlejerk subreddit was quite outraged a couple of weeks ago, when Farage said, sorrily, [""we'll have to lose some of our liberty to fight ISIS"",](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxtglcmGOxE) like it was a betrayal of all the libertarianism they stand for.

Binding referendums to veto on all local development seems an even more obviously false promise, to me - I cannot see how it could possibly be kept.

At some point Farage would have to say ""come on, it's common sense we need this new power station"", and it's for that very reason we allow the home office to overrule local objections sometimes.

If you're too lazy to actually look at the statistics and science behind it, it's not everyone else's problem. Don't drag us kicking and screaming back into the 20th century because you lack the ability to place world events in a larger context.

The two biggest nuclear incidents the world has seen were in plants that were built before the internet was invented or personal computers were commercially available. Even taking those into account, deaths and environmental damage due to nuclear are *dwarfed* by the fallout from fossil fuels. 

&gt;why aren't we working towards that instead of building more nuclear stations...?

I can't believe an adult (I assume you are an adult) would even ask a question that infantile. Of course we are working towards better renewables. Apart from the fact that existing industrial interests and lobbyists are pushing governments not to invest in renewables, and that they are currently nowhere near efficient enough to compete, we are investing *huge* amounts of money into them. 

That doesn't change the fact that we can't just invent an entire power grid and supply system and replace our existing century-old power generation infrastructure with new technology overnight. This is a monumental undertaking - perhaps one of the biggest humanity will ever carry out.

And in the interim, what do we do? Just fuck about with coal, which we know is hugely damaging and inefficient? Continue sucking oil from increasingly inconvenient caverns, painting our oceans black on the way? Or do we move to build zero-carbon nuclear plants with waste that can actually be *managed?*

And again, the fundamental problem with renewables as we currently use them is that they cannot provide a constant, reliable level of output, and are heavily localised. The amount of power the national grid loses through the transportation of electricity is *insane*. 

Solar power is not only *off* 50% of the time, it can only provide power economically to areas near the panels. Without massive advancements in storage or transportation, it's useless to over half the world's population.

Wind power suffers the same problems, except wind is even less predictable than sun. You either don't have enough when you need it, or you have astronomical costs associated with getting rid of the surplus energy it generates for local grids that can't handle the excess.

Wave power is definitely promising, as most of the Western world's population lives reasonably close to a coastline, but it's the least developed technology we have so far, and maintenance costs are almost entirely prohibitive - not even close to being competitive without government subsidies.",0,1413211045,null,0,1413211739,0,cl885ae,t3_2j19kc,t1_cl885ae,t1_cl876al,null,1426550423,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You still have lots of training sessions, lots of gym work. I don't think 30+ hours a week is a bad lower estimate. I was okay with about 15 hours (*maybe* up to 20 on some weeks where I did stuff on Saturdays) when I was regularly playing but even then I had to occasionally drop some other exercises once in a while (maybe drop the running and if it was really bad, stop lifting/strength exercises for a couple of weeks).

This also comes down to depth and rotation. You should not have to rely on one player and having a good squad is a part of that. Would you seriously expect someone to play 50/60 games from August to May? I think Oscar played something ridiculous like 60+ games for Chelsea a couple of years ago, that's insane in 9 months and that's not counting internationals, that could easily be another 10, maybe 15. Say it goes up to 80 games in 9 months. About 2 matches per week for about 38 weeks of the year, on top of everything else? Travelling too.....

Fuck that. Rest the player for when you need them, you should be able to cope. If you need that one player every game to get stuff done then maybe you need to get a few transfers done if possible.

Officially they were single party leaders in 1910 as well, but they needed Irish Nationalist and Labour support for some policies to pass through. This sounds worse than it was - Labour and Liberals were natural allies, and Irish Nationalists agreed with everything if they thought Home Rule would be the result    
I know some historians argue Liberals were in terminal decline during that time period (Dangerfield), but I can't agree. Had Asquith held a general election in 1914 it would probably have resulted in a hung Parliament, with the Liberals continuing with Lab/Irish Nationalists support, which is not a bad result. Not many parties can stay in power for long periods of time, and it would probably have been 12 straight years after that election.     
What really tore the party apart was the War. Asquith was a shite war-time leader, and permanently damaged the reputation of the party. To compound this, Lloyd George decided to stage his coup and formally tear the party apart - the Asquithians and the Lloyd-George Liberals were never properly reunited. Lloyd George did what he thought was best for the country, but it was not in the best interest of the party.

**Housing and planning**

– UKIP will protect the Green Belt. 

– Planning rules in the NPPF will be changed to make it easier to build on brownfield sites instead of greenfield sites.  Central government is to list the nationally available brownfield sites for development and issue low-interest bonds to enable decontamination.

– Houses on brownfield sites will be exempt from Stamp Duty on first sale and VAT relaxed for redevelopment of brownfield sites.

– Planning Permission for large-scale developments can be overturned by a referendum triggered by the signatures of 5% of the District or Borough electors collected within three months.

**Democracy and the Constitution**

– UKIP will overcome the unfairness of MPs from devolved nations voting on English-only issues.

– UKIP supports the recall of MPs as was originally promised in the Coalition Agreement, whereby 20% of the electorate in a constituency must sign a recall petition within eight weeks. The approval of MPs will not be required to initiate a recall petition.

– UKIP will introduce the Citizens’ Initiative to allow the public to initiate national referendums on issues of major public interest.

false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"&gt; abolishing inheritance tax

I agree. The thing to remember is that **all tax is bad**. If we could live in a world where we magic the money up with no inflationary impacts without taxation, we would be better off.

But unfortunately, that's not feasible. People don't like the government borrowing money (e.g. *agreeing* with wealthy people to use their money cheaply) and prefer taxing people (e.g. forcibly removing people's money from them).

Everyone complains about 'muuh taxes' but a tax is by definition a **compulsory payment** with no obligation for anything in return. There is no and never has been any grounds to complain about taxes based on what you get - that's not part of the deal. You pay tax, or you go to prison, that's the deal.

So, given that tax is damaging, lets be economical about this. One objective is to maximize aggregate utility (lets not worry too much about the non-transferability of individual utility at this point, that's for a more detailed analysis and actually does not impact the general direction of my conclusion).

So to maximise utility we want to:

* minimise taxes where we can
* focus on the most damaging taxes for minimisation
* if possible, swap damaging taxation for less-damaging taxation

In order of most, to least damaging taxation:

- tax on first earned income = tax on first money spent
- tax on last money spent
- tax on last earned income
- tax on non-spent wealth (savings, equity, etc.)
- tax on inherited wealth

essentially, the more you add taxes on 'activity' the more damaging to the economy. This is because it impairs economic activity, it makes it more costly to hire people, to work for someone, to buy something or to do something.

However, wealth taxes aren't anywhere near as damaging. They are still bad, but not *as* damaging. So if we let someone keep 100% of their income, but taxed them some of their net wealth at the end of every year and indeed taxed heavily on inheritance, we would maximize aggregate utility.

Additionally, borrowing is often 'cheaper' than the negative cost of taxing. That's because if you borrow over 30 years at 1.5% it's a very small cost to service that borrowing, compared to the knock on impacts, year after year, of charging people 20% more on everything then spend.

n.b. although this is a theoretical discussion of what would be the best in a mechanical, economic sense it does not account for the human factor. People don't *like* the idea of wealth taxes. It feels more like theft than taxes on spending or taxes on income (even though they have a far greater impact on your livelihood and the economy). Additionally, it is easier to avoid tax on wealth - simply move your wealth to the cayman islands! Or hide it under your bed. Having to pay 20% more on every penny you spend however, you can't avoid that. However, of wealth taxes, inheritance tax is one that can be *relatively easily* enforced, so in a perfect world we should do so.",0,1413212129,null,0,false,0,cl88lgk,t3_2j3y3j,t1_cl88lgk,t3_2j3y3j,null,1426550214,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Alas, much of what people write in the media about the TTIP is simply garbage. The fact of the matter is, we don't know what it's going to contain yet as they haven't finished negotiating it. Because of this, we have to get our knowledge directly from the sources, or the sporadic leaks that are coming out every couple of months. With that said, there is *nothing* to indicate that there is going to be anything which makes it easier for private firms to buy out public services. In particular, there is nothing that can force the government to privatize anything. At worst, they just have to provide the same level of access and open up some markets, very akin to how the 3rd EU Postal Directive required governments to give up monopolies in certain areas (such as giving up the monopoly on small letters, I believe it was), which the British government used as an excuse to privatize the postal service instead, despite there being absolutely no requirement to do so.

If there are privatizations that happen, it won't be because of the TTIP, but rather because the government chose to do it. You can read the EU negotiating mandate [here](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11103-2013-DCL-1/en/pdf), and see for yourself that there's nothing egregiously abusive of the public interest contained within.

They've never looked so bad. The point I keep trying to reiterate (and which Ukip supporters here and elsewhere consistently have no answer to) is that it's not Ukip's policies that are bad in and of themselves. It is the fact that Ukip attracts people who believe those policies (largely incorrectly) to be ones that will stop all immigration to the UK and/or will mean that legal immigrants will be kicked out of the country.

Neither of those things are in any way Ukip policy, but if you were to go to Clacton or Heywood or Rochester or anywhere else with very high Ukip support, and ask people why they were voting for Ukip, the vast majority would say they're doing so because Ukip ""will sort out immigration"".",0,1413213490,null,0,false,0,cl8975a,t3_2j1nov,t1_cl8975a,t1_cl88gbd,null,1426549933,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

What you do is cope. What choice do you have? All the people you mention have one resource without which I'd be lost - the internet. Even if all they have is a smartphone, they have access to the supermarket's websites, with their store finder. Google or Bing maps will pinpoint the nearest bus stops and tel you what services use them. Even single mums and carers get a couple of hours a week off. You take an interest in where you shop and what you shop for and you make time to check the place out. Over the years (and it has took years), you build up a picture of where the nicer branches are, when your usual branches mark down their stock (I fucking love the cheapy shelves!) and which branches to go to for different things.

An example: We're blessed to have over 20 ""big five"" supermarkets in easy travelling distance. Most of them are small and crap. There's one or two each which are huge, but one of them might have a very small selection of clothes and homewares, where the other might have a big selection. One branch might have a good variety of savoury snacks and sandwich ingredients, so you'd go there for the kids packed lunches.

Sure, public transport is patchy to put it kindly, and not everyone lives in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, etc, with easy access to every shop imaginable, but unless you're stuck way out in the sticks, the chances are there's *some* choice and *some* way of getting out and about on a regular basis.

I never wanted to send the message that people who aren't doing what I do aren't trying hard enough. I always say that what I do probably won't work for anyone else. The point I was making is that it's really not too difficult to disprove the point of the article, just using an example of one shopping trip in one shop, and it's not hard to eat heartily (if not amazingly healthily) on a tight budget.

not everyone has the opportunity to do things the way I described. Most of our friends despair over how fiddly and particular we are over what we shop for and where, but those same friends are the ones who keep asking how we cope.

The party was too divided and apart from free trade lacked an ideological base to tie the party together. Free trade by the late 20s was being questioned by many within the Liberal Party itself (I'd name names but I'm away from my books), undermining the only solid underpinning of the party both electorally and internally. Even the rivalry between Asquith (whose poor war leadership was more  a public perception due to his insistence on maintaining his peacetime schedule than the lack of a war cabinet etc IMO) and Lloyd George was as much an internal/ideological dispute between the New Liberalism and the more Orthodox Gladstonianism as it was a bitter rivalry between two political titans. That's not to say of course that the Liberals fell solely due to internal disputes (I've written a 10000 word paper on the subject, and even that wasn't enough to cover even a fraction of the ongoing debate), but the fragmented nature of the Party certainly hindered its ability to reorganise itself.

false,Treskol,null,null,"I agree the party was struggling, but I'm still unsure as to why it just died.   
The start of the 20th Century was a politically turbulent time for everyone, not just the Liberals. The Conservatives struggled too to reinvent themselves in the post-Salisbury era, and the basis for an ideological base was there in theory with the Welfare Reforms that they had promised to introduce in the election. It was ... strange that they couldn't form a base off of them; the election of 1906 showed they had a strong public backing for them and that normally shuts up rebellious MPs.    
In many ways MacDonald's National Government mirrored the Liberal Coalition 1915-1922. The struggles the 1930 Labour Party experienced were (arguably) greater than the struggled the 1914 Liberal Party faced. The ILP broke off, the leader MacDonald was expelled, Mosley had created his Mosleyites and they had a massive 20 MPs. Barring not being expelled, that isn't terribly different from Lloyd George and Asquith. Why did it kill the Liberal Party and not the Labour Party? True, MacDonald was no Lloyd George, but Scripps and Attlee were no more effective parliamentarians than Asquith.                     
The death of the Liberal Party must then come down to voting bases. The Conservatives had the middle/upper classes, Labour had the working class. The Liberals lost their voting base, therefore, as they offered inferior proposals than Labour did. I guess parliamentary parties struggle without any votes, who knew.

Fair enough

&gt;This is compounded by the assertion that ""it's a one off"" when yet another elected ukip representative makes a racist comment

It usually is a one off, it's just that because it's a UKIP official saying it, it gets infinitely more attention than if another party offical said it.

For example, When Godfrey Bloom said ""bongo bongo land"" as a throwaway generic ""foreign"" country name for his example of where foreign aid goes, he was derided as a racist and the thread on it recieved hundreds of comments and upvotes.

When John Prescott called Chuka Umunna ""chumbawumba"" people here made excuses for it, when you know that no such excuses would be made for a UKIP official saying it.

&gt;On the other hand, why are those that are pro UKIP so against them being in the news? Are the things they say worth getting embarrassed about? Perhaps of you are embarrassed by the opinions of a party member it should be taken into account when voting for them?

Because a dispropotianite amount of publicity on UKIP is negative, and no, this isn't because UKIP is somehow ""worse"" than other parties.

It's calmed down a lot now, but in the runup to the EU elections especially, there was a massive hate campaign by the media and the main parties.

Even today, there's still a lot of baseless hatred from the media towards UKIP (this [article](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/farage-manifesto-lies-how-ukip-4417649) comparing them to the Nazis for example), but I think they've mostly learned their lesson from the EU elections that it doesn't really damage UKIP so much as enhance it's ""Underdog"" status.

&gt;The National Health Service

&gt;UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.

&gt;We will stop further use of PFI in the NHS and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where this is affordable.

&gt;We will ensure that GPs’ surgeries are open at least one evening per week, where there is demand for it.

&gt;UKIP opposes plans to charge patients for visiting their GP.

&gt;We will ensure that visitors to the UK, and migrants until they have paid NI for five years, have NHS-approved private health insurance as a condition of entry to the UK, saving the NHS £2bn pa. UKIP will commit to spending £200m of the £2bn saving to end hospital car parking charges in England.

&gt;We will replace Monitor and the Care Quality Commission with elected county health boards to be more responsive scrutineers of local health services. These will be able to inspect health services and take evidence from whistle-blowers.

&gt;UKIP opposes the sale of NHS data to third parties.

&gt;We will ensure foreign health service professionals coming to work in the NHS are properly qualified and can speak English to a standard acceptable to the profession.

&gt;UKIP will amend working time rules to give trainee doctors, surgeons and medics the proper environment to train and practise.

&gt;There will be a duty on all health service staff to report low standards of care.

I think it's safe to say that Batman would consider killing the Doctor as a pre-emptive strike to prevent any possible lapses in the Doctors character. 

The thing about Bruce Wayne is that he doesn't kill, it's part of his code, but what has always made him a dangerous adversary to those who are his equals or superiors is that at the end of the day Bruce Wayne is a mentally unstable nutjob with an incredible mind and the resources and talent to do just about anything. He is capable of killing almost everyone in the JLU except Superman and likely Wonder Woman. It's that knowledge that someday the Bat may snap and go ballistic on everyone that keeps people wary of him. To say the Doctor poses no threat isn't overly accurate. The Doctor gets more people killed in the run of an adventure than we like to admit. The Doctor is a dangerous man, many of the conflicts that have happened on Earth were the direct result of the Doctor being here so often. His foes found him here and decided to punish those the Doctor cares about. Beyond his own capabilities the Doctor is a threat to earth simply by being here.

Honestly, I only started watching soccer/football after the 2010 World Cup (23 y/o here), and a buddy of mine turned me on to Spurs after Gareth Bale tore apart Maicon at the San Siro. 

I followed Spurs casually for the rest of the year, and when they signed Clint Dempsey in the summer, I was hooked. I bought Fox Soccer on my cable and learned as much as I could about the squad. 

(Quickly fell in love with Huddy, Siggy, Walker, and Hugo/Old Man Friedel, on top of the obvious Bale man-crush.)

By that point, I was hooked on the team as much as any individual player, and I'm still supporting them now that nearly every major player from ""my"" first team has moved on.

TL;DR - WC 2010 got me into the game, Bale got me interested in Spurs, Dempsey got me committed, and the squad got me hooked.

Of course the very poor will not be affected by this, but its not just the poor and the rich who we should be concerned about. The majority of people in this country are somewhere in the middle, and those people are increasingly struggling to maintain their standard of living. The majority of people in this country are getting poorer, and that is a very bad sign for an economy. Its easy to say that people should be grateful for what they have, and that many people have it worse off, but that's missing the point. 

Grandma in your little story doesn't have a small fortune, she has an average estate built up over many years to pass on to her family, who all now are much worse off than she was while she was their age, and who have very little hope of ever saving as much as she did. Avoiding paying tax is not illegal or immoral, in fact she is making a sacrifice for her family, to help them during these hard economic times, so that they may have a hope of having the opportunities in life that she had. 

This isn't about the rich getting richer. Its about trying to stop those in the middle getting poorer.

I do see gold very much as an inflation hedge - I followed the 2008 financial crisis quite closely while I was in college and I'm not confident that the banks could withstand a similar deflation of asset bubbles today - which given government insurance of bank accounts and the precedent of QE/lowering of interest rates doesn't give me a huge amount of confidence that my savings in a bank account will always be earning interest in excess of inflation.

I also see equities as overvalued at the moment, though I would like to begin taking a position in the future - I'm lead to understand I should not try and time the market, but regardless I don't think I'm in the financial position given my savings goals where I should be taking a position yet in any case.

The current price drop is probably linked to the slowdown in Europe and China, since oil hasn't suddenly got cheaper to get out of the ground.  China, in particular, has been one of the countries best able to buy high price oil, largely thanks to consumers there taking on vast amounts of debt.  They now look to be approaching debt saturation, so their ability to afford high price oil is diminishing.

This isn't ideal, because the cost of *extracting* oil from the ground has been increasing by about 10% a year since 2005.  It would appear that consumers are reaching the point where they can no longer afford to pay the high cost required to extract the marginal barrel.  This will impact production negatively, likely soon.  Oil majors are  already focussing on capital efficiency as opposed to exploration and development.

So yes, while oil prices may end up falling for the next year or so, it probably won't last, because supply will contract, price will shoot up, and we'll have ourselves another oil shock and recession.

Your reply is an example of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. Banks are better capitalised than they have been for some time. 

Behind the scenes there have been serious efforts made since 2008, including the offloading of significant books of bad loans/property, general de-leveraging across the board, and so on. Not to mention the Basel regulations put in place by the EU.

Have a look at the [2013 Barclays Equity Gilt Study](http://lwmconsultants.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130221-Barclays-Equity-Gilt-Study-2013-%E2%80%93-58th-Edition.pdf), which examines asset class returns since 1899.

Bank accounts aren't supposed to give an inflation hedge. Historically cash has barely (if at all) outpaced inflation. In the previous 113 years cash has produced a ""real"" (after inflation) return of ~0.6% PA. In the last ten years this has been -0.2%.

Over the same period equities have produced an average real return of 5.0% PA.

Gold isn't included in the study, but was referenced in the [Credit Suisse 2012 asset yearbook](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/07/equities-inflation-idUSL5E8D738S20120207) as having produced a real return of only 1.0% PA since 1900

I would re-iterate my previous point about the recommended reading in the FAQ, and maybe have a look at the ""I have £x"" section, as the general order of priority for what to do with money is the same whether you're talking about lump sums or regular investments.

Perhaps if you have a particular desire to invest in gold do so, but consider doing so with only a small portion of your investable assets (perhaps 5% or so), and on the understanding that you are not investing in an asset which will produce a return, only that you are hoping someone else will pay more for it than you have.

If you do want to hold gold or other commodities, there are relatively low-cost ETCs that can be bought as a proxy to actually having to buy/look after your own. Some are genuinely asset backed and some aren't, so DYOR and try to make sure you're not inadvertently buying a basket of derivatives.",0,1413220244,null,0,false,0,cl8ci9n,t3_2j2erm,t1_cl8ci9n,t1_cl8bgkm,null,1426548318,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Are you into craft ales? Quite a nice culture for that in Colchester! There is a beer festival here a few times a year - including vegan beer! (And vegan curry usually)

&gt;The only guideline cases relate to one-punch manslaughter and motor manslaughter (see below) as opposed to involuntary manslaughter generally.

&gt;Single punch manslaughter cases:

&gt;R v Furby [2006] 2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 8 - guideline case
Appellant and deceased were good friends.  For a reason that the court regarded as an explicable reaction, the appellant struck a single punch of moderate force to the right cheek, the deceased collapsed to the ground and died due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage.  Appellant of good character.  Sentence reduced to 12 months imprisonment.  Case law cited confirms that if there are aggravating circumstances the sentence could be as high as four years.

&gt;Attorney General''s Ref No.64 of 2008 (Wyatt) [2009] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 59
Single punch manslaughter case of  unprovoked attack by offender with a record of yobbery.

On the occasion of groups being invited to contribute to something or other about the Act, it was only those from among the ""for"" half that were invited (to an extent that makes sense, but still a bit iffy).     
Eventually most if not all of the professional groups aligned against the Act even though in principle they agreed that the NHS needed reform of some kind (what ~70 massive institution doesn't?).

MPs in the main ignored the professional bodies' dissent and voted in the Act.

I wrote to my (then) LD MP about the Act just before the final commons vote. I didn't ask him to change his mind but rather I asked why, in his opinion, the various professional bodies - the RCP, the RCN etc. etc. - were all against the Act in its current form. My justification for asking was that they are en masse an intelligent group of people, they have the interests of patients at heart and that they cannot all be totally misinformed. There must be a reasonable explanation for their being against it?

I got back a ""Thank you for your email. This is why the vote is important etc."" copy/paste reply.

I would also like to see another set of companions that are not involved with or related to each other.

I'd agree with this for the most part, but we're not talking about the EU Elections, it's the general elections in which UKIP hold a grand total of one seat, for a whole week, in their 20 year history.

false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"Sure, though I'd better keep it fairly short.

I'm a socialist, which probably speaks volumes about my thoughts regarding globalisation. My dad was a union leader for many years back in the 70s and got the big shaft from the Tory govt in the 80s. When I got into politics it was very much as an anti-Thatcher / Major / Tory generally, and like many others crowed mightily when Blair got in, though things changed pretty quickly when the direction of his 3rd way became clear. 

Privatisation was just the beginning: I worked with a lot of people who had come from the mines, the car factories, BT, you name it. There was such bitterness and anger, even hatred towards the Tory government, and then to see Blair continue the trend... It was a bit of a wake up call for me. Then of course the second Iraq war, Enron and Bush's cabinet. They weren't even bothering to hide their motives by this point.

I left the Labour party, joined the Lib Dems for a bit, then they sacked Charles Kennedy, appointed Ming over Hughes (the latter may not have been a bad thing with hindsight) and demoted a lot of other MPs that professed to ""alternative"" lifestyles. In a hissy fit I joined the Greens, read Lucas' book (Green Alternatives to Globalisation) which was admittedly full of daft ideas but got me reading about other stuff. Basically I got turned further and further away from globalisation, and I was never a fan to begin with.

What drives me politically speaking is the idea of a fair society, with publicly owned services and private companies that pay their fair share. If Tescos and Vodaphone buggered off elsewhere because they refuse to pay their taxes then that opens the door for smaller businesses with different ideas. To have MPs or lords who answer to bodies other than the general public is not democratic, it's not good for society in general and is a clear conflict of interest.

The theory of globalisation may be sound, but in practise it means that a politician can act according to the organisation that is most likely to offer him or her the most benefits. To see John Major join the Carlyle group after leaving office makes me question his motives while PM. To see Cameron and Blair acting as arms dealers while in office leaves a particularly bitter taste in the mouth. And to see Blunkett campaign for ID cards provided for by the company whose board he sat on... Well, all these things are done pretty much in the name of globalisation. Those of us who decry it are seen as hindering progress, or unpatriotic, or some kind of loony. Yet I subscribe to the view that being pro-globalisation basically gives someone a license to be a crook. Not everyone *is* a crook, of course, but there are plenty that make Richard Nixon look pretty fucking saintly.

Finally, globalisation (I believe) makes it all too easy for big business to exploit their workers. I don't think that Nike, Apple, Nokia, whoever, would find it quite so easy to set up sweatshops in Bangladesh and then snigger quietly when the factory collapses if the world wasn't so pro-globalisation. By limiting the power of a corporation and ensuring better regulation the lives of the workers and their families could be significantly improved. Even if it's just basic healthcare or a better wage. But no, globalisation allows Big Business to do pretty much what they want outside of the US and Europe.

Shit, so much for keeping it short!

      ""Planning rules in the NPPF will be changed to make it easier to build on brownfield sites 
       instead of greenfield sites.  Central government is to list the nationally available brownfield

What they note is that the Campaign For The Protection Of Rural England estimates that there is enough brown land for 1.5 million homes.  Civitas estimates it at 2.5 million homes.  They want to provide low interest loans and government decontamination grants.   

You don't need large new sprawling housing estates and all the new services and costs associated.  You don't need new cities being built.  You don't need vast government projects.  You need to turn around brownfield land and to cut the red tape and costs associated to let the more numerous smaller developers and builders to move in and do it.  It will help energise our other metropolitan areas too.

You say they can't fix the housing crisis,                
They say between 1.5 and 2.5 million new homes in what they call a brown field revolution!

What someone suggested was that a muslim declaration of moderatism and British identity be written and imams and community leaders asked to sign it voluntarily - this was proposed to ease tensions after the London bombings.

As it turned out the British Muslim Council themselves wrote an open letter and community leaders signed it.  They then launched the IslamIsPeace campaign to promote....moderatism and British identity to address tensions post London bombings.

For someone (u/ikyda1) to try and spin the initiative as anything but positive is quite sinister.   It's a campaign to promote British integration for UK muslims, promoting moderatism and social contribution.  He's making it out to be quite the opposite and then calling it UKIP policy.  Quite shocking.

For most of the Mummy, he was muttering about not wanting to watch the series any more, because what the Doctor did was unforgiveable, and Clara was basically just going back to an abusive relationship.

And like a real drug, he's going to endanger her life and destroy her relationships and turn her into someone who will say and do anything to get her next fix.

Look at the existing scholarship on GATS, which is extensive. 

The Canadian NGO http://PolicyAlternatives.ca has a lot of stuff on GATS that is quite well written. Since GATS is an international treaty it applies to everyone's countries who have signed it., Undertsanding the GATS is crucial to understanding the goals of the US and EU in services. ""Facing Facts"" is a good starting point.

Also, FTAA - a failed FTA in the Americas is interesting for its ""wish list"".. A serch for FTAA on the Policyalternatives.ca site will turn up ""Divide and Conquer""

No

Yes, Bruce is obssessive and stubborn, but he is far from unstable. It's literally the entire premise of Batman. He's uber-stable to the point that when someone tried to strip him of his sanity, he had a backup psyche already prepared (Batman of Zur-En-Arrh from *Batman: R.I.P.*). 

It's also the prominent theme of his ongoing struggle with the Joker. Joker is the avatar of chaos and Batman is the avatar of order.

&gt; The Doctor is a dangerous man, many of the conflicts that have happened on Earth were the direct result of the Doctor being here so often.

This is the same for Batman. Most of his rogues gallery would not exist if he never put on the cape and cowl, he knows this, it was the major point in *Under the Red Hood*. Hell, the Joker literally wouldn't exist with out Batman, he was a result of an altercation with the Red Hood at the Ace Chemical Company. 

This is also true of all the other heroes in the DCU. Zod, Mongul, Doomsday, Myxlptlk wouldn't bother Earth if it weren't for Superman. Sinestro, Atrocitus, Larfleeze, The First Lantern wouldn't care if it weren't for Hal and the other Earth Lanterns. Ares, the God of War would stay in Olympus if it weren't for Wonder Woman.

&gt; Doctor is also essentially a god. He has control over time and space, he's destroyed civilizations and crushed entire races and species.

**The motherfucking Flash**. Flash can time travel **at will** (much more accurately than The Doctor too). He can move between parellel universes **at will**.

I love The Doctor, but he's small time compared to what the JLA deal with on the regular.

Not to mention all the other dangerous god like beings and literal gods that Batman does not worry about like Orion and the Gods of New Genesis, Kyle Raynor the White Lantern (the only being to see what's beyond existence), Dr. Fate (literally fate), Captain Atom (Dr. Manhatten from Watchmen was based on him).

Seriously, Batman wouldn't worry about The Doctor. He'd be peeved if he brought the ire of some dangerous aliens down on Earth, but the JL and the Lantern Corps would tell him, ""sit down, kid. Let the pros handle it.""

The people answering the questions don't know what they will be for. I'll try find the link

Edit:

Ok not the company that organises the questions, but this is a quote from an interview: 

We never know anything about the people who provide the answers. What do you know about the 100 people?

Alexander: That is the big mystery, and no, we don’t have a group of people kept in an underground cellar somewhere. They’re found by an online polling company.

Richard: Among all the millions of other things they ask people, they filter in a few Pointless questions every now and again. They’ve got very strict rules about how you fill them in, so you have to do them timed so people can’t look things up.

Alexander: The point is those who answer can’t know they’re being polled for Pointless. You can’t ‘apply’ to be one of the 100 people, because that would then affect the outcome. Who knows who these people are? I’d be delighted to meet someone who had been asked, and find out if they knew they had been asked a Pointless question.
