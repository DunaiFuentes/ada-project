Hazard-Oscar-Willian

----Luiz--Ramires--

Azpi-terry-Cahill-Iva

This is probably going to be the lineup because Eto doesn't play away from home, and he's injured. Willian on the right would be great for shutting down Lavezzi and his pace would help against their left back.  I would rather have someone else than luiz in the CDM spot because i'm afraid of his runs. Either Luiz he has a really good game, or a bad game. The backline is the same as always. Hopefully Hazard is going to have a good game, and can score a goal or at least set up a play.

My prediction Chelsea 1-2 PSG.

PSG on their good day can very easily score 2 goals. Hopefully we can come back on our homeleg and score a couple goals to proceed to the semi's",0,1396310469,null,0,false,0,cggwcsz,t3_21uf40,t1_cggwcsz,t3_21uf40,null,1433154652,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

If they win the league this season, he will rightly enter into the folklore of the club forevermore, but he needs to consistently challenge for titles and trophies for a few years at least before he can be compared with the best- and indeed, those two haven't just challenged; they've won a hell of a lot too. I have full faith in Rodgers, and see him bringing the club forward in a big way, but those two are still a level above as it were.  Much like Ronaldo and Messi with regards to Suarez:  If Rodgers and Suarez keep progressing as they are, and challenge strongly for the champions league, then we can talk about having the best player and the best manager in the world. 
Nevertheless, loyal as I am, I have to say I wouldn't swap either the mentioned player or manager for anyone else in the summer. I love the idea of building something beautiful - Messi coming in and scoring 100 goals, say, would not be as wonderful as Suarez staying and scoring 100 goals more for the club. Likewise, I'd prefer to see Rodgers lift the champions league title with Liverpool than Pep.

The problem is one manager had a singular plan and did not appear to be very adaptable when it came to changing that plan. The new manager picks his friend/kid/husband/whatever every week and leaves himself limited based on that.

Callum Robinson’s brilliant double decided a local “derby” that began as a damp squib and finished in thrilling fashion at Villa Park.

For almost half-an-hour neither side could make much impression, despite plenty of endeavour, but the Barclays Under-21 Premier League encounter suddenly sprang into life, although chances were at a premium.

The two captains, Aston Villa’s Daniel Johnson and West Bromwich Albion’s Donervorn Daniels, were called together by the referee as players from both sides got heated in the 35th minute, but the real action got under way just after the interval when Jordan Graham was presented with a great chance by Andras Stieber, only to miss a sitter.

Albion’s strong midfielder Liam O’Neil forced a fine save from Bradley Watkins in the 48th minute, but it was Villa who drew first blood on 71 minutes when Johnson fed a superb through ball to Robinson, who produced a class finish from an angle.

Albion levelled in equally fine fashion after 82 minutes, O’Neil’s glorious pass sending Alex Jones away to outpace Joshua Webb and score low into the corner.

As the final whistle approached former Villa ‘keeper Boaz Myhill saved well from Johnson and Daniels headed over from Joe Ward’s free-kick.

Albion looked to be heading for an away point, but Villa’s most dangerous players on the night, Graham and Robinson, combined with Graham’s cross being converted in slick fashion by the goal-hungry Robinson.

We promised we would do it for ourselves, for our club, for our families, and most of all, for our fans. Look at where we are now. Top of the entire league. We've all but guaranteed that top 4 spot, and we've done it by scoring the most goals and having the most fun of our lives. We've done it with a team spirit and brotherhood unmatched by any other clubs. And we've taken ourselves and our fans on a beautiful walk down memory lane to what we, the mighty Reds, used to do. We didn't spend the hundreds of millions like these other clubs to get here. We didn't buy our way to the top. We earned it. We earned it with the blood, sweat, and tears of the past few years. We earned it with every sprint, every pass, and every tackle in training. We've already accomplished our goal. The show is over, all that's left is an encore. When you walk down that tunnel, hold your heads up as high as you can, because you've put on a season that we can all be proud of. The pressure is all on them to win this, with their 100m+ squads and the expectations. So go on out there, and remember that you have the chance to be heroes. Go out there knowing that nothing is expected from you but your best effort. Go out there, and have the time of your lives.""",0,1396333978,null,0,false,0,cgh5xu7,t3_21vaqd,t1_cgh5xu7,t3_21vaqd,null,1433159234,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,AyVeeBeeOhYouTee,null,null,"They don't spend any more than you would expect a club of their size to spend. Yes they went a bit wild in 2010 or 2011 when they signed Carroll, Downing and Henderson for a tonne of money but that was under the genius eye of Comolli, who we know so much about, as well as brand new owners who didn't know better at the time.

Since then though they've not gone particularly mad. They have a modest budget that they use as well as reinvesting money brought in through transfers. They sold off Carroll, Downing and Adam for a loss but got a very good chunk of money out of them anyway. Henderson has turned from a £16m flop to an arguable bargain at that price. And Sturridge and Coutinho cost a combined £20m. Many of their other players have either been there for years or are youth team products who have been given the chance to step up to the first team.  They're doing it right.

Compare that to the likes of City or Chelsea. Chelsea signed a crocked Fernando Torres who hadn't done anything of note for a year before leaving Liverpool for £50m and in the 3 or 4 years since he's left, he's scored half as many goals at Chelsea as Sturridge has in just over a year at Liverpool.  

All this and I haven't even touched on the debt Liverpool have had to deal with due to the previous owners.

City are in a whole other league of their own in terms of spending. Sure, Liverpool have probably spent more over the course of the Premier League era, or maybe even the last 10 years. But think of where City were 5 or 10 years ago compared to the last 5 years. Probably 90% of their spending has come since 2008. Chelsea, and especially City, were nothing before their rich owners. Absolutely nothing. Chelsea were good for a Cup win every few years but were on the brink of administration not so long ago and regularly finished about where we are now. City had barely established themselves as a Premier League team. They'd been relegated from the Premier League two or three times in the preceding 10-12 years or so and even went as far down as Division 2 at one point.

If given a choice between them or City or Chelsea, I'd choose Liverpool every single day of the week, without question.",0,1396336161,null,0,false,0,cgh6f6p,t3_21vcem,t1_cgh6f6p,t1_cgh62qh,null,1433159462,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

The man who River got the manipulator from (I can't remember his name, he's the big blue guy in Eleven's era), often works with the Headless Monks and goes headless himself. Theory is that because Jack cannot die from injury his head just lasted a very long time until he became the Face of Boe.

You will see during that time stronger anti smoking laws, such as no smoking in private vehicles when children present and a further ban on smoking in public places covering outside. 
Therefor, promoting the legalisation of weed would be seen to be going against this message.  While we all know that you don't need to skin up to enjoy it, the anti legalisation pressure groups will focus on spliffs. 
Prohibition doesn't work but it is all parties policy. 
The tory party are supposedly about freedom of the individual and removing interference of the state. But they don't take this approach about health matters.
The liberals used to back legalisation, they now say there should be a debate and don't rule it out. 
Labour changed it from class c to class b so I can't see them moving quickly to back its legalisation. 
A friend lives in Uruguay, where it is now legal to grow, he says it was to cut out the organised crime.  I could quite go a relaxing evening on an unspoilt beach watching the sun set...
The existing law isn't enforced, rather than 5 years in prison you are more likely just to have it taken off you.  But decriminalising possession up to a certain level and allowing people to grow a couple of plants would allow police effort to focus on more serious drug problems. 
In my view we should look at all drugs and consider ways to educate users, make sure things are safe for those who do use and remove organised crime. But legalising all drugs may be too far. 
However, I also believe, based on personal experience and the thoughts of friends who are mental health professionals, that it's not a harmless pleasure.  Like drink it is about how much people use and the individuals underlying problems.

You don't think a larger greenbelt would be of benefit to anyone? Nobody says it has to be a belt, it could be zoned off, turned into massive parks with still room enough for development.

Ask somebody living in any city centre if he'd like to see trees (within a reasonable distance, Jesus Christ, have you even seen the size of London?), or a reduction in his rent, and you can put safe money on the rent.

Either you live in a green belt, or you are fairly articulate Daily Mail reader. I haven't proposed scrapping them, only scrapping them as they are now.

If you move the greenbelt now, in 20 years time people want to move it again, then again and in 100 years London will be like LA or Tokyo. Miles and miles of urbanisation.

You are living in a dream world if you think building on the greenbelt will have any impact on the cost of renting or buying in London. It will be low density, high end properties to get maximum profit. 

London has a big enough problem with transporting people into the centre to work at the moment, how is adding a hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of homes to the commuter belt going help with that?

Ah that same need to prevent urbanisation that was stalled a few years after it was implemented by World War II, and then ignored as successive governments tore it up for roads because they didn't like trains.

Within city limits? Still prohibitive expensive. That's why they're still brownfield.

Voluntary work is *intrinsically* rewarding, as helping your fellow man is a noble thing and also makes you feel good about yourself. Introducing an *extensic* reward for doing it, especially a currency-esque one, creates a problematic disconnection and confusion of incentives.

As an example, many people would find being offered money for charity work to be quite offensive as it--amongst other things--implies that they would only do it because they are being paid. In that way, part of the appeal of voluntary work is that it is done without a reward and, often, the outward appearance of that work.

Brownfield is not expensive, it's just more expensive than developing other sites. It makes far more sense to encourage development on those sites than destroy the green belt.

Building on the greenbelt will not solve the housing shortage, the type of housing that would be built will be high priced, low density. It will not help anyone but the people who can already afford to live in or around the greenbelt. It will not solve the urban housing shortage.

There's no hard evidence to suggest that their constitutional position in itself necessarily generates tourist money. There isn't a single royal building in the top ten of British tourist attractions according to Visit Britain. The Palace of Versailles has ten times the number of visitors that Buckingham Palace has, because there's no royal family preventing access. Why do they need a constitutional position to encourage tourism? We can retain the pageantry of state as a republic.

&gt; Without all the bullshit of elections and all that crap

Oh yeah, *democracy*. Such a shitty idea. Actually, [Irish presidential elections are really good for that country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland) They get a debate on who they want to represent their country *on the basis of what values*. You see, titillating ignorant tourists isn't my only consideration when it comes to who represents me and my nation. It's also what message we convey to the world. And speaking of democracy:

&gt; They should have the rights and priveleges that we as a nation decide to let them have - or not.

I absolutely agree. We've never been given the opportunity as a nation to democratically decide what rights and privileges they have. If Charles is so popular, let him stand for election for head of state. If he wins it will give him a mandate and democratic credentials, as there's no valid argument to suggest that the British people shouldn't be able to elect their head of state.

_____

- Employers will not care about the fact you're incapable of driving, unless it's a driving job. Public transit is more the sufficient if it's a ways away.
_____

- Bristol is also a city which is encouraging cycling, thusly you should be fine, and if it's mentioned in your CV it shows your active which is always a bonus as compared to someone who sits on their ass all day (no offense to anyone who does, but it does help!)
_____

- You should also not have a single CV, it's not efficient. It's fine to upload it to websites that people can view publically. But tailor make your CV to the job, if it's a customer service job for example, focus on social activities &amp; jobs you've had before. If it's data entry, again, focus on your experiences with that. You probably get the jist.
_____

- If at all possible, don't let the job opportunities come to you, you go find them. Print a couple CVs, get a file binder and go to the dense commercial areas (City center, Keynsham etc.) first, industrial compounds (please be careful though! HVGs aren't used too non-high vis people in yards a lot of the time) as well as local places of work (even if they're not advertising mind, there's usually more jobs than you might think, and if you can get in before they start recruiting even better!) but remeber to just be as upbeat and positive as possible, ask if the manager is available and hand him the CV directly, if not just hand it in anyway, if you're memorable you're much more likely to be considered, especially if it's the manager who remembers you.
_____

- To be fair, being on the dole is shit. You get fuck all in the way of money, if you're offered a part time job, you should (by all means) be willing to accept it and just continue to look for full time employment. Quite frankly, £600 a month is a lot more than £290 or whatever you're entitled too. 
_____

- Apply for jobs that you don't have specialties anyway. I've got myself into a graduate position after not even finishing A levels purely out of doing this.
_____

Also, if you want someone to look over your CV. Simply change all personal/confidential details too ""a_posh_trophy's 'X' "" Change all job names to ""&lt;Type Of Services Rendered&gt;"" and leave out any address information. What you'll mainly be looking for feedback on is your introduction (Most employers will discard it if they're not engaged or if it's excessive) and your ""personal interests/hobbies"". Experience, location etc. is almost always secondary. People are MUCH more likely to take someone who has no training but wants to work, than someone who has training but doesn't come across all too well and is there for the sole fact of ""money"".

Eitherway I hope you find something soon, I wish you all the best in all your ventures love. Keep it breezy.

Firstly this guy was just making observation on a potential thing, as we don't forget we have Alex Salmon (on the other side) going around saying that a Independent Scotland would be the greatest utopia in the world and that's his opinion so maybe you shouldn't listen to any of them. 

Secondly, This view about the Torys, we get it you don't like Thatcher, and you don't like London. But this Tory and Liberal government and was clearly democratically elected and has been trying hard to both support all parts of the country (some areas better then others is true). But its both Liberal and Torys government and Scotland did vote for Liberal Democrats in the Election so you are representative, i.e. you help create this government. 

Thirdly, ""Escape what British politics has devolved to"", To be frank there hasn't been a huge change in politics since New Labour and both the 2 Prime minster of that government, both Scottish where the ones who shaped it, So really thinking that the Scottish politics would be different is frankly untrue.

Finally I am sorry for the rant, I don't really like John Cridland views anyway, but i read your post and just am kind of sick of the ""Tory hate campaign"", ""Scotland Superiority"". We all in the same boat and we should all be working together to get out.

It's not typical Guardian readers who comment and upvote such, it's the army of Internet ukip fruitloops.

I think you will find that places like /r/unitedkingdom do not accurately represent the views of the majority of the actual British public. Quite a few people on here claim to be 'Liberal', but are bordering on fascistic with some of the extreme things that are said. It is not a place to get a good balanced view of things.

On almost all news sites I went on, including the Huffington Post, Farage was being defended over this quote and in general terms is supported. Now you can make excuses about UKIP having an army of 'Fruitloops' to brigade comments, but are you really that naive? That's just a piss poor way of justifying to yourself why these crazy nazi's are getting support. The fact is the main parties have ignored the publics wishes for too long now, and they are turning to less centrist parties to be able to get their voice heard. THERE ARE A LOT OF UKIP SUPPORTERS. Maybe just not on /r/UnitedKingdom. It is the same reason the Front National are getting great turnouts in France. It's also the attitude from a lot of members in this subreddit, 'Eww he thinks that the level of immigration is too high for our country to be able to sustain it, what a bigot nazi fruitcake' which stops the ability for meaningful discussion about the problem and leads to people having to turn to extreme measures.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"Apps are stealing the customers of gay bars, fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it. Safe spaces for LGBT people being for-profit enterprises centred around the purchase and consumption of alcohol is really not a good thing, and gay bars tend to be such a monoculture environment that even many LGBT people find them very hostile places. Personally I don't think I'm going to establish meaningful connections in dark, crowded bars with Beyonce being blared at 140dB where there is nothing to do but get drunk and where you're treated with suspicion and hostility unless you are an &lt;25 gym bunny with tattoos of Lady Gaga lyrics.^1

It's this environment which in my view is a major cause of the perception of gay men in particular as promiscuous and drunken/drug-addled. If the only place you can be safe to meet other non-hetero people is in an environment that makes conversation and getting acquainted (in the non-euphemistic sense) impossible, and where more often than not you are not at the pinnacle of sobriety, what else is there (but dance and drink and screw, because there's nothing else to do)?

I'm no capitalist, perish the thought, but I really would like to open an avowedly LGBT-friendly environment focussed on allowing people to meet each-other and which doesn't have the overarching prerogative of routing people on drink prices. Relatively quiet and discreet (at least a majority of the time), with a range of background music that caters to a wider audience, open during the day but not serving alcohol until the evening, with frequent relatively informal events like LGBT-related film showings, book readings and discussion groups. A *lot* of LGBT people don't identify with the preening, superficial and in many ways discriminatory culture of the gay bar scene (or drag queens, which personally I despise - miming in a bad frock is not a genre of performance). Lesbians, trans people and PoC are often treated *atrociously* in gay bars. And a *lot* of us are not interested in the ubiquitous fucking top-40 bullshit which typifies those environments. There are a few nails in the coffin of the 20th century gay bar, and a major one is the fact that they simply do not cater to the diverse range of LGBT people out there. Modernize or die.

I would try and meet people to collectively open somewhere to run as a co-op or something, but alas Aberystwyth doesn't have the population to support such a venture I fear.

^1 Not that people like this are bad people or don't have a right to exist. But this subculture/stereotype is not the be-all and end-all of LGBT people in society.

The prohibited kind.

s89 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 provides:
(1)Where a protected tenancy which is a regulated tenancy is granted, continued or renewed, any requirement that rent shall be payable—
(a)before the beginning of the rental period in respect of which it is payable
shall be void, whether the requirement is imposed as a condition of the grant, renewal or continuance of the tenancy or under the terms thereof; and any requirement avoided by this section is, in the following provisions of this section, referred to as a “prohibited requirement”.
(2)Rent for any rental period to which a prohibited requirement relates shall be irrecoverable from the tenant.
(3)Any person who purports to impose any prohibited requirement shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale [currently £1000], and the court by which he is convicted may order any amount of rent paid in compliance with the prohibited requirement to be repaid to the person by whom it was paid.
(4)Where a tenant has paid on account of rent any amount which, by virtue of this section is irrecoverable by the landlord, then, subject to subsection (6) below, the tenant who paid it shall be entitled to recover that amount from the landlord who received it or his personal representatives.
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/58/section/89

In laymans terms, the rental period is specified in the lease. For example, if the lease says ""the rent shall be £X per calendar month"" then the calendar month is the rental period. So they can ask that you pay April rent at the beginning of April. If they grant you a six month lease running April - September, and ask for the ""last two months rent"" this is taking rent for August and September ""before the beginning of the rental period in respect of which it is payable"".

There isn't a way around it folks. Any money in addition to rent and a deposit is a premium. So whatever you call it, its unlawful. Any deposit, including a larger deposit (max of 2 months rent), must be held in a TDS. And any rent demanded before the start of the rental period whether as a condition of the grant of the tenancy or part of its terms is unlawful, the term purporting to do this is a void term, and therefore the landlord forfeits the accelerated payments of rent and therefore cannot collect the rent for the period in question.

This means that per subsection (4) the tenant can sue for recovery of this sum (essentially getting a free two months rent) provided the action is brought within 2 years from the date of payment (6).

So go ahead, sign up with O'Neill for 6 months, and after you've moved out you can claim for your last two months rent back.

_Should be_ separate, assuming that there are two chimney pots above the roof.

The problem is that chimneys 'wear out' -  the sustained effect of the heat causes the mortar to weaken.  It will eventually crack.  Couple that with the gentle movement of a building, and it's chimneys that present the most issue for old buildings.

Cracks between chimneys are the most common flaw - as there's normally only a couple of brick thickness between them, and it wears from both sides.

Note that chimney's shouldn't be 'sealed' - they need airflow throw them, otherwise they get damp (and then the dampness degrades the mortar …). They needs to be an air vent into the chimney - that's probably where the smoke came into your bedroom from.

It is unclear who would be considered 'at fault' if there is a crack between the chimneys - however, if the fire was causes on his side, then it's probably fairly clear that the cause of the immediate damage was on him.  You might have to get your chimney lined, to seal cracks from your side, depending on what's what with it.

&gt;fair point, other acceptable answers: Chalobah
Anyway, my point is rather that Luiz is more effective in that position than Ramires (with his reliability and distribution issues), Mikel takes up a squad position and doesn't play. Only offers a useful option in a system where we expect to be pinned down in our own half. Lampard is getting old and far less reliable and also still looks to get forward rather than willing to sit. MvG is practically our only hope. Unless Romeu plays for us again, I kinda wish he would but I haven't been paying too much attention to his loan. We have a lot of potentially dead wood and Luiz who isn't even really a CM. I think he's a decent CM, sometimes he appears to lack the composure you'd want but he's ok compared to the rest. But when you look at our other options it does seem silly to not get someone else. (I suppose we'd have to shaft at least one of them then)
So yeah, still would have prefered Chalobah as answer. Chalobah or someone new.

Ramires and Mikel aren't at the level you want in a  2 man midfield. It's a simple as that. Lampard is old and MvG is his replacement really.

You talk about propaganda, yet that is 100% what your comment is.

You don't engage with the argument, in any way, and have nothing to say on the matter. All you can muster is an ad hominem attack, and even then all you can say is that the guy went to a selective state grammar and then Cambridge. So he got himself a good education. What a cunt, right? I also went to Cambridge, come from a single parent family in a council flat, my mother was hospitalised due to malnutrition when I was a kid, and I spent time in my teenage years sleeping rough, but I assume I too am a posh entitled Cambridge twat? Or maybe, you know, an Oxbridge education is a good thing to have and is a good tool for tackling politics, business etc. Not enough people from poor or lower middle class backgrounds have one, but not everyone that has one is posh, and for that matter being posh doesn't discount a person from having an opinion either. You're a bigot, pure and simple.

And yes, the head of a business organisation that lobbies government has an opinion on Scottish independence. From a business-oriented perspective. What a bastard. It doesn't make it propaganda or scare-mongering, it just means it is one particular perspective. The onus is on people who disagree to make an argument as to why they disagree, and if all they can manage is ""propaganda, bullying"" then all it shows is a paucity of ideas.

This is what is annoying me about the whole independence debate, it is based on propaganda and rampant emotionalism, such as this. Nobody is debating this on a serious level, or realises that a break is almost certainly forever. Instead we get this emotive bullshit, polluting a vital conversation for the future of this island.

Where is the critical thinking here? Where is the interest in actually making Scotland and the UK a better place?

And the later comment.

&gt;""“Later, with the most expensive squad at Real Madrid, he did nothing in the Champions League.""

This happens to be the widespread opinion about Jose - Ask on any Football website or in r/soccer and you'll get the same response. Read through the opinions of those in Spain/Europe and you'll mostly get the same view unless they are connected to JM.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/real-madrid/10069868/Jose-Mourinho-lost-the-dressing-room-at-Real-Madrid-and-failed-in-the-transfer-market.html

But sure, Benetiz is a cunt, right? He won us the Europa League, he put his heart into our club for one Season and all you can do is insult him? Do you have a life dude? Or should I say, Mrs? - No one wanted him to join Chelsea, but the high majority of fans respected him by the time he left, only the little ones like yourself insulted him, again, degrading the club even further.

Another interesting comment from yourself.

&gt;I genuinely think people should lighten up over what Mourinho says. He is almost always taking the piss or just saying something to annoy people for the sake of it and if you can realise and accept that then he shouldn't get under your skin.

There's a saying for opinions like yours, it's called having a Double Standard, you might want to look it up.

* [5Times Podcast](http://www.5times.co/podcasts/) - LFC legends such as McAteer, Ian St John, Ronnie Whelan, Fowler, Barnes etc discuss LFC

* [The Bib Theorists](http://thebibtheorists.com/) - pretty interesting bunch who get good guests (e.g. had Dr Steve Peters on the other day)

* [Men In Blazers](http://meninblazers.com/) - My most listened to comedy pod, have to subscribe through Grantland Sports 

* [Beyond the Pitch](http://www.beyondthepitch.net/podcasts/) - two guys (can't even figure out who they are) who get pretty phenomenal guests.  Their Man U and Milan heavy content can get annoying at times and content is kinda annoying to access now due to being signed by Satellite Radio.

* [Counter Attack](http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/category/counter-attack-podcast/) - This Canadian podis actually pretty fucken annoying to listen to because the hosts can be burtal but for some reason it's still in my rotation as a hangover from the no defunct The Footy Show podcast that the Score used to put out before they were absorbed by Rogers Media.

Wonga gets a lot of hate purely for being the most famous pay day lender. Having used them multiple times because I don't have a credit card (I should really get one but the mother threw away the last letter  without my say so), I wouldn't class them as loansharks. 

The terms are nice and clear and you know exactly what you will repay when you take the loan out. The APR might be crazy but you can't take a loan out for a year, so it's purely representative.

At the end of the day, absolving the people who use these services of responsibility when it goes awry and painting said companies as evil gangsters who'll break your legs is pretty much Daily Mail, nanny state fodder.

Maybe they should be forced to do more, credit check-wise, but if you take out a loan and can't repay it, that's your fault.

&gt;

&gt;""__Love &amp; Monsters__"" is the tenth [episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [second series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_2\)) of the British [science fiction television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, first broadcast on [BBC One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 17 June 2006. It was written by executive producer and lead writer [Russell T Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) and directed by [Dan Zeff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Zeff).

&gt;The series typically follows alien time traveller [the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) (in his [tenth incarnation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor), played by [David Tennant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant)) and his [companion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\))(s) (at this time [Rose Tyler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tyler), played by [Billie Piper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Piper)), who travel around time and space in a machine called the [TARDIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS). However, ""Love &amp; Monsters"" follows a contemporary ordinary man named Elton Pope ([Marc Warren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Warren)) who becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box, and joins a group of like-minded people in hopes of finding him. But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy ([Peter Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kay)) joins the group, the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his interests. Kennedy ultimately turns out to be a creature called the Abzorbaloff.

&gt;Due to the addition of a [Christmas special](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christmas_Invasion) in the production schedule, an episode had to be ""double banked"" with another story (in this case ""[The Impossible Planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Planet)"" and ""[The Satan Pit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satan_Pit)"") for production to finish on time. With ""Love &amp; Monsters"", Davies was able to tell a story from a different character's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper. The ""Doctor-lite"" and ""companion-lite"" structure has since continued in the programme. The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity, as it was the winner of a *[Blue Peter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter)* children's competition to design a *Doctor Who* monster. ""Love &amp; Monsters"" was watched by 6.66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans. Some praised the complexities of the script, while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour. Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;I have seen the effects alcohol does to someone that is mentally unwell.

The fact that things like alcohol or smoking are legal is not a good reason to call for weed to be legalised. Just because two things that are bad for you are legal, is no reason to add another thing that is bad for you to the list. 

&gt;There is nothing wrong with the benefits it provides in its natural state so why waste money into changing it?

I get that you believe that all things in their natural state are inherently better for you than after they have been altered. 

Medicine has been developing over thousands of years, and the plants we used to make medicine have been studied for all that time. All that scientific medicine is doing is looking at how to maximise the benefits these plants can provide, while minimising the risks. 

For example, Atropine is a drug used to treat heart conditions, it is extracted from the nightshade plant, which is poisonous if consumed in it entirety. We need to change its state in order to get the benefits from it. 


In the same way, THC can help reduce the size of cancer cells, which is great. But cannabis can make you high, paranoid, nauseous, and lead to mental health issues. These are all potentially unwanted effects that can be avoided by extracting the THC and consuming it separately.

The pound depreciated from 2007 to 2009, shielding U.K. exporters from what would have been a tighter squeeze.

Also: 

&gt; Brown didn’t see the crash coming, but who did? He made the case for “light-touch” regulation as banks grew reckless and the housing bubble inflated. He wasn’t alone in that. Maybe he increased public spending too much before 2008 instead of cutting debt while he could, but on the eve of the crash, U.K. government debt was 28 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 48 percent in the U.S. and an average of 43 percent in the euro area.

---

&gt;

&gt;The stadium is owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the football club. The 2008 takeover made the football club one of the wealthiest in the world,  prompting suggestions that it could consider buying the stadium outright.  Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £1 billion redevelopment led by architect [Rafael Viñoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Vi%C3%B1oly).  

&gt;During the 2010 closed season the football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment being made in the playing surface so that it is better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage.  In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, agreeing to now pay the city council an annual fixed sum of £3 million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000.  This new agreement occurred as part of a standard 5-year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £1 million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium. 

&gt;In July 2011, the stadium was renamed the *Etihad Stadium* sponsored by [Etihad Airways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways).  Development plans for the *Etihad Campus* adjoining the stadium were revealed in mid-September 2011. In return, the club promised to build a new community hub in east Manchester which included a new school, sixth form college and community centre. The club released images of a cutting-edge youth academy and training facility, including a 7,000-capacity mini stadium on derelict land adjacent to the stadium's SportCity location.   It is believed [Etihad Airways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways) fought off competition from [Ferrostaal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrostaal) and [Aabar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aabar_Investments) to gain stadium naming rights.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I have no problem with fluoride being added to the water supply. 

What I am concerned about is a private entity, or a government, having total control over a potent, addictive and habit forming psychedelic substance. 

Do you look forward to a world where Monsanto controls the world supply of cannabis? You seem to be quite interested in natural products, how will you feel when the worlds supply of weed is a GM crop?

How about when Marlboro enters the market? How much harm can they cause with this new product, considering how many people they have Killed over the last 100 years with cigarettes. 

Are you a fan of the tobacco industry? what about the drugs industry? or large scale industrial farming? Are the ethical industries run by ethical companies that care about their customers? When you are talking about something as potent as weed, isn't it dangerous to give total control over to companies like that? 

What about the government. Do you trust them to be fair and impartial over their policy on how they regulate drugs? I mentioned brave new world, where the government feeds their citizens drugs to keep the docile. Does that seem far-fetched? Look back at the recent UK budget, where the duties on beer and gambling were lowered. Make people happy and docile and they will vote for you. Is it impossible for weed to be abused that way? Make weed cheaper before an unpopular policy is announced and people will care less.

-------

I used to go to uni in Hull and lived in Penryn, Cornwall. Transport was a bitch by train, last costing about £150. By car was better, but was almost exactly 1 tank of fuel at about £60.

Below is a brief overview of my financial situation back then in the hope that it'll help you understand things. Bear in mind that I'm really not in to the club scene and don't really drink much alcohol. There was a big purchase of a gorgeous compound bow and bits during my second year, with other accessories added over time, probably totalling to ~£1.5k. I don't think I could have bought it if I indulged in the nightlife and didn't keep my spending low.

Had near the minimum loan, no grant, at a little over £3k. During my first 3 years if my parents hadn't helped me financially I'd have been fucked as I didn't have work. During my final Masters year I had a job, shared private landlord rent with 2 others (seriously much cheaper than student landlords), and had a car. My parents didn't help me financially on my final year and with job and loan things were still a bit tight.

On my final year I was on a monthly income of £300 (1 day a week, £18k pro rata) + maintenance loan of about £3.3k over the year. £300 was just short of my rent and bills (including car insurance). Even with the £3.3k over the year I was in my overdraft.

Hull is dirt cheap and the lowest rate for student rent was £60 a week. Exeter will likely be much higher and your grant will probably cover only cover 2 months.

I managed to get in to uni before things really went to shit for students. You'll need to be wise about your spending.

Side note: I'd recommend getting with a private landlord in your final year if you can (earlier is good, but might be difficult come year finish). They're often much cheaper, but you have to handle all the utilities and financial division by yourself (my route was everything was in my name and other tenants paid me their share.

Allen in for Gerrard --&gt; Gerrard can't get a yellow or else he misses City game. Allen will be good to control the midfield.

Lucas in for Henderson --&gt; Henderson needs a bit of a rest and Lucas can be good to anchor the midfield while the rest of the players bomb forward. Also he needs some game time.

Sakho in for Agger --&gt; Need to give him some game time and will need him to defend against Big Andy.

This is probably going to be the lineup because Eto doesn't play away from home, and he's injured. Willian on the right would be great for shutting down Lavezzi and his pace would help against their left back. I would rather have someone else than luiz in the CDM spot because i'm afraid of his runs. Either Luiz he has a really good game, or a bad game. The backline is the same as always. Hopefully Hazard is going to have a good game, and can score a goal or at least set up a play.

&gt;The lack of a quality option up front really hinders the entire team. With no lateral movement opposition defences can play in a linear fashion and have no fear of being manipulated. Torres is painful to watch when he drops deep with his back to goal, equally he can no longer stretch defences with his pace. To compensate you would like to see him drag his centre back slightly wider to create space centrally. Again, this is not something that he does.

&gt;What this lack of movement and respect from opposition defensive units creates is problems for Chelsea’s attacking midfielders. Hazard suffers in particular when he is regularly tasked with beating four men before he has a chance to do anything with the ball. You often see his opposing winger, full-back, right centre back and defensive midfielder gravitate towards zones he is likely to cut into when receiving the ball.

There's a few gay pubs which are always nice too but so far I've only noticed them when my straight friends have pointed them out to me, or they've had some queer-karaoke or something on just on advertised on a board outside.

I certainly don't identify with the gay-scene as it were. Sure I get a bit camp sometimes but no more so than most people (I mean who doesn't love Mrs Slocombe jokes). 

I'm not sure they'll die out due to lack of modernisation - there's always going to be that core group who like that atmosphere - but increasingly as people become less scared of The Gays then more generally relaxed places that will open up where it's less exclusive - places where straight people are comfortable and happy to hang out but ultimately that LGBT people will feel safe in and be backed up by the staff if anything does happen.

&gt; go back to your private subreddit

Makes absolutely no sense because if you recall correctly it was me arguing with people from the private subreddit which I wasn't a part of, so you are pretty far off the mark there. 

As for the rest of your remarks, I'm not getting bogged down in what Mourinho has achieved or his time at Madrid because that has nothing to do with what I am saying.

The bottom line is that Benitez is a Liverpool man who never cared for Chelsea, and nothing I saw from him did anything to suggest otherwise and now that he has left he is free to show his true colours again (as he does in this interview).

And as for the Mourinho vs Wenger stuff, that is also completely beside the point. Mourinho is a hero to us Chelsea fans and can say what he likes as a result (and if he wants to insult Wenger then that's absolutely fine by me) - I don't know why you think I should be embarrassed or 'a cunt' to call Wenger a specialist in failure, but thanks for taking the time to read through my comments, if that's the worst one you could find you must not have looked hard enough!

TLDR: It's the Benitez defenders like yourself who have the double standards and would probably let Luiz Suarez manage us if it meant we got a trophy. I know who likes Chelsea and who doesn't, and I'm not in the least bit ashamed to stick up former group and call out the later. That is not what having double standards means.

Also using the assumed average age of 23, look at 2000. They would have been fans starting around age 10. Oh hey look, there's a nice spike around age 10. Look at 2005. People would have been around 15. oh hey look, another (smaller) spike around age 14/15. Then look at 2010. The average person would have been 19 or 20.

The R2P doctrine is intended to provide diplomatic resolution to conflicts and the ""third pillar"" under which military intervention is argued for is only in extremely exceptional circumstances where all other diplomatic venues have been completely exhausted and there is a current, ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.

It's so extreme and there's so little customary law on it that the UK government didn't rely on it for it's legal justification for the war.

Edit: I'll just add that R2P is *absolutely* part of international law. It's a very important and developing doctrine, but there are hierarchies in IL and state sovereignty is a *jus cogens* (non-derogable, indisputable) principle, as is the need to go to the security council for approval of the use if force. So you can't rely on R2P to justify invasions even in places like Iraq, because it conflicts with a core principle of IL.

Crap? Everything I said has come true, so how exactly was it all crap? I clearly stated selling Mata was a mistake due to what he brings our team when we're finding it hard to breakdown defenses, he used to link our team together like no other player has done since.

I stated Luiz should become a midfielder and he has, I stated Hazard should be used as a CF when we're lacking a player and he has, I stated we should change our formation to become more flexible in-game and it happened although not to what I'd like. I stated Schurrle would become an amazing asset for us when he was apparently a ""bad"" signing - And that's not even half of what I've said.

This is before fatigue from the fixture pile up with Europe and other competitions happen. Injuries happen, you can't just ignore that. In fact part of a players' value is based on their injury frequency. It's part of why Van Persie came so cheap for United. Look at his injury record.

First 19 games flatter most teams, especially young ones that are injury prone (there's always a high incidence of injuries for players happen around their growing stages once they get more playing time, around 23-25)

You can keep pulling as many if's out as much as you want. If this is the case then what happened last year? And the year before that when Van Persie was at the club? 80 points with ifs then too?

&gt; And what's happened this Season since I said all that? Losses due to poor tactics that have probably cost us the Title.

Are you kidding me? We had absolutely no right to be in the title race for as long as we have been considering how new much of the squad is and the fact we finished nowhere near top under the guidance of your hero, Rafa Benitez. If only Mourinho could've heard your wisdom sooner we might have been OK! Mourinho has worked wonders to mold this group of players into a winning unit, a couple of bad results and idiots like you think they know better, it really beggars belief. 

&gt; I stated Luiz should become a midfielder and he has, I stated Hazard should be used as a CF when we're lacking a player and he has, I stated we should change our formation to become more flexible in-game and it happened although not to what I'd like. I stated Schurrle would become an amazing asset for us when he was apparently a ""bad"" signing - And that's not even half of what I've said.

This whole thing had me laughing along, you should be premiership manager mate, or at least a psychic! Luiz has played in midfield occasionally for us, and often due to injuries/ suspension, Hazard has played upfront maybe a handful of times. Schurrle still has to find a lot more consistency for us before we can judge him as a signing. 

As for your Mata point, that is just so lazy it's unreal. The common consensus shortly after he left was that it was clear that he didn't fit into Mourinho's desired formation/ playing style and we played very well without him. To now say we miss him just because we lost a couple of games is ridiculous, who's to say we wouldn't have dropped more points with him in the side? It's all conjecture.

Anyway, I've seen 'debates' you have with other people and you're not worth the time, especially if your starting point for a discussion is:

&gt; Everything I said has come true

Pretty hard to change anyone's mind if that's what they think to begin with.

Do you disagree that people should have to pay to store their property in a way that doesn't inconvenience others? If so, can I dump a load of bricks in your garden for a bit until I need them?

&gt; Funnily enough another redditor I had a conversation with the other week was obsessed with stopping HS2 and spending all that money on self driving cars. Hallmarks of the same attitude - what starts out as a good idea (more walking cycling &amp; less cars in town or self driving cars) becomes impractical when taken to the extreme (no cars in towns ever, or no rail connections only self driving cars). It's a shame because these ideas are good but become silly when approached with an attitude of it's the only solution.

Self driving cars are an interesting idea. But they won't stop congestion or cars clogging up residential streets.

I've never said anything is the only solution. The problem is that in this country successive governments have treated the car as the only solution at the expense of all other forms of transport.

&gt; Transport is going to be a mix of lots of things and crucially needs to have public onside - not rammed down their throat.

What? lol

No of-course not because we were shit with players fit back then. This year with key players fit we were brilliant and would easily get 80 points.

true,Catses,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Exactly, having regard to their views doesnt necesarily involve following them, but in most cases it is important to evidence that they have at least been considered.

The law generally says that until the age of 16 you cant make many decisions legally as a matter of capacity, consent and so on. This is most often brought up in regard to under age sex though equally it can relate to other kinds of consent or contracts. A big issue for example is consent to medical treatment, whether parents have to be informed and whether they can over rule their child's decision.

Although the law says 16 is the age, its a relatively soft law which can be deviated from in some instances as a reflection of the reality that everyone develops mentally at a different pace and that there isnt a significant change in decision making ability on the night of their 16th birthday.

Traditionally in medical consent the test applied has been the ""gillick competence"" test in which generally speaking if a child is deemed (a subjective assessment essentially) to sufficiently comprehend the implications of the procedure then they will be allowed to make their own decisions with regard to it and whether their parents will be informed about it.

Photography is a very strong passion of mine and I would love to take it further into a career and become professional. I want to learn much more about the subject e.g. technical skills, lighting techniques, theory etc. etc. But as you can imagine, I don't have access to much equipment and can't really afford any which slightly limits the capability of my photography :/ . Therefore, I feel that these items which you are very kindly offering would be ideal for me and would be greatly appreciated!

If we want to be a top team we need to be in multiple competitions. With a veteran manager, like Van Gaal, we'll be able to compete in domestic cups, the league, and EL at higher degrees than we have seen before. It's all a matter of leadership.

Look at 'Arry - we did well enough in the league under him, but at what cost? We didn't even try in the EL and barely tried in the domestic cups. Under AVB, we tried in all competitions but didn't have rotation so everyone got run down quickly. Under Sherwood we basically went down in flames in the EL and tried to focus in the league, but heavy injuries across the squad have really taken their toll. Injuries sustained mostly due to lack of rotation.

If we have a top manager who knows how to rotate (especially how to rotate youth in the group and Ro32 of the EL) we'll be fine, and we'll be able to grow our brand even more.

That's the reason we need to be in the EL. To grow our brand. Liverpool has a very well managed and very far-reaching brand, while we're just starting to build our international identity.

Kennedy looks quite good, lots of pace, and Martinez has basically said that McAleny will be in the senior side next year - he's not mentioned above because he didn't do anything last week but after coming back from a broken leg recently he's got something like 3 goals in 3 games.

Also, stuff that goes on inside the box, players grabbing each other etc. How is that legal? 

Other things like missed penalties etc I can understand because those things tend to balance out over the course of the season.

It makes sense for Manchester and the surounding towns to be governed together. Likewise with the West Midlands which ended the crazy situation where three counties met almost in the very centre of a major city, and Cumbria, which meant that the Lake District came under one council.

However, in my opinion that is all they are - administrative boundary changes. The government of the day, as well as the current government officially acknowledge the historic boundaries, but don't do much to promote them. For example, you now see signs when *leaving* Blackburn welcoming you to Lancashire. Madness!

So yes, for administrative purposes places such as Blackburn and Barrow-in-Furness should be placed outside Lancashire, but for all other purposes should be in it. Maps, signposts and the news should show the traditional boundaries.

This is why you can't come up with a single example and instead say vague things like ""general attitude"". Do you think it's a coincidence that the staff at Man City and Bolton have nothing but praise for him?

I would say that it is less destructive in moderation than both alcoholk and cigarettes but people are the problem and it is not the plant that is getting people addicted as you say. It is the way in which we live that causes the most damage to ourselves. People can abuse anything like those that drink far too much sunny Delight. This goes for anything. 

How could a plant that inherently makes people calmer and more peaceful have a negative effect socially. Alcohol changes peoples behaviour and it can take a massive turn for the worst. I have never witnessed any violence with people that are on cannabis ever. I see people get drunk breaking things and knocking lumps out of one another more often than i would like. It is almost impossible to ingest too much to be lethal. Most people using it are some of the most compassionate people i know. 

The government got the country drunk? I think the alcohol prohibition in USA is the only thing I could think of that is close to what you are saying and that was a bloody mess.

 If it did have these negative effects socially then surely the Netherlands or one of the many other countries that allow people to use it personally would have noticed. It won't change anything and how will anyone ever move forward if we are afraid of change.

The technology is not carbon neutral, and being reliant on uranium it is not renewable. We consider its use, moreover, to be elitist and undemocratic. There is so far no safe way of disposing of nuclear waste. To a degree unequalled by even the worst of other dangerous industries, the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and its waste will be passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.  
  
Also regarding their energy policies, they oppose the use of fossil fuels *aswell* as nuclear energy while they give no alternative sources which use renewable sources as of now. The renewable sources we use in the present day in the UK would not provide the necessary amount of energy that we use as a nation and creating the infrastructure would most likely cost vasts amount of money.

true,RedScouse,lfc12,,"Its not really anti-Semitic. Its anti-Zionist if anything, and Zionism is the belief in a homeland just for the Jews.

An excerpt from the wiki reveals
&gt;The name quenelle comes from an elongated fish meatballs dish, which is said to look like a suppository.[3] Hence, the phrase ""glisser une quenelle"" (""to slide the quenelle""), with a gesture simulating fisting practice,[3] is similar to the English ""up yours"".[4] The arm outstretched refers to the length of the arm going up one's bottom.

However, the gesture was made famous by French comedian Dieudonne. He originally had an act with a Jewish comedian, where they railed against racism, and utilized racial stereotypical satire to do so. He actually railed against the French far right party with his comedian friend.

Later on, however, Dieudonne then became close to the French far right party (which is pretty racist), although he still maintains that he is merely anti-Zionist. That being said, he has made what some may consider anti-Semitic comments, but one of the incidents I explored of such comments, he was provoked by a reporter who also said something extremely inflammatory to him.

Regardless, the gesture itself has been used by most people as an anti-Authoritarian symbol in general. From my French friends, who are extremely liberal and left-leaning, they told me that the quenelle isn't really anti-Semitic and is mostly anti-Authoritarian. Moreover, its use isn't seen as a big deal at all.

However, many /r/soccer professors believe that it is extremely racist, but I have not heard any of these people mention they were French or knew a lot about French culture.

Anyways, that's the extent of my knowledge regarding the quenelle.

&gt; Now pictures of Nasri and Sakho performing the gesture have emerged.

&gt; The City midfielder was pictured outside the Carrington training ground last November performing the gesture with a friend, though he has insisted he was unaware of the anti-Semitic or political connotations of the gesture and is thought to have performed the act because of its popularity among people in his native France.

&gt; Sakho too has pleaded ignorance and said that he was conned into performing the gesture.

&gt; “This photo was taken six months ago, I did not know the meaning of this gesture. I was tricked.""

true,singeblanc,null,null,"&gt; I'm skeptical that either of the two main parties will do much to stop the relentless rise in house prices.

Quite the opposite: whoever is voted in will actively work to ensure that prices continue to rise.

Why? Because **they use house price rises as a barometer of how well they are doing as a Government.**

That is why you see policies like ""Help to Buy"", effectively giving cheap credit to first time buyers, which (just as with the credit crunch) only succeeds in pushing prices up. If you give everyone £χ of easy credit and then let them all bid on something they all want, then the end result is that the prices for that resource will just rise by £χ.

It is also one of the main reasons that the interest rates have been kept so low.

However, this isn't sustainable: the interest rates will have to raise at some point (they can't go down, so the question is not ""if"", but ""when"" they go up), and incomes aren't rising to match the house price rises, so... if it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble and sounds like a bubble, **it's a bubble!**

We looked unprepared in every aspect for the match, defence making mistakes is one thing...defence not moving and communicating with each other, midfield not effectively tracking back, lack of pressure in the midfield. All of which ties back to management not preparing the team for the game.

Attacking, we seemed absolutely at a loss how to overcome the LFC (who pressed as a complete unit on defence, not just an individual or two) pressure combined with poor runs was leading to forced passes or hoofing the ball up the pitch. Poor movement, poor positioning, disjointed interplay....all of it stacked up again looks like poor preparation.

Tim said he didn't bother to watch the previous game which is shocking, but even disregarding that fact our squad looked lost in terms of what to do and where to turn. They just don't seem to be executing to a plan of any sort it really does look like they are told to just run around a bit. They continually are all over the place even in good performances.

People (including myself) are asking for a philosophy for how the team performs on the pitch, ultimately we need that....but at the moment i would settle for a damn plan, it barely looks like the players are receiving instruction heading onto the pitch and they are performing in that manner.

As cubs314 pointed out, the last time we played Liverpool they ran all over Sandro in the limited time he was on.  The problem lies elsewhere, be that motivation, communication, poor instruction or whatever.

Edit: Look at the Southampton game.  In the first half there was little pressure on the ball despite Dembele (who is quite defensive, though some don't seem to like to admit that) starting.  After halftime with only Bentaleb and Sigurdsson in the middle we were still able to put pressure on and win the ball back quickly.

Bristol-proper, as the main urban centre of gravity in the area is hamstrung by these stupid non-counties. South Gloucester give absolutely zero shits about sustainability and is basically a giant Bovis housing estate, with a huge out-of-town shopping centre. All completely car dependent, which shits all over the efforts Bristol-proper is making at trying to get people out of cars to reduce traffic.

Bristol had an absolutely world-class airfield in the Filton Airfield back-in-the-day. It was huge, was spitting distance from *two* motorways, **and** a railway that ran right next to it. Alas, South Gloucester, in their rate-seeking fugue-state, built thousands and thousands of homes in the flight path who then won a referendum to effectively close the airfield. All for a dogshit housing estate thrown together in a few short years.

Bristol is now served by the fog-landing training strip (seriously) at Mendip International 10mi+ south, accessed via a single winding country road.

true,MidsITRecruiter,null,null,"Hi, 

I may be a bit late on this one, however, I have just seen the comment about a cv been a maximum of 2 pages. This is nonsense!!!
I have been a Recruitment Consultant for 5 years and pages on a CV comes down to hiring managers personal preference (which unless you deal with an agency is difficult to know) however I will try to give you some words of wisdom as to why your cv doesn't have to be a maximum of 2 pages:
1. Your CV is searched for by agencies/Hiring managers/HR managers using keywords. So you need to ensure that any key word to do with your job e.g. Sales, b2b, b2c, KPI, targets etc are in your CV a good 2-3 times 
2. If you are reducing your CV to try and fit it on to 2 pages you will miss out key words, key information. If this information isn't in your CV how do ""we"" know what you were/are doing. We aren't mind readers
3. Detail is key. You need to make sure you include as much detail as possible, especially about your current position. What's your team size, do have any staff directly reporting to you, what were your daily responsibilities? Did you have any additional responsibilities? what challenges did you face/overcome etc
4. There is no right or wrong amount of pages, as long as it's not getting into ridiculous amounts i.e 16 pages!
5. I send CVs which have circa 8 pages, detail gets you the interviews

 
My critique about your ""sales specific cv"" would be:
It doesn't look like you want a sales role, you have a varied career history and for the last year? (you need to put months in - I know someone has already suggested this) have been in a sales role but you haven't focused any detail around it really. You don't really mention what kind of sales you were doing (so as mentioned above I am left guessing) Were you doing tele sales, shop sales? Did you deal with customers face to face, over the phone, by email? Who were your customers i.e was it business to business or business to consumer sales? What was your target? What were you actually selling? (I know you were working for the camera center, so I'm guessing Cameras and Camera equipment, but you need to be a lot clearer)

It focuses on giving its candidates the ability to sit Microsoft exams after an intense learning program that lasts for 12 months""
After 12 months you have qualifications and experience in IT and will typically be considered for Service Desk Roles and then you can progress through the ranks into Security.

There are other companies that offer IT appentiships, so you can look locally to you for an ICT/IT Apprentiship . Have a look on http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/

1 of my clients specifically likes to see candidate who go the extra mile to get into IT. It's all very well and good saying you want to and you can. For example if you work for next or lidl or somewhere it may be worth asking if you can sit with the Service Desk Staff and ghost them/help them voluntary for 1 day a week or a couple of hours. Or if you are at College go and ask the IT Department if you can get some voluntary work there. Have you thought about asking your parents if the companies they work at have an IT Department which you could go and do some work experience in over the Easter Break? It could lead to a job in the long run.

Your best bet is 1 of the above options and then working your way up the ranks 

If you want to get straight into Security, without any commercial experience, you are more than likely going to need a degree

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Inflammation:

&gt; The final common pathway of metals and particulates (oxidative stress),allergens (asthma) and gases (noxes and ozone).

&gt; Most people think of inflammation as a small red painful itchy lump, or a swollen knee or ankle. They think of it as local. A real flu gives a hint at how it can be a whole body response. You won’t hear about this in relation to air pollution from the newspapers, TV, parliament or government bodies. Plausible deniability is one of the reasons for “not knowing” why the body’s rhythms of inflammation make a nonsense of the way averages of pollution, and the general numbers game, are played out in London.

&gt; Self-amplifying cascades are the order of the day. **A single peak episode will trigger an unstoppable, uncontrollable immune reaction leaving the whole body more sensitive to the next lot of pollution** and awash with activated cells, new cells breeding fast and swamped with little known hormones, some of which stay around for 24 hours or longer.

&gt; When this pollution becomes long term, or when we have a long heat wave this gets really serious and leads to permanent scarring and damage. If a child has lived long enough in such conditions the lungs never grow properly, the wounded lungs scarring, if it is in the womb its development is affected. Low birth weight,preterm delivery and therefor infant mortality all rise in frequency. **Most politicians prefer to talk about the end stage, dying early, rather than the damage that affects babies or youngsters for their whole life ahead.**
