The medical records of every NHS hospital patient in the country have been sold for insurance purposes, The Telegraph can reveal.

The disclosure comes days after controversial plans to extract patient data from GP files were put on hold, amid concerns over the scheme.

Those in charge of the programme have repeatedly insisted that it will be illegal for information extracted from GP files to be sold to insurers, who might seek to target customers or put up their prices.

However, a report by a major UK insurance society discloses that it was able to obtain 13 years of hospital data – covering 47 million patients – in order to help companies “refine” their premiums.

As a result they recommended an increase in the costs of policies for thousands of customers last year. The report by the Staple Inn Actuarial Society – a major organisation for UK insurers – details how it was able to use NHS data covering all hospital in-patient stays between 1997 and 2010 to track the medical histories of patients, identified by date of birth and postcode. 

 It boasts that “uniquely” they were able to combine these details with information from credit ratings agencies, such as Experian, which record the lifestyle habits of milllions of consumers.

The calculations were used to advise companies how to refine their premiums, resulting in increased premiums for most customers below the age of 50, according to the report dated last March.

The 274-page report describes the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics as a “valuable data source in developing pricing assumptions for 'critical illness’ cover.”

It says that by combining hospital data with socio-economic profiles, experts were able to better calculate the likelihood of conditions, with “amazingly” clear forecasts possible for certain diseases, in particular lung cancer.

Phil Booth, from privacy campaign group medConfidential, said: “The language in the document is extraordinary; this isn’t about patients, this is about exploiting a market. Of course any commercial organisation will focus on making a profit – the question is why is the NHS prepared to hand this data over?”

He added: “We have been categorically told that it would be illegal for GP data to be handed over to insurers, yet already all this hospital data has been extracted. It blows out of the water the idea that patients’ privacy is being protected.”

Last week Tim Kelsey, director for patients and information at NHS England, said it will be “a criminal offence” for any information entered into the new giant database, which will combine GP and hospital records, to be sold for insurance purposes. However, a database which only contains hospital records remains a separate entity, with its own rules allowing greater access to third parties. 

 There has been a growing backlash against the scheme with family doctors and privacy campaigners raising fears that data could be misused.

Those behind the £50 million data-sharing plan say it will improve healthcare and help medical research.

Last week NHS officials announced a six-month delay to the plans, to address concerns and improve publicity. Speaking after the delay was announced, Mr Kelsey said the database needed to go ahead because it was “vital” to improving Britain’s cancer survival rates.

Tomorrow, the Commons health select committee is due to question NHS officials leading the scheme and to hear concerns from privacy campaigners.

In the report based on hospital data, actuaries used the information as the basis for detailed calculations about the incidence of common health conditions.

It describes a falling market in 'critical illness’ insurance cover, with sales dropping by almost half in a decade, and suggests estimates of prevalence for major conditions including Alzheimer’s disease are likely to be significantly underestimated, because they are based on the hospital figures, when most care is provided outside hospitals.

The Department of Health said: ""The rules changed last year so this would no longer be allowed. Information like this can only be accessed now if there is a clear benefit to improving health or health systems.""

If I could give some advice:

Your title on the post; ""*very quick sale wanted - PLEASE take a look!*"", just comes across as begging, or looks like an advertisement for the house itself, as if you are the seller/estate agent. 

Since you're not affiliated with the estate agent/house, I don't really get why you'd post the title like that, it comes across really badly and was probably the reason why the post was downvoted. A more appropriate title could have been something like *Found this house for sale, I can't believe they advertised it in that state..*, or something witty or sarcastic.

But in the end, often posting a successful post to reddit is down to  chance, timing, and luck. 

What you **absolutely should not do, ever** is do what you have done here: make a post complaining about its reception and the downvotes.

I'd claim the reverse of course.

Nope they're clearly worse, just perhaps less deluded.  However, even Rothbard knew he wasn't genuinely an anarchist and you shouldn't try and posthumously paint him as such for the cachet.

&gt;It appears you are fundamentally not much different to the leftists I was caricaturing.

Do go on...

&gt;I would vehemently dispute your notion that ""most rightist libertarians"", libertarians who in fact don't constitute a small handful of elitist snobs in Washington, want to specifically stop ""'wasting'"" money on the poor, or to appease corporate interests. I would say ""most"" libertarians are of the Ron Paul variety, with a burning desire for liberty in large part because that liberty would massively benefit the poor.

Heh.  Ron Paul is an anarchist?  Seriously??!  He's certainly a bit more traditionally libertarian than the current tea party crowd of straight edged but edgy republicans, in terms of foreign policy for example, but he's not remotely libertarian in the old fashioned sense of a genuinely socialist individualist anarchist like Tucker.

A lot of people seem to criticize Sherwood for loaning out Holtby, but was it really all that bad of a move. Holtby wasn't playing here because the truth of the matter is that he just wasn't seen as being good enough to help get the club where they want to be in the short-term. Loaning him allows him to get a lot more playing time, which could help him develop further.

The point of my original reply was to inform the lamenting individual that /r/gallifrey existed, if they didn't know about it, so that they would be aware of a more serious discussion subreddit for Doctor Who fans.

I don't necessarily agree that the subreddit is ""turning into something,"" but phrases like this are often tossed around when - like I said - a following gains more and more members as popularity rises. The quantity of posts will inevitably rise, and people who have been around since the beginning will have nostalgia for the old days. See: hipsters and old people - ""Back in my day..."" / ""I was into ___ before it was cool."" Again, not being sarcastic, this is just something that happens when more and more people become fans of a book, or a tv show, or a band. It's only natural, and we should all rejoice in the common love of our shared interest, regardless of how long someone has been a fan.

And if certain fans want to post pictures in the dedicated subreddit? Let them, that's the point of reddit; in the end, the upvotes and downvotes will show what the community wants to see more of. Those that don't agree are welcome to make their own subreddits, which is exactly why numerous smaller splinter subreddits exist, generated off of a big subreddit becoming too popular for a certain subset of people. Some may be elitists, sure, but I'm certainly not. I'm just a humble fan of the show who doesn't like being attacked for expressing his viewpoint (again, the point of reddit: a forum for discussion).",0,1393204042,null,0,false,0,cfmz6zi,t3_1ypd0o,t1_cfmz6zi,t1_cfmyvlj,null,1432529685,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I was fine with trying it again until Capoue went off. Without a DM (and Kaboul for that matter), we are very exposed at the back.

First and foremost he's ostensively against using the State to fund rapine and pillage - that's pretty good - except, he seems to be pretty pro transnational corporations which are ultimately heavily reliant on military might.

Usually youth players get their chance in the squad when injuries force the hand, or in cup ties the manager has no/little interest in. It makes it easy to go back to the youth team because there is no expectation. They get brought in, told the reasons, and that it's a chance to make their mark for future selection.

A Tax Tribunal dismissed his appeal against a decision made by HMRC that an avoidance scheme he used did not function so as to give rise to a tax deduction.  Or, in simpler terms:  HMRC said no.  He asked the Tribunal to overturn the HMRC decision and they also said no.

He'll have to pay the tax and interest *(which will be charged at a rate considerably lower than a commercial rate)*.  He **potentially** could also be charged a penalty of up to 100%, **but** that depends on behaviours.  Because he took advice and the advisor had taken counsel's opinion it will almost certainly be regarded as being an *error despite taking reasonable care*.  That means no penalty.

true,Nogbadd,lfc55,,"As a Scouser living in Melbourne, there was good news and bad news. 

The good news is that the fans showed the club just how broad is their appeal. When Stevie G went to take a corner, the whole crowd in that section of the ground rose to give him a standing ovation! And the singing...well, the video gives you a sense of the occasion. Hair standing up on the back of the neck time.

The bad news is that the local media support a different code, Aussie Rules, and run ""soccer thugs"" stories whenever they can. Is this to protect their investment in the oval ball game? Who knows. AFL has its own issues with drugs and criminality, but this is all grist to the mill for the journos. Let there be crowd trouble in Europe and out come the ""soccer violence"" stories.

Anyway, a minor whinge, but as I walked to the game I saw multiple riot police on horseback, ready and waiting in case there was trouble. IN CASE THERE WAS TROUBLE? At a friendly? At a friendly in which the Melbourne Victory supporters were as much there to pay homage to Liverpool as support their own club? Ah yes, but English ""soccer"" clubs = violence, don't they?

If you think I'm over reacting, I'm afraid to say that the policing of Victory Fans is heavy handed, including restricting access to parts of the ground. The Aussie fans have a small core of ultras who do what all football fans do; the Poznan, standing up, singing songs etc. But the police seem to want them to behave like AFL fans; sit down, be quiet, wave a scarf and buy a pie.

Football is supported at the grass roots by everyone, but in the editorial offices they do not seem to share enthusiasm for the round ball game. Funny that. And the fact that the only team they regularly report on has been ""knocked off their perch""... well, don't mention that, please. Anyway, I suspect there will a boost with the Aussies in the World Cup, let's hope that they can surprise a few people, and connect with the public, and maybe even the press...

This really isn't true or at the very least most of the players in the squad would not be starters on any of those teams. With the exception of Vertonghen, Lloris, and possibly Eriksen. I mean who outside of those Vertonghen and/or Lloris would be all that desirable to teams like Barca, Real, Bayern, City, etc? 

&gt;quality depth at almost every position.

Have you seen who the fullbacks are on this team. There is pretty much no depth there. A team shouldn't be relying on players like Naughton as their fullback coverage if their goal is to play in the Champion's League.

Also this is from a previous post but it sums up how I feel about last summer signings.

I've felt this way for a while. At the beginning of the when everyone was going gaga about all the new signings I felt that most of them weren't really going to help take this team over the top or make-up for the loss of Bale.
I think a good job was done of bringing in players to provide depth. However, the initiative to add players to make-up for the loss of Bale or to add players who would replace players we already in the first eleven wasn't as superb as people made it out to be at the time and hasn't really worked out so far. Players like Capoue, Chiriches, Chadli, and arguably Paulinho, depending on how you rate him compared to Dembele, provide great depth and increase the overall quality of the squad but they don't really improve the first eleven.
As for players that were brought into improve the first eleven and/or help make-up for the loss of Bale; Soldado, Eriksen, Lamela, and arguably Paulinho, they have all been fairly disappointing so far bar Eriksen. This has resulted in the team not really being improved and more than likely not being as good as last years team due to the loss of Bale.",0,1393210751,null,0,false,0,cfn2bns,t3_1yqlzk,t1_cfn2bns,t1_cfn1cu8,null,1432531227,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

It's only in the high stakes of European football that you immediately label a young player a failure after 12 months. Every sports league in the US usually has a 3 year grace period for a player to find their legs.

Hendo has matured massively in his nearly 3 seasons with us now and he's gaining in confidence all the time. 

We tend to only note his athleticism but anyone whose been paying attention realizes his creativity, passing, and pressing have resulted in more goals than any of us likely realize.

Right now the market is so fucked up. I honestly think any difference in people's opinions on his value are more likely to do with their overall valuation of players worth in general. What would be a more worthwhile discussion is comparing his value to other English CMs around his age.

He's obviously indispensable to our side at the moment. I believe everything is in place for him to be a captain of our side in the future. Certainly he's worth more to us than to other sides, as others have noted. 

The real question is what would you take for him? 

Right now I don't think we could even sell him for anything below 30. I know that sounds crazy but I can't see us replacing his all around ability for anything less than that and also getting the years back in another player that he offers us.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"Very few enterprises moved to Vista, and those that did generally have a life cycle management process that means they will already be on 7 and evaluating 8.x. This is why the XP EOL is such a big deal for slow movers, they didn't move to Vista, then the depression hit and many firms put upgrade projects on hold. Not because the cost of the new licences, but because they were heavily invested in enterprise software that only worked in IE6, or applications like SAP which needed a lot of project work to upgrade to the versions that worked on Vista/7. And all of them (including the government) will have enterprise agreements, meaning they pay far from the sticker price for each licence, I've seen discounts of to 97% before. 

I know this because I've been involved in the project to get the modestly sized firm I work for, which only has a few thousand employees, running Windows 7. It took a year from it being approved to users actually getting Windows 7 installed. Enterprise IT is not like a small business or a home user setup, but scaled up with big numbers, it is far more complex and operates on a very different set of rules. The reason we are being forced to pay such a large amount of money is because the government failed to invest in keeping it's internal technology up to date and ignored very clear warnings from MS, in a similar fashion to the way it failed to invest in flood defenses, ignored very clear warnings from climate scientists and is now facing a massive bill. 

And the problem will not go away if we switch to Linux desktops. Because again, you will need to deal with a firm that can actually support your level of operations, and that won't be cheap regardless of the cost of the individual licences for client machines. Everything needs to be tested, validated, and all the applications your users need will need to be reworked and undergo the same level of testing. And at the end of the day, you will face exactly the same need to update things and deal with the version you are using going EOL after 5 years or so. And that still won't change the costs you incur for things like VMware licences, Oracle licences, SAP licences etc.  

At this point you are probably gearing up to tell me something nasty about using Windows. But you would be wrong. I like Linux, and I use Linux. But trying to switch to desktop Linux to save money is the wrong way to go about things. A far better approach would be to work on moving the back end systems over to open source technologies and leave the desktops running Windows + AD for the moment. The really huge costs are going to be for the things like the Universal Credit, NHS records, HMRC internal services etc. Ensure they are using OSS and open standards, leverage things like Hadoop and Presto, bring firms like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc in for consults and work with smaller UK firms rather than the traditional multinational behemoths. Fix the back end systems, and you will save tens of billions. And if you design them properly, it will make moving to desktop Linux far easier than it will be if you start with the clients. 

And while you are doing all this, replace the idiots leveraging the deals with firms like MS with people who can actually cut a bargain. I am damn sure half the cost is the government simply not knowing what it's running and then agreeing the the first number that firms like MS throw at them. They tried that with us, but when we actually did a proper audit and started actively managing licences rather than just letting engineers install MS SQL Enterprise where Express would be more than enough, the costs simply dropped.

Also find this hard to believe given Agger's love for both clubs. He decided to forgo the wages still owed to him by Brøndby as a token of his love and to help them financially.

http://onside.dk/premier-league-superligaen/broendbys-haab-svinder-liverpool-tager-til-usa

Its a danish article, and im no sure how much you would get from a translation. But it simply says that Liverpool has announced its plan for training matches this summer, in america. As a result the article says, that it will be unlikely that Liverpool will visit Brøndby this summer.

This is sort of a followup article. About half a year ago the website wrote that Brøndby had asked Agger to talk to whoever is in charge of this, to try and persuade them. I can try and find the article if you want, but ill have to do some digging. edit: also the club would have liked it to be this summer, since this year is our anniversary.

About not making a fuss. Brøndby technically cant make a fuss about it. The way it was written into the contract, was that Liverpool would have a friendly, but not a specific date or in specific time frame. It was up to Liverpool to decide when they wanted to visit. So technically Liverpool could postpone it indefinitely.
This is from articles ive read over the years, i probably couldnt find them again.

edit:

Once established, you asked me to convince you but I have refused to indulge you because I think you are entrenched in beliefs that mean you are not interested in knowing what there is to know. 

If I am trying to convince you of anything, it is that if you want to know something, you have to be interested in looking for the knowledge yourself. Otherwise, no one can convince you of anything. 

Every time you express another cultural irrelevance along the lines of - the Telegraph reports government members as saying this or - blah blah conspiracy theory or - there's a hobbit in your boxer shorts, it confirms my prejudice about your readiness to listen so scary new information.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Reasons why that's a bad comparison:

- Drogba's first season: 16 goals in 41 games, despite being out for 2 months with an injury, and a goal in the League Cup final. Certainly not 24m-worth contributions, but certainly more valuable than what Henderson offered us until about January last year. 

- Even if you don't find those stats impressive, Drogba was never anonymous in the way Henderson was for us under Dalglish.

- This is Chelsea under Abramovic - they could throw extra money at players on a regular basis. Liverpool couldn't; that summer window was a one-off after years of chronic underinvestment under H&amp;G. Add to that the lack of competition for top 4 finishes then vs now, and you see that a 24m slow-burner hindered Chelsea less in the short-term than a 15m slow-burner hindered us in the short-term. We have to be more critical of our use of money, because we have less of it.

- If you're measuring Drogba's ""par"" as what followed from his third season onwards, that's just absurd - Henderson has the potential to be a very good player, but I don't think anybody's going to argue that he's going to be a Drogba-level player. 

For example, did City overpay for Fernandinho? Absolutely, in my opinion. Does it matter to them? No; he's met the requirements and demands they had of him, and they had the money to pay 'whatever it costs'. With Henderson, he wasn't instantly good enough to be worth 'whatever it costs', which is the attitude with which Comolli bought him. He didn't meet our requirements in Kenny's first season, or for the first part of Rodgers' second season.",0,1393239209,null,0,false,0,cfnb0k9,t3_1yqbaq,t1_cfnb0k9,t1_cfnav4a,null,1432535388,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

Again prohibition has made a relatively safe drug into a killer.

Things like silica, lead (in Germany - which caused poisoning) , glass have been added to weed - unless you 100% know where your weed is being produced its a case of buyer beware - again a fairly safe (one of the safest) drugs is being contaminated and made dangerous purely because of prohibition.

I'm actually studying addiction psychology myself, partly due to my fascination with the subject from being an addict myself for many years and partly because I'm mentoring addicts. I totally agree that you can get addicted to pretty much anything but the people I've met in groups are having physical withdrawal from weed. 

FTR you have two types of drug withdrawal, physical and psychological. You don't however get physical withdrawal from weed, you don't even really get it from cocaine.  You do however get it from opiates.

The real problem is people talk a good game on self ownership but in truth believe in communal ownership of the person with granted privileges. The difficulty of the abortion debate comes about because people cannot bring themselves to say that they believe society owns the individual.

It becomes a very clear debate otherwise. Either a person owns themselves with subsequent obvious outcome or the state/society owns the person with subsequent obvious outcome. The fact that lots of people want the former with the outcome of the latter creates the difficulty in the abortion debate.

My anecdotal evidence for this is my local supermarket Sainsbury's. Couple of years ago, the last time I was unemployed, I basically lived off the ""basics"" range. That's what it was there for. 

I'm now unemployed again, however this time when I try and shop, the cheap 12p noodles have disappeared, cheapest ones are now 75p, the basics ""cooking bacon"" packs used to last me a week for £1.45, they've been re-engineered so you get 6 rashers for £1.45 now, the cheap apple/blackcurrant juice has gone from 52p to 80p (as the next cheapest is £1), as well as all the brand name stuff reducing the amount per packet while maintaining the same price. 

The thing is, I can't really complain, as all Sainsbury's are doing is fucking the consumer up the arse from every single angle they can find. In a Tory Britain, that's called ""good business practice"" as it demeans and weakens the scummy unemployed poor people while enriching the ""hard working"" business owners.

If you were creeping along and riding like a saint, while the driving was pretending he was on The Sweeney, then it goes the other way.

Also, it may be possible that the fact he was pulling out of a service station and not a ""formal"" road junction works in your favour.

Been working part time (declared) doing odd computer repairs, website etc, but never enough to make it viable until a fairly recent mini surge. When I asked about pushing this, I was told 'Oh yes that's doable, we'll get someone to contact you who can help!'.. Great I thought, JCP actually going to do something useful? Nope, turns out their scheme will only take you if you aren't already making an income..  
  
The Work Programme is an abysmal failure, 2 years of travelling every week or so around 45 miles in horrid fenland weather to spend 5 minutes there and be told 'There's not much we can do'.. Tax Money well spent then.. Another shocker, these people are paid around £23-£27 per hour for this?!  
Courses they put you on never seem to finish, and its always some strange provider from far away who seems unprepared, un-organized and your certificate for completing never seems to exist.  
  
Its definitely infuriating, I used to get migraines from stress every few months.. They are now every week.  
It gets worse when you see that some political *lucky person* lands their-selves a 100k a year job for doing bugger all, doing bugger all.. Or footballers wages all over the news/papers etc.. Makes you sick.  
I've already given up my rented home and moved back with parents, didn't want to.. but when its £600 and you will only get £300 towards rent, you aren't going to last long there..  
I'm seriously thinking of leaving their 'help' and pursue my own ideas. It seems its either get demoralized/ill by them interfering with me carrying out their own instructions, or getting that break in doing what I'm trained and love doing.  
The Worse part I've found is the recruitment agencies.. So many of them dictating to firms about how an employee should act, what qualifications are right for the job..

Very versatile, as well - has been used on the flanks this season, both as a wingback in 3-5-2 and as a wide attacking player in a 4-2-3-1; took up the creative responsibility when Gerrard was out injured, but now that Coutinho's playing CM, Henderson's keeping things ticking and playing the shuttling role.

Has grown in confidence, which has honestly been the biggest thing holding him back since he joined. Even under Kenny you could tell there was a player there, but he took his time to show that belief in his play.

Areas to work on: just needs to keep adding end product - I've been wanting him to attack the box since he first joined, so I was overjoyed to see him do so against Swansea. He did it against Spurs as well - coincidentally, the last time he scored in the PL. Notice something? Also sometimes lacks composure in front of goal - has missed a few presentable chances.

Do you play in midfield mate? Cos I do and when you play there you can't blame your team-mates for not getting you the ball enough, it's up to you (as someone in the middle of the pitch who can move around to receive the ball anywhere) to get yourself on the ball and put yourself into positions to receive the ball. Not only that you need to have the control to put your team-mates at ease that when they pass you the ball you'll receive it and not lose it quickly and be able to do something with it. 

Paulinho's curious style is not very beneficial to these attributes which make him a very strange midfielder. That game, his deficiencies came to the forefront very heavily and it was clear as day he was having no impact on the game. As a CM, that's your fault, it's up to your to impose yourself upon the game. Obviously you need the team to help you out aswell but you don't rely on one man in DM to get you the ball, you can collect/receive it from anyone if you're up to the task. He wasn't yesterday.

God Dawson? under AVB? He certainly did not improve, under Redknapp he was far more reliable and solid. He had spurts of good play under AVB but was more reliable under Redknapp and earlier.
I understand age will have an impact in this scenario.

I don't think Defoe changed that much, he just played as a lone striker more than he had during previous stretches of his career so it seemed like his game changed. He's still the same player really, and he didn't change his game too much as the lone striker really, other than the fact that he'd not be able to have someone hold up the ball for him as before.

I'm not going to be able to agree with you on AVB, I just don't agree that things were getting better under him. (Not that he deserved the chop as a result of that, but y'know don't make comparisons to how ""good"" AVB was.)

&gt; no wonder the team doesn't care to listen to the man.

Nice you've got so much evidence for this.
Seen the same shit said under AVB post poor results and performances, ""oh he's lost the dressing room"". I don't hold you to higher standards than these peoples opinions; let's leave it at that.

He's played Eriksen in CM/DM capacity once before alongside Dembele if I remember correctly and it was OK but he wasn't brilliant in that role. I think Bentaleb is better in the DM role than Eriksen, though it is debatable.

Got to ask, do you really think that football is so simple that one formation and one direction is all you need to be a successful team? Playing 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 every match isn't something I want and it was one of AVB's most glaring flaws (more glaring than the media's criticisms of his man-management). Cos that's so naive, it's like the whole football narrative thing which exists so people can pretend like there's more to football than half chances, and just sort of slow averages. Wanting one style of play just so you can understand it easier is preposterous, why would things be simplified just for you.

I looked round and the guy has his knob out and was brazenly pumping away like he was having a lazy afternoon wank at home. I didn't know whether to burst out laughing or to be shocked.

Anyway, he gets up and starts running down the carriage, shoving it in these two petrified women's faces like it was a cut of the day at the butchers. Then shit gets v dark and he starts harassing a family. This all happens in the space of about 30 seconds.

I got off and shouted down a couple of transport police who radioed ahead and they managed to nick him at the end of line at Stratford! I was going to go up as a witness in trail but he admitted to the charges in the end. Result.

Think of it similar to a ‘loss leader’.

Picture this 

you’ve got a party with 20 + people smoking weed, you lace your weed with heroin it makes it stronger, all 20 love the weed, love the feeling.

The next day they want some more of the weed, you tell them it was flavoured with heroin which is why they liked it so much.

A percentage of the 20 who smoked the laced weed will be very pissed off – they were spiked.

A percentage will be put out they were spiked may not buy your weed again

A percentage will be fine with it but wont want it again

A smaller percentage will be fine with it and will smoke heroin again

It this last group that makes it worthwhile, they’ve tried heroin which they would have otherwise avoided, they like it and they will be a repeat customer, they will likely also find you other customers.

A lot of the problems that we have in politics too, however, are because of the fact that we as an electorate are poorly educated on our own system of government. If a person is turned off politics because of PMQ's, or thinks that it is the reason we have had on the whole some pretty bad governments over the last generation, then they clearly have no idea how government in the UK is run, and why it is run that way. PMQ's has nothing to do with the day to day running of the country, nor how the government is held to account. It's function is to allow parliament to keep the PM and cabinet on its toes, most effectively seen when a backbench MP can ask an untabled question that the PM isn't briefed about. The element of theatre increases the profile of parliament and the drama makes for good viewing. The only real problem with it is that firstly since the time of Heath it has served as a forum for soundbites that often trump any real debate in the public mind, and secondly that these days the public think that that's how Parliament and government works day to day.

I think our last 2 games should be considered 'less than wins'. We came back and won them. And I put that down to a great vitage fighting spirit that is something I really enjoy about liverpool. But the energy levels required for those games and the ability to sustain it isn't something we should rely on.


While being wins, I hope the team considered them lifelines, lifelines that they well and truly earnt - no doubt. But still they weren't safe reliable performances and outline the work needed to improve. Great games because they amazing to watch, the sort of games that create LFC supporters. Great games because the spirit it creates and churns on the pitch among the players looks infectious and champion'esk. Great because they we're games where we were able to lose enough to notice areas for improvement - yet still counted as wins. Great games, just not reliable - so I guess what I'm trying to say is, to expect those levels all the way up until the end is quite irresponsible - so pray focus on our gaps so we may help sustain the streak!

Skunk and it's many variants has been around since the 80s not since ten years ago and in percentage terms amount of THC has not gone up much or at all in the last ten years.  Yes weed is more potent than it was but people were smoking hash with higher % THC than weed for years.

true,brevityandlevity,lfc99,,"I don't wholly agree with the premise that only the matches against Top 9 teams are ""difficult"".

Last night's Norwich v. Tottenham game gave us breathing room, and should let everyone know that even the bottom teams should not be underestimated right now.  Teams that are facing relegation have just as much to fight for in these remaining games as top teams.  It is a miracle that we did not drop points to Fulham last week.  Were it not for a foolhardy tackle in the area, we would have dropped two points, we'd be six off the top, and I think the prediction would solidly be ""best we can hope for is fourth"".

This coming weekend of matches has some good fixtures in my opinion. The bottom teams may be able to make a dent in the top squads.
 
Fulham v. Chelsea - I think Fulham could draw or beat Chelsea at home.  They've got a new manager, new energy, more reason than anybody to fight for a win, and Chelsea has to play three games in a week; a taxing game v. Everton that they won by a late miracle, Galatasaray away, and a Fulham team that will think they have a chance, and knows they need a win to have any chance to staying up.  

Stoke v. Arsenal - Stoke is only 3 points from the relegation zone.  They'll fight like hell to win at home.  They played City hard and came out 1 - 0 losers, but will believe they have a chance to win.

Man City v. Sunderland - Capital One final.  I think it was David Silva who was quoted saying that this game will not be easy, and a win would be a huge momentum boost for City.  Sunderland has looked good in cup matches, and again, will fight like hell.  I believe Aguero will be back, but City has struggled to put the ball into the net recently.  If Sunderland can win, we will solidly have a demoralized City team.  Recent form has been -- loss to Chelsea (1 - 0), draw with Norwich (0 - 0), loss to Barca (2 - 0), and win v.  stoke 1 - 0.  City has scored 1 goal in their last 4 matches!  They've got a soft EPL run in early March, but as you've shown, their late March / April run of Man U, Arsenal, Southampton may prove to be the opportunity to surpass them in the standings.

Southampton v. Liverpool - This will be hard.  We have to fight.  A win will be huge.  Physioroom says both Sakho and Lucas are due to be back March 1, but we'll have to see if they're really ready.  Our defense looked shit against Swansea.

I expect an upset somewhere in the top 5 this coming weekend.  It likely won't be Tottenham v. Cardiff.  

Imagine a scenario where we win this weekend (59 pts), Chelsea draws (61 pts) Arsenal loses (59 pts), and City has not featured in the EPL (57 pts).  By the end of the this weekend we could be in 2nd, and two points off the top.  The sheer psychological blow to the other top teams would be huge.

Granted this is best case scenario.  My whole point is - don't underestimate the bottom of the table.  They have a lot to fight for as well.",0,1393252629,null,0,false,0,cfndzfo,t3_1ys7t3,t1_cfndzfo,t3_1ys7t3,null,1432536788,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,doeboy73,null,null,"""Queens Park Rangers are considering dismissing Harry Redknapp, their manager, as they falter in their attempt to win promotion back to the Barclays Premier League. 

The West London club have picked up one point in their past four matches and there is significant concern that the underlying problems and their form could lead to them falling out of the Sky Bet Championship play-off positions by May. 

QPR’s finances and plans for a new stadium would seem to make it important that they return to the top flight at the first time of asking. Some supporters vented their anger and turned on Redknapp after the 1-0 defeat away to Charlton Athletic on Saturday. The club declined to comment last night. 

Michael Laudrup, who was dismissed by Swansea City, has been mentioned inside the club as a possible replacement should the poor results continue. 

QPR’s home match against Leeds United on Saturday could be critical for Redknapp, with 15 games left of the season including meetings with four teams chasing promotion. T heir campaign ends with matches against Millwall and Barnsley, both of whom could need points to survive the drop. 

QPR have a sizeable playing budget and were strong favourites to finish among the automatic promotion places this season, but they have struggled in front of goal and trail Burnley, who are second, by seven points and Leicester City, the leaders, by 15. 

Redknapp’s side have scored only 37 goals, an average of barely one a game, and failed to register a shot on target against Charlton. Redknapp brought in four strikers in January to lessen the blow after losing Charlie Austin to a shoulder injury but, of those, only Kevin Doyle has started regularly. Fans have also complained about inconsistencies in Redknapp’s team selection. 

Redknapp took charge a year ago but was unable to save the team from relegation. He brought in a number of experienced top-flight players last summer, such as Richard Dunne, Karl Henry and Benoît Assou-Ekotto . The club invested heavily in the top flight and failure to win promotion could be more significant with QPR likely to announce losses of more than the £23  million they posted in their last set of accounts to May 31, 2012. The owners have lent about £92.5million to the club.""",0,1393255487,null,0,false,0,cfnez1v,t3_1ysjvz,t1_cfnez1v,t1_cfndbfh,null,1432537319,3,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,3

Well, if you only read right wing newspapers and listen to right wing politicians that's what you get. If you take the time to listen to the remaining 3 major parties and all the left wing papers you get a more balanced feedback.

true,smellysk,null,null,"In fairness, a good bulk of Spurs fans (myself included) never rated or wanted Sherwood from the start. After yesterdays performance the majority of angry fans weren't slating Bentalab (kid is a real talent, but he shouldn't automatically be first name on the teamsheet), they were scratching their heads as to why he remains on the pitch, 1-0 down, him having a stinker and Spurs desperately needing an attacking option? With regards to the line-up, I think it's fair to say that after the Newcastle performance the same players deserved to start, however you don't play the bulk of them 3 days previous on a fucking car park pitch halfway across Europe, this was Sherwood's fault and his alone.

But it all comes down to Sherwood for me, check my comments, like many fans my opinion of him since day one hasn't changed, regardless of his league record. He is completely under-qualified and inexperienced to manage a PL team, he's failed his A licence twice and the FA rushed through his Pro licence at the request of Spurs. He plays direct, hit and hope football at its worst, and seems to have no clue how to change a game.

Tactically, I've seen nothing from him since he took over, apart from the quick switch to 4-4-2. His substitutions and selections have been baffling at times. His comments on Paulinho ""I didn’t realise he was that good” imo either showed he hasn't watched him before or he hasn't got a clue...and playing Bentelab against Yaya and Fernandino was naive, even tho he played well against weaker opposition. Furthermore, we look even shakier at the back since he's took over and he hasn't managed to blend in ANY of the summer signings (if anything we look more disjointed eg. Eriksen, Holtby, Capoue etc.) We've gotten away with some really, really lucky results since he took over, Everton &amp; Swansea in particular stand out, cup results have been dire and lets be honest, if it wasn't for Adebayor's resurgence we would be sitting 7th or 8th in the league......

You can say certain fans are short-sighted and naive because we beat Newcastle away last week, but the majority just know Sherwood is short-term, not good enough and completely out of his depth. The new manager honeymoon is over, fans aren't calling for his head after one result, many didn't want him in the first place. But we are stuck with him until June either way, I just hope he tries to bed in the new signings and gives some youngsters a run in Europe.

I never thought we'd get near the Top 4 under him, and that looks even less likely now! Without CL football there will be clubs circling our better players, I only hope Van Gaal takes over in the Summer and gives us the experience and stability we need....especially with the new stadium coming we need a long term project, with an experienced manager!!",0,1393256332,null,0,1393257834,0,cfnfap0,t3_1yqlzk,t1_cfnfap0,t3_1yqlzk,null,1432537473,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,radioactivespider,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;experience tells me that most cutting of drugs is done with cheap fillers not very expensive alternative drugs.

Cutting is, as cutting is about increasing the quantity of it (not the strength not the effect) and selling it as one product.

e.g coke, speed you add a cheap powder thats as close to odorless and tasteless as possible e.g lactose powder start with an ounce of good speed add e.g an ounce of lactose I now can sell 2 ounce of speed.


Or for coke say you cut it 2:1 maybe it wasn't strong to start whit people will notice so you throw in a little amphetamine, the effect is different but its still a stimulant, so with the mix of coke, speed and lactose, it works close enough as expected for it not to be bunk and still work like people were expecting, again it wont fool a regular user, but in a club or a one off itll do.

However this isn't about cutting the cannabis its about getting more people to try heroin, by tricking them into smoking heroin then hoping they like ti enough to want just heroin in the future.

As for whether Bentaleb is better than Holtby, the answer to that would be yes and no. Holtby is the more mature player and he is probably individually better than Bentaleb, but it has to be stated that the two of them do not exactly play the same position. Bentaleb tends to start in a deeper role than Holtby would play. As a result Holtby is competing with Eriksen, who has been one of the teams best players, for playing time where as Bentaleb is competing with players like Paulinho, who has been rather inconsistent.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"&gt;After hitting the post the most times in the league

Well some things never change then! :/

But seriously though, this is what being a fan is all about. I became a fan in 1996 (I never saw Rush play for us. He left just a few weeks earlier. That's a huge regret of mine but I was 7 at the time so I didn't care back then).

Back in 1996 we were there or thereabouts but never could break into the top 2. *Oh well, it'll come.* My dad was sure of it too, we'd won the league only 6 years ago and it was a matter of time before we did it again. *So what if United have won the league twice in recent years? We're on 18 and they're on 9, they'll never catch us.*

Fast forward a few years and we've had our fair share of ups and downs. We finished 7th one year followed by a treble two years later. We dropped in and out of the CL and then all of a sudden we win the whole bloody thing with let's face it, far from the best squad in Europe at the time. *Champions League now, league title(s) next!!*

Fast forward another few years and we get shiny new owners. They're American. Not just American, one of them is **Texan** (by this stage I live in Texas) so I get excited about the prospect of some preseason friendlies here, some big-money signings and a ""spade in the ground"" in less than 2 months.  We see brand new stadium designs, we get to another CL final, and we get this sexy new Spaniard called Fernando who starts banging in the goals right from the off. *We will win the league*.  Theeeen the shit hits the fan. Hard. Yes, we finished 2nd (fucking Macheda), but we'd already shown massive signs of discord off the pitch. Cue a complete and utter collapse (of course though, we got a ""famous win"" over Bolton that one time) that we're STILL dragging ourselves out of now. Until we get back in the CL, our comeback isn't close to complete. We were perennial CL and league challengers. Getting back into the CL would just be the start. Those cunts set us back 5, possibly even 10 years. But fuck me, am I happy right now.

FSG, Rodgers, hell even Ian ""Fucking"" Ayre is immeasurably better than H&amp;G and their cohorts. Despite everything I've seen us go through, the highs, the lows and the **proper** lows, we stick by. We're not like the plastics at other clubs who support the team because of their bank balance or recent trophy haul. We're not like that kid on /r/reddevils who practically wrote a love letter announcing his ""arrival"" to /r/chelseafc because ""he couldn't agree with the direction United were heading"". Fuck that. We're Liverpool Football Club, and always will be. That's why me and my fellow fans go find a TV wherever in the world we happen to be to watch us every week, win or lose. I've watched Liverpool games in pubs in the middle of Beijing, a village in Mongolia, a wooden shack in Sierra Leone and watched all of our Champions League games online at the back of my uni classes on mute.

This has been the longest ""bad spell"" we've had, but it only makes the rise all the sweeter. I hope Rodgers stays with us for longer than Slur Alex stayed at United. I love our football, I love our players and for the first time in almost half a decade, I look forward every week to watching us play. In 18 years supporting this club, I've maybe missed half a dozen matches that were available to watch (obviously, streaming wasn't a thing for the first 10 or so years), but since then I refuse to miss our games. The last 5 years has made me a miserable, pessimistic bastard...but fuck me I'm excited now.

Even if that was a real problem, how do you think a person can integrate quickly with society? In few months, years?

Also, what do you regard as integration? I've heard that the problem can be even with Polish shops with Polish food, after all immigrants need to integrate fully and even forget about their country's food etc?

Although, I think it depends who we bring in. We CAN'T drop Hendo, he's too important. Gerrard is already a *rotation* player, when Lucas comes back. I don't think we'll bring more competition into that role. The good thing is he can play CM, if a freak accident happens and we have several injuries.

Joe Allen will be rotated a lot. He already has this role, but I don't think he'll lose playing time, because he'll be needed a lot in the cup competitions. I think he'll get the same playing time as now, if we bring someone in.

Coutinho will probably be the one who is 'fighting' per sea, because it's likely we'll be after Konoplyanka again. He's a hot/cold player and I think he'll get subbed more than anyone, if he doesn't show the talent he has. Also, he'll be used as a super sub, if he doesn't start the match.

I really hope Rodgers doesn't drop Sterling due to his age. He has every right to be on the first team sheet. The CL will give him so much confidence. I think he'll be used almost every week and he'll gain a ton of experience.

**Cameron** is the epitome of the posh mummy's boy, groomed for Oxbridge, privileged elite that the working class absolute abhor. Despite cringeworthy PR attempts at connecting with the ""real people"" (rolled up sleeves, hard-hitting sound-bites) he's still a posh Tory twat.

The conservative party that he leads, again, are the enemy of the working class - or to be particularly socialist - the class that works for the country's production, while he heads the (minority) class that does not work while scooping all the profit.

In Scotland he's particularly unpopular as a) Scotland never vote Tory yet consistently the UK as a whole DO, and b) the Tory party are responsible for shutting down our coal, steel, gas, shipping industries in the past and currently responsible for raking in some £300billion of our Oil money while 1 in 4 Scottish children live in poverty.

**Piers** is another dye-in-the-wool Tory cunt, but instead of being a PR cunt that went into politics (like Cameron), his life of exploitation and privilege has come through the media. 

He's a particular bedfellow of Rupert Murdoch, whose right-wing rags are a continual blight to this country. Piers was also involved in the phone-hacking scandals (although seems to have gotten away Scot-free) Worst of all after abandoning the country, still sees himself as an authority on football despite knowing absolutely nothing about the sport.

In short, despite being universally hated, both have risen to the top of respective industries emphasising the insidious power of the ball-licking elite upper classes.

true,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"Okay, integration point first. Here's one example. Between Dalry and Gorgie in Edinburgh, there are about 8 foreign-food shops that I can think of off the top of my head. There's an African supermarket (used to be two, but one sadly shut down a few months ago), a Chinese supermarket, two Indians, and four Polish. Of the Polish outlets, each one has a Polish name that is practically unpronouncable to all non-Poles. Of the other outlets, all have English, or at least, anglicised names. 

This, of course, isn't a wholly encompassing study. However, it is something that represents a phenomena and that loudly broadcasts a message, which appears to be that while Britain's other settling shop owners are pitching to be accessible to everyone, the Poles are keeping things more to themselves.  

The open letter in that article you posted here appears to confirm a degree of separation. Look at lines like *""Poles have contributed with their taxes 34% more to the economy when compared to the benefits taken, more than any other minority and even the British themselves""*. That's a very clear and strong distinction they're drawing between themselves, and everyone else in the country. Next paragraph, *""We can‘t understand why people who have respected British law, paid our taxes, contributed to the culture, have much in common and fought alongside the British on many occasions, notably in the Battle of Britain, should now be slandered""*. Again, the message of separation, but co-operation with Britain, is very clear.

true,SaradaV,lfc68,,"I think in a number of positions its going to be a case of stick of twist for Brendan in the summer. Centre back is a perfect example, even if we assume we'll probably never see Coates again for Liverpool that still leaves us with 4 experienced 1st team centre backs and a very promising (and expensive) young centre back. Despite that, there's clearly issues in that area of the pitch and I'd rather see investment there than in pretty much anywhere else besides left-back and out wide (where we pretty much know there'll be investment in the summer anyway). So really Brendan has to decide whether he's happy to go into next season with a centre back compliment of Sakho, Agger, Skrtel and Toure, or does he move one on and look to bring Ilori into the first team fold, or does he maybe move two of those on and invest in another centre back like he did with Sakho in the summer. 

Something clearly has to give at right back, as we surely can't carry Johnson, Kelly, Flanagan and Wisdom into next season with all looking for a spot in the first team. I'm certain Johnson will remain our no. 1 choice there, though with his injuries we probably could do with two back ups. I personally am of the opinion that if we recieve a decent bid for Kelly in the summer it might be time to let him go.

As I said, we'll see investment at left back in the summer, but I think Brendan has to decide whether he's happy to bring in an understudy to Enrique (a la Cissokho) or does he want to go big and look for a potential first team replacement. I imagine that will mostly come down to how much money he has left, and who's available on the market.

Midfield looks like the obvious place where someone will have to miss out, but with Lucas' knees and Gerrard increasing age I think we can almost guarantee that we'll have injuries in this part of the field at some point. I imagine that when all three of Lucas, Gerrard and Henderson are fit, we'll continue to see all three start, with Coutinho maybe being accommodated wide again. I reckon Lucas will be dropped before Gerrard and Hendo though, and it may be the case that we see Gerrard + Hendo + 1 of Lucas or Coutinho, especially if we see a big summer signing out wide. I think a loan for Alberto is inevitable with Suso coming back and Teixeira coming through.

Naturally we'll continue to see Suarez and Sturridge start, so I think we may see more of Sterling from the bench when everyone else is fit. I imagine if we see a 'marquee' signing anywhere it'll be a winger, who will share game time with Sterling. 

TL;DR: I reckon a 1st 11 of Migs, Johnson (Flanno and Wisdom in reserve), Sakho, Skrtel/new signing, Enrique/new signing, Gerrard, Henderson, Lucas/Coutinho, Sterling/new signing, Sturridge and Suarez. I know I haven't mentioned Allen but with both Lucas and Gerrard likely to miss game time, we should still see plenty of him in and around the squad.",0,1393263575,null,0,false,0,cfnih2a,t3_1yt2zk,t1_cfnih2a,t3_1yt2zk,null,1432538969,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Other times it'll be a new signing or Suso to take his place. 

We'll have to see how Enrique looks when he returns, even so I still think we need a new younger LB to either supplant him immediately or eventually take his place. We are probably ok at RB and have Wisdom returning next year. 

CB is the major issue now. I am starting to think one of Skrtel or Agger will be sold in the summer. That would leave us with Skrtel/Agger, Sakho, Toure and Wisdom for next season. Would we bring Ilori in straight away or allow him to develop further while on loan? I suppose it's the same question for Wisdom. If they are both loaned out again and we do sell Skragger then we'd need to buy another replacement. Or will Coates come back?? Doubt it.

Good club management and stability is hard to find at high levels.

There is awareness of the relativism of personal values and opinions and a corresponding emphasis on procedural rules for achieving consensus....

Stage 6: *The universal-ethical-principle orientation.* Right is defined by the decision of conscience in accord with self-chosen ethical principles appealing to logical comprehensiveness, universality and consistency.  These principles are abstract and ethical (The Golden Rule, the categorical imperative); they are not concrete moral rules like The Ten Commandments.  At heart, these are universal principles of justice, of the reciprocity and equality of human rights, and of respect for the dignity of human beings as individual persons.",0,1393267780,null,0,false,0,cfnkjmi,t3_1ys8gx,t1_cfnkjmi,t1_cfnioht,null,1432539946,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Other says ""as long as it's fair for native people but still keeps some elements from other people's origins"". You do realise that the first one was and is used by people on the very far right?

Why do you think it's so wrong to use a Polish name for a shop? It's written in the same alphabet as English and if you were to ask a cashier in that shop how to pronounce it and what it means they would gladly tell you that. Very often there is a back story of that name, for example ""Koziolek"" which means goat (goati-ish in fact) and reflects to the very popular Polish cartoon.

You may say, ""Why would I like to learn anything about Polish etc?"" but that's just ignorant, especially that most British people I have met and known usually asked me for example how to say this or that in Polish or at least how to pronounce my name correctly. You are not asked to learn whole language. You are not even asked to pronounce or guess what it means if you're not interested. You can still do shopping there and all Polish stock sold should have English labels.

What I'm trying to say that the integration doesn't have to mean forgetting everything about your own country and origins. It's also about sharing some stuff. I bet that many Brits who have ever worked with Poles know at least few Polish words (especially swearing or simple how are you, which you already may know as Borat's ""Jak sie masz"" is exactly what we use).

By an ""integration"" we shouldn't abandon everything about our culture and origins. ""Polish delicatessen 'Koziolek'"" isn't offending to anybody and if something it tries to show a little about our culture, food etc. London has it's China Town and it's obviously a pride of British multiculturalism, not some kind of ""not integrating"" part. Even though I can't even read Chinese words.

&gt;The open letter in that article you posted here appears to confirm a degree of separation.

Not really. How else can we defend? Especially when far-right uses different slogans against us? What shall we say instead? There was a study, nationally reported and often quoted. The same quotes are used here. The study if you had a chance looking at it was not done by Poles but by British university staff. We are being officially named as ""Eastern Europeans"" by national papers (whether left or right wing), by politicians and by probably many many average Brits. We are already on the side here. Why would we abandon any research which although talks about us in separation defends our place in this country?

Anyone who claims that housing benefits don't benefit the people they're paying for is utterly stupid.

He is intent on seeing out his tenure with the Dutch National Team until the end of the word cup but he and Levy have been having talks since January. AVB was an ""all eggs in one basket"" ordeal and Sherwood was brought in as damage control as soon as we all saw that AVB's success was largely due to Bale's amazing individual performances. At the end of the day, we're still in 5th place with young players and great potential. We just need a manager that will get the best out of us and LVG could be that guy. Let's just hope that Sherwood manages to keep us in 5th place because that is the best we can hope for from him (I like to dream about 4th but we're just too inconsistent).

I haven't done so. Don't over interpret what I say. I meant English women are less attractive on average, when compared to women from some other nations.

&gt;I'm married to one, most of the sub reddits male readers will be in a relationship with one, maybe a few of the readers are women, and maybe a few have daughters

And you can have a beautiful wife. It still doesn't stop me on admitting then in my own opinion British women on average are less attractive.

&gt;And had it occurred to you that maybe some men like larger women

So what? I'm not going to kill obese people. I'm only admitting than on general obese people are less attractive than non obese. ""Fat"" people should also have normal lives like all others... but plenty of them should try a bit harder.

&gt;and whats your fascination with women 

Duh, I'm a man. Why would I be fascinated with men? I don't give my opinion about men's looks as I don't look at them as often as I did and do at women. Simple as that.

&gt;If you don't like English women than that's fine

I didn't say I don't like English women. Look above. Also, by saying ""don't like"" I would have to take all other points into account and I obviously know looks are not the only thing to focus when judging a person whether I like him/her or not.

&gt;but don't come here expecting any kind of agreement.

Free world. People have racist views and share them. I only said one simple thing about personal observations of attractiveness of a certain population. People are just sometimes too sensitive and can't have an objective discussion if it attacks them personally. I even admitted that other (than mine) nationals are more beautiful and personally think Brazilian and Russian girls are at the top of the highest numbers of beautiful women.",0,1393270938,null,0,false,0,cfnm45v,t3_1ysde0,t1_cfnm45v,t1_cfnlq5w,null,1432540686,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"The notion that Bentaleb was starting against Norwich in place of Eriksen, I believe, is a flawed one. If anyone was playing in place of Eriksen yesterday, it was Dembele. Several times this season we have seen Eriksen play wide left with Lennon playing on his natural right side. When we are lined up with Eriksen out wide, he is given the freedom to cut infield and create with Rose overlapping on the left and Walker and Lennon providing the width on the right. Yesterday, we initially lined up just as we did against Newcastle, Lennon playing wide left with Dembele on the opposite wing. Yesterday, Dembele was asked to be the creator that floats inside. My problem with that decision is that Dembele is a creative player, but he is not a creator like Eriksen. Dembele prefers to do his work on the ball whereas Eriksen likes to let the ball do the work. 

The game plan yesterday was to overload the middle with Rose and Naughton providing the width. This can be attested to by the fact that Sherwood started the match with four central midfield players and with Lennon playing inverted. Once Capoue was injured, several shifts happened, but the game plan to overload the middle remained the same. Bentaleb was forced to drop from his box to box role and into Capoue's CDM role, but still was asked to shoulder the majority of ball retention in the middle. Chadli replaced Capoue and moved wide left but was asked to play through the middle. Lennon shifted back to his natural right side. Dembele moved into the middle, but was still expected to be the creator. There are several problems with that. Attempting to overload the middle with Dembele, a player who loves to have his space so that he can dribble past people is stupid. What creative skills he does have are negated by depriving him of the space necessary for him to thrive and create through his dribbling.

What also hurt us is that we were relying on Rose and Naughton to provide us with width. Kyle Naughton is no Kyle Walker. Also, Rose was being asked to both raid the left side and keep Norwich's best player on the day in Snodgrass in check. With the loss of Capoue, we had no natural CDM to assist him. Bentaleb was running like ragged out on the pitch yesterday as he had to both play as a CDM and play as the main ball retaining midfielder. Dembele is not the sort to put in loads of effort in the initial and secondary phases of possession. He instead prefers to get the ball near the final third. For some reason, Paulinho, who normally is a workhorse in the center of the pitch didn't seem at all willing to assist Bentaleb in the transition phases and instead played higher up. I think it showed several times when Norwich would press high on Bentaleb and force us into back passes that resulted in one of the numerous hoofs up field to no one in particular. It also showed when Bentaleb made the mistake that led to Norwich's goal. Rose was vertical of him and was looking for a pass through a Norwich player and neither Dembele nor Paulinho put in the work to offer him passes infield. This left Bentaleb, whose job it is to maintain possession at all costs, isolated on the ball on the outside with no passing options. He showed his youth and held on to it for too long rather than just getting rid of it as he should have. IMHO, some serious questions need to be asked of Sherwood's game plan and Paulinho's and Dembele's work rate during the initial and secondary phases of possession as they were pretty lazy yesterday.",0,1393276412,null,0,1393276617,0,cfnovr3,t3_1ysxjm,t1_cfnovr3,t1_cfngxgw,null,1432542054,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

&gt;""**Doing a Leeds**"" is an [English football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) phrase which has become synonymous with the potential dire consequences for domestic [clubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) of [financial mismanagement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_mismanagement), following the rapid demise in the 2000s of [Leeds United A.F.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.), a [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) club that invested heavily to reach the semi-finals of the lucrative [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) European competition, but in the process built up large debts. The club suffered a ""financial meltdown"" after failing to continue to qualify for the competition, and subsequently dropped down two levels of the [football pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system), into the third tier, [Football League One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_One), for the first time in history.

true,Ghengiscone,flair6,,"The problem with looking at it like other sports is that besides wanting to win the league every great player in Europe wants to be playing champions league football. In American sports players are already at the pinnacle of competition in their field AND because of the parity of American sports nearly every team in a league has the ability to win the title. In football if a player of great skill wants to be winning titles and playing in champions league and feels that they can do neither with their current club they voice their displeasure rather vocally, have their agent send out feelers to other clubs, refuse to turn up for training or play, etc and because all these other clubs want them the owning club has little recourse.

Each player is an asset based on the initial transfer fee and wages paid over the course of the contract, and when a player doesn't play or voices their discontent, the value of the asset goes down and thus the club loses money. In American sports there is no outlay for the player previous to signing a contract and there is nothing to gain monetarily from letting the player go so proceedings like the potential Vert situation don't happen as often. 

If Jan wants to leave and starts acting like a prat we have the option of not playing him, which makes his value go down, making him play, which makes his morale go down, which could also affect the team, or selling him, which gets wages off the books of a player who doesnt want to be here and we make a tidy sum off of it.

If Enrique is consistently healthy, I think he's a good enough player that we don't really need to be talking about bringing in a ""top"" LB any time soon...but unfortunately he's just been starting to break down recently, and in really major ways. Who's to say how he'll be after his knee injury, but I'll tell you from having been through it myself, it takes a lot longer than you think to get back to 100%. Athletes have all the advantages in the world when it comes to recovery, but it may just not be in the cards. They're expected to go right back into performing at a crazy high level, so the risk of re-injury is very high. And even if they don't get hurt again immediately, it could be another season or so before he feels completely confident in that knee, by which point maybe he's started to lose some of his sharpness, or maybe the opportunity is gone entirely and he's been sold on to another club. 

So really, as much as I want Enrique to get back to where he was, we really need to be looking to bring in a highly-rated younger LB this Summer.

Having a 125 for some time first will help you with insurance as well. And you can always get a two stroke for more punch or a sportbike for speeds.

&gt;

&gt;**Remembrance of the Daleks** is the first [serial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [25th season](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_25\)) in the British [science fiction television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 5 October to 26 October 1988. It was written by [Ben Aaronovitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Aaronovitch) and directed by Andrew Morgan.

&gt;In the serial, alien time traveller [the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor) ([Sylvester McCoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_McCoy)) and his [companion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) [Ace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(Doctor_Who\)) ([Sophie Aldred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Aldred)) travel back to the beginning of the Doctor's journey to retrieve the Hand of Omega and keep it from the [Daleks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek), the reason why he fled his home planet [Gallifrey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey).

&gt;The serial contained many references to the history of the show. It is set in 1963, around the same time as the very first Doctor Who episode, An Unearthly Child. Remembrance of the Daleks returns the Doctor to [Coal Hill School](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Hill_School) and the junkyard at 76 Totter's Lane, locations first seen in that episode. The serial also continues the story arc of a [civil war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war) between rival [Dalek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) factions, culminating in a showdown between the Doctor and Dalek Emperor [Davros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davros). This was the last appearance of Davros and the Daleks in the original run of Doctor Who; after a brief mention in [the 1996 television film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)), the Daleks would return in the 2005 episode ""[Dalek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_(Doctor_Who_episode\))"".

What you can do is do your theory and CBT separate of the DAS.  This is what I did and then I did the 3 day DAS which was training / mod1 / mod2 although with no experience you'd probably need to do more than the 3 day one.

Best way is to do your CBT, get a cheap 125 and learn all the basics and get comfortable riding a bike and riding it well.  Then decide how you want to move forward.  If you know how to ride a 125 safely and correctly you can fly through the DAS course later.

true,Kleenexwontstopme,null,null,"In my opinion we should sell Agger, Johnson and Lucas. All are far too injury prone and when they do play they are all obviously past their best. 

They'd be good squad players admittedly but they're all probably on fairly high wages. Meaning if we sold them we could probably get someone younger, equally good, and for less money. 

Besides that I don't see many sales. I don't think Borini or Aspas really have a place in a champions league squad. Although I'd like to be proven wrong. I personally like Borini but I just don't see it working out. Alberto probably out on loan with Texeira getting a bigger role (on the bench anyways) next season. 

We'll need to replace Cissokho because I can't imagine we'll take him permanently. Same with Moses. 

If all of the above happened then we'd obviously need to buy in a few positions:

Striker/ wide forward (first XI quality; and someone for the bench)
DM / holding mid (to rotate with Gerrard, or start most of the season)
CM (to rotate with Coutinho, Allen, Henderson)
LB (starting XI quality to give Enrique competition)
RB (starting XI quality)
CB (starting XI quality)


Having listed it all out it looks like a lot of new players. So most of this probably won't happen.

It doesn't matter that other managers came close - it was Di Matteo that won it. It doesn't matter that we had our fair share of luck, because Di Matteo still succeeded where other managers failed.

It's also not a fair comparison, because the squad under Di Matteo was in a much worse place than it was under most other Chelsea managers of the Abramovich era. Factor in that we basically gave up in the league at the end of 2011/2012 (reserves against Liverpool at Anfield, anyone?) and the statistics are a lot more skewed. I'm not saying his league performance was great, and I don't think he was a long-term solution at all, but I'm just pointing out how the statistics you've provided are misleading.

&gt; I don't believe he deserves as much credit as he is given

I think you're devaluing his achievements - 'other managers came close' 'game of luck', sounds like you're saying that what he did was not that big a deal.
