true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"&gt;Not many people would associate the old trophy with the league though (since they probably weren't alive at the time or too young to remember.)

I'm too young to remember (I was 8 months old the last time we won the league) but that still doesn't mean we should have the new trophy to represent us winning the old one. The old Division 1 trophy is now the Championship trophy because according to the Football League, it's the same division. It really should have the proper trophy up there. not having a go, just saying...it would only get us stick from other fans for pretending we've won the Prem or something.

The Shaw deal i think will be a sticking point for any LBs on the market of any type of quality.  Alberto Moreno for example seemed locked on to go to LFC but seems to have to stalled out because Sevilla are trying to get other teams to come in so they can drive up the price. 

£15m for Davies i personally think seems steep, but honestly....that really may be the market at the moment.  Rodriguez will probably end up going for similar money as Shaw (probably less but £20m - £25m seems likely), Sevilla are wanting Moreno to go for £20m+. 

I would think personally £10m would still be worth it for Davies, i think if it was say £10m with incentives that may push the price to £12m i wouldn't be upset with it.  My concern is that Swansea seemingly want much closer to £16m+ which starts to get steep especially if Swansea push for add-on clauses.",0,1404331425,null,0,false,0,cimwljo,t3_29o5mq,t1_cimwljo,t1_cimuvju,null,1434521004,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

With Suarez, we finished 7th, then 8th, then 6th.  Last season he was in insane form (arguably the form of his life) for his first 16 games back, scoring 22.  The last 17 games, he had 9.  His first full season, he scored 11 for us with a ridiculous 138 shots.  Historically, he's been pretty poor against the sides with better defenses, instead piling up shit loads of goals against poor sides.

I personally think the improvements to the squad (e.g. Henderson's improved form, Coutinho and Sturridge coming into the side, our formation changes to a side that allows for more goals at both ends) are what lead to Suarez's great degree of success last season rather than any inherent improvements he had to his game.  Yes, Suarez draws defenders, but equally the likes of Sturridge and Sterling create space for Suarez.  

In other words, the changes to the squad are what allowed us to go from spots 6 through 8 with Suarez to 2nd also with Suarez and I have no reason to not believe Rodgers and the rest of the staff couldn't make further changes which would again improve performances, even without Suarez.",0,1404332263,null,0,false,0,cimx11k,t3_29nyw3,t1_cimx11k,t1_cimsws2,null,1434521328,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

&gt;it is clearly something which should be opt-in so that those of us who don't want it don't need to do anything.

It shouldn't exist at all, all it is, is a barrier to knowledge and experience, under the guise of 'protecting the children' The irony being that when the 'internet is down' it's often the kids fixing the fucking thing.

I make no excuses for what I use the internet for, Masturbation, education and information. When you add any kind of block to that service it can only end negatively. You either get sexually frustrated, or stupid/ignorant and brainwashed. I don't know about you but I don't want the government deciding what I can and can't show my children, the horrors of war should be studied and understood to avoid conflict, not avoided, human sexuality should be discussed, studied (incredibly rigorously) and understood to avoid hatred and bigotry, and all information should be available to all so that the mistakes of the past can be reviewed understood and avoided. It's no good exposing children to this after they've 'grown up' and made their minds up, by then it's too late, and it may take years to 'correct' a behaviour that would've taken minutes as a child.

However, at RW?  That wouldn't be a bad shout.  Despite being listed as a defender on the US roster, Yedlin actually played RW this World Cup, and did so rather well.  Against Portugal and Germany, he was instantly dangerous running against tired defenders, and he ran the Belgian defense ragged for 90'.

As a winger, he's basically a 20-year old Lennon with more potential upside.  Wicked pace, puts in a good defensive shift when  the fullback is caught forward, and already crosses the ball better than Lennon ever has.  His particular strengths are suited to the Premier League.  Did I mention he's only 20?

""Passive"" income is often used as a bit of a misnomer, you'll need to put in effort at some stage to make money, it's just possible you'll make money for longer than you're putting in effort. 

Interest on savings is a type of passive income, but to make any meaningful amount (even £100) you'll need a lot of money at your disposal (tens of thousands). This isn't really passive as you've had to work very hard (presumably) for your thousands of pounds. 

People often refer to passive income regarding ongoing money coming in from some prior project, such as blogs, websites or apps. This again isn't truly passive as you'll have had to put in a lot off effort to make whatever the project is successful. 

As for ideas, websites, blogs and apps are a good place to start. For a blog or a website you'd only need enough money for a domain name and hosting (£30 or so for the year) and you can start trying to make money from ads or affiliate programs. To make a meaningful amount, your site/blog will need to generate a lot of traffic.

Alternately you could invest in stocks/shares, which can provide a larger return, but with added risk. To have £100 per month income, a dividend portfolio would be the best way to go. You would need at least 4-6+ different dividend paying stocks to achieve a payout each month though, and then have a large sum in each. The average dividend payout on the FTSE 100 is 3% ish IIRC, but if you chose correctly you could average 5-6%.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"I genuinely agree with you so much, ethics-wise especially in a perfect world I'd happily swing that sword of justice. But here and now, with Facebook? Nah, I genuinely don't see this as a big enough deal and I'm willing to allow website operators to actually do stuff with their traffic otherwise what's the point of building websites? Its not like Facebook are doing _that_ well, they're still bleeding users after burning cash for about a decade.  
We're also just talking about hiding stuff that _should_ have appeared in your feed that you could still easily see if you went to the user's wall. It's like putting something that is on the shelf slightly out of reach.

and I don't buy that you can't go elsewhere. You have a phone, I have a phone, your grandma probably has a phone. All of the ""old"" services still work, some new services exist (Path, for example) the fact is that you like Facebook because everyone is conveniently there and its easy.  
Will you stop using it because of this? How much do you really care about this issue? I'd be interested to know.  

and don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be smug here (well maybe just a bit) but I'm coming from a position where I've already accepted that my habits and my laziness contribute to the worlds ills and I'm too apathetic to do anything about it.  
I still shop at supermarkets even though that's what helps contribute to the 30%+ wasted food rate, I buy processed food even though its likely contributing to poor conditions for animal welfare or shitty deals for farmers. I sit here glaring at a computer screen wrought from rare earth minerals that were mined in countries that have less than stellar workers rights records. My energy is likely somewhat Russian powered.

So considering that... I find that getting pissy with Facebook just because they decided not to immediately show me a post by a friend waffling some sort of emo shit is kinda pointless considering the perspective.  
.... and if we're on that whole civil disobedience tip (the US government apparently funded the test) then there a number of different things to campaign against before we even consider this. I mean if we _really_ cared then why are we even still using an American service? We all read the Snowden didn't we? They record _everything_ you say and analyse it...... but.... but.... its mighty convenient and everyone is on it. So fuck the ethics, too much hassle, I will just flop upon this couch.

Morris described *Blue Jam* as not being about belly laughs but about a forehead smile, and that it was best listened to at three in the morning after being awake all day.

Correct, but the issue is we don't have to. The majority of people who are currently in food poverty and suffer are farmers - the ones that grow it and ship it out here.

And the 2nd or 3rd door block the other lane. Hence the bus jam not just for the 4 buses with the 4 doors, but also for the 4 buses with 4 more doors for the next ""platform"" 50m next to it. So - *if* they're full, there's a whoopin' 624 passengers stuck in traffic. Of course, the 4 buses with this high capacity are an almost idealistic scenario, last time I checked, a few buses were no double deckers, so less seats.

Again, the Škoda 15T in the Prague variant - 6 big double doors. Which all can be open at the same time. A feature that even the Edinburgh trams have, however inadequate they might be otherwise.

About the other thing:
I know that building a proper bus station now would be a way too big thing to do. But why was that not thought out before? It's not like the train station just popped up there overnight or that the city centre just moved there a year ago or even that the bus lines didn't exist a fortnight ago. I'm just wondering how this serious lapse in planning could happen.",0,1404340552,null,0,false,0,cin14b1,t3_29n6dy,t1_cin14b1,t1_cimtpb0,null,1434523322,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

We've still got him on 4 years and he's (imho) the 3rd best player in the world.

All we have to do is look at Gareth Bale. Great talent, skilled player, sold to Real Madrid less than a year ago for what was it 85 million? Bale and Suarez were tied two years ago for 23 goals. Suarez last year scored 31.... I think it's pretty obvious who the better player is. 

Barcelona are not stupid nor are they poor. If you want the third best player in world football you gotta pay up for him. Bale money at minimum and honestly should logically be a bit more than him.

I'm also happy for anyone to call Mohammed a paedophile.  Why?  Firstly because he died 14 centuries ago!  He's dust by now - I'm sure he's not going to get offended.

Secondly because it's arguably true!  According to tradition, it may well be the case that he married a 9 year old.  

&gt;""they're taking over the country"" 

This is of course a statement about *people*, and not their ideas.  I don't agree with the statement, but neither do I think we should stop people from expressing such sentiments. There *are* valid concerns about Muslim immigration and demographics and trying to shut up such concerns through political correctness is currently backfiring in a big way.  

&gt;I'm not convinced that generalisations about what ""they all believe"" (or ""they all do"") are much better.

I for one never claimed that all Muslims believe anything.  I suspect a good proportion of Muslims are simply cultural Muslims who couldn't care less about the Quran.

But again - it's useful to compare to how we handle arguments about non-religious ideologies.  If I claimed  that (for instance) conservatives don't like raising taxes would people call me a bigot?  Would they tell me that since not every conservative believes exactly the same thing that I'm making mass generalizations?  Would people tell me that conservatism is a big and complex ideology and that I'm being reductionist?  And so on.  Even if I was factually wrong in a political opinion would I be accused of prejudice?  Well, on reddit perhaps they would, but likely, most people would understand that political criticism is a necessary part of sorting out good ideas from bad.

--------

Of course, some statements can be bigoted, but only when they're applied to *people* and not their ideas.  Ideas don't have feelings and so can't be harmed, whereas people can most definitely be harmed by dangerous ideas.

However if you are intent on camping near Bloody Bridge there's a camping site pretty much just up from it. I haven't been myself but the reviews of it seem to be favourable. As far as I know there's three main fields within the camp site - that is said to not be too busy in the first place - which would mean if yis are wanting a swall you's could probably find a spot in at least one of the fields and could be rowdy enough and not bother anyone. I've pinned it on Google Maps for you [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bloody+Bridge+Backpackers/@54.1732905,-5.880981,2091m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sgoogle+maps!3m1!1s0x0:0xa842b1d87deed1ed), hopefully you can see that okay. [Here](http://www.bloodybridge.com/html/campsites.html) is the website of the place itself which shows the fields and other info. The website also says that they have toilets and secure parking which would save you from keeping the car down at the main Bloody Bridge carpark, which, to be honest, I wouldn't really trust particularly during the Summer (see the aforementioned smicks issue!).

A few points: New American redditors, as an American redditor I'm really disappointed. Just because you were really proud of Tim Howard in the moment, doesn't mean you abuse your anonymity by downvoting someone for an opinion that opposes the ""Tim Howard is the best goalkeeper of all time"" frenzy that's sweeping around the states right now. You guys have probably seen nothing of Tim Howard except this world cup, which is why you're here now, and the Tim Howard you've seen is based on a total of 4 games. 4 games. That's not enough to accurately judge how good of a keeper someone is, especially if you're judging that compared to the less than 4 games you've seen of other keepers.

/u/layendecker, on the other hand, has been watching Tim Howard games every week for years. His opinion is much more educated than yours, and although I might not agree with him either, you downvoting him because you disagree with him is downright ignorant, immature, and wrong. American fans of this sport already have a bad name, and this is just an example why. You, right there, were an example why.

This all being said, /u/layendecker has gotten cold responses to his comments here before, let's not pretend that's new. He's a cynical long-time fan whose idealism regarding Everton success has been tempered by time, and although many of us have argued with him here before in times of hope (us almost passing Arsenal last season comes to mind) he's basically almost always been right.

So, in conclusion, although I hope some of the new American fans see this and decide to cry for their sins and for being an example of the American ignorance and overzealousness that we get stereotyped for, I think this should be an example to all of us as well, because we've all been guilty to some degree.

There are certainly practices and aspects of ""muslim culture"" that I'm unhappy with, but I don't tar all of Islam with them.

I'm not against signing Lallana, especially at the reported 16-17m + add ons.  I hope he does well, keeps getting better and proves me completely wrong.

Assuming the % was lower back in 2007, Asians were proportionally represented, may even have been under-represented in sex crimes if they still made up more than 5.6% of the population, or may have been slightly over-represented if the proportion was less than 5.6%.

Specifically in terms of grooming Asians appear to be quite highly over-represented, but those statistics are not for the whole of England and Wales as not all police forces responded to the CEOP. 

Was this incident the OP of this thread posted an incident of grooming? It may have been, but if not the over-representation of Asians in grooming isn't relevant here

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"""because under your system by definition the more privileged and richer someone is the better social support they recieve""

That is the exact opposite of what I am saying.

If someone or someones family is rich, they will not need support from their community as they already have the money needed to employ the help they need.

""only people fortunate enough to have relatives will be helped""

Which is why the system kills two birds with one stone. If the system reverts back to the way it was, of a time when families took care of their weakest, it would encourage people to have children, thus sorting out the aging population problem.

Also, you misunderstood again. No where did i say help should be denied to those who have no family. If one had no family, immediate or not, they could rely on their community or, if needed, local charities, local healthcare and yes, even the government.

However to lighten the load on the NHS and government, families and communities need to step up and start helping instead of assuming everything should be done by the government.

""and only in proportion to the wealth of their relatives""

I have absolutely no idea where you keep getting this from.

Not once did i even mention wealth. That's a strawman argument if i ever did see one.

""It's a mad system that would only entrench poverty and suffering within communities and families to an even greater degree than currently.""

This 'mad system' works fine in China, Japan, South Korea, most South-East Asian countries, India, most oceanic islands and nations, many parts of africa and also Latin America.

Its also the way things used to be in this country.

""Also it's been tried before - it's where the word Dickensian comes from.""

Surely that's hypocrisy. 

I've see a lot of UKIP supporters say they are bored of having their views swatted away by being called racist. I think that was a legitimate complaint, and I think governments in the past should have at least listened and tried to combat these peoples views rather than essentially ignoring them. 

More recently, I have seen plenty of legitimate arguments against UKIP, or UKIPs point of view, be it them ignoring the TTIP, or criticising issues in the EU while ignoring very similar issues in the UK, or using statistics to say how some schools are full of non-English speaking foreigners when the party leaders children make up 2 of those number. 

However, I still see many UKIP supporters first line of argument going along the lines of 'people only disagree with us because of political ignorance or because they think we're racist'. This is exactly the same line people would take in the past with issues UKIP claim they are dealing with. Surely you can see it is hypocritical to complain your views are being ignored, while ignoring the plethora of legitimate views arguing against you?",0,1404349185,null,0,false,0,cin4wim,t3_29otmq,t1_cin4wim,t1_cin1i05,null,1434525311,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm not particularly impressed with our transfer business this summer so far, but a lot of it depends on who we bring in, form, and luck. If we bring in most of our targets, the defense improves a bit, everyone's form stays the same, and we avoid major injuries, we'll be challenging for the title again.

By the same token, if we have a bad transfer window or our new guys flop, or our top players have a bad run of form, or we have more big injury issues, I could see us really sliding, too. Granted it'd take probably all of that happening at once to knock us to 10th, but I think some people on here are forgetting that regardless of how well we did last year, everyone starts from zero in the new season.

The top four is going to be *tough.* 

Man City is Man City, 'nuff said. Infinite money is always hard to compete with. 

Chelsea have finally signed a striker. Sure, he flopped in the World Cup, but in the PL he's not going to have 70k Brazilians booing every time he touches the ball. 

Arsenal look to be strengthening further with Sanchez, and they could be a real contender this year if they don't get hit with the injury stick again.

Everton could do things too; Martinez is a great manager and they've got some exciting young talent. You never know when a guy like Barkley is going to explode into full-on superstar mode. 

Spurs may be a force too. I know some people will laugh, but look at what Pochettino was able to do with them early last season; heck, they beat us at Anfield. Granted, he wasn't able to sustain it, but Spurs have a much better team than Soton (on paper, anyway).

Manc Scum sadly now have what appears to be a competent manager, and they're clearly willing to spend some serious cash this summer.

Luis Suárez’s transfer from Liverpool to Barcelona appears increasingly likely after a day of “productive” talks ended with the clubs closing in on an outline agreement of the forward’s value.
  
Despite suggestions that Barcelona would attempt to use Suárez’s recently imposed four-month suspension as a bargaining chip to try to sign the 27-year-old Uruguay forward at a discount, there was an acceptance from the Spanish club that they will have to come up with a package that at least comes close to Liverpool’s expectations.
  
Liverpool are seeking in the region of £80 million for the striker, and that valuation failed to deter Raul Sanllehi and Antoni Rossich, Barcelona’s football director and general director, who represented last season’s La Liga runners-up at the negotiations in London.
  
It is understood that during lengthy talks, Ian Ayre, the Liverpool managing director, reaffirmed his club’s desire to sign Alexis Sánchez, but although Barcelona are prepared to allow him to leave, the situation is complicated by the Chile winger not yet having determined where he sees his future amid interest from Juventus.
  
Ideally, Barcelona would like to include Sánchez as a makeweight in the deal and that would suit Liverpool, although settling on a price for the 25-year-old is unlikely to be straightforward after his value increased as a result of his outstanding performances at the World Cup.
  
Suárez is likely to move to the Nou Camp regardless of Sánchez’s position, and it is understood that Rossich outlined a proposed payment structure for the transfer. Although no deal was struck, a source close to the talks described them as “productive” as a result of both sides having “sensible expectations”. With the basis for a transfer having been established, the clubs will hold a further round of negotiations in the near future, once Barcelona have established whether Sánchez is prepared to sign for Liverpool.
  
While the discussions were taking place, Barcelona continued their public pursuit of Suárez, with Josep Bartomeu, the club’s president, becoming the latest high-ranking Nou Camp official to praise the former Ajax player for apologising for biting Giorgio Chiellini, the Italy defender.
  
“It honours him. It’s not easy to admit your mistakes,” Bartomeu said before confirming that Barcelona are in the market for a forward this summer. “We have the names and the players, but sometimes there are clubs who speculate over possible signings by Barça to manipulate the price. All I can say is that they are names that have been agreed with Luis Enrique [the new coach] and they excite us.”
  
Suárez is understood to have agreed personal terms in principle with Barcelona, and wants his future to be resolved at the earliest possible opportunity to avoid any prospect of an acrimonious departure from Liverpool.
  
That objective appears achievable, particularly with Liverpool also seeking a swift resolution to the saga as they look to ensure that there will be no repeat of last summer when Suárez attempted unsuccessfully to force a move to Arsenal, causing disruption.
  
With will on all sides to reach an agreement, it seems increasingly likely that Suárez will fulfil his long-held ambition to play for Barcelona and that Liverpool will not stand in his way, as long as the deal allows them the opportunity to replace a player whom Brendan Rodgers regards as one of the best in world football.
  
Sánchez’s arrival would go some way towards achieving that objective and Liverpool also maintain a strong interest in Lazar Markovic, the Benfica winger, with a deal for Divock Origi, the Lille forward, also close to completion.",0,1404350534,null,0,false,0,cin5ho1,t3_29p35y,t1_cin5ho1,t3_29p35y,null,1434525622,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

And yes, some are single deckers with much less capacity, obviously those get used on routes that generate less passengers (or where you're running the buses with such frequency that you don't have time to get that many passengers waiting) - again something the honking big trams wouldn't replace so well.

As to the bus station - I guess it comes down to Waverley Market being privately owned and built to house shops, rather than duplicating the existing bus station on St Andrews Square (which is of course why there's a tram stop there and not at Waverley, too).

But people are glossing over what a serious effect it will have on our team. We'll be starting the season off on a down note, I don't care who else we bring in.

They, like most of the rest of us, will be thinking we couldn't win it last year with him and now we've got to go this whole season with out him. It's going to resonate all season. If we need a late goal one match there will be a bit less confidence without him here. And all it takes a a few dropped points before those feelings amplify. 

We're playing with fire and we might just burn the whole thing down. Sounds dramatic but what if we miss top 4 next year?

true,Gustyarse,null,null,"LOL, my local MP tried to sort out my situation.  I was told that I had not attended an assessment to which I had not received an invite, and as a result I was cut-off from the system.  I replied, offering to immediately attend this meeting I did not know about, but that was unacceptable.  Still cut off.  I appealed this decision, explaining that I did not know about the interview as I had not received the letter.  Two months later, decision:  still cut off.

I had to go through what must have been an expensive (for the tax payer) procedure of litigation before it was accepted that I, living in a multi-occupation dwelling, with 12 tenants in the last two years, might actually have not received that letter.  It was assumed that all mail arrives with a 100% success rate.  Failing to receive one letter was tantamount to fraud.

I received not a penny in something like 8 months.  If it had not been for friends and family members, I would have had to either turn to crime or kill myself.

So no, your MP cannot help.  They ignore him/her.  In fact, no-one from the department involved even bothered to turn up to the appeal.  They knew they'd lose it.  But until it was overturned, I was one more person not on the official figures.  I was a win for IDS.

So in the end, I was sorted out, but who can live on nothing for 8 months? I was very lucky, I had friends and family that kept buying me groceries, but I DID NOT WORK FOR 30 YEARS TO BE FUCKED OVER LIKE THIS. I paid a lot of tax, a lot of National Insurance - is that a joke, now? National Insurance - what exactly does it insure you from?


edit:: oh just to make sure you realise how funny this is, I was repeatedly told that if I dropped my counter-claim, if I stopped accusing them of fucking me around, they'd give me money right away.  I could get job-seekers allowance.  So long as I decided I was fit for work, which my doctor was very much against.  Utter fucking blackmail. Again, if not for support, I would have had to accept this.

I can't explain how black the hearts are of the people deciding on these policies.

Right, but is he making those good passes because his new teammates make such great runs or because he's improved? 

Is he creating opportunities because his new teammates are better at creating space for him? 

Playing with better players undoubtedly makes any player look better, and it's very hard to know whether it's the player or the players surrounding him, remember Lallana was one of the best players in the PL last season already. 

&gt;You're being very optimistic with your outlook (more goals, assists, etc.) If he does all of that, then yeah, that's fair

It wasn't a prediction, it was an example. 

He could go and get more goals if he's played in his favoured position, but the good thing about Lallana, and the reason he'll fit in at Liverpool, is his versatility. You say 'will he be up to fighting for his place', but realistically his place is right across the front line, so he naturally gets more chances to play.

One of Lallana's biggest assets is his pressing, I think his workrate could be quite under appreciated if he doesn't bang in goals right away. ",0,1404353151,null,0,false,0,cin6mc7,t3_29nyw3,t1_cin6mc7,t1_cin6cwb,null,1434526218,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Now I live in a town in Warwickshire which is an easy 25 minute commute to Birmingham or an hour and 20 minutes to London, the train station is walking distance. You're really asking too broad a question, you'd do best to figure out which city it is you want to be near and then start looking at which towns in the commuter belt come recommended. There are loads of satellite towns outside the major cities that are heavily populated by families since they demand larger properties and are heavily concerned with catchment areas for schools. Most of these will have trains running into the city for the daily commute but it's worth checking. Obviously since there's demand to live in these areas house prices generally reflect this. London works on the same principle but the commute area is much bigger and you have to go quite a long way out until you start seeing house prices / living costs more reflective of the rest of the country. Where I live has almost as many people commuting to London as to Birmingham despite London being almost a whole hour further away on the train. 

edit: oh and I'll add that in suburbia it's generally preferable to own a car, that said you don't need to a own a car, there are always buses and trains to get you to major hubs of activity unless you're living somewhere rural, the problem is if you want to visit your friend 5 miles away there probably won't be a direct route and taxis are expensive.

Chris Morris did [sets for that show](http://www.cookdandbombd.co.uk/forums/index.php?page=thebreezeblock), I seem to remember fragments of Blue Jam being broadcast within the Breezeblock, but I may remember it wrong.  That wiki says it simply followed on.  Either way, that's how I ended up hearing it.

At the time I was around 16, 17, and the show ran (IIRC) 11-1am and then shifted even later, midnight-2am ish.  Monday nights, I'm pretty sure.  So to listen to it, I had to stay up late after having gone to bed, on my Walkman, with school the next morning.  It was quite a commitment but I discovered so much of my favourite music via that show.  

As for Blue Jam - I don't think I really knew what to make of it at the time to be honest.  It's pretty ambient and surreal and since I was often sleepy or literally sinking into sleep as it was broadcast, I don't have clear memories of it.  I would agree with simoncowbell, I found it intriguingly creepy more than laugh-out-loud funny.  I certainly hadn't heard anything remotely like it on radio, (although older people could probably find precedents of some sort); I guess at the time _I_ probably most connected it with stuff like [Arab Strap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEe3OzmC_ow) or [Ivor Cutler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If9FKtKGLTo) which MAH and other DJs on R1 around that time like John Peel (RIP) played, as much as comedy.

I've since become a follower and fan of everything Chris Morris does, but I haven't gone back to Blue Jam really.  The only bit I definitely remember is ""shit my leg off"".  It doesn't quite count, but I also strongly remember the scene from the TV Jam where the guy kills himself by throwing himself out of a 1 story window 30 times.  And how it sounds like such a corny and stupid gag but by the end of it, it was verging on upsetting to watch.

License fee is worth it imo, although I don't even watch a great deal of TV really, I appreciate their website, iplayer, news arm, David Attenborough arm, sports coverage, etc - and all with lack of adverts, which I seriously loathe, so I like having this system.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"Honestly being near any of the three cities in question isn't going to make a difference to your kids since you won't be living in the city. Each have their own charms and differences yet each are similar in a way. Each offer similar opportunities for your family to do things locally if you're living nearby. Most large cities outside of London in the UK are industrial with a mixture of poor and wealthy areas. Unlike London a large chunk on the wealth will be away from the city centre in these cities although they'll be some nice inner city parts too. 

Of the three, Bristol is the smallest with 500,000 people and the least significant really, it's a sort of gateway to the South West which is a really nice part of the UK with plenty of tourism and picturesque seaside towns. It's also close to South Wales which is a main hub of activity in Wales. I think you'll find the commuter areas outside of Bristol most expensive since it's the furthest south and is close to some quite affluent areas like Bath. 

If you look up the populations of Manchester and Birmingham you'll probably get misled, what you really need to compare is Greater Manchester with the West Midlands and you'll find both have about 2.7 million people so they're roughly equal in size. Birmingham is the second city of the UK with tonnes of transport links to the rest of the country, huge amounts of shopping and a large immigrant population (although you'll find a reasonably large immigrant population in any UK city). It's centrality can definitely be a benefit. 

Although Birmingham is the second city, Manchester is more like the capital of the North and a hub of Northern culture which is something Birmingham doesn't have to the same extent since for many people living in the surrounding area, compared to those living in the North at least, it's far more feasible to travel to London for cultural stuff instead. 

Both Manchester and Birmingham have highly commercialised city centres, both having huge shopping centres and massive amounts of nightclubs and restaurants. Bristol being smaller doesn't really have as much but it does have its own charms. It's really up to you to make a decision about which city you want to work in and then start doing research regarding whereabouts it's best suited for you to settle with your family in the commuter belt. Personally I like where I live just south of Birmingham because Birmingham is close for most things and when I need to get to a London it's a just a matter of sitting on a train for an extra hour, it's also not expensive like much of the south east, travelling east to west or vice versa tends to be more problematic, but it's really more a personal taste thing.

Those are two hallmarks of a time when the Premiership became the Premiership and Southampton were perpetual underdogs that refused to get relegated and insolently forced the superstars of the big clubs to play in our cramped little stadium where taking a throw-in meant being so close to the crowd that you could feel the saints fans breathing down your neck.

We're back in our 'ancestral home' of St Mary's now, which takes its name from the church our club originated at and from the area of Southampton it's in. But The Dell years are still a core part of what informs a Saints fan's identity.

Then there came the Friends Provident years. That was when we moved to St. Mary's. The spirit of the club stayed with the fans but it was locked out of the boardroom. Things went downhill. Nothing worth Googling there.

Then there came Markus Liebherr. He bought the club. He saved it. He would have been given the place of honour at the table in any Saints fan's home. We loved him. http://youtu.be/lwSZ_p8NTs0

Based on [this article](http://www.moneywise.co.uk/news/2014-01-10/yodel-and-hermes-named-uks-worst-parcel-delivery-firms) Yodel claim to have handled 14,000,000 parcels last Christmas. That's approx 583,000 each day.

So what should their success % be ? 99% sounds pretty good but that means Yodel would fail 58,300 every day. Suddenly it doesn't sound so good.

99.9% ? That's a decent performance but they're still failing 5,830 times per day.

Even at 99.99% success there's still 583 poor sods waiting for their delivery. Do any of us work to 99.99% success every day ?

Journalists didn't give the story any credence at the time, since it seemed to be a politically motivated, and partially antisemitic, smear story.

What's interesting here is that the story alleges a tape was found by Customs and Excise and passed on to MI5; the intelligence services weren't above smearing politicians in this way in the 1970s, so this does somewhat check out. This would have been not long after the Clockwork Orange and Spycatcher revelations came out (when whistleblowing ex-spies told the public about their agency's attempts to smear and discredit elected politicians) so, even if the rumours were true, journalists would likely be on guard against being used by the security services (on top of needing proof for a story like this).

Also, for future reference, those heavy handed hints of yours for the latter reference wouldn't protect you from a libel suit, since it's blatantly obvious who you're referring to (though the press's characterization of it being a prominent female Tory MP in the 80s didn't have all that wide a field to begin with).

Little tip: The A449 might look like a short cut, but it's really not. The road between Ross and Ledbury is quite windy, although you can probably maintain a fairly reasonable speed round the hilly bits. The section between Ledbury and Worcester is really slow in a lot of areas, mainly around Malvern - the main road is also the high street of the town and there are parked cars and traffic lights along a fairly long stretch of it, not to mention speed restrictions.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Walking into a station with no trousers whilst covered in your own shit is not the behaviour of a person who is in control of all of their faculties.

Perhaps the faculties he wasn't in charge of were his bowels?

I can't believe that the police, CPS and courts would send this man to jail if he really did have a mental illness.  He pleaded guilty and there was no mention of a psychiatric evaluation.  That's not to say that justice isn't miscarried sometimes, but some kind of mental illness or psychotic episode is such an obvious explanation that it's unthinkable that no-one would have considered it (including his own lawyer).

My guess is that he got pissed up and shat himself.  He discarded his shit-splattered trousers and underwear in a bin somewhere and tried to stumble back to the tube station, hoping to find a plastic bag or something to cover his mud-stained manhood.

At some point time later he realised he had left his wallet, money, oyster card, etc., in his trousers and had no way to get home.  He tried to ask for help and made up some bullshit about being robbed because he didn't want to admit he shat himself.  Perhaps he was too drunk to realise that he had poop smeared all over his legs (I haven't personally ever attempted to remove shit-filled trousers while drunk but I can imagine it makes quite a mess).

Ballistic missiles approach their target from directly overhead. Aircraft carriers have [anti-missile cannons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS) and [anti-missile missiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile) and neither of them fire straight up, so they can't even be targeted. But even if they did they would be useless due to the velocity of a ballistic missile, basically they're travelling so fast that by the time they're visible to the target it's physically impossible to shoot it down due to the low relative velocity of any projectile you can fire back at it.  
  
So that'll be £40b worth of tax payer money bobbing about that, in the event we got into a proper scrap, would be at the bottom of the ocean in less than an hour.

I've had a number of experiences with YODEL, and can pin the bad ones entirely on a bad person in their employ, rather than on the business itself (though you can argue that hiring is their responsibility and I wouldn't disagree with you).

Incidents that stand out from my history:

* They straight up stole an SSD out of a package my father ordered from dabs.com, then delivered it to our neighbours to ensure that we couldn't reject the delivery (box was half crushed and covered in repacking tape). I never opened it, took photos and spoke to dabs, when they received it back the SSD wasn't in the box, 200 pound bullet dodged there.
* A lovely local lady driver tried to deliver a package for my mum, when we weren't in she had it at her place rather than the depot that was 30 miles away. Sounds dodgy but she left a card and happily gave directions to her house which was in a nearby village.
* My girlfriend ordered some new running shoes from sports direct. Never showed up, had to get an investigation launched and a refund issued.

Having painted a rather negative picture of YODEL I'd like to point out that ALL the major courier companies can be terrible as well (though I've never had them swipe my goods).

I don't think that beyond Cameron's religiosity, this has anything to do with porn. It's about developing tools to prevent access to extremist material and in the long run anything else ""detrimental to society"". 

This is impossible without seriously compromising the entire structure of security on the internet. So it's either doomed to fail, or the price of success is the death of information and transactional security. It's hopeless. 

(By the way, my attitude to extremist material is that blocking access is not the answer. It's the same as the porn 'problem' - the burden falls on our schools and social and religious leaders to teach the vulnerable respect for life and not to kill.

I spent most of my childhood living in Wirral, Merseyside. Accessible to Liverpool and Manchester for work as well as many other smaller towns. We didn't have a car, public transport was good. Schools were good - the area still has a selective system for 11+, I went to a grammar school, but the comps are good too, there are also several catholic schools. I can do a little comparison here to another place I lived, Stroud, Gloucestershire, which also has a selective system, but far more of my friends in the Wirral ended up going to university than my friends from Stroud. Just something I've noticed, couldn't tell you why.

But yeah I would say Wirral was a great place to live. At least away from Birkenhead. It's a good mix of urban, suburban and slightly rural. It's got beaches. Access to the aforementioned cities as well as North Wales, the Peak District and Lake District (although those are much easier if you do have a car.)

true,911tim,crest,everton 5eva,"Well for a start, in the UK we call the 'roster' a 'squad'. This is mostly my opinion, but I hope most will agree haha.

May as well start with the basics! In recent memory, Everton have always been a club punching above it's weight in the PL. We have virtually no money compared to most other teams in the PL, so don't expect loads of massive signings! For the majority of the David Moyes years, we were constantly called 'overachievers'. We played a pretty conservative game, mainly by trying to make our team hard to beat. We usually played a 4-5-1 team with the two wing backs and two wingers overlapping one another often. This resulted in quite a negative style of play with lots of defending and trying to go down the wingers and cross into a big centre forward. Towards the end of Moyes' era, we did become very good at this and we were pretty exciting to watch. Moyes left last summer after 11 years at the club to manage Man Utd and is generally hated by more fickle Everton fans.

Roberto Martinez is our current manager. He plays a possession based attacking brand of football. Last season we played 4-2-3-1. It worked pretty well considering this was a massive transition in style and footballing philosophies. The back four consisted mainly of Baines, Distin, Jagelkia and Coleman. We have another fantastic defender in Stones but he's still quite young so not really first team yet. Baines is an Everton supporter and generally well loved. Distin is closer to 50 than 20 but he bossed the defence last year so well. He'll play longer than Giggs but won't get anywhere near the plaudits. Jagelkia is our captain, and a fantastic defender. Coleman is another really well loved player. Kept out of the team for years by Phil Neville for God knows why,  but he set the PL alight last year with his surging runs and goals. Baines and Coleman played as wing backs, getting forward whenever they wanted. The two defensive midfielders would then sit back and cover for them.

We played 2 defensive midfielders last year, and they were mostly McCarthy and Barry. McCarthy came with Martinez from Wigan. He cost a lot of money, and a lot of Everton fans were pretty sceptical that he would be good enough for us or be good value for his price, but he was one of our best players by far last season. His work rate is unparalleled  by anyone I've ever seen. Never stops running. Barry is a former England international who was on loan from Man City. He's probably going to sign this summer. A very hard working, strong midfielder. Both of these players generally won the ball and played it forward to the more creative attacking players we have.

Next we have our 3 attacking midfielders. Generally we played Pienaar, Barkley and Mirallas. We also had Deleufeo and McGeady, but they didn't play as much. Pienaar is another classic Everton type player. Very hardworking and links up perfectly with Baines. Barkley is a young superstar. He's going to be a world beater one day. Very technically gifted, yet strong and confident. This season coming is going to be his! Mirallas is our other winger. He's a bit greedy, but when he decides to pass he's so good. He frustrates me more than anyone else in our squad. Oh yeah, we also have Naismith who's also known as 'Scottish Messi' or 'Naimar'. Some have argued that Messi is just 'Spanish Naismith'.

Up front we had Romelu Lukaku. Big as fuck, strong as fuck, could pass, could score but with a terrible first touch. Unfortunately, he was only on loan and probably won't come back. He's going to be one of the best strikers in the world at one point. We've got a few other strikers, but talking about them makes me feel sad so I'm not going to. 

 I think he always played a 5-3-2 at his previous club Wigan (correct me if I am wrong!) but we haven't adapted to that style yet. If you have been watching the World Cup, that's the style Holland have been playing, but we will probably play a much lower tempo with less emphasis on individual runs.

A lot of this will be different in the coming season as players come and go, but there's a quick summary! ",0,1404376981,null,0,false,0,cineiuc,t3_29q4js,t1_cineiuc,t3_29q4js,null,1435482677,29,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,29

The UK Payments Council seems to be a good reference as to how the systems are standardised and how they work, and describe all types of electronic payments from within the UK: 

http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk


They have released a guide for billers which specifically advises keeping payment references within the 18 character limit:

Would you be able to encrypt/compress your reference string into an 18-char string? I hope so, because the service is badly needed, and looks awesome. Once functional, I would definitely be a user!

Think about it:  those two tyres may be fitted to many different bikes with different weight distributions front to rear, so they can't possibly warm up identically on different bikes.  On top of this, the rear is responsible for drive and steering (the profile of the rear is what actually causes you to turn), so having it warm as quickly as possible can only be a good thing (assuming you're not hammering the cold front - fit a decent front at the same time and you've solved that issue).

I used to ask the same thing, and thought highly of the British press for not publishing the pictures when other countries did.

I disagree with their stance on renewable energy sources, for a start. Their manifestos are full of claims that solar and wind power are ""inefficient"", ""wasteful"" and ""scams"". As I see it these technologies are in their infancies, of course there will be difficulties early on but that's not a reason to kill development altogether. Their main argument seems to be that fossil fuel backup is needed for times when these aren't providing enough power, but I would argue that investing in research into energy storage, as Germany is doing, is a much better solution than short-sightedly continuing to burn through fossil fuel resources in the hope that the problem will have sorted itself out by the time they run out.

Being strongly anti-nationalist, I'm also rather uneasy about their position on immigration, with their remarks about Romanians being particularly odious. While I'm sure this could be seen as Godwin's Law in action, I really don't think it's possible not to draw parallels with the rise of fascism in Italy (and later, Germany) here. Scapegoating, overt nationalism, and cultivating a cult of personality during a period of economic woes by appealing to workers' wallets - ""a warning from history"" indeed. 

I do to an extent agree with their ideas about the benefits leaving the EU could have for small businesses in terms of reducing needless regulation. However, much of their rhetoric about independence rests on the assertion that it will save taxpayers money. I'm sure that's true, but I really can't see any government lowering taxes significantly, and (like just about every other party) they have little to say about getting the huge tax debts out of the numerous multinational corporations we've heard so much about.

http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/12December/Pages/UK-cancer-survival-rates-below-European-average.aspx

&gt;Researchers say the main reason for low survival rates in the UK seems to be delayed diagnosis, underuse of successful treatments and unequal access to treatment, particularly among elderly people.
However, patient factors are not accounted for, such as the level of smoking, alcohol misuse and poor diet in the UK.
It could be the case that poor cancer care in the UK is not solely to blame for the below average cancer survival rates, but may also be related to the factors listed above.

&gt;In the UK and Ireland survival rates were:
Around the European average for rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Low for kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers.
Much lower for lung cancer than for other regions for all periods, although results for lung cancer in some regions (central and eastern Europe) may be affected by overestimation.

So sure, it *could* be diet related, it *could* not. At best our cancer survival rates are ""around European average"" for some and low/much lower for rest. ",0,1404381145,null,0,false,0,cinf8il,t3_29q1o7,t1_cinf8il,t1_cinejjc,null,1434530581,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Now though, probably because of many morons like my wife's ex abusing it, you HAVE to go to mediation first before a court will even give you the time of day.

So...your bf would have to attempt to get his ex-wife to a mediation session, at a cost of course, where they would try and sort it like adults. If this doesn't work, or the ex refuses then I believe he would then be able to start court proceedings to get a contact order in place (if contact was still being denied) which would state times and places of visits.

Its a pretty long and drawn out process though, and the if the ex lawyers up and wants to really be a dick about things she might be able to reduce his contact to a few hours every fortnight or something. 

The best way about this would be to try and sort things out like adults, which she doesn't sound capable of doing, either by going for a coffee together, or by using a mediation service. If not then you'd have to take her to court and that could get very messy, with CAFCASS getting involved and opening a case on the children etc.

This all might not apply to your case in particular, by hopefully it gives you an idea. Definitely speak to some professionals about this though, be that the CAB or a solicitor. Our solicitor gave a free initial consultation and then took a £500 payment initially and used that as a credit account type thing, we got a refund of about £200 for the hours we never used. But we also never used him in court, as he would have charged even more for that, he was strictly for advice through the process.

GL, this was a massive weight on our shoulders over the last 6 or 7 months, financially and emotionally, but that was down to the court taking the ex's case at face value and summoning us no questions asked, they don't do that anymore, we would have never got to court if it had to go through mediation first! Hopefully you guys sort it before then too.",0,1404381240,null,0,false,0,cinf92d,t3_29q40m,t1_cinf92d,t3_29q40m,null,1434530591,11,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,11

However, I tend to keep common tyres front and back because I've found that sometimes the profile as you start to lean over can lead to slightly odd handling with say a newish brand x at the front and a new brand y at the back.

This spoils the otherwise quite lovely ""matched new tyres feeling"" and instead can give a version of the ""the handling is going off because the shoulders are wearing at the front and the rear is developing a flat spot"" effect earlier than it might otherwise.

Unless they can overcome this issues Bitcoin can't be as popular as (for instance) VISA as it's not as trustworthy.

I believe Bitcoin is a trailblazer, and a better cryptocurrency will be produced that doesn't have these issues, and that the hype of Bitcoins is mainly from early adopters who are looking at getting incredibly wealthy.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","It's educational. Cruising at speed isn't that different - you don't use much power when going along at a fixed speed. You do, however, learn a few things that you don't internalise to the same degree in a more powerful vehicle.

 * Looking ahead. Because it wasn't easy to accelerate, you looked ahead and planned for what you saw, so that you didn't lose speed if you didn't need to. This is also a fuel-saving measure in a more powerful car - instead of braking late and hard to 40 for a slowdown ahead on the motorway, you brake gently from much further ahead, and are often able to sail through at 55ish.

 * Use of gears. Less of an issue now my car has a DSG instead of a manual gearbox, but not having much power gave me a deep sense of whether I'm in the right gear for what I'm doing - and an understanding that I need to get the revs high to get full power (this sounds silly, but I've met people who didn't realise that shifting at 2,500 to 3,000 RPM would mean they couldn't use a significant chunk of their engine power).

 * Prefer to stop rather than go. This sounds a bit silly - after all, the point of driving is to go; however, what I've really learnt is that you're better off stopping (even if you are poking into the junction) rather than accelerating through a manoeuvre that's no longer safe (e.g. because you've realised that the car you're pulling in front of is doing 80, not 50). In general, while it doesn't feel this way, stopping part way out of the junction gives the person who you've noticed suddenly an extra chance to take evasive action; they may have to pull out into the path of oncoming traffic for a small period of time, but they're much more likely to get away with that (not least because oncoming traffic doesn't want to crash, either) than with overtaking your car or with stopping safely.

By and large, the common theme of my experience in both powerful cars and low power vehicles is that you can use engine power to get into trouble, but it's very rare that it actually gets you out of trouble; often, what you perceive as ""I floored it, and just about avoided being crushed/being rear-ended/a head-on crash"" is actually ""the other vehicle that would have been in the collision took evasive action, and thus I wasn't crushed/rear-ended/in a head-on crash"".

That's something of a contradiction in terms. Discriminating against someone because of their religion is almost always racist, so you couldn't really have an anti-Islam organisation that is also not racist.

People often say ""Islam is a religion, not a race"", which is only partially correct. It is indeed a religion, but religion is also a component of race. From wiki:

&gt; [Race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical, cultural, ethnic, genetic, geographical, historical, linguistic, **religious**, and/or social affiliation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29)

So if you are discriminating against someone because of their religion, which your proposed organisation would be, you are most likely being racist except in a few rare instances.

This is also reflected in the law. Your proposed organisation would be illegal under the [Equality Act 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010), which defines religion as a protected characteristic. It would be considered harrassment under Section 26, defined as follows: 

&gt; A person harasses another if he or she engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, and the conduct has the purpose or effect of violating the other's dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the other.

Islam along with Christianity is also a very diverse group covering people from Africa/Asia/Persia/European ethnic groups, opposing their beliefs doesn't make you a racist against all of these ethnicities.

Women don't have penis's therefore they aren't rapists, a car is not a house so its not burglary when its broken into to.

Women however can be sexual offenders, guilty of sexual offences (which rape is considered a part of) and as long as their crimes aren't shown more leniency as a consequence of this, then I don't see a problem.

Two of Torres, Ba, Lukaku will be sold. Personally I'm not at all sold on Lukaku, I think he's clumsy and the modern football fan's overemphasis on statistics massively flatter him. He seems much weaker than a man of his size and muscle tone should be, is poor at holding up the ball, and he has a poor first touch. His pace and monstrous shot make up for it somewhat, but he won't have as much room to run behind defenders when playing for Chelsea. If you had to start a striker in the Champions League final, Lukaku would be fourth choice behind all three of last year's strikers. 

Ba is a great impact sub, and still retains value, Torres would be a fantastic signing for several sides but might be too expensive to dispose of.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"Whilst the EUROCARE study serves as an indicator, there are a few things to bear in mind: 

* It tracked survival rates from **1978 to 2007**. That is from 36 years ago to until 7 years ago. Cancer treatment in general and the NHS in particular have undergone a significant amount of change, in that period, as you can imagine. More importantly, cancer treatment and the NHS have undergone significant changes since 2007 as well. It would be interesting to compare the study results with UK data from the 2007-2014 period to see the numbers difference 
* The study focuses on **countries, not on regions**. I only have experience with London hospitals, not other regions of the UK. London, by default, attracts the top specialists and researchers and also has the best resources for offering new experimental treatments - I imagine the situation is different at regional hospitals 
* **Quality of data** is an issue - diagnostic processes differ across countries. It could well be, particularly as we are considering such a broad time period both culturally and temporally, that in some countries, cancer was/is chronically under-diagnosed. What would be classed as death from late stage cancer in one country could be classed as a natural death some place else, where the cancer would not be picked up due to differing diagnostic protocols. I'm not saying this helps the UK or harms it - it's just something to note when looking at medical studies across countries in general 
* This study looked at **raw data** and ignores genetic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors. As with the point above, this does not mean the UK is over- or under-ranked, but it is an important factor that was ignored, due to the scale and nature of the study. I would not be surprised if someone was attempting a lifestyle-adjusted follow-up or a completely new study, but these are extremely difficult to do logistically 

Those would be my main reservations about this study. The problem is, it is difficult to do a good study in this respect. The numbers are massive, so one cannot really inspect each individual case. You must therefore rely on raw uncontrolled data which means the study is only good as a starting point - *why* are these numbers lower in the UK? - but you simply cannot draw any conclusions from it. In other words, studies like this are good for posing questions other research can attempt to answer, but they rarely provide answers themselves. 

The other type of study one can do in this case is one on a smaller scale - identify hospitals, instead of whole countries, and examine the cases in greater detail. This then allows you to better control for lifestyle and other factors. However, by pinning it down to specific hospitals, you introduce a greater selection bias - you could pick a top hospital in one country but a poorer one in another. 

This is a common conundrum across the medical field. The currently controversial digitised NHS patient records were designed to combat this problem, by providing data on the scale of the EUROCARE study but in such detail that was previously possible only in smaller studies. That's the researcher's take on it. Of course, bureaucratic incompetence and/or other more sinister elements mean that such a large database is also quite dangerous. But that is a different topic altogether.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"The full picture seems to be:

- more people in *absolute* poverty e.g. can't get the basics they need

- less people in *relative* poverty e.g. experience standards well below acceptable

Though this seems to be caused because median incomes have fallen, not because of any positive change in poverty. We've 'lifted' people out of relative poverty (which is calculated at 60% of median income before housing costs) because everyone is poorer, making the threshold for poverty lower.

For the record, absolute poverty is now higher than relative poverty - living below the minimum needed is more common than being significantly poorer than the median now.

From here: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/325416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2012-2013.pdf

Chart 1 shows the falling trend in real incomes in the past few years, Chart 2 shows that relative poverty has remained fairly constant if drooping a tiny amount.

&gt;**Key Findings**

&gt; * The average (median) real terms household income Before Housing Costs (BHC), at £440 per week, has not changed from 2011/12, following two years of decreases. The average household income After Housing Costs (AHC) has continued to fall from the leve l in 2009/10, and for 2012/13 was £374 per week, affected by rising housing costs for some.

&gt; *  Income inequality remained unchanged between 2011/12 and 2012/13.HBAI uses the Gini coefficientto measure income inequality, an indication of the gap between the least and most well off. The higherthe number of the Gini coefficient,the greater the level ofinequalityacross the population. 

&gt; * ndividuals at boththe top and the very bottom of the incomedistribution have seen real terms fallsin income in the latest year,primarily driven by falling earnings.These falls were not statisticallysignificant. This kept the Gini coefficient flat, both BHC (34 per cent)and AHC (38 per cent) in 2012/13. 

&gt; *  The percentage of individuals in relative low income has beendecreasinggradually since 2008/09, and is atits lowest level since the 1980s3, at 15per cent in 2012/13 BHC, broadly stable compared to2011/12. 

&gt; *  Looking at the percentagein absolute low incomeBHC, it remained at 17per cent following increases over the previous two years. 

&gt; * he percentage ofindividuals in absolutelow income AHC increasedslightly to 23 per cent, the highest it has beensince 2001/02. However this change was not statistically significant. 

&gt; * these latest figures BHC show 9.7 million individuals in relative low income, whilst there were 10.6 million under the absolute low income measure. ",0,1404386729,null,0,false,0,cing873,t3_29q6si,t1_cing873,t3_29q6si,null,1434530880,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

The only reason why Coutinho was not in the world cup squad is that he did not score enough goals this season. He has the work rate, and the talent to become a world class talent for sure. Do not worry. 

Sterling is the biggest talent in premier league by far. The way he has develop is insane and he will thrive with bigger responsibility. Lallana is a fantastic talent, not a world beater. But if Arsenal is talking about Theo Walcott and Cazorla then we can suggest Lallana who had a really good season. 

Sturridge's job is not to be creative and by the way he got 7 assist and scored a decent amount, 21 goals. 

The onlyone i will agree you with is Ramsay, none of the others. If you even say that Podolski is better than Lallana, Sterling, Coutinho, Sturridge you can just leave this sub and go to bed.

For people to talk about how full of them selves the Americans are while completely missing how truly awful their own squad was is either ignorance of the sport, blind jingoism or just a strange form of sarcasm.

I really think the lesson of the World Cup is that CONCACAF isnt the weakling anymore and the Euro leagues need to realize the rest of the world is catching up to them.  Four years ago, I would have said an MLS squad couldnt hold their own against the teams looking at relegation in the EPL, but now I would say Seattle or Kansas City could hold their own in the middle of the field.  They could never compete against Manchester City (cant wait....seeing them in a few weeks in Minnesota), but at least they are approaching a level where they belong on the same field.

For the US, this was really huge...For the first time ever, matches in soccer outdrew audiences for the NBA finals (One that featured LeBron James, even...) and MLS had 21 players on world teams, compared to only 4 in 2010.

Though my heart is always with SG, you can't say Suarez isn't the most exciting, lethal, furious mass of motion we have seen at Anfield. 

Our opponents fear his name on the teamsheet when they are coming up against us.

Now all of a sudden, give us Sanchez and 40 million and we are cool with losing the best we have.

Barca have Messi and have said today that he is unbuyable. Madrid / Barca just stomp over everybody in the transfer market and I'm sick of it to be honest. 

Suarez is as vital to us as Messi is to Barca. They would never sell Messi but we are supposed to roll over like good pets and cough up Suarez.

I'm realistic enough to know that he will probably go. I'm also realistic enough to know it will be good for Barca and bad for us. Losing one of the best players the club has ever had is a negative,  no matter how some people spin it.

I hope we get Barca in the CL next season and destroy them. I know I would have real belief in that statement if Luis Suarez was wearing the red of LFC. Without him it seems a little more hopeful rather than possible.

true,BeanHead98,null,null,"**What would you like to see us do with the money?**: I'd say we need to first and foremost get in a new, capable striker to replace Suarez. I actually think this is much more important than fixing our defence, because our whole system is about attacking power, imagine us if we lost Suarez and didn't replace him. After the striker we should then focus on getting one striker for the future (when the star striker leaves us again... /s), maybe Origi.

**What players would you like to see us sign?**: In order of importance, I'd say:

**Sanchez** (**£40M**): replacing Suarez as the right winger. This will allow Sturridge to play up top every game and let Sterling do his thing of the left. I know he isn't as good as Suarez, but since we have more back up now I think we can make an impact off of the bench this season. Great buy if he comes along with the Suarez deal.

**Moreno** (**£25M**): We desperately need another LB that can come straight into the first 11 and Moreno could be that person. We have Enrique for adequate back up and despite him being injury prone Flanno could cover in the case of a disaster were both LBs are injured. Flanno would move to RB and challenge Glen Johnson for his spot.

**Micah Richards** (**£6M**): We need an experienced RB who can come in and fill in the job for a year or two. This would allow Flanno to develop and when Richards retires he can be the first choice RB. I think we should sell Johnson as soon as we get an offer to free up the wages and well, he's just shit.

**Lovren** (**£15M**): Not much needed on this one, Kolo is almost had his time and we need another CB to challenge the first team. I think Agger might be off and I'm sure Barcalona will be back in for him since they have to get all of there transfers in for the next 3 windows. I think having Sakho, Skrtel and Lovren as the CBs would be a very promising defence, especially with the likes of illori developing for next season.

**Origi** (**£10M**): With the money from some of the players we sell we should have enough to fork out enough for Origi. He's only 19 and will definitely be a future prospect, especially with Rodgers working with him. He wouldn't be for this season, since he's being loaned back, but he could be very useful in 2/3 years and even a sub after his season long loan. I'd sell Aspas if we did get him (Or even if we didn't, just get Aspas away from Anfield) and maybe even sell Borini to Sunderland if we get a fair offer from then ~£12M. With that money alone we could buy Origi and potentially have another deadly striker in a few years.

**Total:** **£96M, but with the money we will get from offloading a few players we will easily be able to spend this much.**",0,1404388386,null,0,1404395852,0,cingkyh,t3_29qct9,t1_cingkyh,t3_29qct9,null,1434531039,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;Sturridge isn't creative, and very selfish

That's wrong, Sturridge is very creative and linked up with Suarez perfectly he had 8 assists last season which shows that he is creative.

&gt;Gerrard is past his best.

Still had the most assists in the league, captained the national side and was one of the best players in the league.

&gt;Coutinho can't get anywhere near the Brazilian national team for a reason

Ozil had 5 goals, 9 assists. Coutinho had 5 goals, 7 assists. Coutinho is 22 and Ozil is 25 so I would say that Coutinho had a better season last season, also the fact that he works harder defensively than Ozil.

&gt; Henderson just runs and not much else

Anyone who has watched him knows that is bullshit, Henderson created the fourth most chances from open play last season, which shows that he doesn't only 'run'.

&gt; Lallana is OK, but nowhere near a world beater

True he isn't a world beater, but he was one of the best players in the league and had a better season than Cazorla/Ozil.

&gt;Sterling is raw and far from a creator

Sterling ripped the league up at age 19, he has extraordinary promise.

--------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Ramsey was the best midfielder in the league last season until his injury

Agreed there, but he is an Arsenal player staying injury free is impossible.

&gt;Ozil is the best no.10 in the world.

Laughable really, to claim that Ozil is better than Iniesta and Silva.

&gt;Cazorla beats many top Spaniards to the national team

He was appalling last season, he was worse than Lallana/Coutinho and was very average, he is only in the Spanish team on reputation.

&gt; Walcott has pace like few others which can keep defences pinned back

Sterling?

&gt;Wilshere, Podolski and Rosický

Jack 'Glass ankles' Wilshere, Lukas 'I didn't even know he was playing' Podolski and Tomas 'walking stick' Rosicky

The agency started chasing me for a fee of £200 about a month after I'd moved in, so I asked them to outline what exactly they'd done for me. ""It's just our standard fee"" was their only response, so on the basis that they couldn't justify the amount I said I wasn't paying it. They hadn't had to carry out any credit checks or anything as I'd gone directly through the landlord, and I hadn't signed any agreement with them, so I didn't see how I could owe them anything.

After a few more weeks I started receiving letters from the agency demanding the original fee + extra costs and threatening legal action if they weren't paid; I thought these were idle threats until eventually I did get a small claims summons.

While the law is there, these guidelines are the interpretation of the law and the practical guidance on how that crime is prosecuted ""in real life"" as opposed to internet lawyer land which commonly appears on these discussions and gives an erroneous impression of how the law is actually applied.

This on its own is ""sexist"" I guess when you consider the penis alone. But the crimes of Sexual Assault and Assault by penetration (sections below the main one) both cover what the OP seems to be implying dont exist. Rape in precedent is a very specific crime relating to the penis under current precedent yes. The law doesn't change unless a specific distinction comes up, or the law is changed by parliament. Yes a man is ""a rapist"" if he is convicted of rape, but this is the nickname of society.

Southampton have reportedly rejected a £20m bid from Liverpool for Dejan Lovren, but the defender is set to snub the Saints’ pre-season to force a move.

Liverpool have already signed Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton this summer, while Luke Shaw has joined Manchester United.

But the Saints are determined to stop the mass exodus continuing despite strong interest in Lovren.

Liverpool have opened the bidding with a £20m offer, according to the Southern Daily Echo, despite the 24-year-old having only moved to St. Mary’s on a four-year deal last summer.

Lovren is believed to have already handed in a transfer request to the south coast club and is prepared to be a no-show at pre-season training in order to get the move he wants to Anfield.

**Rape**  

- (1)A person (A) commits an offence if—  
  - (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,  
  - (b)B does not consent to the penetration, and  
  - (c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.  
- (2)Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.  
- (3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.  
- (4)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

Here's section 2:

**Assault by penetration**  

- (1)A person (A) commits an offence if—  
  - (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina or anus of another person (B) with a part of his body or anything else,  
  - (b)the penetration is sexual,  
  - (c)B does not consent to the penetration, and  
  - (d)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.  
- (2)Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.  
- (3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.  
- (4)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

They arent at all on a level where they could compete at the highest levels, but a top MLS team could easily be near .500.  Its only going to get better, too, as this year the MLS average attendance was higher than the NBA (more money, more reasons for top players to stay home, again).

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"It doesn't have to be 10 years - but 10 years is a good amount to allow the service to bed down and reach it's maximum potential.  The NHS has real issues with short term contracts - we negotiate and recontract with our main acute services providers every year (or at least, most do!) - this is NHS-NHS contracting.

What this means is that we spend 3 months of the year negotiating, 3 months drawing up a contract and then only a 6 month break until the whole thing starts again.  It's a waste of resources - but with the traditional model of NHS contracting, it's pretty much needed.  Currently the NHS is very short term focused due to it's somewhat archaic contracting practices.

What the Guardian article doesn't go into is that this is a 'new' model of contracting - it's outcome based commissioning, which while somewhat untested, has the potential to be a game changer.  Instead of saying (every year...) that acute services will cost x amount for y units of care, meeting a, b and c targets, we say that we want to see patients diagnosed within 14 days, first treatment within 28 days, that those patients report a 'good' or higher level of satisfaction after 3 months with their treatment and that their health has improved in x, y and z ways after 12 months.

We then leave it up to the provider to best judge how to reach those criteria.  Yes, that provider could be Virgin or Care UK.  Or it could be an NHS Trust or even a cancer charity etc.  That 'lead' provider could then even subcontract some of their services out further, as long as they meet the outcomes we stipulate in the contract.

In an ideal world, it's a really quite promising way of running services - it takes the focus away from units of care, penny pinching and activity counting.  And puts it onto the actual care, patient experience and health outcomes.  But it's a new system and internal NHS organisations are generally not good at the technicalities of contracting - while private providers often are.  So there's a very careful balance that has to be made to ensure the 'right' provider ends up with the contract.

In my area, we've done this successfully twice now - on a much smaller scale.  One contract run in this fashion has gone to a local clinician led not for profit social enterprise and the other to the local district general hospital.

The really important part of this is to make sure that strong contract monitoring processes are in place with measures to break the contract should anything go wrong (and with NHS contracting experience being pretty crappy, they're often not!).

true,Monarki,null,null," With an agreement to sign Diego Costa now in place, here are a few thoughts about the striker and how he might fit into José Mourinho’s Chelsea.

In many ways Diego Costa is the embodiment of José Mourinho’s footballing philosophy. A bellicose, gritty and imperfect striker, he spearheaded Atlético Madrid’s remarkable title winning campaign. Costa shares Mourinho’s indomitable spirit and as a focal point there are few who lead the line as well. His aggression, movement and power are salient qualities that have been missing from Chelsea’s docile attack. Gianfranco Zola went as far as saying that Costa represented “the missing part of the puzzle”.

Chelsea fans in general are naturally cautious about any striker coming to the club. Only Didier Drogba has truly excelled in the Roman era. Nicolas Anelka proved useful and Hernán Crespo looked phenomenal in patches but could not settle. The scars of Andriy Shevchenko and Fernando Torres’ transfers are still very raw. Having wasted around £130m on strikers, tantamount to buying Radamel Falcao and Edinson Cavani, it is easy to see where the trepidation stems from.

Our greatest mistake last year was to spend over £100m and not buy an elite striker when one was available. The aforementioned Cavani and Falcao went for around £55m-£60m each, but signing just one of them may have delivered a league title. That elite category of striker is unavailable this summer, at least for that sort of money. Chelsea have therefore acted out of necessity, and at £32m Costa could prove to be exceptional.

There are undoubtedly wider issues concerning the balance of the team that need to be addressed. A static midfield incapable of moving the ball at speed; lopsided and unadventurous full-back play and shot-shy attacking midfielders certainly did not aid the cause. Nonetheless, lacking a prominent goal scorer was painfully obvious. Manchester City had four players scoring over twenty goals, Liverpool had two and even Arsenal’s much maligned Olivier Giroud scored twenty-two times. Chelsea’s entire strike force managed thirty-one goals last season with a paltry nineteen goals coming in the league.

In the case of Manchester City and Liverpool they had talismanic figures in Sergio Agüero and Luis Suárez leading the line. What Agüero and Suárez give to their teams is more than you can quantify in terms of goals. The speed of play, space for team mates and overall confidence level of those around them increase. This intangible quality is something that Diego Costa possesses.

After his extremely disappointing showing at the World Cup, where Costa looked bereft of match fitness, questions were asked concerning Costa’s suitability. In a World Cup that saw Spain torn between their past and their future, Costa looked lost. People will jump to conclusions about a certain player essentially on the last game he has played. His performances for Spain were apparently enough to discount an entire season of exceptional form. Perhaps it is time to rationally address some of those concerns.

true,Monarki,null,null,"We are ultimately buying Diego Costa on the back of his success at Atlético Madrid: a side who are the antithesis of the Spanish national team stylistically. John Terry looked horrific in André Villas-Boas’ defensive high line, could barely get a game under Rafael Benitez, yet has returned to playing at an extremely high standard this season. The same applies to Costa with Spain. His natural movement and tendencies are at odds with Spain’s tiki-taka principles.

Should you judge Costa basis the World Cup? Unequivocally no, but I would say that for any player. Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski clearly make the point in the excellent Soccernomics about the perils of buying and evaluating players after a major international tournament. Not only are their prices grossly inflated, but the tendency to ignore a season’s worth of form for a handful of games in isolation is surprisingly strong.

It is therefore worth stressing again that Chelsea are buying the Diego Costa on the strength of his performances for Atlético Madrid. As a support act to Falcao he bagged twenty goals in all competitions and this was mostly playing out wide. Yet, it was his explosion this season as a powerful and efficient goal scorer that really made people sit up and take note. Chelsea are looking to play a brand of football closer to Atlético Madrid than to Spain, so it makes sense to at least tailor your opinion on his performances for Los Rojiblancos.

Costa is not a classical representation of the number nine position, but his suitability to what Mourinho wants is undeniable. He is a great goal scorer, not a scorer of great goals. This has, oddly, been a frequent criticism that I have seen of him. Until football starts awarding goals on artistic merit I will take fifteen scrappy goals where Costa is actually in the right place over the occasional wonder strike.

Chelsea need a physical and goal scoring presence; this is exactly what Costa provides. Given the doubts surrounding Costa there will be extensive pressure placed upon him to ignite Chelsea’s attack this coming season. I also dread to think what the majority thought of Didier Drogba when Chelsea signed him on the back of a campaign playing in France and the UEFA Cup.

With all the above being said I am quite optimistic that Costa can succeed at Chelsea. Given the nature of it being Chelsea and how these things play out it is unlikely that Costa will be afforded a season to bed in. The almost rapturous slating of him by BBC and ITV pundits should already let you know that the media want him to fail. Costa must hit the ground running at Chelsea; he needs to be fully fit for the first game of the season.

So what are we getting for our £32m? Michael Cox of Zonal Marking acclaim sums Costa up perfectly: “A snarling, indefatigable centre-forward who hunts down opponents relentlessly, who works the channels tirelessly, and who has improved his goalscoring record significantly over the past 18 months. Beautiful to watch on the ball, horrible to watch when he starts getting angry, Costa is a terrifying opponent”.

For a team that is losing so much experience this summer the initial thing to note about Costa is that he is a complete leader. He will pick a team up, place them on his back and drive them forward. So many times this season games that appear to be plateauing have been lifted by an injection from Costa.

He is no angel and he will win at any costs, notably winding Sergio Ramos and Pepe up to within an inch of their life. It is these little things that can spark a team and a crowd during a game. He walks the line of madness very finely at times, but having someone willing to consistently run through brick walls for the shirt is a welcome departure from our current strike force.

After Costa split his shin to the bone in the act of scoring against Getafe, Diego Simeone quipped “another scratch doesn’t hurt a tiger”. Sid Lowe suggested that this particular goal neatly summed up everything Costa stood for as a player: “the determination, the fight and the sacrifice, so competitive it hurts”. José Luis Mendilibar often played him “virtually on his own” and was particularly effusive in his praise stating that Costa has a “fantastic capacity for occupying four defenders on his own. He has this trick of not really looking as good as he actually is”.

Mendilibar took it further as he explained that Costa “[…] doesn’t look particularly quick, or technically that good, but he is far faster and talented than it seems. Sometimes it seems that he is one step away from losing the ball, he doesn’t appear to have it under control, but he keeps it and more often than not he finishes. He also had that mala leche (attitude/edge)”.

Lowe finishes his assessment by stating that “Costa is the striker for whom no defender is too big or too mean, no fight to be shirked and no ball lost, for whom every punt is a pass. The first time you see him dribble past a defender, he appears fortunate; the fifth time he does not. He seems to be bundling through, not entirely in control, but he invariably gets there. And when he does he invariably finishes”.

Signing Costa is almost certainly an indication of how Mourinho wants to play next season. While talk of tactics and shape are almost lost in terms of fluidity these days I would anticipate a mixture of 4231/433. Mourinho must release the handbrake. A less conservative approach against weaker opponents must be advocated. We are far too patient, slow and diffident in possession. Fàbregas’ arrival instantly elevates the quality of our possession and one would hope that a top class box-to-box midfielder is also added to make us formidable in that area.

Costa ultimately allows Chelsea to play direct, quick and incisive football against lesser sides. Moreover, he is a huge counterattacking threat. There is no need to rotate strikers depending on opposition. Costa should be the focal point of the attack against a side parking the bus and someone who will look to dominate possession. He should improve our counterattacking quality where we need to play in that fashion and his dynamism should open up the pitch against teams intent on putting ten men behind the ball.

Costa’s key strength is his movement. Having played on the wing and being something of a street footballer until he was nearing his 20s, there is an innate rhythm in his capacity to find space and locate the ball in the penalty area. While his goals are not thirty-yard screamers his movement is phenomenal. Just looking at his goals scored last season you can see his array of feints, well timed runs and natural feel for where the ball is going to land. People are going to be impressed more by someone belting a shot into the top corner from distance, but Chelsea need someone capable of finding the space to shoot against packed opposition.

The way he links with his midfield is crucial and something that should be mirrored at Chelsea. Costa is always extremely quick to react to any transition and his awareness of both team mates and opposition players allows him to quickly move into superb areas. A lot of his goals or attacking moments come from when the game is in transition.

However, when teams have sat back against Atlético Madrid his comfort in playing in wide areas and ability to pick the ball from deep and drive at defenders is invaluable. He draws an incredible amount of fouls and his directness with the ball make life difficult for teams who do not possess decent one-on-one tacklers.

Perhaps the greatest contribution Costa will make is that he will quicken up Chelsea’s pedestrian tempo. So much of Chelsea’s play stagnates through a lack of incisive passing in midfield. We lack players willing to play the quick and at times difficult pass. However, the complete lack of movement or threat at centre forward is equally culpable. Some key additions this summer will naturally improve this, but any player within the team is triggered by their centre forward when it comes to movement. It is no coincidence that when Drogba occupied both centre-backs, Lampard would ghost into the penalty area and score time-and-time again.

Costa has the ability to occupy and threaten an entire back four over the course of a match. He expertly peels wide to open up lanes for midfielders to advance into. As centre backs are unsure whether he is looking to exploit the channel between full-back and centre back or simply pull wide, it often creates space. Koke spoke of his almost telepathic understanding with Costa at length over the previous season. The space made by Costa and the understanding he develops with Chelsea’s chief creators will be a crucial element in our progress next year.

This ability to occupy defenders and threaten across every channel finally means that teams cannot simply look to stop Chelsea’s left hand side and expect results. You would hope that with a naturally left footed full-back and Diego Costa stalking up front teams venturing down the “stop Hazard and you stop Chelsea” route may have slightly more to think about. The ability to peel from his marker into the space left between full-back and centre back is his trademark.

His ability to adapt to a direct game where he brings people in play, act as a counterattacking threat or simply pull a defence around are wonderful assets. However, it is his finishing quality that will really determine Costa’s impact at Chelsea. He needs to be aiming for 20-30 goals this season – a decent target if Hazard moves to taking penalties on a full-time basis.",0,1404391820,null,0,false,0,cinhhc6,t3_29o8fj,t1_cinhhc6,t1_cinhgsg,null,1434531443,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Monarki,null,null,"I personally love the directness that Costa will bring to the side. If given the ball you know he is always going to be positive in possession. I think at times last season our strikers were so negative or incapable of retaining possession that opposition sides barely acknowledged they were on the pitch. Costa brings an entirely different puzzle for people to solve as he can dribble extremely well, particularly when you consider the size of him. There is this unorthodox way that he drives at teams, much like Luis Suárez, that makes him extremely difficult to handle.

He could be better when attacking the ball in the air from crosses, but there should be no concerns with his hold up play. If you ping the ball towards Costa it tends to stick and Chelsea can finally start to play with second phase runners from midfield on a frequent basis. How many times has Torres in particular won a flick on or knock down to only have no one near him? That stems from players not willing to make the run because there is no trust in him (or Ba) in retaining the ball.

Costa has shown on numerous occasions that when he plays with his back to goal he can bring people into play. Playing Hazard into the type of space Arda Turan enjoyed on a regular basis where he only has his full-back to beat would be beyond dangerous.

Costa scored twenty-seven goals in the Primera División last season. Twenty-two of those came against sides outside the top five. With five goals in eight games against direct title rivals. Taking a look at when he scores goals is also interesting. I personally feel the mark of a top striker is not necessarily accurately reflected in the number of goals he scores, but when he actually scores them. People will differ on this but is the third goal in a 3-0 win as important as an equaliser, winning goal or the opening goal in a game?

So many strikers with obscene numbers fall into this category. Drogba was someone who did not always hit twenty goals a season at Chelsea. However, the percentage of his goals that were “important” were staggering. Of Costa’s goals last season over 50% were important. For comparison (and comparison only) Luis Suárez came in around 25%. Costa’s impact will be judged solely on the goals he scores. That is a fact of any strikers life. However, I do hope that Costa’s overall contribution is tangible enough that people notice the impact he has on the rest of the team.

The ultimate question in all this is simply how much of an impact will Costa have on this Chelsea side? It is always difficult to call transfers, but I do remain hopeful that Costa bucks the recent trend Chelsea have developed with strikers. Is he perfect? No. Is he going to score thirty-yard wonder goals? Maybe. Will he give absolutely everything for the shirt? Absolutely. It is this last criterion that I am perhaps most disappointed with Chelsea’s current crop of strikers. Leaving Stamford Bridge after a tepid display where your striker has not even broken into a sweat is always disheartening.

We can bemoan the lack of attempt to sign a truly outstanding striker last summer all we like. That is in the past. What matters now is that Mourinho has opted to pin his Chelsea future on the chest of Diego Costa. It is not a stretch to say that Mourinho may well have to win something next season to keep himself at the club. While the long-term plan is definitely taking shape, if Mourinho’s plans to re-establish the club are to come to fruition this season must be successful. It is not something I necessarily like, but our track record hardly screams patience.

Andres Iniesta told a Spanish newspaper that Costa had “shown almost unbeatable performance levels” over the course of last season. We can only hope that he brings the same hunger and desire to Stamford Bridge. This seems to be the first time in an eternity that Chelsea are actually buying a player to suit the system, rather than pigeonhole someone into a role they are unfamiliar with. For that alone, regardless of your opinion on Costa, we should be thankful that the club are actually on the same page.

Costa has shown a huge desire to actually learn and improve over the past two seasons. His development is down to an insatiable work ethic and supreme coaching. Working with Simeone has elevated him and I would hope that working with Mourinho has a similar long-term effect. If Mourinho can build upon what already exists and Costa can slot seamlessly into being the spearhead for Chelsea’s attack then we will be getting a superbly gifted player with even greater potential.

Costa is by no means a finished product and the synergies with Didier Drogba when he came to Chelsea are stark. I can only hope that Mourinho continues the excellent work that Simeone has started and that Costa’s rapid rate of improvement does not stop. He may be borderline mental, completely imperfect and at times a little too aggressive, but he is a goal scorer physically built for Premier League football. It will take time for him to adapt; given the general divide surrounding his signing the jury is certainly out. I for one prefer to be optimistic.

Anything can happen in terms of this signing, but I am comfortable that the club have actually thought about Costa and how he fits into Mourinho’s plans. If the summer goes as planned then Costa should be leading a very different looking Chelsea team.

Even when companies actually do some research that is for the common good, they request massive tax breaks that, effectively, result in public funding.

chemotherapy - comes from mustard gas research at Yale 
MRI scanners - Peter Mansfield won the nobel prize for this; a Professor at Nottingham university
CT scanners - based on research by itallians in the 1900s; not a private company

As for the fact that they are ""manufactured and distributed by private companies"" well woopdy-fucking-do we live in a capitalist system, what other choice did people have?

Don't attribute the research of scientists to your particular political/economic ideology.
Scientists live and work under whatever economic system is imposed upon them, even in times of great constraint they somehow manage to overcome adversity. 
When they do there is always some prick wanting to attribute credit of their work to something or someone else.

&gt; There's a whole chain of private corporate interests that means your mum is alive, and you thank the few people at the end who are employed by the state whilst shitting all over that whole chain of private corporations?

My god, do you even listen to yourself?
Is your aspiration to be a management consultant, or something else equally useless?
I mean, I've heard some asinine shit said on the internet before but this is clearly the work of someone who is in love with their god given ability to bullshit.
You do not get to attribute *all human endeavour* you find find favourable to an economic system that you support.

Thank the CEOs and managing directors to take a huge cut from the salary of wage workers producing materials and distributing them to doctors. If we didn't have them living in fancy houses and driving expensive cars there is no way that we could organise our healthcare system.
All hail the gloriousness of private enterprise. Never allow criticism. Shun the non believers.

Private healthcare is not what the people working in the NHS want, the people using the NHS want yet we're having privatisation thrust upon us by people that only set foot in NHS hospitals because they want a photo opportunity.

I was employing newly qualified gas engineers with CCN1, CPA1 &amp; CKR1 on £28-30k basic/45 hr Mon- Fri week to install/test gas cookers or appliances, The courses to qualify for those would cost about £3k. With further [gas qualifications]( http://www.gascert.co.uk/gas-acs-glasgow-domestic-commercial/acs-ccn-domestic-natural-gas/courses/ccn1/) there are a lot of big employers looking for people and offering good job security, decent salaries &amp; working conditions.

Plumbing &amp; Electrician type courses would take longer and may require on the job training but can be very lucrative in the long term. Are you happy getting your hands dirty?

I've seen quite a few mates make easy money passing their HGV cat C+E tests, again it will cost you a couple of grand to train and you will need to get experience via an agency for 6-12 months before employers will consider you for a full time job but starting earnings can easily hit £25-35k and more with ADR training. There is going to be a big shortage of trained HGV drivers over the next decade so earnings can only go up.

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"Yes - and no.  Historically there certainly was (see the 'World Class Commissioning' initiative launched about 8 years ago).  But since the 2013 NHS changes, the system is much more fractured than ever - we went from 10 bodies (Strategic Health Authorities) having regional control over around 20 Primary Care Trusts each (who used to do the actual contracting).  Those regional bodies, although much maligned as management types, actually performed a pretty useful role in developing staff across the area and holding those Primary Care Trusts to agreed on standards around contracting, quality of care etc.  There was region wide consistent guidance and policies available and a central body to co-ordinate work across organisations.

These days, we have 1 national body - NHS England and over 300 Clinical Commissioning Groups.  The way the system is set up is that there's little to no regional oversight and no co-ordinated set of standards to be held to - we all do our own thing and muddle through.  There's certainly no money or strategy for staff training, that's all been cut.  It also doesn't help that in the re-organisation, we lost a lot of the people who used to work in contracting roles - often to higher paying private sector companies.

At the end of the day, we've not had a pay rise for years, there's no professional standards for NHS managers (which were mooted about 3 years ago) and no training available.  The private sector is free to cream off the best NHS staff, who know the system and they're able to field much larger contracting teams - with much more significant legal backup.

For all that people complain about NHS bureaucracy costing money, some of it at least is definitely worth it - where that level is, I'm not entirely sure.

 never actually come across anyone who's been doing any
good.  The only people I think need privacy are people
who do bad things.  Privacy is the space bad people need
to do bad things in.  Privacy is particularly good for
paedophiles, and if you keep that in mind, privacy is
for paedos, fundamental, no one else needs it, privacy
is evil.  It brings out the worst qualities in people.
It brings out hypocrisy.  It allows them to do bad
things.  And no, once the British public wise up to the
true perils of privacy, which, you know, one spin-off --
for example, if there is a privacy law, your secrets are
going to be much more valuable than they were before.

Simply put, statistics.

Imagine you, for instance, want to gather statistics about rape. So you go and look up the sexes of the perpetrators and victims of rape. You don't think to also look up sexual assault, because it's specifically rape you're interested in, even if to your own mind some of the things counted under sexual assault are actually rape. 

Female perpetrators will never be listed under the ""perpetrators of rape"" category because what they do isn't rape, legally. It's treated the same and carries the same sentencing, but it's not listed as rape because it legally isn't.

You could include the things from the sexual assault category that you consider as bad as rape in your statistical analysis, but then people will harp on at you for using your own definition and not the legal one, or that your own definition of that sexual assults are also rapes differs from their own. It's easiest to use the legal definition so that's the one you use.

So you're forced to conclude in your statistical study that 99% of all rapists are men, because what women do isn't rape, legally, even if it is morally.",0,1404395664,null,0,false,0,cinisvx,t3_29qae9,t1_cinisvx,t1_cinfy9d,null,1434532225,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

There is a distinction between *wider unionism* and *moderate unionism*. The DUP *do* represent wider unionism otherwise they wouldn't get voted in. Wider unionism isn't moderate. Moderate unionists are an electoral minority.

Unionist parties get away with intransigence, propagating ""unionist unity"" and conflagrating ""protestant-unionist-loyalist"" because there's no credible, secular, moderate unionist party soaking up votes, making the distinction between the constituent parts of ""PUL"" and saying that they won't be subsumed into this crude intransigent monolith. In terms of NI21 this kind of vindicates John's opposition to redesignation; the DUP can claim to represent all-unionism because moderate unionists are forced to vote for parties designated as ""other"" in the executive.

As for the British and Irish governments. The Tories want the DUP's vote in the event of a hung parliament so aren't going to do anything.

/u/whollyme's point about council tax is a very good one. It can be prohibitively expensive for a single person to have to pay the council tax on an entire flat. Also, be warned: Edinburgh Council are remarkable inept and incompetent (and as I hear it told, corrupt). Not that this should keep you from moving, just... be warned.

Regarding work, Edinburgh and Glasgow are only an hour's train journey apart from one another, which means that it's actually quite feasible to commute from one to the other. This means that you aren't just limited to looking for work in Edinburgh. You could actually cast your net pretty wide, maybe try Dunfermline in Fife. If you found a job in Glasgow you might even consider moving there, which would mean that you and your friend collectively have places to crash in both cities (just don't google ""glasgow murder capital"").

Edinburgh's a bit small when it comes to live music, but Glasgow tends to be a tour stop for most artists and, again, it's only a train ride away. Edinburgh's got lots of great places for a night out, though.

With the current team we have we can’t afford to be missing our best player for a third of our season. Whoever we sign will not be on the same level as Suarez but they will hopefully be able to perform for the whole season. Plus if Saurez is not able to train with the team how much longer will it actually take for him to get fully match fit?

I wish we had Suarez for the game against Southampton at Anfield when we had no creative spark as Coutinho was missing as well, those 3 points could've won us the league, but he was banned. 

The first part of the new season could be major for us and any player we sign will give us more than Suarez through that period of tough games and also seal our CL fate.

and:

&gt;**No-one is saying that women who commit grave crimes with the same degree of culpability as men should not generally receive the same level of punishment.** It is a myth, as Lord Rooker pointed out in the House of Lords' debate on women in prison last year, that all the women in prison are there for shoplifting.[12] But there is a good deal of evidence that women are disproportionately locked up for less serious offences.",0,1404396978,null,0,1404407470,0,cinjbmi,t3_29qae9,t1_cinjbmi,t1_cini0gg,null,1434532487,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Give him stats on how a former Chelsea striker became a 20 goal a season striker in his system. Or how a 17 year old unknown winger prospect flourished under his system and was England's best player in the world cup. 

Then show him clips of how Arsenal crumbles against every big team in the league losing to City, Chelsea and Liverpool by ridiculous scorelines conceding 5 or more goals.

If an ordinary person would consider it sexual whatever the circumstances, then it will obviously be ""sexual"". If not, the jury would have to ask themselves two questions.

In the medical example, penetration with a medical instrument could, in some circumstances, conceivably be considered ""sexual"" by some people, but the jury would be unlikely to conclude that a doctor was doing whatever they were doing for sexual reasons (unless something very odd was going on!), so it couldn't be a sexual act and thus couldn't be a sexual assault or assault by penetration.",0,1404398231,null,0,false,0,cinjv2v,t3_29qae9,t1_cinjv2v,t1_cingu72,null,1434532596,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I would fundamentally disagree with you on this bit. I would say that rather than being prepared from birth to serve the people of the UK as head of state, that the royals are prepared from birth to preserve and maintain the status of and influence of the house of Windsor. 

Not that those two different goals are always mutually exclusive. 

But no matter how long someone has prepared for a role, the fact that we are stuck with them, and only them, for good or bad only underscores the need for us to have options. The option to elect or remove someone from office based on merrit and not on bloodlines.

The Queen is popular. Charles isn't. But i'm guessing the same people who scoff at the idea of choosing a head state wouldn't mind being able to choose to skip Charles for his son.

When you look at the forwards that were grafters--and the shite ones too--that have played for Liverpool in recent years, there was loyalty or acrimony in the simplest footballing form...you suck and we hate you. Or you won't stop running and we love you for it. Or what the f*** kind of hair cut is that Djibril?!?!?!

BUT, Torres...Suarez... the two most uniquely gifted strikers to play for us in the last 15 or so years (don't start with the Fowler 06-07 or he played in 2001 don't you know stuff...I know and I also can't wait for the Michael Owen debate) have left under curiously similar statements.

Thereotically--that's for Torres--at the peek of their power they agitate for a move to a bigger club. a better club. Their are few clubs who can rival Liverpool's history and particularly the unbelievable quantity of top forwards. 

The continental clubs tended to be more diverse. Whereas every single one of our greatest strikers was British--and there is NOTHING wrong with that. It's a matter of happenstance.

Perhaps, their is a psychological burden associated with coming to Liverpool as a foreign striker. The elephant in the room being, the fans secret expectation/hope/desire to see the return of the king. the legend of Kenny and Ian...and Ian...and Peter and John and Jesus H. Christ it goes one. 

How do you live up to that? How do you match the qualities and memories of past giants whose games where perhaps diametrically opposed to the one taught to you?

I expect Sturridge to cope with this. And interestingly enough Fabio Borini--perhaps through lower expectations--seems fully adapted to the English game. 

I'm just saying being a foreign striker at Liverpool can play mind games with some. Too bad...we learned spanish for our strikers. At least the man who drinks sangria still loves us.

I hope this isn't perceived as a racial issues. It's not. Look at it this way. When you dream of the return of the King. Of the striker feared throughout the land. Who do you see? There's no wrong or immoral answer but, odds are you see the same thing Suarez sees, that Torres saw. 

It's too bad neither will fight for it. I would give my left nut to take on that challenge.

Gk: We need a solid first choice to come in since most of us have lost faith in Kenny. **Silvestri would be nice**. Also, a an experience back up was needed so I'm happy with Taylor signing a one year deal.

Cb: Pearce is still dominant and possibly team captain worthy if Ross goes, but Wootton and Lees are still unconvincing. **I'd like another cb just to solidify the defence, but 2 won't hurt** (since Wooton can play rb he might be cover for Byram)

Rb: Not the most urgent spot to fill since Byram has still got potential and Wootton can act as cover, backup  would be nice but not urgent. If we can get in a quality player it would be great as then we can play Byram on the wings.

Lb: Still like Warnock but if he goes I'd want a decent replacement since Blackman and White haven't proved themselves at this level. Charlie Taylor looks a decent pick too.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;It's not eternally BT's fault though. Laying fibre optic is expensive and no one company can afford the cost of replacing the entire network. It requires massive government investment but also a change in the competition laws. 

I disagree that it's not BT's fault and it didn't used to be this way.

Around the turn of the millenium the VOA introduced the Fibre Tax. All companies running fibre optic cables in the ground across the UK are subject to this tax. For every kilometer of *lit* fibre-pair in the ground the company (ergo, the consumer) must pay about £105 per annum. This was the ruin of a few smaller ISPs, and remains a significant hurdle for competition.

Did I say all companies? Not quite. BT don't have to pay this. They pay a special heavily reduced tax for no reason. Virgin Media also pay reduced taxes on their fibre infrastructure. This gives them a huge advantage in the telecoms market where margins are tiny at the best of times.

&gt;The current rateable value applied to Other Operators is £230 per fibre pair-kilometre. On a multiplier of 45.2% for 2012/3, this gives rise to a tax charge of £103.96 per pair, or £51.98 per fibre.

&gt;Other Operators therefore pay some 18.43 times the rate paid by Openreach for link fibre on a FAC, and some 49.98 times that on a LRIC basis. If BT’s measure of link fibre was per fibre pair, then the difference would be 37 times and 100 times respectively.

So BT have an unfair advantage in fibre backhaul. So what? So why the hell don't we all have all-singing-all-dancing FTTP?

OFCOM still give them preferential treatment on last-mile technologies as well.

&gt; The VOA probably knew that BT estimated a cumulo cost per line in 2009/10 of approximately £5.50 for services based on copper access lines. At the same time, the VOA proposed to assess NGA operators (other than BT) for cumulo using an RV of £20 per home connected, equivalent to an annual charge of £9.70 (after multiplying by the rates multiplier of 48.5% in 2009/10).

&gt;This implies that the profit potential of a non-BT NGA line is higher than that of a BT copper-based line, by a factor of 1.76 (£9.70 divided by £5.50, that is 76% higher), in the opinion of the VOA

In effect, BT is still totally tied into the will of the state. From filtering to GCHQ wire tapping, BT is right up the front with the begging bowl asking for kickbacks to implement things and do a poor job of providing universal high-speed access. OFCOM are complicit and are demonstrably not acting in the consumer's best interests.

And of course, OFCOM's bizarrely permissive relationship [continues right up to the present day.](http://br0kent3l3ph0n3.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/ofcom-decisions-lack-transparency/)

To say that Henderson/Gerrards/Countinho/lalana are shit is just plain stupid. They are good players. But to say that they are better than ozil/Ramsey/Cazorla/Wilshere is just as silly. 

Lfc have a superior attack in Sterling-Suarez- Sturidge where as Arsenal have a superior midfield. 

You also have to understand that yes Arsenal were top of the league for longer than any other team, they broke down due to injuriea/fatigue or what ever and also due to am inferior strike force. They (like city and cfc) played more games (UCL) and went further in the cups,  meaning they played more games. Lfc played less last season, allowing them to focus on the league. It would of been a different story if you had UCL gamea. Your squad is thinner than most think. 

Now, LFC fans be humble. I think Sanchez would flourish better with the Arsenal system.  But there's no need to bash each other.  I genuinely believe some of you are too young and are acting on emotions as opposed to logic.

Lets see how the season will unfold with UCL and (hopefully not but) injuries.

true,WeaponizedKissing,null,null,"&gt; It seems like I should be going for a current account?

Correct. A current account is your everyday, regular bank account. It probably won't do anything special other than giving you somewhere to hold your money. In contrast there are also savings accounts. You won't want or need one of those yet. They are more aimed at longer term saving.

&gt;I have no idea which bank to go with, what they need (I have no passport), can I just walk in and ask to open an account?

Most banks will want proof of ID and proof of address at a minimum. A driving licence will work for ID if you have one. Some might require previous bank statements. Some accounts require you to deposit in at least £X per month, usually £500 or £1000 (easy if you're working). You can check out the websites for all the major highstreet banks (HSBC, Natwest, Santander etc) to get an idea of what they need. There is very little difference with a simple current account, and it's very easy to switch to a new bank if you decide to do so for whatever reason.

Alternatively, just pick a branch that's near your home or work, walk in, and explain the situation to an advisor. Someone at the branch should be able to help you if you explain that you're after the most basic bank account available and don't have much in the way of bank history.

&gt;Do you need someone to be a guarantor like renting?

No, guarantors are only really needed for things that are risky, such as offering credit or locking people into a rental contract.

Daws and Rose may not be suited to what Poch wants to do (Daws is slow-footed and not as adept on the ball as others, Rose lacks discipline and defensive instinct) but are still going to be upgrades over what Hull have on their squad and would both walk into a starting role.

""Personally, I don't see the point of paying taxes if we don't look after the most vulnerable in society.""

Taxes do much more that just go to the social welfare budget.

You're in Yorkshire now? Many councils covering homes in Yorkshire have a Welfare Benefits unit. Contact the relevant one (google!) and point out that you have anxiety which makes you claiming without assistance difficult/impossbile, and you've already deferred placing a claim for that reason. If they don't have a Welfare Benefits unit then contact your council's Social Services department.

&gt; I'm new to the area and my doctor and consultant don't know me so wouldn't be much use to support a claim. 

Failing that explain the problem to your GP. Many of your records will be available to them immediately because recent ones are computerised and networked. It's quite normal for GP surgeries to have links with agencies whose activities include helping people claim benefits. All it will take is for the GP to write a letter to the appropriate agency.

There's also the [Citzens Advice Bureau](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/about_this_site/get_advice.htm), but I would say they're more set up for people who don't have crippling anxiety/phobia.

So you're saying because of the way SOME (I'd argue a minority) of people respond to Islam, that means we should say Islam is bad and discourage it? It's said some people interpret some Christian literature and teachings as it's okay to molest alter boys and children, should we discourage all of Christianity, or paint all Christians as paedophiles? Some following the teaching of Buddhism [have been inciting the murder of Muslims](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/08/us-myanmar-violence-specialreport-idUSBRE9370AP20130408) should we discourage Buddhism too and say all Buddhists are bad?

I understand what you're getting at: there's a lot of coverage of Muslims doing bad things. But that's not proof or evidence that the majority of Muslims don't do bad things.

Probably because a full public enquiry would scupper any chance of a fair trial before the police could even charge anyone and we wouldn't want anyone wriggling off the hook now, would we?

It's the police's job to determine if a crime has been committed. It's the courts job to give a fair and impartial trial for the accused. If found guilty, THEN (and only then) is it time for a public enquiry to find out how and why it happened.

""National Insurance (NI) in the United Kingdom is a system of contributions paid by workers and employers towards the cost of certain state benefits. It was initially a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment, and later also provided retirement pensions and other benefits.""

""The contributory principle was central to William Beveridge's plan for a comprehensive social security system after the Second World War. He described his Plan for Social Security as: ""first and foremost a plan of insurance - of giving in return for contributions benefits up to subsistence levels, as of right and without means test, so that individuals may build freely upon it.""[45] The quotation summarises the key features of Beveridge's plan. His overall concern was to prevent poverty through provision of a subsistence income, rather than the creation of a system which replaced wage levels.""

Our taxes go toward education and protection, but the idea with national insurance is that we automatically pay out of our wages a little every month so that should we fall ill, we've contributed to the costs - and furthermore, everyone paying a little provides an *insurance* for both ourselves and our fellow workers.

That's a really good bit of advice, because individual staff working at branches of most banks are really helpful, so it's good to have a local branch you can just pop in to.

Other things to consider might be ATM networks - are there cash machines you can use for free, and are they nearby; internet and phone banking - are these available; and will you get a debit card, cheque book (some people still use cheques!), etc. You might have a limit on how much you can withdraw using your debit card to start with, but you can always go in to a branch and withdraw more.

Personally, I'd go with any of the major high street banks, and if someone you know recommends a local branch then that's a good sign.

If you sever the club from its history and traditions, the name 'may' be forever, but not the soul. Tradition is the life blood of a club like West Ham. It's because West Ham haven't won much that tradition matters all the more, because it means that the club's success has been predicated on the people who have supported its existence. The supporters who have devoted their lives to propping the club up are the people who truly comprise West Ham. I've supported the club for 43 years, and I've relished the victories when they've come, but if I'm honest, I don't care if we win or lose, I don't care what league we play in, and I certainly don't care if we win the league, not at any cost at any rate. Being a West Ham supporter isn't about winning the league. It's about the club's history, the club's identity and an ethos of doing things in a particular way. You can't sell or trade a club's history. I'm not advocating not winning, nor asking for the club not to evolve. I just see the signs that the club is pulling away from who it used to be, and I don't like it.

1. Promote from youth squads. Conor McAleny is 21 and just signed a new 3 year contract, signalling Martinez's confidence in his ability. Not seen much and is coming back from a nasty leg break, but has impressed at lower levels.

2. Loans. Something we sort of became famous for last season. Martinez was both lauded and criticised for his use of the loan market (bringing in Lukaku, Deulofeu, Barry and Traore). It is widely expected he'll do the same this year, with Traore looking the most likely to come back. He was injured and didn't get a chance to impress last season. 

3. Lukaku. We can but dream. Half the fans believe we can buy him, the other half don't think we have a chance. 

4. Buying. We have been linked to lots of players this summer, with Swansea's Wilfried Bony looking like a possibility *if* we don't get Lukaku. Media rumours should always be taken with a bucket-load of salt. 

5. What we already have. It isn't much. We have Kone who hasn't really featured because of injury, and when he has played he hasn't impressed. He generally sucks during pre-season because he fasts for Ramadan and it affects his performance levels. 
Then we have Naismith. He wasn't good under Moyes (he was played out of position on the wing) and as such the fans moaned about him non stop (myself included). Under Martinez, he has been much, much better. Played as a striker, or just behind the striker, he works his socks off every match and managed to score a few important goals last season. Kevin Mirallas can also be played as a striker, but mostly plays on the wing.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"Honestly, I have no idea - it's difficult to even *recognise* your own social programming let alone discard it and think dispassionately about it, and there's no guarantee that the next few decades of cultural change will necessarily result in substantial changes to sexual mores (as opposed to other attitudes or issues).

I suspect that people will view underage sex *between underage people* a lot differently - [Romeo and Juliet laws](http://definitions.uslegal.com/r/romeo-and-juliet-law/) seem like a no-brainer, faced with the current alternative in many jurisdictions of convicting one or both of the people involved as a sex-offender.

Similarly I suspect that our current hysteria about minor and victimless ""sexual"" offences will ease off a lot - prostitution ad similar services becoming legal, and right now people can end up on the sexual offenders' register in some places for drunkenly urinating in an alleyway at midnight if they happen to be within a minimum distance to the nearest school, and that's just fucking *insane*.

Similarly I suspect that we'll learn to differentiate better between paedophiles (people who have a *disease or orientation*) and child abusers (people who *act on their desires* and harm another person), and non-offending paedophiles would be treated medically the way we treat any other harmful paraphilia now, instead of being treated criminally or ignored, condemned and force to hide their disease and try to manage it on their own until/if they can't manage it any more and abuse a child.

Hell, if you want to get really creative and think outside the box, consider the fact that [easy, anonymous access to pornography apparently reduces the incidence of rape](http://www.yapaka.be/sites/yapaka.be/files/actualite/pornography-rape-and-the-internet.pdf), and then consider the possibility of legalising or decriminalising the *possession* of child pornography for registered, self-identifying paedophiles as a route to reducing incidences of actual child abuse.  You could easily put safeguards in place like restricting supply to specific places and still prohibiting the *production* (to avoid creating a market demand for more), banning such registered individuals from jobs or roles involving access to children and/or legalising the possession and production of simulated or artificially-created (CG, photoshop, etc) images that didn't involve harming any actual individual.  It's a gross idea, but then so's a colostomy bag - the important consideration is whether it might *work*.

Ultimately I suspect that we'll look back on the paedophile hysteria of the late 20th/early 21st century a bit like the way we now look back on medieval people burning mentally ill people as witches.  Yes, sometimes mentally ill people can commit horrible crimes and no, you don't always want the dangerous ones wandering free in society, but that doesn't excuse treating someone who's mentally *ill* as barbarically as they sometimes used to.

I suspect people will view the treatment of homosexuality and homosexual individuals and couples as pretty morally wrong - I doubt it would be considered bad enough to be *criminal*, but you might see a lot of retrospective prejudice/bigotry lawsuits in a few decades.

Perhaps things we still consider a bit outré (and even illegal) might become accepted and normal - polyamorous relationships, threesome and group-marriages, etc.

Increasingly we're tending as a society in a direction you could characterise as ""well if it doesn't hurt anyone, who really cares?"", so there isn't really a lot I can think of in society that we actively demonise in a sexual context that isn't objectively harmful.

Perhaps with contraception and genetic screening (to avoid genetic degradation) incest might become more tolerated, though I suspect we also have those prohibitions in place at least in part to avoid compromising and tainting parental and other familial relationships with other agendas and priorities (eg, to prevent parents grooming their kids into sex-slaves rather than raising them to be fully-rounded people), so perhaps not.",0,1404407913,null,0,1404408354,0,cinoo82,t3_29h0o2,t1_cinoo82,t1_cilogjz,null,1434534963,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Only minor gripe is that delivery times can be a bit erratic but then they make no guarantees..

However, I've been sat in a friends front room, windows open and watched a Yodel driver walk up to the door, push an already completed 'you were out form' through the letter box and then walk off without even knocking..
So I imagine your experience will vary greatly depending on your drivers.

I will add to this for balance that Royal mail have left my parcels in hedges, thrown parcels over my gate into puddles, delivered to the wrong street, and outright stolen stuff.

 There are some fantastic midwives out there but, as in all professions, there are also a few who are slap dash, not very knowledgeable and uncaring.

Definitely see the GP as soon as possible - I'm assuming the midwife did all routine checks: BP/urine/foetal  position/foetal heartbeat?  Abdominal pain is very common and often harmless but I'd rather err on the side of caution than go down an acupuncture route - this seems odd to me.

I'm not denying that there needs to be a body to adjudicate on contentious parades, the RUC stopped more parades than the parades commission ever did, however the parades commission in its current form is unfit for purpose, those who it most effects have minute say in how it is run, there is little uniformity to its determinations, it is often inaccurate in its statements, accepts evidence at face value without any scrutiny, regularly supports cultural apartheid, often gives in to threats of violence, and worst of all there is no accountability, either to Parliament or the assembly.

The majority of the Haas proposals on parades were fine, there were a few things that needed worked out, but that fell apart due to the ridiculous notion that all three issues; Flags, Parading, past, should be dealt with in the one go.",0,1404408990,null,0,false,0,cinp8o6,t3_29qdux,t1_cinp8o6,t1_cinnwxi,null,1434535247,-2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-2
