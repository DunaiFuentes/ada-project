&gt; Meanwhile, Liverpool have dismissed reports in Spain that Barcelona winger Cristian Tello will be heading to Anfield on loan for the rest of the season.
&gt; 
&gt; Tello, who rejected the chance to join the Reds on a season-long loan in the summer of 2012, has found his opportunities limited under Gerardo Martino this term.
&gt; 
&gt; That has led to speculation that the 22-year-old could move on in January.
&gt;

You can clearly see that this season. We are in desperate need of a player that can link up well with the attacking third. Someone that can play alongside Ramires or even Van Ginkel in the future. For striker, i will go with Lewandowski. Diego Costa is my preferred choice, but i don't think we can afford him this window. I don't need to explain why we need a striker on our team. Our current strikers have miserably failed. A team like Chelsea doesn't have time and patience to wait for them to come good.

&gt; ‘If you worry about such things, and I do, then I specifically said John Hurt’s Doctor doesn’t use the title. [Matt Smith's Doctor] is in his 12th body but he’s the 11th Doctor, however there is no such character as the 11th Doctor – he’s just the Doctor – that’s what he calls himself.’

So really, none of them are the Xth Doctor, that's what *we* call them.  And we call Hurt the War Doctor, but that's still just our name for them.  So technically they all just call themselves Doctor - but Hurt's character didn't.  Therefore we can call him the War Doctor for clarity's sake (or 8.5), but *he* didn't consider himself ""the Doctor"" - the next regeneration to do so was Eccleston's, thus becoming the 9th person to call himself ""the Doctor.""

""GJ has been inconsistent at times, but usually it's been in one phase of his game OR the other, but rarely both, especially for such an extended period of time. For me, this doesn't come down to a lack of competition at RB, misunderstanding of his role, tiredness, or disinterest.""

""Johnson appears to me to be suffering the after-effects of an untreated head injury. The degree of logginess we've seen of him over the last seven matches is very similar to what I've observed for decades here in the States throughout the NFL. It's clear that there isn't anything mechanically wrong with him. He doesn't appear hobbled or to be favoring any part of his body. The problems are with speed of thought, reaction time, and general game intelligence. Even an undiagnosed low-grade concussion can have this kind of impact.""

""The way he's held the ball in the attacking third near the top of the 18' and he just sort of stands there as if ruminating what to do, that's new. Even on his worst days in the past he would at least try to protect the ball, but of late he's simply been at a loss (much of the time) to do even the basics. Slowness of thought, a fatigued look about his play, confusion, these are all part of the diagnosis. He should be asked about his sleeping patterns, headaches, nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, tiredness, as these are common symptoms.""

""Keep in mind that it doesn't take much to injure the brain. A slight knock from an unusual angle, an awkward tumble, a slip on a banana peel can all produce symptoms. It could also be a recurrence or exacerbation of a previous injury. Many people think that head injury is necessarily the result of hard and/or repeated blows to the head but this is scientifically not the case at all. Also, head injury does not mean a person is non-functional all the time. A person can drift between periods of clarity and periods of malaise or confusion. It's not all or nothing.""",0,1388535434,null,0,false,0,ceeg52s,t3_1u4as0,t1_ceeg52s,t3_1u4as0,null,1427910545,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2

As you said, it is very subjective especially unpredictability. 2^nd for Serie A (top 3 are separated by 10 points) and 3^rd for Bundesliga (11pts between the top 3) are quite surprising, while La Liga have the top 3 separated by 5 points - with Atletico and Barca separated by 2 goals.

Making a more reasonable La Liga 2^nd, Seria A 3^rd and Bundesliga last, reduce the gap between the EPL and La Liga to a single point, which seems more adequate (and also quite marginal).",0,1388535670,null,0,false,0,ceeg7yy,t3_1u3b70,t1_ceeg7yy,t1_ceefcmn,null,1427910507,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

So they all arrive, and find out that what the signal is, is the eternal question, ""Dr. Who?""

If the good Doctor tells them beyond the crack his name, and he is trapped inside a truth field, so he cannot lie if he answers, then they will know that they are knocking on the right crack to the right universe, and so will break through, bringing the whole of the timelocked, pocketuniversed Time War with it.

And so he, as well as the entire town and probably the entire planet, for good measure, is #1 on everybody's exterminate list, so that he cannot say and bring Gallifrey back. Understandable. He sends off Clara so she doesn't get hurt in the warzone, and is left without a ride, defending the poor citizens of Christmas for 300 years from being exterminated with him. ect, ect.

What I don't understand, is how come when Clara whispers into the crack that they've got the right universe and the right Doctor, that magically solves the conundrum of the Time Lords bringing Gallifrey and the Time War back to be finished. Sure, Time Lord high council types can donate regeneration energy, and can even extend the life cycle, which might make some sense what with the Doctor giving them hope in being sealed in a painting pocket universe, but the underlying problem wasn't solved.

This should cause Gallifrey and the Time War to break through and resume, no?

And as I've said - at its core is this idea that cycling is somehow morally virtuous and those that do it come across as holier-than-thou lycra wearing oddities, whilst car drivers are portrayed as evil environment destroying scum... which ironically is self defeating - since it alienates people that don't cycle from doing it even more so.

Bottom line is; we aren't a nation of cyclists and if we ever are going to be - it isn't going to happen overnight with an expensive cycle lane system... but rather long term change in the economics, demographics and geography of the UK.

Sure, the council voted unanimously minus two, but how much of that was due to the abject hopelessness of the war and the intimidation of Rassilon?

When the Master attacked Rassilon at the end and Gallifrey returned to the war, he would have been out of commission for a while, which means the Time Lords would not enact the sanction. Following this, Gallifrey was also put into a pocket universe, safely away from the Daleks who destroy themselves in the crossfire.

That's not to say it wouldn't be good or better, but it would definitely be different.

Plus, there's so much sci-fi magic in the DW universe, it's hard to come up with a solid reason why someone is *dead* dead. I mean, hell, people were pissed because they connived a way to keep the Ponds away. In DW, there's always a wibbly-wobbly explanation around the corner and if the writers try and get out of that, they get hate. 

As for Handles, while his death was important and saddening, he didn't have backstory or very much depth, so nobody will be truly sad that he's gone. At least, not in the same way we were sad that Rose was gone or that Rory died (again and again and again), and those characters came back. Hmm, thinking about it, the only character that has died on the show and meant something (that I know of/can think of) is Harriet Jones. That one was pretty solid. Everyone else either comes back or is *just* there to be killed off.

They hide everything inside until it boils up and makes drama. Doesn't mean the change doesn't happen, it is just hard to see. 

Some consequences/changes over the course of the seasons that I can think of:

- Amy &amp; Rory's relationship develops and changes through loss and sacrifice

- Amy becomes less selfish and opens up a bit

- Rory grows a spine and stops being so paranoid about Amy

- 11 slowly becomes less egotistical and a bit more realistic/pessimistic.

- While already known, River changes from the engineered assassin to the Doctor's SO

Scoring more goals tends to lead to more points, it signify s attacking dominance that is as likely to matter with Man City as vs Norwich.

Also the guys who are creating most of those goals are your attacking third players who simply have less of a defending role. Defnding vs goals is mainly the responsibility of backs, keeper, and to a lesser extent mid.

Going on assumption i would say that simultaneous to this situation in Arcadia, Rassilon and the high council were preparing to complete the final sanction or had already attempted to do so and failed miserably! 

A-thankya Tennant!

Keep in mind that the Tennant, Eccleston and Hurt doctors have no memory of what happened in the 50th due to the time streams being out of Sync as stated by Smith. As mr ProtoKun7 below states Hurt probably decided to timelock the planet in response to the knowledge of what Rassilon and the High Council were getting ready to commit or possibly already failed to commit. Don't wrap your brain around that one, too many negatives.

Now, for the fun stuff...MORE ASSUMPTIONS! Here's what I believe is the timeline of events and also an explanation of what happens between the...well everything. Before the ending events of the 50th when Hurt, Tennant and Smith are gallivanting around Gallifrey in their  tardises with all the rest of themselves, Rassilon is trying to escape the time lock, or a time lock which hasn't necessarily been enacted yet. Not completely anyway. This would also mean there is TWO Tennant's in existence at this point due to the timelines being out of sync (Ladies and gentlemen please contain your orgasms when pondering this possibility). However all that really has no ground at all even going on assumption and probably could be thrown out but its there for anyone willing to give it more thought. 

The REAL assumption is what happened between the 50th and Christmas specials. Rassilon failed in enacting the final sanction, is all bummed out and then suddenly 13 DOCTORS come in and save Gallifrey and put it into a pocket dimension...that's including the Daleks already past the sky trench. Now they may be Daleks but I would like to think ANY ground force would fall into utter CHAOS at the sudden disappearance of their main fleet and command structure, thus giving the Timelords the chance and the morale to kick the deadly pepper pots back into oblivion. This would cause Rassilon and the High Council to no longer feel compelled to enact the Final Sanction (well maybe Rassilon would still feel compelled cause he seems a bit crazy to me, does anyone have a guess to how he was brought back?), and now the timelords would dedicate themselves to trying to find some way back into regular space (i like to think they be in E Space...THE RETURN OF ROMANNA....no no i'm just a crazy fanboy!)",0,1388553703,null,0,false,0,ceeljbr,t3_1u4q5b,t1_ceeljbr,t3_1u4q5b,null,1427907931,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

But yeah, interesting discussion, that's one of the things I didn't understand about the UK.  You truly do have a commitment to the social welfare system.  Very few Brittish wouldn't support something like the NHS, where here in the U.S. it's very controvertial.  Stop me if I'm wrong but you guys have free public universities, council housing, pension type benefits for most workers, and even your conservatives generally support these things.  You are kind of willing to pay so that your brother can have these things if he needs them.

But it's not always your brother who's using them.  From what I've heard that's the reason so many Brits are sick of the immigration.  And I can't blame you.  You're willing to pay the taxes to have the things I've mentioned, but that was when it was Brits helping Brits.

I can understand the backlash against multiculturalism.  The article I read discussing it said ""the wellfare state isn't possible in a multicultural society.""  And I think that's totally true.

They're two completely different things even though it's the same person. Same being, different titles.

An incarnation that had a completely different purpose than the rest of his forms that went by The Doctor.

But what if we're speaking about generalities? Since we don't really know it, let's just say The Doctor's REAL name is John. The War Doctor is the 9th John, but John still only called himself The Doctor 8 times. When he had regenerated into Eccleston, John then called himself The Doctor 9 times, and The War Doctor 1 time. 9 Doctors, 1 War Doctor. 9 Doctors whose purpose was to try and fix things and make things better, 1 War Doctor to say ""No more."", be a badass and get shit done during the Time War.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Depending on the length of Kane's injury, I don't think that we need a striker this window. As long as we move away from this 4-4-2, he should be sufficient for a 3rd option. He has shown some promise in his limited playing time this year and he would certainly benefit from more first team exposure. Then, in the summer, he could train with us and then we could bring in a third option and loan him out to a side that would play him consistently. If we're going to continue with this 4-4-2 nonsense, then we should bring in a first team ready striker, because playing your only two strikers every game is a terrible idea. 

The other glaring need is LB. I don't think that Rose is the long term solution for us, but he is suitable for now. That said, there has to be a senior player to mentor him and/or be his backup. Or there needs to be another young-ish player to challenge him and their rotation would provide cover. It's apparent that Vertonghen, while a capable LB, needs to be in the central defense, considering he's one of the best in the league. 

Other than that, we're good until the summer. We have four CBs, if Kaboul ever comes back, and Capoue is more than capable of covering there, as long as he isn't paired with Chiriches. LB needs cover, but RB is sufficient, considering Walker's consistency and Naughton not being absolute shit there. Fryers can float around where needed.

The midfield is stacked in every position and with absolute quality. Sandro, Dembele, Capoue, Paulinho, Holtby, Eriksen, Sigurdsson, Lamela, Chadli, Lennon and Townsend are all fighting for 4 spots (hopefully 5 once we change formations). That depth is arguably unrivaled, as they aren't just bodies to fill a spot on the bench, but fighting for a starting spot each match. The only addition we could potentially add here would be a big money signing to the left side, but I wouldn't see that happening until the summer. 

Basically, Sherwood seems to be pleased (or overwhelmed) with the squad depth and rightfully so. There's a lot of quality and a lot of players who need to be on the field.

Sometimes he was so good at it that we were able to look past the ridiculous plot finales or what you have not, simply because we were so in touch with the characters and their stories and development.

His partnership and chemistry with ramires both at CDM well be unpassable, if and when, luiz gets some discipline, and to me, that comes with experience (more playing time at that position). Anyways, that opens up a spot at CB, so we move in ivanovic back to his natural CB, position. Then with a RB spot open, we move in Azpi back to his natural place (hes doing very well so far as a fullback!) So, to my final point, we buy LUKE SHAW. Yes, ashley is our LB, but we all know he is coming of age and all great things come to end but hey just think of having L. Shaw as starting LB with cole as a replacement, then CB with terry, iva, cahill (and maybe luiz IF we need him), then RB with azpi and ivanovic as a backup. Then our CDMs will be ramires and luiz with lamps as a backup(he is coming of age and will be another great thing to come to an end) and also MvG as a replacement along with JoM and essien.
tl;dr buy luke shaw and put him LB. Put azpi RB and iva to CB(but can also come back as a RB if needed), then bump up luiz to CDM (needs to be disciplined a bit) and put him alongside ramires.

true,lwang,null,null,"Precisely. Jenna Louise-Coleman is a fantastic actress who can bring any amazing amount of charm and verve with each performance...but the concept of her character and storyline is just utterly bland.

It's something I've been noticing, what differentiates the RTD and Moffat era. RTD, for all his many, many faults as showrunner, gave each companion a concrete story and character. Rose was the estate girl who longed for adventure even as she was tied by the strings of family and community. Martha wanted to save people. Donna was your everyday woman, putting up with life's struggles with a larf and a whiplash wit. Yes, each changed with the Doctor, but in the end they were people who came into contact with the Doctor.

Contrast that with the main companions of the Moffat era. Amy is the Girl who Waited. River Song is the Doctor's Wife. Clara is the Impossible Girl. Before they are characters, they are concepts. They are created to serve the plot. Amy is probably the worst offender in this regard - though Karen Gillan puts in an enormous performance to give her continuity and reasoning, there is no goddamn sense in Amy's professions: Kiss-o-gram, model, writer. We don't know what Amy desires in life beyond waiting for the Doctor or being Rory's wife. She's capable, snarky and absolutely refreshing but that is not to Moffat's writing, rather it is Karen bringing life to what would've been, in other writer's hands, a perfectly dull role.

So if the character in the show doesn't believe himself fit for the title of ""Doctor"" but we have nothing else to call him, it makes sense to use the title but not give him a proper number. You could just as easily call him ""The Warrior"" if you wanted, and I know plenty of people do.

At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what your personal opinion is anyways. The show's lore, the BBC, BBC America, Moffat, and Matt Smith have all made it blatantly clear numerous times that Hurt was an incarnation of the Time Lord who frequently uses the title ""Doctor"" that just chose not to use the title for himself. Just because you don't want to accept that doesn't make it false.

My granny (and many like her) were stuck out in the boonies outside of Sydney and found the living conditions rough n' ready compared to the neat order of the English countryside. Besides that, the whole new concept of massive distance between towns, huge expanses of empty land, could give the impression of a 'pioneer' lifestyle, far from centres of culture. This could feel very isolating and 'uncivilised' to a person who only knows compact, dense, built-up England.

Lastly, what is now good-natured rivalry between our countries could be a little more raw and mean-spirited back then, and my granny found her neighbours were rude and openly complained about the 'pom' family, and never accepted her or extended their help to her as a woman on her own with two children in a strange country. Obviously this isn't true of everyone she met, but I think many English immigrants found the plain-speaking of the 'bogans' quite shocking.

That's really all there is to it. He carried the title through that entire form until right at the very end. Supposedly at one point he DID use the moment, but then he changed his own history. Or 9 through 11 were wrong about the history and he never blew it up in the first place and just thought he did. But either way, in the end, it's not about what he ended up doing or what we feel he earned. He went by The War Doctor the entire time in that form and fought in a war. Something he wouldn't do just as ""The Doctor"". He took that name immediately when he decided to go to war because he wouldn't do it as just ""The Doctor"". And that's what still sets him apart. It's just what he willingly called himself, even before using the moment was even thought of. And he still did it in order to be a warrior and fight in the war, where he avoided it entirely as The Doctor. And by time they said he was The Doctor again, he regenerated anyways. He had fulfilled his purpose and was of old age. He regenerated and went back to being The Doctor. 

And if he chose to go by another name again, then that version isn't The Doctor either. No matter how good or bad he acts.

And as I've said, it does largely have to do with numbers, not just the character. It's not enough to say ""this is true because I said so."" He has yet to give a legitimate reason why. 

It doesn't matter what's said out of the show. Forget about all that. Steven Moffat could run across the country screaming ""Chris Eccleston is still the ninth Doctor"", and it wouldn't mean anything. The only evidence that counts is in-universe evidence. And as I've said, the War Doctor seemed to have changed his mind at the last minute, so until that moment, he wasn't the Doctor. He didn't become the Doctor until the moment he avoided destroying Gallifrey, and now only Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi's characters know that.

But he doesn't. The only people who have a substantial part in that decision are the War Doctor, Clara, and ""Bad Wolf"". Matt Smith even offers to help him blow it up. Besides, even if it does refer to all three Doctors, the biggest role in the Day of the Doctor *should* be the Doctor.

I know, I was just listing ways that he is the Doctor, and that was just one of them.

It's still more evidence than you have. As I've said several times, if he changed his mind at the END of the Day of the Doctor, then nothing he said before that matters EXCEPT for his title card. Because it just appeared on the screen, it was basically the show itself saying ""John Hurt is the Doctor."" None of the characters could have known that he would change his mind, but the show could. Even so, where do you get that it's been ""superseded""? Yes, other characters have stated otherwise, but why does that supersede it? No character could possibly know the show as well as the show knows itself. Just because it happened later doesn't mean it takes precedence.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"The UK Government has an immigration target currently at 100,000. It has reduced non-EU immigration by something like 1/3rd. In order to reach the 100,000 goal (this is due to various factors eg capacity on infrastructure, rates of flow affecting integration ie jobs/homes etc and of course based on capacity from previous migration trends); the UK government MUST cap  EU migration rates.

So the ""free movement"" is not an unqualified success if your own government is not reaching it's own set targets (assumption: Targets are based of positive outcomes for regulating flow rate of human traffic).

If the above is true, then this conservative piece is propaganda positive spin at odds with it's own government's ""policy and targets"".

I'm therefore surprised to see people agreeing with this assertion in general terms seeing as it's contradictory to:

Net migration for 2012 was 176,000 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012.

&gt;""Net migration for 2013 - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating - rose to 182,000 in the year to June, up from 167,000 in the previous 12 months."" ~ ONS

The different figures probably come with different error margins or estimates. But the trend is still INCREASING away from the government targets: from a peak in early 2000's of 250,000 pa under Labour. With open borders to Romania and Bulgaria there is expected to be a sharp spike once again.

Looking at the past:

John Major, Conservative PM: Didn't he promise in the mid-90's a cap of about 55,000 immigrants pa?

Nick Clegg on 20 May 2010 launching the coalition policy document, the Prime Minister said:

&gt;""In terms of immigration, what you can see is that there's a cap going to be put in place and, yes, that is with **the ambition of getting to levels of net migration that were prevalent in the 80s and 90s, which is tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands.""**

What politicians say and do should not be mixed up. Whether you believe immigration to be positive or negative is a question connected to that first statement.

Effectiveness on the pitch in real terms is much more difficult to quantify. 

For example : is a midfielder more effective because his tackling stats are high or has that midfielder been forced to tackle because he is beaten/caught out of position too often and is forced to make rash last ditch tackles.

As for Lucas as I have said many times:

Against poor/decent/excellent opposition. 

Lucas is excellent/good/poor. With some notable exceptions.

He is our best player/only player for that role in our system and we really miss him when he is out.

Imo going forward we really do need a better player in that role. Someone with his abilities but who is more mobile/aggressive and has more presence in big games.

Saying that, it's the friendlest and most relaxed place I've ever lived. The hustle and bustle during the day completely dies down at night and you can walk through town in the early hours and not see another soul. I love it.

I moved here 7/8 years ago and I don't think I could live anywhere else in England. You'll be able to find a double bed in a houseshare quite easily, average price is around 350-500 plus bills. Anything more than that and you're getting ripped off. Parking isn't likely in town, but if you lived a bit further out either Hove or Moulsecoomb/Patcham way you'd probably get parking and cheaper rent. So you know, there is absolutely no point in driving in town if you're planning to work in town too. You can walk everywhere, there's always a shortcut, and the buses are great.

Office jobs are easy enough to get if you're happy to work in a call center/admin type job. There's two call centres I have in mind that are ALWAYS recruiting. One is the telecoms center by Preson Park (also a nice area to live) which house Lovefilm and the like. I can't remember the name of the other one but I'll edit this when I do.

Brighton is quite an arty farty crafty city so you'll never be short of things to do! Night life is good, I'm a pub girl myself but there's plenty of clubs and regular nights ranging from 70's to drum n bass :)

In previous editions have you given little bios about some of these players? I don't think I've heard of Roddan or Peterson. How old are they? What are their positions?

Also, aside from Wisdom and Borini, what are everyone's thoughts on the chances of our other loanees making it to the first team? Unfortunately it doesn't seem like Coady, Robinson, or Morgan will be getting a shot.

RTD had a long and successful history writing in a number of genres, and so he came into Who with a lot of extra knowledge about plotting.  Some of the ways he subtly worked in arc material, such as with key words, was really quite clever.  

So he had a good formula for having every episode be 99% standalone, but still usually with some little bit somewhere that ties into the overall arc.  (Like the implicit ""Who's John Saxton?"" suggested by the occasional mentions of his name and pointed cutaways to his poster.)

I don't think Moffat got that you can't simply wing something like that.  It requires legitimate pre-planning from early on, or else a good editor's eye for where you can slip a scene in without disrupting the flow.  

He, it seems to me, ultimately got caught up in the godlike powers of being able to put virtually anything he envisioned onscreen, whether it was a good idea or not.  And as showrunner, he didn't really have many people around telling him which ideas were bad.

(Plus, to his credit, ratings remained as good, if not better, as under RTD.  Although I think a large part of that is thanks to BBC America picking up the show around the time Moffat took over.  It gave him a big new audience that RTD lacked, since he really only had domestic viewers to count.)",0,1388583259,null,0,false,0,ceeqg1v,t3_1u4v3s,t1_ceeqg1v,t1_ceepp85,null,1427904336,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

But since QI questions are incomprehensible and un-Google-able anyway, seeing them in advance doesn't really help!

Ed Milliband can walk down the street and talk to people in town centres like he does without people being held back by barriers. He may have bodyguards off to the side but you won't get near the Queen unless you behind a barrier and even then there will be burley men hanging around ready to blow your head off. 

I saw Michael Gove walking alone from Leicester Sq towards Trafalgar Sq in November and no-one recognised him or if they did (like me) they didn't give a shit (like me). I'm not exactly going to say hi as if I'm a big fan. Boris used to cycle to work, so did Cameron actually until he started using armed guards and land rovers.

The big one that everybody is missing is child benefit, because the child doesn't have to be in the UK:   

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/23/child-benefit-payments-outside-uk

Not that in the great scheme of things that costs the UK a lot, but that it is a great draw - especially where there's a culture where grandparents are more involved in the raising of children anyway (by no means a bad thing).  What it does mean is that by the time somebody has claimed what is a meager child benefit when spent in the UK and sent it back, it's already more than the equivalent of a what was their weekly wage for many.  Wages for the poorest are that low (and cost of living obviously much cheaper).    

The issue there is that it's a huge motivator to come if you're poor or have a large family of dependents back 'home', and it's the numbers that will put pressure local services.  Added to that, if they do decide to bring their children (which is of course entirely their right, and rightly so) then local authorities have now no means of knowing exactly how many school places they're going to need in the coming years.",0,1388587989,null,0,false,0,ceer7he,t3_1u5nva,t1_ceer7he,t1_ceequcb,null,1427903980,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

&gt; Habitual residence

&gt; There is no clear definition of habitual residence and it can be difficult to prove that you intend to settle in the UK. The decision maker can choose from a bank of up to 100 questions which will take into account your individual circumstances. For example, they may ask you about:

&gt; * the length of time you have been in the UK
* your reasons for coming to the UK
* how long you intend to stay here
* whether you're likely to find work in the UK.

&gt; The decision maker will also look at how much your life is based in the UK. This is known as your centre of interest. Things they will consider include whether:

&gt; * you own property in the UK
* your personal possessions are mostly in the UK
* you have family and relatives here
* you've joined any clubs or societies in the UK
* you've enrolled your children at a school.

&gt; It can be difficult to predict what decision will be made about your claim. Your specific circumstances will be taken into account when they make a decision. It's really important to include as much evidence as possible when you fill in the HRT form. If possible, seek advice before you complete it.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"FY1 - you will be expected to work tirelessly for long periods, doing tasks that make you wonder why you bothered getting a medical degree (endless forms, paperwork and other secretarial duties).

FY2 - a bit more freedom to make decisions and get involved in patient management, largely due to there being someone below you on the pecking order to do the tasks noted above. 

Pay is good, but don't think about it in terms of an hourly rate, because you will be disheartened.  

Edit - also perhaps consider a busy district general hospital with a specialism you are interested in, as opposed to a large ""teaching hospital"".  Teaching hospitals are in my experience often anything but, as there will be so many trainees of varying levels clamouring for procedures, etc.  I had a fantastic experience doing my FY years in a busy DGH and came out with much more practical experience than did my friends at the teaching hospitals.

I don't recall there being a full life biography of The Doctor in The Library, why do you think there is one?  Even if such a book existed, how would it have information about events in the future?  In order for your theory to be accurate, the events in *Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead* would had to have taken place centuries before the events of *The Time of The Doctor* to give River time to set up the Papal Mainframe.  You are assuming a computer 'becomes' the Papal Mainframs. And that River ever escapes The Library.  We don't have any real evidence to support either of those ideas yet.  Just circumstantial coincidence.  You're basically creating an incredibly unlikely, yet very creative, scenario and using River as your 'god of the gaps' to fill in any area where you need to bend physics.

Now, this is a fantasy show, so I'll be the first to admit anything is possible.  I just still think this is too unlikely to believe.   

I think what Moffat really wants is this discussion.

true,DoktorStrangelove,lfcwfmm,,"Immediate thoughts/reactions: 

It took most of the first half and a goal for our guys to start to settle. They looked down after the disallowed Suarez goal. Clearly it's going to take a couple good matches for the team to find its rhythm again. They seem more susceptible to frustration than they were before the City and Chelsea matches. They also let momentum drop for a while around the 70th minute...allowing poor teams to generate late pressure has caused us problems this season, it needs to be addressed. 

Coutinho...I don't know what to say. He is clearly in some sort of slump. His short passing is tidy and plenty accurate, but compared to last season his incisive passing is way, way down. He also had maybe 1 decent shot today, but he took like 6. I want him to score and work his way through this as much as the next guy, but I'm becoming less patient with his poor efforts. He has been so, so wasteful lately. That said, he still creates chances with regularity, so maybe he'll start converting more of them soon. Hopefully Sturridge's return will take some of the pressure off of him so that he can polish his game back up. 

I have no idea why we keep putting Moses in the game. He's either completely invisible (like today) or looks lost/incompetent whenever he manages to work his way into the game. He should only be used in emergencies if we don't trust our own players. In a comfortable-looking 2-0 situation at home against a weaker side, we NEED to be experimenting with Alberto and maybe Ibe as attacking subs, not giving minutes to loanees. I'm beyond frustrated with Moses at this point. 

Other than that, good match and good 3 points. They won't all be amazing to watch, I'm just glad we got the result and got the train back on the rails for now. ",0,1388595146,null,0,false,0,ceesz6p,t3_1u5x0v,t1_ceesz6p,t3_1u5x0v,null,1427903083,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

true,maitrevee,1986,Petr Cech,"**Talking Points**

After brilliantly shackling and dominating Suarez and co, the challenge is to start expressing the same personality away from home at places such as St Mary's. The impressive win over Liverpool raised our total points in the opening half of the season to 38, a four-year high. The gap between third and fourth has opened to three points.

Today's fixture offers another chance of self-improvement as the Blues were seen off 2-1 here last season when Rafael Benitez was in charge. The Spaniard had little choice but to field a slightly weakened side as the FA Cup quarter-final clash with Manchester United was scheduled for Easter Monday lunchtime, fewer than 48 hours later.

Today is the quick turnaround rematch from the home meeting at the Bridge; the first action of the second half of the season is against a team we played just 31 days ago.

Southampton's last eight games have included one win and five defeats, including the 1-3 at Chelsea. Jose Mourinho turned that game around after Saints took the lead, switching to two upfront and overwhelming the visitors. The final score could have been a lot higher.


**Tactical Brief**

David Luiz is suspended after receiving his fifth yellow of the season in the victory over Liverpool, while Frank Lampard is injured and Branislav Ivanovic doubtful. Midfielder Ramires is available after his one-game ban.

Saints' midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is back after suspension at the weekend but goalie Artur Boruc, midfielder Victor Wanyama and forward Guly do Prado remain sidelined. Another attacker, Dani Osvaldo, has been ill recently.

In the success against Liverpool Chelsea played a similar high pressing game to the first 45 minutes against Swansea, a side that also likes to build from the back.

Interesting to see lessons Pochettino has drawn from our recent encounter and the 4-4-2 deployment that changed the game. It is the first experience of Christmas period football for the Argentinean. Many a manager has come a cropper during the intense schedule without the winter break to which they are accustomed.

Pochettino likes his side to play as much as possible in the opponent's half, all his full-backs playing like wingers and ready to receive the ball as soon as possible. Excelling in the no.10 role in the middle, captain Adam Lallana is growing in confidence and influence, and looks a yard faster in the mind and the legs than a year ago.

When their high pressing game fails Southampton will do almost anything to nip opposition attacks in the bud and they give away a hefty number of fouls. Sometimes under pressure and on the back foot they lose their collective spirit and play like strangers.

A goal down in the first minute after Michael Essien's errant back-pass during our recent encounter at the Bridge, Chelsea switched to 4-4-2 at half-time. Saints were unable to adapt to the additional threat upfront. Other sides, including Spurs at St Mary's, have started with two up and enjoyed success.

Chelsea Academy graduate Jack Cork has been figuring alongside the equally combative Schneiderlin or James Ward-Prowse in the south coast side's deep-lying midfield during Wanyama's absence. Saints have conceded nine goals in the five-and-a-half games since the much-cautioned former Celtic player went off against Aston Villa.

Southampton with a dangerous delivery and Cech elects to punch clear.

43
Cork had earlier made a superb tackle on Ramires.

43
Great work from Torres again to trick his man but his delivery is weak.

43
Southampton corner. Ball took a little nick off Cahill.

42
Great approach play from Southampton but Ramirez's shot is blocked.

40
CHANCE! Schurrle and Hazard want too much time inside the area and Southampton clear.

38
Really entertaining game. Southampton with more of the ball but Chelsea look dangerous in the break.

36
CHANCE! What a run by Ramires and when he approaches the edge of the area Davis is able to flick it over for a corner.

34
Mikel gives the ball away to Lallana. Ramirez then fouls.

33
Chambers's ball to Rodriguez is long this time. They are trying that diagonal pass at every available opportunity at the moment.

31
Schneiderlin playing an important part in front of the Southampton back four. Mikel concedes a foul.

31
Ramirez from distance but that won't be troubling Cech. Over.

30
Shaw down the left will get Southampton going again. Lallana looking for little pockets off the strikers.

28
CHANCE! Chambers leaves Cole for dead and when he cuts back for Lallana his shot is blocked again.

26
Hazard with a lovely piece of play but Davis is quick off his line again.

25
CHANCE! All Southampton at the moment. Ramirez with a lovely ball to Rodriguez but he can't bring it down quickly enough. Cole clears.

23
That's better. Mata this time wins a free-kick.

22
Chelsea look for Mata but he needs the ball into feet rather than in the air.

22
Excellent play down the right by Chambers but Cole intervenes and plays it back to Cech to clear.

20
CHANCE! Torres again. He breezes past two Southampton defenders but his shot is high and wide.

20
Lovren appears to have got over his early knock as well.

20
Ramires concedes a free-kick. Southampton on top now.

18
Lallana looking more lively now. Chambers looks for Rodriguez but his delivery is long.

17
CHANCE! Lallana does brilliantly inside the area but it's a great block by Cole.

16
Lovren looking for the long ball towards Ramirez but Terry is coping well at the moment.

14
Ramires thinks he is clean through after a lovely ball from Torres but Davis is alert and clears.

13
Game a little scrappy. Stoppages haven't helped.

12
Azpilicueta appears to have a problem with his back and is making his way off the pitch.

11
Cork catches Hazard but it was neat play by Chelsea in the build up. Ramires did particularly well.

10
Chelsea using the ball far better in the early part of this one. Roy Hodgson is here. Few players looking for a World Cup spot.

9
Lovren is back on but will need to be monitored.

8
Lovren is now being helped off. Southampton get us started again with a goal kick.

7
Lovren is still down. Hopefully he will be ok. Southampton will certainly need him.

6
Concern at the moment on the pitch. Lovren is down with a face injury.

5
CHANCE! Southampton fail to clear the corner and Schurrle fires wide.

4
Torres looking really lively early on. This time down the right and he claims another corner for his side.

3
CHANCE! Southampton give the ball away and Torres does superbly to beat his marker but his shot is deflected wide.

2
CHANCE! Southampton fail to clear properly. Torres is caught in two minds and pokes wide.

1
Cole looks long for Torres but Lovren is on hand to clear.

The suggestion that Mata has a poor work ethic or doesn't offer enough is harsh. The guy has won us matches in the past almost single handily. 

Basically, if Mourinho made it about purely footballing reasons (I.e. ""Oscar fits my system better"") rather than bringing personal matter in to it (suggesting he doesn't work hard enough etc) I'd find it all more understandable.

I think there is still a market for first class travel. However, I also feel that Virgin have over-specified first class provision on some of their trains.

As for the queen bringing in more money than £36 million I would dispute that but her cost is far more than £36 million. £36 million is her personal grant, all maintenance of her multiple palaces, her massive security and thousands of other associated costs is covered by other grants from the government some of the largest of which are never fully exposed.

The money raised from the estates never actually belonged to the Queen. The crown estates have not been owned by any monarch since [1760](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate).

The royal residences bring in less than 1% of the country's tourism revenues so any tourism benefit is purely conjecture as it's impossible to calculate and almost definitely grossly over estimated.

Her single speech in world war 2 to wartime children was both not particularly remarkable aand hypocritical as she didn't evacuate to canada as the lords recommended.

The royal family were the first politicians, they are more than capable of spending as much as they like with little scrutiny. For example look at how long the expenses scandal went on before people noticed, MPs were massively increasing their pay through backdoors.

Given the prevailing spirit of hard working families, privatisation and boosting the economy, why not privatise the lot. The land assets, the other fixed assets of gold, art etc and the working sales force of HMTQ and her various offspring?


It's very easy to sell off public land and building assets, we have done it many times over the last few decades. There are numerous infrastructure funds looking for prime real-estate and swathes of Scotland they can use to dodge tax. If they are indeed bringing in many billions of £ in to the UK then give them a cut - good luck to them. They can use this to promote 'Brand Windsor' every time they seal a new BAe Systems deal say 2% goes to the company.

Indeed with a salesforce like they have, portfolio managers to work all the all the money, land and 'special assets' they wouldn't be a million miles away from a Specialist Investment Fund. They could also set up in one of the countries they 'rule' like the Bahamas. It's perfect.

true,iomex,null,null,"I agree, a new rail line through the middle of the country would be a very good thing. The major problems with the UK rail network at the moment seem to stem from it's age and inherited neglect from the 70's/80's. 

A new rail line wouldn't have these problems, and could even run a profit as you wouldn't be spending a huge amount on maintenance. As you would use pretty much uniform rolling stock, you can use metro-style platform edge doors to prevent costly platform suicides. New stations would be better designed, more capacious, more comfortable, and would integrate with local transport services in a better way.

However, I find it difficult to digest the cost. I have little faith in the UK to undertake any major construction project at under triple the original budget. Budget management in general seems to be pretty poor in this country - I wouldn't disagree with a 1p per litre tag on fuel duty to pay for rail infrastructure projects, but this would spiral higher and higher and would end up paying for London Underground running costs. 

There is also a distribution-of-wealth issue as well. I have no real gripe with spending on a London-Birmingham corridor as this is clearly one of the busiest rail corridors, but it does feel like other parts of the country are forgotten about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's two main types of property ownership in the UK:

* Freehold - The most common, this means you own the property and the land it stands on.

* Leasehold - This means you own the property, but not the land it stands on. The land belongs to someone else and you are temporarily renting it. When the lease ends, the land and the property on it automatically returns to the ownership of the leaseholder.

I'm assuming in your case your property is definitely leasehold OP? When the lease ends, you have to renegotiate it with the lease owner, which will probably be for another 99 years, or maybe even more. This can cost quite a few thousand pounds, however the leaseholder legally has to accept to renegotiate with you, and legally can't charge you an extortionate fee, it has to be a reasonable fee.

No you didn't make me look like a tit at all, like I said there was no need for me to respond because every point you raised I've already addressed.

This is really not worth my time but I'll tell you what lets run through it shall we?

&gt; Why is it needless?

Because having two threads with opposing views means a lack of discussion rather than having one thread with the entire argument on it. I've already said this in my previous comment.

&gt; Maybe they are making a new thread to get their feelings/comments on the matter more views, create new discussion.

The original thread was already on the front page of the subreddit, thats about as visible as you can get on this subreddit. As I've already said having two threads with opposing threads creates far less discussion than simply having the debate on the original thread.

&gt; Stop being such a jobsworth and get on with it.

I'm simply making a complaint about these kinds of threads, as I've already said people need to stop making them each time someone makes the slightest bit of criticism, It's simply a way for OP to criticize people on another thread without having to voice their argument directly. What was meant to be a passing comment has turned into a debate by conversing with people such as yourself, so I guess you could say I did get on with it.

&gt;It's a forum, forums contain THREADS.

Yes but creating redundant threads covering the same issue, is often considered bad manners. I've already explained why it would be considered bad manners in both this comment and the previous one.

&gt; Grow up lad, 'for fuck sake.'

This is kind of a contradictory statement, because on one hand you tell me to grow up, yet on the other you keep repeating the phrase I said ""For fuck sake"" because you think that repeating what I said as a statement against me is some amazing put down, like a teenager who thinks he is super edgy.

No, you extend your lease.

I myself live in a leasehold flat with two other flats that are also leasehold, as our freeholder is a pain in the arse ( our flat and the flat below for example both have room for large roof terraces and she won't allow it ) we're grouping together at present to buy the freeholder out which we can do legally without her consent.

and just to be clear, the freeholder would expect to be paid some significant proportion of the value of the property for extending the lease.

Plus losing that kind of money even *with* Champions League revenue means that you're in serious danger if you miss out for a season or two.

If you're a club losing £30m a year before transfer spending then you're only solvent for as long as you've got an owner who is prepared to continually meet that kind of shortfall. It's nice to have a financial safety net like Abramovic but he's not going to be there forever.

These magical companion stuff is a little stupid as well. Clara's a great companion but I'm not bothered with all this 'There's a billion of her helping the Doctor' stuff. The DoctorDonna storyline I can tolerate, it was only slightly referenced and wasn't a massive thing.

I completely agree with the sonic screwdriver argument. *The Power of Three* was a great story that was ruined by its stupid ending, the Doctor just waved his sonic at a screen and the world was saved! It should be restricted to one use per episode, and there should be more moments where the Doctor could easily fix something with the sonic, but has lost it for some reason.

She genuinely complains that people don't shop at ""ethical"" supermarkets (which she defines as ""Waitrose, Ocado and M&amp;S, Co-Op if absolutely desperate""), and refuses to accept that some people can't afford to, despite having lived in a poor, working-class environment until she was 30. She thinks I only do so because I am a student and only have a part-time job (I have pointed out that even I get paid more than I would if I were on the dole, but to no avail). She genuinely refuses to shop at Tescos, even if desperate, due to the fact that when she used to shop there (about a decade ago), the manager was slightly rude, and didn't organise the store he was in charge of the way she recommended, or would have preferred.

She is a middle-aged, Daily Mail-reading, snob. Oh, and she's both been a housewife for the last two decades and also one of these people who complain about other people not ""getting off their bums and working"".  She complains about not having any money, but doesn't want to cut down on the thousands of pounds they spend on holidays every year, shop at a cheaper supermarket, or, as mentioned, get a job, citing my dad's high-pressure job as the reason (to minimise his stress, he needs to come back to a sparkling clean house every day and get away from it all very frequently, apparently, which is fine, but it only actually takes her a couple of hours a day to do that, and the rest of the time is spent doing things to occupy herself, most of which cost a lot of money, like Pilates and yoga classes, and learning Italian simply to show off in posh restaurants; also, I imagine a second income could probably help his stress levels quite a bit, and he might even need less holidays).

And, if I point ANY of this out, it's my fault that they have ""no"" (read: more than most people) money, because they spent a shit-ton on sending me to private school for 12 years (where I had no friends, was bullied, achieved aggressively average grades, begged to be put in a normal school where there were more than 10 kids per year, and hated every second of my existence), as if I did it maliciously in some way.

1. Drink as much water as you can cram down your throat before bed. Like you should feel like the water will make you throw up. 

2. Make a cheese toastie but forget to eat it, or at least pass out half way through. Which leads me on to 

3. Pass out somewhere uncomfortable. It's important that it's just comfortable enough to sleep when drunk but not sleep well enough to actually feel rested and when you begin to sober up the uncomfortableness will wake you up. I find an armchair is optimal as it minimises room spin. 

4. Wake up at around 5am, at this point you will feel horrendous. Your bladder is full, your back is aching, you are dehydrated, you may well have a stinking head ache and feel nausea. 

5. Have a bite of that cheese toastie, go for a piss, drink more water and then go to bed and get good and comfy. 

6. Sleep for as long as you can. Sleep until mid afternoon. Early evening if at all possible. 

7. Sports drinks and fresh air. Stand outside and breath deep, take some pain killers and maybe take a nap to wait for them to kick in. 

8. Shower, brush your teeth. Make yourself clean. It's important to clean off that sense of shame.

As TedK04 said in this thread, I am also concerned about Benteke. He doesn't look interested, and isn't putting in the effort that he did last season. Whether that is a simple lack of form, or wanting to leave, I don't know.

I'm not sure exactly how much money Lambert has available to spend (Probably not much), but I think we need a creative midfielder as an absolute must. A clinical finisher would be useful up front as competition for Benteke, but that is just a luxury.

true,heidurzo,null,null,"&gt;Making her spending obscured is no less moral than people living on state benefits having obscured living expenses. The idea that any of us would be happy for all of our expenses to be viewed by the public is ridiculous.

She is the head of state, she is supposed to be morally superior to the average person. And being both head of state and receiving orders of magnitude above the average benefit recipient she has reduced right to privacy in this matter.

&gt; 1% of Britain's foreign tourism is roughly £200 million so i'm not sure what you're getting at with less than 1% being a bad thing.

The estimated cost of the Queen is [£202.4 million](http://www.republic.org.uk/valueformoneymyth.pdf) (bottom of page 4) so she is actually causing a loss there. Besides if we got rid of the queen those revenues wouldn't totally disappear but most of the costs would.

&gt;She has benefits diplomatically that outweigh tourism anyway. 

Source please. Why does she benefit diplomtically more than the hordes of diplomats which could be trained with the amount she costs.

&gt;The money raised from the crown lands makes a ridiculous amount of money for the UK. It's not owned by the Queen but was surrendered on the agreement that as the treasury pull in the profit, they must pay the monarchy for owning it. The idea that the queen is totally irrelevant to any income from crown estates is false.

The amount raised is substantial but the queen is totally irrelavent to it. She doesn't own it. She doesn't control how it operates. If the Queen were to go the revenues would still be generated. The agreement was made so we do have to pay her but not anywhere near as much as we do.

&gt;Finally, the idea you think her benefit is not calculable is incorrect. Many people have put forward estimates of the amount she makes the country and the answer is almost always that she is definitely good value.

Source please.

However at the heart of it all my main problem with the monarchy is not how much it costs.

They are looking at the palace because it is a magnificent work of art. The crowds are still there when the Queen is in Balmoral.

Not comparable. Obama actually does more than cutting ribbons and hosting banquets. Besides the US president has to personally pay for many things the queen doesn't.

Well I take issue with the beaches bit for a start: people travel from all over the world to surf at the gower: its tidal range lends itself to excellent surfing. Then there's the lake district; Ann Hathaways cottage; the amazing architecture of Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh; the cultural life of London and all its great nightlife.

Tactically I am starting to like Sherwood more and more. He is playing a hybrid 4-4-2/4-3-3 system with the top 3 of Lennon, Soldado, and Adebayor having the freedom of the top third and the movement between them is fantastic. In the middle Dembele and Capoue held the middle and Eriksen has been set free he can drift around the park finding space and passes and it really showed today he set up the first and scored the second (drifting in behind Valencia).

At this point there are a few options. Since the article clearly states that Jose says we have no intention to sell Juan, we could 1.) keep him and basically keep up with this inconsistent play time and frustration. 2.) Mata could miraculously gel to Jose's tactics and become a first team winger, or 3.) we sell or trade. 

The first option is a poor one because it's obvious Juan is getting fed up with the time he's being offered and he honestly deserves to be playing week in week out. The second option is what we all want, but seeing as though Hazard is currently in god-mode and Willian is settling in quite well, I doubt this will happen. And now we come to it, the final option, the one we've been dreading but can't ignore either. We sell mata so a club outside of the premier league (Maybe League 1 or the Bundesliga). All we can do is hope for a high transfer price and use the money to buy a proper striker, maybe we could even work out for a trade (Mata for a striker plus cash).

Kane was there to harass the back line and disrupt their attack. We had our backs against the wall and all that was required was a bit of energy up front. It's also worth not tiring Soldado out too much as Adebayor is now injured.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;NHS funding doubled between 1997 and 2010 under Labour

Spending increased to about two thirds of the French and German health budget. The NHS has always been massively underfunded. 

As you point out, the modest extra spending wasn't even very well targeted. Add in the billions wasted on NPfIT and it's a wonder that the NHS manages to deliver outcomes that are at least average for the developed world. 

&gt;private interests work very well in both the French and German heath systems

Private sector provision works well in France, and acceptably well in Germany. Private sector provision will never work in the UK. We need to move away from this model.

&gt;which are both consistently ranked amongst the best in the world 

Sweden does much better for less money. The key difference with the Swedish system is that it's very decentralised. We would do well to copy this in the UK, though people would complain about postcode lotteries.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"A 10% deposit is the minimum you would need for a mortgage unless you are going to use one of the new government backed schemes, they require a 5% deposit and either provide an equity loan from the government (that you have to repay alongside a mortgage) or the government would guarantee a 95% mortgage for you.

The most important thing for you is going to be your salary. Lenders rarely lend above 4x salary, 5x if you're lucky. For you that means you're probably only going to be able to borrow £60,000 at an absolute maximum, are there properties available for that cost in your area? This is why most people don't buy when they're single, they purchase with a partner that greatly increases the amount a bank will lend. Also, borrowing the maximum available when you're earning just above minimum wage can be very risky. Owning a home is *expensive*, you can spend thousands in a year just dealing with things that can (and do) go wrong.

&gt; What time frame should I give myself to get a house - 3 years? 5 years? Or would it be more beneficial to rent for now?

That depends, it's a decision only you can make. Personally I would recommend that you remain rent free for as long as possible, as once you enter into renting you're going to greatly reduce your savings potential and on such a low salary you're going to probably hit pay cheque to pay cheque living... You're on barely above minimum wage, trying to be independent on that salary is unrealistic. I left my parents home when I was 19 and moved into a rented flat, and although the freedom was amazing (and I was lucky that I had a very good job) if I could go back I would remain living with my parents, just because the amount you can save when living with parents vs. living alone is crazy.

I would be asking what your salary progression opportunities are like, do you expect regular salary increases, or do you expect to remain on sub £20k for the next 10 years? Do you plan to remain single, or would you like to settle down with a partner? Right now I think if you do want to move out, your only option (that would give you some ability to save) is renting a room in a shared house. Independent living on minimum wage is unrealistic unless you make huge long term sacrifices.

true,artfully_riced,null,null,"To focus on one example (involvement of politicians in recent protests/violence); from p4-5 of the [Proposed Agreement](http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/haass.pdf) from the 31st Dec posted elsewhere on this board (bolding mine):

&gt;We also accept that there is a particular responsibility for elected representatives to uphold decisions made by any body that has the lawful authority to make determinations in relation to parades, select commemorations, and related protests. We therefore commit to acquiescing to and upholding any such determinations, regardless of whether they reflect our own personal preferences or the wishes of the communities we represent, and to supporting the police and the criminal justice system in enforcing such determinations. **We agree that this includes the responsibility to call on others to act in the same way. We recognise that the only legitimate means to challenge such determinations are those set out below.**

Though they offered decent-sounding leadership-based [explanations](http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/politicians-defend-roles-in-flag-protests-1-4581211) (ignoring dodgy stat claim), unionist politicians inciting and (particularly) attending illegal protests without actively 'calling on others' (protesters) to stop attending them would violate the bolded directive. 

So in the (very) hypothetical scenario in which all parties agreed to uphold it, would our society be any more peaceful? 

According to Peter Robinson, undermining the DUP was a [major motivation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20917786) for protest organisers, which doesn't suggest that different actions by unionist politicians would've had much effect.  A [poll](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21331212) shows that by Jan 2013 ~half of unionists polled wanted them to stop, and of those that did, either none mentioned politician's actions as a reason, or that wasn't considered a viable answer by the pollsters. 

So there's no evidence I can see that protesters would've been influenced by politicians pointing out that their protests were illegal and that they shouldn't be holding them, but there doesn't seem to be anything (polls, whatever) that directly investigated that question. To me, a more likely scenario seems to be bluebottled's - that any kind of anti-flag-protest noise from unionist politicians would leave them open to losing support not just from hardliners but also from huge segments of their base (on the flag issue, by Sept 2013 [~1/3](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/belfast-telegraph-poll-2013-poles-apart-on-thorny-issue-of-flagflying-29581711.html) of unionists - and ~1/5 of 'other' and 'none' - thought that all councils should be *required* to fly the union flag *every* day).

**tl;dr:** I dunno. What a mess, eh? Maybe an agreement would pull the general opinion more towards compromise, but the big problem seems to be that on this one issue that I've focussed on in this post, a Haass agreement would've been more-or-less irrelevant - because of a lack of grassroot support, though, not because politicians weren't involved in any recent trouble. I guess public reaction to the lack of agreement will become clearer soon when we get more details of who rejected/accepted what and what people think about that. 

EDIT: then again, as the position of the unionist parties is probably not out of step with the 1/3 unionts who think that all councils should be required to fly the union flag every day, that's probably not a valid stat to show their lack of grassroot support on the issue.",0,1388612952,null,0,1388619561,0,ceezm5v,t3_1u5jvk,t1_ceezm5v,t3_1u5jvk,null,1427899985,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

I feel it's more the government that deserves the ire, for running the franchising schemes in such a completely idiotic way!  I've been travelling by train over the last few days; despite ""engineering work"", floods, foul weather, and huge numbers of people travelling for the New Year, it's mostly gone remarkably smoothly (and when it hasn't, the situation has been explained clearly, effective steps have been taken to resolve the problems, and all the staff have been suitably apologetic and helpful).

I've actually been rather *impressed* by FGW, of all companies: I found their Android smartphone app a couple of weeks ago. It has a built-in journey planner that, at a glance, tells you which platform you need to go to, which seat you're reserved in, how long you have to get there, whether your train is running on time (or how long it's delayed by). It's genuinely a really nice piece of software that makes travelling by train much easier.

On the other hand FGW are still running ancient, decrepit and overcrowded trains, etc. etc., but I don't feel like the train companies deserve to be vilified as totally and irretrievably evil and corrupt. I think that if DfT took a good, long, hard look at the franchising system and made a few tweaks here and there, things would look up.

I guess the only other alternative would be to set up publicly-owned companies like East Coast and Network Rail to run all of the franchises.

In terms of benefits, there is no culture among Bulgarians to rely on government assistance for anything. We have been taught to help each other via other means - e.g. the extended family can look after children, lend money, recommend jobs, etc. I am a bit concerned about the gypsies - they have shown little desire to integrate with the Bulgarian society, contribute or work here, so I guess it is possible some might view it as an opportunity to scourge off a richer country. I think the numbers will be small, as it takes a fair amount of initiative and education to plan this out - sort out travel documents, book flights, etc.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; there are much more egregious examples of inherited wealth and inequality

Out of interest, do you have an example to hand?

&gt; And the living monarchy confers substantially greater benefits to society (tourism, diplomacy) than any of the other cases. 

The problem there is that many countries don't have a monarchy and yet do OK on the tourism front. Further 'current royal' sites visited by tourists don't make it in the top 20 apart from, so far as I know, the Tower of London. And that's not really specifically tied to the current monarch. The UK has millennia of history scattered about the place, and I really don't think the tourists would stop coming specifically because the monarchy is no more. On the contrary, I have to wonder how much revenue would be generated from a permanent and wider opening on Buckingham Palace instead of the ~6 weeks of select few rooms that currently takes place.

On the diplomacy front, I can grant that to an extent. However: who is it that the royals are doing diplomacy with? Certainly not that many other royal families, but rather heads of state etc. Why then could the UK not do something similar - why would it be detrimental for us?

&gt; it's one of the last such inequalities to tackle in my book

Why would the case most directly tied to the public and the nation be your last choice?

&gt; Couple any legislation to eliminate the monarchy with a 100% inheritance tax

I really don't think they're entirely the same, or directly comparable. I'll grant that royal land etc. and income from that is very muddled and I don't claim to be 'up' on that side of things at all. But much of the royal 'inheritance' is surely tied up with status?

I am not sure here, you can certainly notice in some places the impact of polish influxes and before that influxes from other places. I think what people have realised from society point of view is that it doesn't really detract much so long as integration is good. Which I think for the majority of Polish workers it has been good.

&gt; In terms of benefits, there is no culture among Bulgarians to rely on government assistance for anything

Yeah I don't really fear the benefit issue myself; why would you come here to work, then not work. Unless they bring loads of kids they'll make more working than on benefits. And most of the Polish people I've met (I think they've made a good testcase) seem to be very hard working people.

&gt; I am a bit concerned about the gypsies

We have Romanian gypsies here at the moment, and I would argue they are already an issue, they do little to integrate and seem to come here simply to beg on the streets. Most disconcertingly making their kids beg too whilst they should be in school. Of course I don't imagine the Romanian gypsies to be a good stereotype for the average Romanian worker.

3 wins in TWENTY GAMES this season. 1 in our last ELEVEN. That is so bad it's indescribable. Seriously, there are insufficient superlatives in the English language to fully convey how bad that is.

I think the brutal injuries we have suffered are partially to blame, but we are doing so badly I don't think you can lay all the blame on them. I think it is mostly Allardyce, and that's why that Fat Fuck needs to go A.S.A.P.

I know people always say 'teams are too quick to sack managers nowadays' but that doesn't apply here:

* Allardyce has had 2 and half years, and vast amounts of cash to build a side and get them to gel (this isn't the Di Canio situation of sacking after 12 games, Allardyce has had plenty of time and resources, and squandered it all)

* He's had twenty games this season, so plenty of time to turn things around, and all we've done is get worse and worse. This is the worst WHU team I've ever seen, and I'm 17 so I witnessed the Roeder and Grant shambles. This team is worse than those!

I think our relegation (it's too late now, its over. It's not a relegation battle, just look at the players there's no fight there) is due to a horrible run of injuries, combined with truly awful management. Allardyce's decisions have been ~~fucking demented~~ odd, let's look at a few of them, but there are plenty more:

* Today, when Noble was injured he brought on Rat, a left back, not one of the three wingers we had on the bench that could go out wide, with Diame playing in the middle. He brought on a left back, in a game he himself described as 'must win'

* His perserverance with the 4-6-0 when it clearly was not working, earlier in the season. It worked once against Spurs, and that was that. It was useless but he stuck with it for way too long, and potentially cost us a lot of points.

* His refusal to drop Nolan throughout the entire season, even though he is abysmal. After his ban is up for today's disgrace he'll be back as captain and starting every game, even though he does virtually nothing for the team except whine at refs.

* Spunking all of our money on Carroll. I don't dislike Carroll, but he's very injury prone and 7 goals in 24 games (his record last season) was desperately mediocre. Not worth the £15+million we payed, not even close

* His overly defensive tactics, like refusal to play two strikers (even though we are a crossing team, so more bodies in the box makes sense) and his 'hold on for the 1-0' mentally which always results in us sitting back after taking the lead, inviting pressure on and ultimately losing. This happened in ALL of our last three games and also against Norwich earlier in the season if I remember rightly.

* The fact that he signs so many old players: Rat, J Cole, Downing, Nolan, Collins, Diarra, Demel, Jussi (and possibly Heitinga) were all ~30 or older when he signed them. There's nothing wrong with a bit of experience in a team, but you shouldn't BUILD YOUR TEAM AROUND players that are in decline and who's bodies will be getting weaker.

* NOT BUYING A BACKUP STRIKER IN THE SUMMER HOLY SHIT YOU CAN'T TOTALLY RELY ON JUST CARROLL, HE WAS INJURY PRONE IN THE PAST SURELY THAT FAT FUCK COULDN'T HAVE JUST *HOPED* HE WASN'T GOING TO GET INJURED, FUCK ME DID HE REALLY THINK THAT MAIGA, WHO SCORED LIKE 4 GOALS LAST SEASON WOULD BE AN ADEQUATE BACKUP!?

From what I understand a lot of my friends had similar experiences finding about Doctor Who. Once I heard about it I in turn told all of my friends and talked about it all the time on facebook turning several others (they continued to do the same)

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"I actually think it is Everton.  I haven't watched them recently, however, so I could be misinformed here, but they play scarily good football when they are on.  Martinez has them playing incredibly fluidly on the attack, and they've been very solid at the back as well.

Spurs are still unconvincing to me, despite their recent uptick in form under Sherwood.  Watching them play United today they were poor at times.  Their talented attacking players (Eriksen, Soldado, Adebayor's good side) link up well on attack, but their slightly less-skilled attacking players (Chadli, Dembele, Lennon) do not.  Today their ""tier two"" attackers didn't anticipate runs well, didn't make good runs, and had generally bad decision-making in the final third.  At the back, there were massive communication issues with tagging off United attackers.  Also, they looked shaky playing out of the back at times as well.  And Sherwood's subs at the end were only slightly better than Rodgers bringing in Brad Smith.

I don't think Tim Sherwood is the right coach to work out these issues.  I think that AVB's tactical discipline is already fading from the side, in a bad way, and that Spurs will struggle tactically in the latter half of the season.  Add to that their eight new players, whom Sherwood will have to try to integrate, and I feel that they will struggle.

United are in better shape than Spurs, but injuries in pretty much any position aside from winger and maybe CB will hurt them.  They were incredibly unimaginative in their play today: get it out wide, bad cross, cross blocked, bad cross, good cross with no one to receive it, etc. etc.  Moyes made changes to go for the win at the end, but they didn't exactly make sense from a tactical standpoint.  He just put on a lot of attackers (Kagawa, Valencia to RB for Smalling, Young, Chicharito) and had Rooney drop deep to be playmaker.  It seemed like he was going for a ""fuck discipline, go 110% balls to the wall for the win"", which can work sometimes, but United's players weren't motivated or skilled enough today to pull it off.  I don't think Moyes has enough tactical nous or good enough man management to try to employ that kind of game-changing strategy, and I don't think the strategy he starts games with works as often as it needs to for a top-four side.

Honestly, United right now are very similar to us, except they have less talent up top, less talent in the midfield- and much better crossing wingers.  But the crossing game looks entirely lackluster, so I'm content with that.

**TL;DR**  Everton are the real threat.  Spurs have tactical and personnel issues.  United are in a real rut, and Moyes is not the manager to get them out of it.",0,1388618943,null,0,false,0,cef1xen,t3_1u6pf4,t1_cef1xen,t3_1u6pf4,null,1427898844,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I recommend you go on a five year fixed rate mortgage as interest rates will rise probably in the next 1-3 years which means on my mortgage a 1% rise would increase repayments by about £80 a month. View this [graph](http://www.economicshelp.org/images/macro-graphs/uk-base-rates-79-11.jpg) to see why it's a smart move doing the above.

I recommend you go and see a mortgage advisor, some if not most do a free initial consultation where they will explain everything for you.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"Ok, personal experience only - IANAL:

When we bought our house it was leasehold. It meant that although we owned the house (well, OK the bank, but anyway), a company (on behalf of a major landowner, who in this area is usually the Duke of Westminster) actually owns the land that the house has been built on. We had a 999 years lease (our house is around 120 years old) and the ground rent payable annually was a staggering £1.50 per year. A couple of years ago, a house around the corner from us (literally on the next street, their garden backs onto ours) was repossessed for non-payment of ground rent (I think that they hadn't paid it in like 30years &amp; the owner rented it out &amp; neither she nor the tenants were paying the ground rent, but still eighty grand house gone for the sake of £1.50 per year!), we had a bit of a panic and bought the leasehold to our property (cost us something like £300, but it means that we can't have it repossessed unless we fail to pay the mortgage at least).

Obviously, because of the length of our lease, the expiry was a non-issue for us. However, we have a few friends who live on a much more modern estate, with much shorter leasehold periods. When selling their houses, if there is less time left until the lease expires than there would be in the terms of a prospective mortgage, most mortgage companies will refuse the loan and so it makes it harder to sell the house.

One of my friends (well, technically her Mum, but still) simply renegotiated a new 99 year lease period, and then sold it with no issues. Someone I know through my parents bought the leasehold and then sold the property as free-hold (no ground rent payable) - but their leasehold cost substantially more than ours did, was about a grand or something (Mum's friend, and I wasn't about to go into too much financial detail with her).

But basically, ASAIK, if your property is leasehold, then no, you don't own the land it is built on, and yes, you can theoretically lose your home. I don't believe that it happens often, I think the house round the corner from us was rare in the extreme, but it can still happen...

Later on, the peanuts disappeared. I could never understand why at the time, but now I know it's because people used to go for a piss and then return to the bar without washing their hands.

true,laerad,null,null,"&gt; I have to wonder how much revenue would be generated from a permanent and wider opening on Buckingham Palace instead of the ~6 weeks of select few rooms that currently takes place.

Personally, I have much less interest in history than living history, and I'm sure I'm not alone. I don't suggest all tourists would stop coming, but the British royal family is certainly the most famous in the world, and is widely adored outside of the UK as the royal birth etc. amply demonstrated. I don't purport to know how much it contributes to UK GDP, but I highly doubt it is zero.

&gt; Why then could the UK not do something similar - why would it be detrimental for us?

For a similar reason. People are strange and history / custom / circumstance have a strong power. The Queen is the only person in the world the US President in anyway shows deference to, for instance (as demonstrated in his visit). The reality is that an elected official doesn't have the same sense of circumstance as a monarch that reigns for extensive uninterrupted periods, and in some ways represents power we no longer actual possess, but in some circumstances causes her to be treated as though we did.

&gt; Why would the case most directly tied to the public and the nation be your last choice?

Because it's an insignificant sum, and I don't really care about it financially. Especially given the lack of clarity over the net effect on public finances.

&gt; I'll grant that royal land etc. and income from that is very muddled and I don't claim to be 'up' on that side of things at all. But much of the royal 'inheritance' is surely tied up with status? 

It's an inheritance. It may be enshrined in different law, but it is clearly an inheritance. You're talking about abolishing their inheritance; I'm talking about abolishing *everyone's*. That's much more interesting to me. Note, I didn't suggest it was ""entirely the same"", but the two are clearly related topics.

true,LandauTST,tardis,TARDIS,"Exactly. **During** the Time War. And when the Time War ended, so did he. As I said, that special form fulfilled his purpose and was old, so he regenerated. As far as being introduced as The Doctor in The Name of The Doctor, we didn't know who he was -exactly- or where he fit yet! We weren't supposed to! Like I said, we don't know his real name so it's not wrong to call him The Doctor GENERALLY speaking, but specifically speaking to pop a number on the line? NO. Again, it's not what he did that makes you feel lives up to the title, HE WOULDN'T EVEN GO TO WAR UNDER THE TITLE ""THE DOCTOR"". 

Why is that so hard for you to understand? He carried that title the whole time and fighting in a war does not live up to the title The Doctor in his eyes from the start. No matter how good his intentions were. No matter how great of a thing he did at the end, that form was SPECIFICALLY chosen to be different. A new form that would fight in the war with a different face and title. 

And yeah, 10 and 11 said he was The Doctor again, but he never called himself that OUTSIDE of generalities since a) we don't know his real name and b) He's not going to say/they're not going to credit him as ""The War Doctor, who is another form of The Doctor who picked up a different title for a new face in order to fight in the Time War."" No. Not to mention in The Night of The Doctor, he WAS credited as The War Doctor. In The Day of The Doctor, he was merely credited as The Doctor, again, only in the general sense of the name.

So maybe you weren't getting incarnations mixed up with how many times he went by ""The Doctor"". You're getting generalities and specifics mixed up. As well as your opinions with fact. It would be one things if the facts didn't make sense, but they completely do. It's not that you haven't heard a convincing argument, it's that you can't be convinced by anyone else since you've already convinced yourself how it should go.

Unless you are living in a hill fort with your Pictish tribe, everything about British culture comes from immigrants all the way back to ancient times, heck the [Picts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) were probably immigrants. This time the immigrants come from [a fantastic melting pot of cultures.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria)

Everything that's good about Britain has come about due to the centuries old melting pot culture on these islands (when it wasn't happening at the point of the sword that is). 

If not for the second world war and the large amounts of Italian PoW's that stayed on after the war, there'd be no fish and chip shops. Shops would still all close at 5pm were it not for Idi Amin kicking the Asians out in 72 and if not for the Irish, we'd all have very well built extensions and driveways.

We are the country we are today because of immigration. Bulgarian culture is amazingly diverse. I really recommend you learn about the countries the tabloids are so keen on scaremongering about.

Remember lads, we'll be fine as long as we don't let the French in. ;P

true,tclayson,english,Cambs,"Pay as much deposit as you can, this will get you a lower mortgage and better interest rates. 

Remember whatever savings you have about £2-10k is coming out for solicitors fees, agent fees, mortgage advisor, mortgage fees, survey, stamp duty (maybe), and probably more I can't remember. That will lower the amount you have for a deposit. 

Advice? From someone who has been there... Don't set a stupidly long mortgage term because it leaves you with more money each month. My gf and I went with a 30 year term when we could have afforded 25 or even 20. Looking back I wish we had squeezed ourselves a bit harder and have paid off more in the last year. We have hardly made a dent on the mortgage (its just interest really and not much of that either - we are paying more interest though because of the longer term). 

On the same lines think carefully about fixing your mortgage rate. We went with a 3 year fixed. Now my job has moved to London and we want to move but have 2 years left on the fixed term. Getting out of it will cost us about £3k in fees. You can get some great deals that you might want to fix for 3-5 Years, but think about your future. What are you going to be doing in 5 years time? If you're a family and you've got a stable long term job then great. But if you're young and single, or a couple thinking about starting a family or maybe you think you'd like to move around freely etc, just remember a fixed mortgage will be a barrier to doing this stuff.

2 years is a good fixing term. Not much can change in 2 years that means you can't wait out the term. 

Don't worry about not being able to afford it. I was always worried about stuff like ""What if I lose my job?"", ""What if I fall ill and can't work?"" etc. We pay about £5 a month for all sorts of life, illness and redundancy insurance. If you're not worried about being able to pay your rent then why would you worry about being able to pay for your mortgage? **Be sensible** and everything will go smoothly. 

Get a mortgage advisor, they'll let you know about all of this stuff. Get a good solicitor and they'll do all the legal stuff. It's a necessary cost and will really help you especially the first time. 

Lastly, just do it. It's a huge step, and the biggest loan/debt you'll ever take out, but frankly loads of people do it and it'll probably be more affordable than your current rent. If you don't have the money to do a good deal now, or get good interest rates then get a short fixed term or get on a variable rate and remortgage when you are in a better position. E.g. If you can save 20% of the property value in 2 years then get a 2 year fixed rate with a 5% deposit and remortgage in 2 years with your new 25% deposit.

- Dragging to select major milestones is good (eg: 5, 10, 15 on the mortgage term slider) but sliders for minor figures aren't a good experience. Allow users to edit the exact value alongside the option to use the slider, so those that want to be precise can be, just make it so clicking on the figure turns it into an input box (I think x-editable is compatible with bootstrap)

- Your ? pop-ups don't disappear when clicking elsewhere on the page, I have to click again on the ? to close them. Helpful extras like that don't need persistence, so making them disappear as easily as possible (clicking outside of them) is the preferred behaviour.

- As you're processing the data server side, you should consider generating a url people can share with the results pre-loaded. For example if someone is talking to their partner over skype or whatever, they can just paste the link to them and they can see the results too, so little data you could encode it and the URLs would remain short. Out of interest, why do you set the window location to #result after processing is complete?

- Perhaps have some default interest rates based on common LTVs, for example at the moment 5% is an obscene interest rate for someone with 20% deposit, but is expected for someone with a 5% deposit. Your site defaults to 5%, even when setting a deposit super high. If someone is clueless about mortgages (which is possible if they're on your site) they might not want to go through the hassle of finding mortgage offers themselves, giving pre-loaded rates (that are potentially what they'd see in real life) would be hugely helpful.

Four: Intelligent but often plays dumb, generally caring and good and very slow to anger. Often uses humor to diffuse tense situations. Kept companions for a wide variety of reasons, between them being forced on him to loneliness, to finding an awesome Robo-Dog. 

Nine: Angry but not violent. Very different from the other Doctors due to proximity to the Time War and the choices made during it, much less willing to compromise. Often yells when situations are not going according to plan. Seemed to keep companions to keep himself grounded.

Ten: Up front, very similar to Four. Intelligent and more than willing to show it off. Loves to show off how clever he is. Will do what he can to solve every problem through talking. Also carries every being he has failed to save on his shoulders, including the Daleks and Time Lords, and punishes himself for it. Seemed to keep companions because he was lonely.

Eleven: A mixture of Nine and Ten, Intelligent and Showy but much more quick to anger and willing to resort to less diplomatic solutions. The large time skip during Season 6 put him far from the Time War and much less hard on himself for it.

Accession to the EU has greatly improved many of the poorer countries (e.g. Poland) and now quite a few people who have immigrated here from them are now leaving to return to their countries of origin. It would be total mayhem if we were to do it for all countries at once but the EU method of slowly accepting new countries seems to work great.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1st - actually has nothing to with the doctor. William hartnells background story was amazing. 

2nd - was a setup for many actors to portray the doctor by using him as inspiration. 

3rd - haven't seen much of him but had some amazing stories

4th - my first doctor. To be honest doesn't hold as much appeal since I've discovered other doctors. 

5th - seemed like an amazingly caring guy. Willing to give everything for his companions. Most ""human"" in having to deal with the unexpected death of a companion. Yes I know other doctors lost companions but this one is the one that everyone remembers due to the shear shock of it. 

6th - brash attitude that many of the doctors have but he lays it on thick without being to... Well dickish. Also was amazing considering that the bbc was basically shitting on him. 

7th - chose to captain a sinking ship. People he was ""to goofy"" yet is honestly a classic version of a nuwho doctor, I'm looking at you tennant. 

8th - honestly his movie a minisode don't do this man justice. Listen to his audio dramas and you will see paul mcgann is one of the top 3 actors to play the doctor. 

War - come on its john hurt for godsake. Ok I'll say it I hated him in name of the doctor. This man shouldn't have been there. The ""war doctor"" the one that fought in the last time war should have been 8. That being said this man single handedly stole the anniversary special. This man LOVES the genre and you can tell he enjoyed himself. Tied for 2nd place with mcgann in top 3 doctors. 

9th - well if it wasn't for him I don't think we'd have nuwho. He was serious and callous and seemed hard for him ""to be funny"" but had been hilliarious at times he shouldn't have been. Reminds me of a mix of mcgann and hartnell. While I don't like his ideology on not returning I do understand and respect it.  

10th - I'll be perfectly clear has some of the best written episodes but I didn't particularly care for him.   It may just be because I grew up with classic who. For me I'll just take his maybe 10 stories I like (3 of which are in my top 10 favorites of all who including new classic and audio dramas) and throw away the rest. 

11th - ok Matt smith is by far my favorite doctor. And certainly not for his stories. He has been plague with stale and boring story lines or ones that either seem to similar to others during his tenure. What he does have is the most character development and the most personal acting range. He (like mentioned earlier) seems to have channeled troughton so much so that sometimes I think he studied with him.  Aside from the troughton goofiness you should really watch rings in hd. When he's giving the stern talking to to the parasite god you can actually see that he is crying. No it's not a fake tear you can watch them run down his cheeks halfway through the scene. Also during scenes like this you don't realize matt smith was 28/29 years old with little experience before doctor who. He comes across as a well seasoned actor, no strike that, you actually believe if the doctor was real and as old and wise this is who he would be. 

Here is the link for that clip.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"&gt; At least a portion of your monthly payments are going into a resalable asset.

A tiny tiny portion at the start of a mortgage.

A mortgage is a long term commitment, a mortgage is terrible if taken short term and taking a mortgage short term is what happens when you think that renting money is ""wasting money"" and a compelling reason for buying is ""I don't want to waste money on rent!"". 

There are many situations where you can take on a mortgage and lose out vs. if you had remained renting, for example:

- Your company relocates to a new part of the country and you're forced to sell after 2 years of ownership

- Your spouse loses their job within a few years of taking the mortgage, you lose the affordability and have to sell the house

- The property becomes unsuitable for your needs and you must sell

If you take a mortgage and have to sell within a couple of years, you'll end up worse off than where you would be if you had rented. When someone is buying only (or mainly) because they ""don't want to waste money on rent"" they will almost always end up in that situation, because house buying requires a commitment to stability.

I'm not saying buying is bad or anything, just that short term mortgages suck and when a person is focused on the short term... they set themselves up for failure. ",0,1388626316,null,0,false,0,cef4p7a,t3_1u6qdk,t1_cef4p7a,t1_cef48j5,null,1427897552,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,landryraccoon,null,null,"The timeline is consistent in either case. It's basically a temporal feedback look. At every step, both timelines are self consistent. The fundamental mistake you're making is that causality as it exists in this universe doesn't exist in the Doctor Who universe. Here's the timeline the show portrays:

- The moment shows Doctor #8 what his future selves will be like if he destroys Gallifrey and the Daleks. This is key. Doctors 10 and 11 in the show come from that timeline.
- Doctors 10 and 11 from the future timeline interfere with Doctor #8s decision so that he does NOT destroy Gallifrey. However, because of the crossed time-streams he loses his memory of those events and because Gallifrey is gone, he assumes he destroyed it (since the last thing he remembers is stealing the Moment and intending to destroy the Time Lords). The disappearance of Gallifrey and the Daleks is consistent with the idea that the Doctor killed them all, even though that's not what actually happened.
- Since Doctor #8 believes he destroyed Gallifrey, his future selves do as well, until the timelines converge in Day of the Doctor, at which point Doctor #11 regains his memory of the events.

At no point in the timeline is there a paradox. Everything is self consistent. The moment never had to be used to destroy the Time Lords. The ONLY fact that has to remain constant in all the timelines is that Doctor #8 believes that he destroyed the Time Lords, whether he did or not, which was addressed.

I do think that they could have done something better with that - for example, if they dropped a line saying something like ""Interacting with the Moment interferes with the memory of living beings so it's hard to retain it"".

I have a friend who has been unemployed for a year, since he graduated from college with a foundation degree in Fine Art.

I have a cousin who's just started looking for another job since his temp position at a supermarket has ended.

My friend is definitely depressed, he's utterly isolated whenever me or my other grad friends are away; he and his family have a rocky relationship and spends all of his time in his room on the computer.

My cousin either buries himself in videogames or spends all of his time with his girlfriend. He and his mother have had serious fallings out and almost came to blows because she's so desperately pushing him into finding employment which, quite frankly, may never be there for him. I believe he also meets the criteria for some kind of depression.

I'm pretty sure that my friend has some sort of mental illness -- I don't know what, because I'm not a psychiatrist. My cousin has some mild form of Autism (not Aspergers), but again, I don't know too much about it.

Why is this worth mentioning? 

Because both of these people went through YEARS of schooling, acutely aware that they didn't meet the bog standard measure of potential, both spent their school years in special groups and the lowest academic sets. 

Why should people who spend their lives, incessantly reminded that they are at the bottom of the pile expect anything but the worst life has to offer? And even then, to come out with NOTHING -- no job, no dignity?

On another note, my mother's friend emigrated to Florida over a decade ago. One of her sons was dyslexic and in the UK she was told her son would probably just scrape by. Over in the USA he became an honours student and is currently studying medicine. So it's not as if academic sets in the UK are a genuine reflection of potential anyway.",0,1388629563,null,0,false,0,cef5z64,t3_1u6y0a,t1_cef5z64,t3_1u6y0a,null,1427896882,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Keratome,null,null,"A match we needed to win for a firm push towards the top 4 , knowing that southampton/everton/newcastle dropped points earlier in the day. Manutd won 4 out of prev 4, at home with webb referreing  
Man Utd. without Rafael, V Persie , Spurs...We were without a lot more (verts paulinho,siggy,kaboul)  

Lloris  made crucial stops  esp 1 v 1 , came close on being called a penalty on young , off his line quickly to deal with the speedy wellbeck, good judgement for the most part   7.5/10   
Dawson played well today, crucial interceptions, cleared the line, guilty of loss of focus transiently after spurs scored 2nd, but during the last 20mins all hands on deck, did extremely well, marshalling forces 8/10  
Chiriches  also played very well today, read the game well, took few chances, first touch good, distribution good, tendency to drive/make runs into opponents half encouraging, also needs to keep focus on restart after spurs score  8/10  
Walker back from suspension, also played extremely well, shut down januzaj with strong physical play. He along with lennon kept evra busy defensively (defence not being evra's better skill) 8.5/10  
Rose couldnt get as far forward as normal, didnt get into the game until later, poor first touches initially, had to defend a lot of the left flank by himself, as eriksen drifted into a more central role, exploited against januzaj in second half, rose still lacking match fitness, got some defensive help later on when chadli came on , to be fair re match fitness, overextended at defensive duties , gets an A for effort, but 7/10 overall  
Capoue played very good , held the man utd midfield in check, hope that the reason for the substitution was forward thinking (upcoming games, rather than injury) , spurs defence looked good while he was there  7.5/10  
Benteleb  subbed on for capoue, took a few mins to get into the pace of the game/ his role, held on, few mistakes, also encouraging for the future 6.5/10  
Dembele another solid performance from him today , good work-rate , went another 90 mins (had to) 7/10  
Eriksen free-ranging forward play from eriksen, involved with a significant amt of attacks, defensively (really depends on the formation been played) helped more centrally rather than on the flank to help rose 8/10  
Lennon seems to have evra's number, needs to be able to finish, to give spurs that scoring option, his pace is tough to deal with defensively, has a decent relationship with walker, keeping lamela off the right wing at this time 7.5/10  
Ade it was the best of times , it was the worst of times, A for effort, good link up lay, very good header , getting some wings to rise above the defender head the ball back across the goal to open the scoring, sketchy injury, maybe precautionary substitution/ even tactical at 60 min mark prev discussed , would be a significant loss if not avail for FA Cup 8.5/10  
Soldado more and more impressed by his vision and ability to slot pinpoint passes , getting closer to scoring from open play, but crucial in setting up opportuntities for others 8/10  
Chadli  helped rose defensively on the flank, which was needed, did what was asked of today 7/10  
Kane subbed on for soldado to hold up play, did that very well esp booting the ball on an offside, seriously though lacks pace,control,first touch if one were to judge him on this game only, I don't think he is PL ready yet to be a go to scoring option at this time , i sincerely hope he proves me wrong 6/10   

webb : there were so many decisions that could have gone against spurs that didnt, added 5 mins for injury time, on another day in another era man utd could have had at least 2 PKs go their way , i would say all in all it was fair 6.5/10  

TS, same lopsided formation as last week except straight swap of capoue for paulinho , you would think that it shouldnt work , esp against a team that can attack on the flanks (januzaj/valencia)and up the middle (rooney). walker neutralised januzaj and capoue / dembele disrupted enough of man utd midfield. valencia dropped into RB later on in the game, and united offence boiled down to janzaj from the wing or rooney from deep (better him there than upfront). It worked because of effort and committment, the one time spurs ""switched off"" we conceded a goal.  

Spurs fans 8.5/10 those guys sang and sang the entire game, good on them , good for us  

Next rd, the top sides are expected to win , we face crystal palace then swansea the following week, should see a few of the first eleven players rested and hopefully the imminent return of verts , kaboul. Our away form is going good so far this year, just need to improve our home form. Its just past the halfway point and we are 2 pts from CL qualification , if you told me that at the beginning of the reason , i'd say sure, I'll take that...COYS !!!!!  

TLDR : 2pts from CL spot

Back in the early 90's I did warehouse work, street sweeping and emptying the bins, and it really wasn't so bad.

At that time, there wasn't a minimum wage as such, but all the temping agencies paid about the same rates ±£0.15p. 

I could pretty much guarantee back then that you'd be offered a full-time job within 6 - 12 months, if you just turned up every day on time and worked just reasonably conscientiously. I guess that got you on a higher rate of pay.

In the early 90's, these kinds of jobs were enough to pay your bills and rent and have a good bit of fun at the weekend. I'm pretty sure it was possible to put a little bit of money away even without trying.

The BBC did not want to make films based on the TV show, so these movies were NOT spinoffs and no characters owned by the BBC appeared in the movies. This meant there could not be a Doctor. Instead, there was a human with the last name Who who had a doctorate degree. Hence, he was explicitly ""Dr. Who.""

The very reason we have debate about ""people buying enough stuff"" is because money is created by debt and because economists tell us that a degree of inflation is necessary to best keep trade moving. 

Personally, I'm fine with an indolent economy, because I'd be glad if people had better opportunities to appreciate their families, the value of friendship and other things that money can't buy.

To do that fairly, however, we need to stop punishing those at the bottom of the pile - right now the economy is not just slow, but what economists call *stagnant*, so it's fucking ridiculous to be sanctioning those on the dole, when there clearly aren't enough jobs for them.

I earned more as a teenager, working weekend and summer jobs on the local market and on Sainsbury's checkouts, than adult minimum wage today. I've just fired up an inflation calculator, and it looks like my job at 16 paid the equivalent hourly rate to £8.50 or £9.50 today. 

That's inflation adjusted, though. The current rates of pay for under 18's and apprentices are *literally* and *unadjusted* less than I earned as a schoolboy in the 1980s, nearly 25 years ago, mowing lawns.

Whilst you can indeed now buy a powerful Android tablet for far less than a 8mhz/512kb Amiga back then, I doubt if time has been so kind to the price of a pint and a pasty, rent or petrol. Meanwhile, people around here say [""tough luck, that's adult wages""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1sq8y9/is_there_any_help_available_for_my_younger_brother/ce071i5?context=9).

true,[deleted],null,null,"yup, no digs money and they pay for my food, electricity and internet. never claimed any benefits and was given some money from my grandad which i've been speculating in cryptocurrency with recently.

im content-ish now with neeting, but at first i got pretty deeply depressed, used to beat myself up a lot for it and thought i was truely just useless scum. then at more or less my lowest point i volunteered somewhere for 4 days a week and worked pretty hard, they gave me a job soon after, they were grateful because i really did make the effort to be a good worker, i left to do a college course which turned out to be pretty useless, finished that then started neeting again.

not so bothered anymore about how people see me, and realised that the life i thought i should have been living (career, active social life etc) was kind of fed to me by the media and society in general, when actually i never really cared overly much for that stuff and am quite alright just being a reclusive hick, i think there is no point beating myself up over stuff because it doesnt help.

i'd rather not leech of my parents and would like to pay them back, but again it doesnt help to beat myself up over it (they dont seem to mind, i dont cost them much, do a lot of housework and my dad is the distant, workaholic type who spends any extra money on stupid shit anyway), would like to be financially independent, with any luck cryptocurrency will be the key to that, but if not, i do old crafts for fun anyway, blacksmithing, woodcrafts, bushcraft and such and could probably find a way of making money that way, im quite confident in myself now and i think i could find employment one way or the other.

i kind of made myself into quite a low maintenence guy i think (read a lot of stoicism), was a soldier as a teen and have spent a lot of time while neeting just finding out how to do things, fix things and get by on not much, should worst come to worst i wouldnt mind just moving to eastern europe and living in a shitty commieblock apartment for the rest of my life, i think a lot of people get used to quite a fancy full on life and fear the idea of living frugally, i used to but dont really anymore so its kind of nice to know i could get by and feel alright that way.

this turned into a total blogpost and for a lot of people i suppose its pretty different because they might not have family who are willing/able to support them financially, but there it is. how about you? how did you get where you are, what bothers you about it and where do you want to be?",0,1388642344,null,0,false,0,cefann0,t3_1u6y0a,t1_cefann0,t1_cef8dr5,null,1427894699,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,maybelying,null,null,"&gt; The moment shows Doctor #8 what his future selves will be like if he destroys Gallifrey and the Daleks. This is key. Doctors 10 and 11 in the show come from that timeline.

This is the key point.  The episode is shown from Eleven's POV, and he is from a reality where the War Doc destroyed Gallifrey.  War Doc had to have destroyed Gallifrey with the moment in order for this timeline to exist and this version of ten and eleven to return back.

The action that War Doc took on his timeline could not depend upon a future version - that's where I was referring to the paradox.  So he had to have used the moment in order for eleven and ten to be able to reverse it - if he hadn't used it, then ten and eleven wouldn't have existed in that timeline.

By making Gallifrey disappear and the Daleks destroy themselves, they were able to maintain the appearance of the sudden disappearance of Gallifrey and the Daleks from the universe, preserving the fixed point in time.  He managed to change history without violating a fixed point in time because that fixed point can still be observed to have occurred.

I'm ok with the forgetting part, that makes sense and is basically the way doctor cross-overs happen.  The story always occurs from the POV of the most recent doctor as he is the further point on their shared time line.  The interactions with the previous doctor's do not ""stick"" because they are occurring in the current Doctor's time - so the memory of those events from his past selves is not available until time has caught up to that point on the timeline.

If they really wanted to get across the idea that the moment was never used and it was all confusion, they should have had the idea to make Gallifrey disappear come from War Doc, and not Eleven.  With some creative story telling, the appearance of ten and eleven muddling up the time streams could have could have messed with War Doc's memory leading him and his future selves to believe the moment had been used until the memory catches up with Eleven.

Yet the idea was Eleven's, after having all those years to ponder it, so War Doc couldn't have acted on an idea from his future self since his future self depended on his actions before he could exist.  So the story was about Eleven going back in his timeline and altering history.

It's a TV show and of course their handling of time travel is often nonsensical, but I stubbornly try and find the consistency and continuity where I can.  I also kind of resent Moffat's attempt to turn the Doctor into a perfect unflawed individual that always prevails, and will hold on to my idea that he did do what he did but managed to redeem himself several hundred years later.

In a circular way, the TARDIS is dependent upon the Doctor to be able to translate.  In the Christmas Invasion, Rose wasn't able to understand alien speak while the Doctor was unconscious.

My head canon is that the TARDIS, having awareness of every point in time and space, is simply able to interpret the ideas or concepts in communication and relies on her psychic link with the Doctor to translate those ideas and concepts into something of a concrete linguistic form that can be translated back to the Doctor and his companions via psychic link.
