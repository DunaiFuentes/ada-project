Sat back and absorbed pressure, but didn't seem remotely interested in any kind of counter. Basically seemed like watching us play. Especially with the partial pressing. There was no cohesion, and no one was on the same page. It was just ugly. Yedlin didn't look great, but I wouldn't take much from this. Particularly with Klinsmann's insistence on playing him as a winger. He's made great strides these last two years defensively, and has vastly improved his actual defensive abilities. His college coach has said in the past that he's not likely to turn into a winger, and I agree. He's got the pace for it obviously, but in terms of his mentality and technical skills, most of his development at the highest level has been focused at being a defender who attacks. He's fast enough to make an impact anywhere, but he doesn't have the ball skills and passing to just straight up play on the winger.

Some business colleges are run as social enterprises, and therefore have to offer a certain amount of training for free, so check those out too, although there might be a waiting list. If you're claiming certain benefits, particularly due to disability, adult education centres may offer free or discounted classes for certain subjects; you can probably get a prospectus sent out to you for free, their websites aren't always great.  Not a lot that I know of is available as distance learning though, although I know you personally didn't 100% get along with that.

According to Evans. 

&gt;without having been there I don't know if she might have indicated (albeit drunk) that she wanted more than that. 

There is a point at which being drunk makes you unable to legally give consent. This is one of those cases.

&gt;That's not to endorse Evan's actions in having sex with a drunk girl - but it's entirely likely that she did not protest at the time. 

Actually yes it is. Having sex with someone who is too trashed to consent is raping them. You don't have to also punch them in the arm for it to qualify as a rape. Merely not protesting isn't enough either you need to have some reasonable belief that the person knows what's happening and is a willing participant. 

&gt;I'd draw a heavy distinction between what happened here and the kind of person who pins someone against an alley wall.

The vast vast majority of people who are raped are not  raped by a stranger in a dark alley, most are not physically harmed (other than you know the rape) for a variety of reasons - being intoxicated, freezing, being to scared to resist, being unconcious.

Your reply is an excellent example of why Ched Evans shouldn't be allowed to play football again. It's important to demonstrate that his action *did* constitute a rape and that they are much more typical of rape as it actually happens.

The reality is, it's a real mixed bag.  If you are, like my mother, a long term victim of a very complex illness, requiring specialist attention and seemingly endless interaction with senior consultants, it's very good.

If you are like me, it can be useless.  I've only just got a letter for my GP from the hospital telling him about my injury.  This is over 2 months late.

The very kind Dr even apologised and dutifully listened to me, everything I'd done and prescribed myself, the reason, I'd had to wait 3 weeks to see her.  In her own words I should have seen her immediately.  She was worried that I would now be requiring surgery.  Luckily for me, I'm able to read medical texts and when someone has correctly diagnosed something, I'll follow the prescribed advice verbatim.  She again appologised, told me to come back if anything changed, and complimented me on my pac man ghost stress toy.

This is the issue, in that circumstance it clearly isn't fit for purpose.

But let's look at the wider picture, we've got rising obesity, this is going to cost us.  We will either have to start getting used to diverting even more resources to the NHS or we will have to cut back on services offered.

At the moment, the mental health services offered by many trusts are atrocious.

If we continue with a fearful denial that anything is wrong with the NHS, because it might be privatised, cut, whatever, I think we will exacerbate the public anger, people are selfish, they will see the failure to deliver to them, and forget the others.

* Sturgeon suggested the SNP would only support a minority Labour government if it agreed to remove Trident nuclear weapons from Scotland. (See 3.32pm.)

* She said that if the SNP won the next Scottish parliament elections in 2016, it would ensure all three and four-year-olds, and some two-year-olds, received 30 hours of free childcare. This echoes (but doesn't match) a pledge in the Scottish government’s independence white paper.

* She said she had struck a deal with the Scottish government’s cleaning contractor to ensure all Scottish government cleaners get the living wage by the end of the year. This will affect 117 staff. 

* &gt;And in future, although we cannot mandate it in law, each and every new Scottish Government contract will have payment of the living wage as a central priority.

Yup. Are you about to argue that her version of events is any more accurate inherently? That would be very poor form and exactly the kind of thing we should consider a problem.

Well you've summed up my concern there. She's hardly the first or last person to get very drunk and agree to have sex with someone. 

&gt; Actually yes it is. Having sex with someone who is too trashed to consent is raping them. You don't have to also punch them in the arm for it to qualify as a rape.

false,rev9of8,null,null,"Do note: I am not a lawyer, and this is all based upon my understanding having spent a lot of time involved in the criminal justice system as an accused.   
  
There may or may not be a warrant out for your arrest and even if there is they may not necessarily be that bothered about serving it for a while.   
  
There is a problem though, as you've failed to answer the citation then the Procurator Fiscal could also potentially slap you with a summary complaint for a fail to attend. If I were you, I'd also make sure you get proof that you notified the DVLA of your change of address within the requisite timeframe otherwise they would probably slap you with the failure to notify as well.
  
If you were to turn up at the police station at 7/8am on a Monday morning then there is a significant likelihood that you probably wouldn't be up before the court that day. Whilst some police stations such as St. Leonards in Edinburgh going to the Sheriff Court in the city will occasionally do runs up to as late as 3/4pm to make appearances for things like bail applications it isn't a usual practice and only occurs if there are a lot of people in custody and they've got people they need to get medical approval before they can appear before the court.   
  
Normally the run for the day is done round about the time you were intending to turn up. Even if your police station does a mid-day run, your case probably not be added to the docket in time to appear before the court that day even if they get you fully processed.
  
Your best bet in all honest is to try and speak to a criminal solicitor to explain the situation and see if they can find out if there is a warrant out for you and if they either have charged a fail to attend or are thinking about it. Initial consultations are free although if you don't qualify for Legal Aid then representation for the matter would start at about £500 excluding VAT.  
  
You may be thinking you don't need or want a solicitor for this as you're going to pay the fine and plead to the fail to attend if they charge it - which would probably cop you a £100 fine. However, the fail to attend is a criminal offence and would affect things like visa-waiver/electronic visa travel to places like the US in the future.  
  
If there is a warrant out then the solicitor you consult may be able to get the police to hold off acting on it, as it's a relatively minor matter, until after you get back from the States if you make it clear you will surrender as soon as you get back. This is your best bet as if the police are insistent on you surrendering immediately such that you're up before the court prior to your trip to the States and the Procurator Fiscal wants to shaft you for the fail to attend then that would, as I understand it, invalidate what I would presume is your electronic visa.  
  
Pre-Cadder, the police could often be cunts about arranging to surrender with your solicitor so that the could get their hands on you before you hand time to properly consult them and get advice (I've been in the situation where I found out there was a warrant so contacted my solicitor so that they could arrange for me to surrender. The police told my solicitor they'd make arrangements to do just that then subsequently completely blanked my solicitor and lifted me without bothering to inform them). However, post-Cadder there is little to no point in them pulling crap like that.  

Also, if you retain a solicitor then they may be able to sweet-talk the Procurator Fiscal out of doing you for the fail to attend if they were planning on charging and prosecuting that.  
  
If you do turn yourself in immediately then your best bet is to turn yourself in very late on Monday night or very early on Tuesday morning as it takes a few hours for them to book you in and for all the paperwork etc to be processed. You'd be up before the court sometime on Tuesday and would probably be out on the street by mid-afternoon depending on how busy the court is.  
  
Shifting of the court is unlikely. It's my understanding that summary matters and solemn proceedings before a sheriff must ordinarily be heard in a court in the sheriffdom where the offence (or main part of the offence) occurred. If the offence occurred in your local sheriffdom then they may be amenable to changing the venue but if it is in a different sherriffdom then you're probably sweet out of luck.",0,1416080417,null,0,false,0,cm3fknw,t3_2mdq1p,t1_cm3fknw,t3_2mdq1p,null,1426010263,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1

Only thing I can say is that the team is not playing well, with any energy or sense of urgency until its too late in matches. I don't agree with some of the substitutions he's made. I don't like the way the team plays at times. Our players do not appear motivated. I believe its the managers job to motivate players and find a way to get the best out of them. Not saying its pellegrini's fault, but the squad doesn't seem together at all.

And with yaya I do have a disdain for him, given the way he treated the club and his complete lack of effort on the field, sure he can make a few passes and complete a few runs now and then. And he may be the best option we have--but you cannot continue to let someone give 50% effort and just keep him on the pitch because he's a skillful player. The same skillful player who said remarkably disgusting things about the club, specifically in regards to the club denying him an opportunity to see his brother. I think the player has a lot of ""making up"" to do with city fans, but a lot are still going to defend the lad, and that's fine. A proper benching may do him good--depends on how he responds.

In the ""old days"" we used to give each registration its own IP address (locally unique number). However the program we used to hand them out read from a configure file on disk.

The only way to re read that file was to restart the program, which took 5-10 seconds. So we had to find the right balance between having that program unavailable and updating it frequently enough.

Every 10 minutes is what was decided, when I got more senior I started to push for changes like this. So now we have ""sticky"" IPs. The one you get given is random, but as long as you use it frequently enough it'll stay yours. Because we don't have to alter a config file now there's no significant wait. 

There's a 30 second wait, but that's to ensure we turn off the datapoint, wait 5 seconds, turn it on and then allow your PC 20 seconds of cocking around sorting its self out before you can click next.

Here's my plan of action, if you were to tell me what you think of it it'd be hugely appreciated.

I'm not interested in contesting the charge (nor will I contest a fail to offend if charged with that) so my objective is to be able to fly on Thursday morning.

Step one is find out if there is indeed a warrant, I know the police will not tell me over the phone as I have already tried that from a payphone so I'll call the PF's office at 9am on Monday. I doubt that will help but I saw somebody suggest that on another forum so one phone cal can't hurt. If they won't tell me or if there is a warrant I then go straight to a solicitor for a consultation on Monday morning. If the solicitor can get the police to hold off on acting on it then great, I can fly with peace of mind. If not I find out how much they can realistically do for me in one day and either retain their services or not.

If not I call a solicitor in the sherrifdom where the offence occurred, explain the situation and get someone to represent me in court the next day. I'll then travel to that city and hand myself in on Monday evening to appear the next day - I certainly won't hand myself in from my home city because I then have to wait for the police to arrange to transport me to the relevant court and I have no idea how long that'll take.

Make a list of electric suppliers and their numbers, call each one to get a quote, and see who offers free standard meters. Avoid smart meters though, as they can actually raise your cost.

In my house we're just 2 people in a 4 bedroom. My flatmate is ultra-conservative with electric, and I'm the opposite. I have a portable electric ceramic heater and I run it *all*  the time. I meter it separately and I pay that amount, and then the remainder of the bill is split evenly. 

There are cheap little outlet meters you can buy on ebay/amazon, that measure what you use in your room. They're under £10. You just plug it in, and it's got it's own outlet. You enter your cost per/kwh into it, and it will tell you how much cash you've used on that outlet. These are brilliant for flatmate type households, because each person can use what they want and pay a fair share (assuming they're honest). Also you can use it to measure what 1 load of laundry costs, etc... 

Bill wise, in winter, we pay £80/month and £15-20 of that is just my heater (I have a huge room to heat, and I like it HOT by british standards). Our house is 100% electric so there's no gas bill. 

Your bill doesn't sound excessive, it's close to what I paid in a 3 flatmate house when I was in Brighton. Standard metering may give you a better deal though. 

Edit: I thought I'd note how we got the best price. Only British Gas offered free meters in our area. We transferred to them for a short while for the meter, then we switched our new meter to EDF, who had the best rates.

Sadly, despite the fact that some will put compassion over profit, I suspect the majority will work the other way round. Especially if reducing the rent would mean they're no longer able to actually afford their buy-to-let mortgage payments.

First off, no.  Don't you dare try that tactic.  Even if I was offended, so what?

But onto your post:

&gt; me knowing the are she is from allows me to know whether people dying of benefits is a local issue.

She could be talking about my area, but I won't really know because just like you, I only know a handful of people, just like yourself.  You and I both are simply not connected to the area other than what people, local press and nation press report.  

You do not have your finger on the pulse of your local area, just like everyone else.  You don't know how many people died yesterday, or the day before or the month before that.  You don't know about that person two roads over that died of a heart attack.  You don't know 98% of the people living within a mile of yourself.  You have no idea how many homeless people there are.  You have no idea how many people got raped.  

All I was trying to convey is that just because you live ""not too far from Oldham"", doesn't mean you know anything about this issue or many others.  

Living in an area certainly doesn't mean you know much about what's actually happening outside your own bubble (this goes for me and most people too).

Your post seems to say ""I live near here, it's not an issue because I said so"".   No evidence, no sources, no citation.  Just a ""gut feeling""?

Whilst it isn't go to have any bearing whatsoever on things such as employment prospects or work and travel within the EU, it is still a criminal conviction even though it is very much ordinarily a noddy offence that no-one gives a particular shit about - in a similar vein to breach of the peace. That means that in almost all cases you are no longer eligible for automatic visa waiver or electronic visa travel to countries such as the US, Canada, Australia or almost anywhere else.  
  
That means that if you do want to travel to those countries then you'd have to go through the time consuming and costly process of applying and interviewing for visas at embassies or consulates. Whilst it is staggeringly unlikely that they would ever turn you down for a visa for such a charge, it's a costly, time consuming nuisance you should try and avoid if at all possible.
  
You may be thinking that you'll just take your chances on visa waiver or electronic visa schemes and hope they don't catch you when you either try entering the country or when you're in-country. If they do catch you though then you're typically deported immediately and barred from re-entry for at least ten years and sometimes for life. There's also the possibility, however slim, that some over-zealous or bored border official, law enforcement personnel or prosecutor may decide to prosecute you for the false declaration and illegal entry causing you to end up in jail for a period of time before the then subsequently deport you.  
  
You've also got the possibility that if you are done for the fail to attend before you travel then your current visa to the US may no longer be considered valid which could get you in deep shit if you do try and fly and then enter the country.
  
If the Procurator Fiscal is considering or is going to try and do you for the fail to attend then it is probably worth seeing if a solicitor could get them to drop any such charge. There's a distinct possibility they would if you've no previous and are otherwise of good character given the circumstances behind it once a solicitor has sweet-talked them about it.
  
Of course, if they do choose to do you for a fail to attend then you're sweet out of luck as you've no defence so far as I can see to such a charge whatsoever.  
  
Just to re-iterate though, I am not a lawyer and everything I've said could be completely wrong but it is my understanding of matters. Obviously, the solicitor you speak to would be able to advise you far better than I ever could.

The real difference is actually on the employee side of things, since there's little obligation on the driver's part to go out every night and earn unlike someone who does it for a living.

Well, that's nice that you think that way, but if you allow Uber to operate then regular taxis will be a relict of the past. I can't think of a good reason why someone would want to become a cab driver if they can just sign up for Uber.

&gt;  because Uber is a larger business than any town or city-scale cab firm, their overheads are higher too and their prices are more expensive.

Where do you get that? Especially since Uber puts all the costs on the drivers. Also in most US markets they have lowered pricis well below regular cabs.

I find the argument to be specious, because the Doctor, I am going to wager, would've been able to tell if they were Gallifreyan in origin. UNIT having had exposure to so many alien incursions, I can buy them getting some telepathic tech, but there is a massive difference between the two - alien versus Gallifreyan or Time Lord technology. Not only that, but in NewWho, whenever Time Lord technology is used, it's pretty obviously called as such by the Doctor to demonstrate to the audience how important it is.

false,closethis13,null,null,"Sometimes these guys can blend in and no one notices. It reminds me of the time I met Gerrard which was a breath of fresh air like it was coming straight from Italy.

I was at a supermarket buying meatballs but couldn't pick decent frozen ones. Stevie comes up to the fridge and chose meatballs too!

I didn't see who it was and asked him if they were a good brand at the same time whilst realizing who he exactly was. He said ""nnnnyeah mate the wife uses these often"". My jaw was just dropped and he chuckled and went to the pasta aisle. I'm wearing a Chelsea shirt and I didn't know what to do except for just stand there feeling volatile because he's an actual Liverpool player. Then I snap out of it and go to check out.

So I'm paying for my meatbals, still thinking I'm dreaming and he comes back with a couple of tins of juice, ketchup, sauce, oregano,spaghetti and some veggies in his cart ( I remember because I let him check out before me). I decide to muster up some courage because he seemed like a top bloke and started walking towards him.

I had my sticky pad and pen with the groceries list and I extended it out before reaching him blabbing in some half wit language and he realized I wanted an autograph. He smiled and walked almost in slowmo towards me with the air conditioning blowing on his amazing brown hair and a strutt full of confidence, our eyes locked onto each other as I'm half smiling when suddenly my face turns to horror (also in slowmo) as I see the wet floor sign and he slips! At this point the slowmo has ended and Steevie is coming at me studs up as the packet of spaghetti he bought falls to the floor. The cans of juice explode on his fall and the friction of his tackle boils the spaghetti in the juice (I'm not even joking m8). He hits the sauce next which coats the spaghetti, next the oregano and ketchup bottle get obliterated which adds that special zesty flavor profile. I've not even got to the worst part yet sadly. He takes me out and my fucking meatballs are now cooking in this mess at aprox 120°c. The veggies have also been shredded by his studs and the onions are being sauted whilst the cabbage is done. Stevie though well, he is still going, next a hole in the counter and then goes through the Barclays merchandising they were putting up outside the store for the begining of the 13/14 season.

I obviously felt like a total idiot for having caused this. I go pick him up and tell him that it was my fault and I wont let it happen again. I'm crying myself and he starts crying too just because I'm sad (thats passion m8s). Both of us are lathered in spaghetti and meatballs (which I might add tasted better than my SO make) also hugging and crying.

Obviously like I said above, I let him check out before me because I'm not a total prick to put him through more misery and said sorry again telling him he wont ever have to see me again.

This was before I bought tickets to go watch Chelsea at Anfield....

He is still a top bloke though. I just made my way out of there, quickly got in my car and legged it but for some reason it didn't budge. Got out and looked at it again and it was on cinder blocks.

This happened in Liverpool by the way. I went to the supermarket just once after that and they had painted the Barclays sign light blue for visibility.

I had to relocate to Birmingham myself for six months for the same reason - I got redeployed instead of getting redundancy money and couldn't find a job in Manchester in the time available so had to take the redeployment. Hated it, left after 6 months and spent 4 months on the dole over last Christmas.

Then in my new job I started in March, a guy I work with travels up from Oswestry 3 days a week. He's now just accepted a job based in Leeds! 

So the point I'm making is that, even though you could work from anywhere (building websites), you'll need to be working and socialising in a place where people need websites building, or more likely, a place with web dev job options.

Almost every player on our squad had a big role in their countries efforts.  It's taking longer than expected, but I do think we'll make a strong push in the second half of the season.  It's a shame because Aguero caught fire and is playing as well as we've seen him play and these draws and loses should be blow out victories but that's just football mate.  

As far as Yaya is concerned I'm not going to make too many comments here.  Yaya by no means is in the right, but he's dealing with a lot.  Citeh fans have short term memory and forget what all he's done for the club.  We don't exactly cheer our team on the pitch and it carries over the internet.  The only player that seems to get the benefit of the doubt is Aguero because of his goal against QPR.  Yet we forget he was largely absent last season.  Some romanticize about the Beast and forget he didn't score a goal for like six months.  I saw some fans hate on Navas and Clichly and calling for their heads.  It seems we want every player available in the transfer window, and a few of us actually like the team we have now.  I love every player on the team and don't want to keep adding players like we did before we won titles.  To address your Yaya benching suggestion, it would be really hard to bench him.  Fernandinho and Fernando are really hit or miss and Fernando is especially erratic and makes some bad decision.  Both of them play a lot calmer beside Yaya.  Some say put Lampard there and that is just ridiculous.   Lampard is big time but he can't give more than thirty minutes.  As good as Milner has been on the wing, his effectiveness greatly diminishes in the middle.  I'm all for getting Pogba and Reus just like every Ulitimate Team fanatic, but we all have to realize that it's really hard to be dominant year in and year out, especially in the Barclay's league.

Feel free to have your own opinion. But Yaya offers much more to a team than Cesc can. Yaya is a physical player who can bully others off the ball, he can be a playmaker just like Cesc, he can hit crazy longshots, he can defend better, he can score more goals, he can hit better setpieces, he can *score* off of more setpieces, and he can dribble and drive at the other team better than Cesc can. Its really a no brainer from a coaches point of view which player you would want if you could only have one.

I am also not sure what you mean by Cesc being the better player over the course of his career? Cesc, just like Yaya had a lot of not too great moments in his career, both are pretty close in how well they have played.

You refer to the weather but what else has changed? Diet, alcohol intake/ smoking, physical activity levels, stress, sleep patterns? Frequency of laundering bed linen or products used, water quality, cosmetic products (including dental and haircare), prescription meds including hormonal contraceptives? Any of these can affect facial skin.

What is your definition of natural, exists in nature or found in the human body or something else? Everything is comprised of chemicals, many scary sounding ingredients are derived from plants or otherwise exist in nature. Conversely there are many poisons, allergens, irritants and toxins in the natural world.

The most natural exfoliants are lactic acid and urea, since both are part of the skin's natural moisturising factors. Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, konjac sponges and muslin cloths are all sourced from nature. However exfoliating a compromised skin barrier runs the risk of further damaging it.

Raw honey releases peroxide, basically you are bleaching your face each day, destroying acne bacteria (on the surface but not deeper within the pore) but the 'good guys' too. Honey is also a potent humectant so will draw water out of the dermis into the epidermis but this water can be lost through TEWL (trans epidermal water loss) leaving the skin dehydrated.

Part of what makes it extra disappointing to me is that he is really, an extremely talented writer. Watch Sherlock, Jekyll, Coupling, etc. Especially when it comes to crafting characters (Clara's terrible, awful, unncessary family excluded). I don't know why his storylines falter and end so underwhelmingly. He sets up amazing arcs and has a whole host of characters, and I would say his dialogue is also very well done. 

But when it ends. It's either so convoluted and distracting that the storyline pretty much just gets ""closed"" because, hey why not? (Wedding of River Song, Good Man Goes to War, Name of the Doctor, Time of the Doctor, really anything involving River) Or the plots and character arcs reach their natural conclusion but they DON'T end and just kinda atrophy or become parodies of themselves (Vastra/Jenny, Ponds, Clara). 

Also, big part of the the CyberDan (patent pending) issue is the complete ignoring of the rules that he, as the writer, set up. Someone before mentioned the maddening evolution of Weeping Angels from awesomely frightening monster with a well defined limit to being able to turn the Statute of Liberty into one of them for absolutely no reason that was necessary for the plot. His love of time travel paradoxes makes sense because its a show about time travel. But it IS still a science fiction show and not a dumbass, love conquers all deus ex machina BS like Matrix Revolutions.

No thanks.

Hell, I wouldn't want Varane if it means selling Schurrle to Liverpool.

On the right wing we have Willian, Schurrle, Salah and Ramires.

I really, REALLY don't rate Ramires as a winger. He has no finesse or control, can't shoot or pass, so having him in a position where shooting and passing are important is a big no.

Salah is young and hasn't improved much this season - I think he needs to go on a loan.

We don't need more general attacking players, but Schurrle rarely plays anywhere except the right so including Hazard and Oscar in the position is.

I'd rather have Ramires playing CM instead of an injured Fab, or Zouma playing instead of Cahill, than Salah or Victor Moses playing instead of an injured Willian.

L'Oreal's Super Liner. It's a third of the price of its dupe, the Lancome Artliner. Make sure you check  you're picking up the right one with the exact same tip (google the Artiner and look at the close ups) as they have several under the same name with different applicators (I forget, but maybe one of them was a kohl). I prefer it because unlike the Artliner, it doesn't disappear or smudge if your eyes tear up in the wind, it's also far easier to remove with a good eye makeup remover. However, there's an odd thing with it whereby it seems really hard to layer the corner of wings. But fine on the rest of the eye. Idk why this is and it makes no sense, but I have got around that by doing an outline of my intended eye shape with kohl first. It seems to be a bit of a primer and makes it far easier/makes corner mistakes less probable.

Thank you.

You obviously don't understand how business works. Let me explain it simply.

You need revenue (that's what you sell the oil for) and you have expenses (the cost of getting the oil out of the ground). If the revenue doesn't exceed the costs, it's a waste of time extracting the oil, and in any case no money to hire people to do it. So there'll be job losses.

false,Obamanator91,cnty-scotland,Greeny Type,"EU Law causes a few headaches basically. 

As far as I understand it, the way in which the Scottish Government must legislate on the issue, would be to require in public sector contracts that the employers sign up to would have a 'performance criteria' that means that workers in that company working on that project must be payed living wage. Even this is of disputable legality, and it is theoretically possible that the Scottish Government could be sued if the business can prove that the living wage causes: 
&gt;“an additional economic burden that may prohibit, impede or render less attractive the provision of their services in the host Member State” 

This is not quite the 'requiring in law' that signatory's to public sector contracts pay the living wage across all of their business, or even for the employee's engaged in that contract are payed the living wage as a performance criteria is not quite the same thing.

So basically it is a bit of a legal minefeild, and the SNP were probably staying as far away as possible from the situation where they, or a local council for instance, could be sued under a pretty woolly clause because they were required to tender for a living wage in a case where a business could prove the above quoted clause.

Could they have proceeded anyway? Yes
Should they have proceeded anyway? Maybe (leaning to Yes), I don't think being sued for trying to provide the living wage would exactly have been bad PR, and I also think there are moves in the EU to alter the wording and contents of the law to allow for exactly this situation at some point in the future. 

But would Labour have acted differently than the SNP if they were in office instead? Doubtful. They knew the SNP legal advice would be that they might get sued and so they would probably have to vote the measure down, so for Labour it was effectively a free PR coup.

Your source does not support your claim that the SNP 'promised to let the independence issue lie for a generation'.

True but without oil Scotland's GVA is £20,571 and the UK's is **£20,873**. How is the rUK doing without oil? Is it all collapsed yet? So with the 20% that's around £24,685 so we kind subside the rUK this is confirmed by the GERS figures here;

http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2014/03/7888/downloads#res446019

To show you I'm telling the truth. Over the figures it shows in table E.1 and E.2 which shows we have put 1.3% more into the system then we took out. That's about £9,114,000,000. 

Also, Norways income from oil is much higher than Scotland's at around 25-30%

&gt;And if you get Devo max which means Scotland and England have separate fiscal systems and you have to rely on your *own* income instead of a subsidy from England, 

What subsidy?

&gt;prepare to see all your services including the NHS trashed because you can't afford it. While England sails on with it's welfare state intact. The next three years are going to be fun fun fun for anyone who isn't Scottish - and the best thing is that you will have clamoured for it all by yourselves! Who will you blame then? Let me guess, we'll get whines about how those wicked Westminster folk used their superpowers to make you vote for Devo Max, LOL.

I don't think he is capable of influencing the play from out wide like Ivanovic can do. If we aim to control the game and have you sitting back trying to hit us on the counter, who knows what will happen. 

I think that wilst the aim is to prevent our transitions, due to the nature of the team and how many options we have, it may be very hard. we can be both controlling in posession and extremely direct (see Costa's goal vs Arsenal), which is obviously an issue to defend.

Who would you have over Wanyama? There aren't many better defensive mids than him in the PL.

No, I'm not trying to be a hipster. Ki Seung Yeung is probably the most underrated player in the league. Tidy passer of the ball and great positional sense, good player. Personally think he could play for a top side like Bor. Dortmund etc.

Nasri and Mata have been showing consistently for a while now (bar last season for Mata, he couldn't even get a game under Mourinho.

You've got a brilliant net income - I'm living with a parent at the moment (at 25), and on my previous net income of 950/1000 a month I was able to save £400 a month easily with £100/150 free spending money and minimal rent/bills (phone/car insurance/payback of borrowed money/laptop finance)
Obviously I could have saved more but I like to know I have some spending money otherwise life gets very boring very quickly :D

Also, if you are itching to get on your feet and become independent, I would say renting&gt;buying right now. It's become a bit scary with regards to buying property recently - in fact your post reminded me of something I'd heard a few months ago - that banks/mortgage lenders are going to be breathing down first-time buyers' throats when it comes to small spending (gym membership etc) because apparently having small monthly subscriptions shows that people are incompetent spendthrifts who couldn't possibly commit to a mortgage. [Yeeea I don't feel too happy about this - it's already difficult enough to get on the ladder, without having your personal leisure spending criticised - I think it'll be into the tens of years before I'd even be able to consider buying!]

Obviously we can't tell for sure, but the fact that he always seems to best Wenger surely diminishes the amount of satisfaction he gets out of it. I remember reading somewhere that we chose Rafa over Jose and that's a major reason why he doesn't like us. Also we stopped him from winning the European cup with chelsea in his first spell, also seemed to always beat his sides in semi finals. I think we saw how much he hates us by his reaction to last season. Running down the touch line at Anfield banging his chest and screaming.

false,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"I really like the idea of selling Salah and bringing in a HG player so we can use the extra foreign spot on a CB. Nothing against the kid, but I don't see him ever being a superstar at Chelsea and we need a new CB and I don't see any really amazing English ones that we don't already have.

With that said, here's how I feel about the players listed.

Baker: I don't know enough about him to rate him.

Boga: Played great in preseason, but I think he could do with at least another year out on loan. I doubt he's good enough to take Schurrle's or Willian's spot and sitting him on the bench does no one any good. He's only 17. Most players that age just aren't big enough to really stand out in the EPL.

Traore: Same how I feel about Boga. No doubt he's talented, but he needs minutes that he wont get here. I think a loan inside England would be best for both of them.

Moses: Probably my favorite choice for the spot. He's shown a bit of spark at Stoke and I think he's about as talented as Salah. I don't ever expect him to be a world beater, but I think he could be great off the bench.

Piazon: Probably my second choice to bring back. Always had high hopes for the kid. Honestly, I haven't followed his progress this season, so maybe my concerns are outdated, but again, my biggest worry here is his size. He's tall, but I remember him getting pushed around a bit a few years ago. That being said, if he did come back, I think he could learn a lot from Oscar, Hazard, and Fabergas.

Atsu: I just don't see him ever breaking into the team. He can't even get into the Everton team. We got him for dirt cheap so I think we should hold him until he has a good run and then see what kind of profit we can make of him.

T. Hazard: I'd like for Thorgan to come back soon, but I don't think he has HG status. Without that benefit, it doesn't make sense to me to bring him back to sit on the bench.

The amount of tax that is deducted is calculated by reference to your total earnings for the year so far.  What this means is that the process tends to assume that your earnings are even.  The significance is that you may overpay a little and the effect for Income Tax will even out over the next couple of months.

*(It's pretty late in the year so the effect won't be terrible. The deduction tables *(at least for the systems I've seen)* would assume that your pay will always be at the higher rate.  So if it had been your April pay and you received say a salary of £1,500 and a bonus of £1,500 it would be assumed that you get £3,000 (before tax) each month.)*

NICs are calculated on the basis of pay periods.  Where your Income Tax exempt amount is for the year, the NICs Lower Earnings Limit gets spread over the relevant pay periods.  This can mean that you can end up paying a little more in NICs because they're calculated by reference to your total pay for **that** pay period.  It won't make much difference though.

If anyone on this thread is prepared to take your comments in earnest, they can easily read the record of my posts in exchange with you where I made the mistake of trying to engage you in a rational discussion about the well known argument that race is a social construct - an idea, not a fact. And therefore any over-confident expression of the idea that ""Irish people"" (definition needed) belong to a special ""race"" is wide open to criticism.

The amusing part about all this though is this is a traditional marxist argument, one which I do have sympathy with however. Yet its our so-called socialist friend who takes the greatest exception to it being made - his apoplexy still undimmed by evidence of his comment above.

There are some elements which housing benefit won't pay for such as gas, electricity and food so we ask clients to pay a service charge as well.

If we have a client who gains employment we have other projects they can in which do not have on site support instead someone would come out and provide support at the property if it was needed.

&gt;She makes a good point. It piqued my interest and I googled 'hindu swastika.' I came across this picture of a child with a bald head and it is tatooed on her scalp.

I actually knew an indian guy who had it painted on the hood of his crossover for good luck or some reason. However! Look at the descriptor text on the picture. It says ""A recently shaved Hindu girl with a swastika drawn on her scalp."" I think, similar to ash Sunday services, they have used a pigment of some sort (again ashes being my best guess, or maybe even a more sophisticated paste) to draw the symbol on her. The statement that vicariously living out your religion through your child still stands though, its kind of fucked.

&gt;I'm sure there are still trainee child slavehouse geisha who have their toes broken in order to fit into the most ridiculously small shoes, and I don't agree with that tradition either.

Well, as you said, its about presenting yourself as sexually appealing. Unfortunately, this is persistent in most modern cultures. Victorian-age women broke ribs tightening corsets, and today more women use things such as make-up, form fitting clothes, and other things of that nature (Definitely less painful though). Most cultures that don't allow women to increase their appeal are unfortunately on the other side of the spectrum. Women are not allowed to drive (at least until recenty in Saudi apparently), or in extreme cases show their face/other parts in public. I think make-up is an integral part of many societies, and if people think they want it then by all means use it. I've obviously been raised and taught to think women with make up are more beautiful than those without, and I'm sure most people here are the same. 

And now my favorite topic; Religion. Let me say its been a bumpy ride for me the past year or two. I've been raised in a mildly christian family since I was born. We went to church and all, but we never were overly zealous or anything of that sort. Then I grew up, and I came to the transition from ""Mommy says its so,"" to ""I believe this, because of reasons x &amp; y."" This did not go well, and at first to my behest, I slipped into non-belief. I struggled with this fact for about two years until I went to southwind. Southwind is a very relaxed church camp I volunteer at every summer (If you remember GWNU, I was there for the 14 day stretch and you checked in on me due to inactivity haha). The last night I sat in on one work crew group's devotional because I was at the soda machine. It was their counselor from their town, and she had something to say. She shared how she was sexually abused (fuck I had forgotten all of this, this is bring back some feels), and we all shared scars and struggles. Anxiety, depression, and self esteem were all cited. Mine was my faith. I told them all my doubts, my struggle to find who I was, and that I wasn't really scared to let go of it all. Soon after I finally realized I didn't believe, and I felt so so soooo relieved. I was pretty content. So thats my story.

But in regard to other people, whatever makes them happy, and as long as they don't make me unhappy. I see people do work in the name of religion that makes me proud to be human. Others are vindictive, judgmental, even war-like in the name of whatever they believe. People here are usually accepting of others regardless (albeit they may joke) of their beliefs and origins. We've all seen examples of the opposite, but mostly we're a nice bunch. People have no right to judge others on that, or dissuade them though, as no one knows the truth. The breaking point in any rational argument is in faith. Someone can argue all they want that a god or whatever does not exist, but in the end their argument is null. There is no evidence for either side, besides their own faith in either the existence or non-existence of something. 

I hate to label myself as Atheist because there are a lot of negative connotations (FUCK YOU MILITANT ATHEISTS YOU'RE JUST AS BAD AS THE ZEALOTS) from misrepresentation and conflict. I simply don't know the answer to it all, and lack the faith to believe in something. For now I dedicate my life to just existing and being happy in that, as well as making others happy.

&gt;Politics have never gone down politically well here, and for good reason. Avoiding them keeps the environment welcoming and friendly.

I think politics are hard to avoid, as they're such a huge part of our lives. However, if people can't air their opinions and debate in polite yet concise manners then I don't know what kind of adults they are.

Fuck we don't even need politics to be mean to eachother, I've seen shouting matches over DND editions here.

And if you don't agree with anything I say, especially on the regard of women, remember I am looking from the outside in. If I'm incorrect I'm sorry, please let me know otherwise. I've been influenced by my environment so I'm bound to err eventually.

Anyways, Love ya

The difference is, a paedophile hasn't actually done anything illegal! Child abuse, sure, horrific, throw the book at them. But being a paedophile is just a desire someone has. And it's a desire that needs to be stopped, but you can't prosecute someone just for thinking things - you punish them for their actions. The reasons for this are pretty obvious.

But even if you think we should be able to punish them for just thinking about children sexually, that wouldn't help anyone. If it's not illegal, paedophiles can come forward and seek help, get counselling and learn how to control their desires. And even if they do start acting on their desires, we'll know who they are, and we can stop them before they do it again. But if just thinking is enough to send them to prison? They won't come forward, have no outlet for their feelings, no support network, and the first we'll know about them is when little Timmy turns up in a ditch.

So, in conclusion, we should be encouraging paedophiles to come forward. Criminalising it will drive them underground and more children will suffer because of it.

I got a degree in Geology, and chucked out a load of CV's - a friend worked for Schlumberger/Geoservices at the time, and he passed my CV to the right people.

What is it you want to be doing, offshore?  Halliburton (along with Schlumberger and Baker Hughes) offer dozens of roles, in a fair range of wellsite operations.  Everything from logging, wireline, cementing, drilling fluids, completions, etc.

I'm a Data Engineer, so monitor a range of sensors onboard - mud pit levels, pipe pressures, weights, how fast we're drilling, depth, and that sort of thing.  Prior to this, I worked as a Logging Geologist, so taking samples of drilled rock and analysing them - always handy to know where we are, stratigraphically.

false,Kh444n,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"""In October 1978, Hayman left a package of paedophilia-related materials on a London bus. The police traced the package and discovered that under the pseudonym ""Peter Henderson"", Hayman had used an apartment in Bayswater, London, to conduct obscene correspondence. In the apartment, police found 45 diaries describing six years of ""sexual fantasies"" concerning children and activities with prostitutes, articles of female clothing and obscene literature. He was investigated by police but released without charge after being given a warning not to send obscene material through the mail.[7][8] In 1981, Private Eye magazine revealed this event. Then, using parliamentary privilege, MP Geoffrey Dickens asked why Hayman had not been prosecuted.[9][10] The Attorney General's reply indicated that while Hayman had been found to have received pornographic material through the post, it was not of an extreme nature, was non-commercial and in a sealed envelope, so did not warrant prosecution.[11]

In April 1981 Sir Michael Havers, the Attorney General, said in parliament that while Hayman was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, he was never a member of the executive committee, so was not prosecuted as others were for publishing contact advertisements.[12][13]

In 1984, Hayman was convicted for an act of gross indecency in a public lavatory.[1][9]

Later, on 29 November 1985, Dickens complained in the House of Commons that he had suffered harassment following his naming of Hayman. ""The noose around my neck grew tighter after I named a former high-flying British diplomat on the Floor of the House. Honourable Members will understand that where big money is involved and as important names came into my possession so the threats began.

I'll give you that public transport within the city is good, but have you tried getting out of it? I grew up in Cramlington, there is one bus route between Cramlington and Newcastle, which is basically a monopoly. They hike the prices every year and you're riding on 30-year old rattly Arriva buses, and that's not counting the buses that take nearly an hour to do 8 miles cos they go by Quorum business park. Something doesn't sit right with me about a company being able to charge me £5.70 return when the only towns the route visits are Cramlington --&gt; Gosforth --&gt; Newcastle. It's even worse south of the river, I had to get the bus to Bishop Auckland once and it took almost four hours round trip and cost me about £15.

&gt; 4G

I've never had 4G except in the very city centre of Newcastle for about 10 minutes. In towns in SE Northumberland I get 3G about 40-50% of the time. If you take the train from Newcastle to Edinburgh, you have 3G for about 2 minutes of the hour-and-a-half journey.

&gt; a few Prets

That was a joke about how many there are in London. I think Newcastle has three and there's one in the Metro Centre, which is disproportionate for a northern city, so I'll give you that.

Women's suffrage in the UK originally only applied to landowning women over 30; at the same time, any man over 21 was allowed to vote. Equal suffrage came into being ten years later.

My point being that allowing women to drive during certain hours (with or without makeup, which you wear daily in part because it's expected in your culture) is a step in the right direction, and history has proved on many occasions that that kind of concession can and does open up a dialogue that leads towards greater equality.

It's hilarious that because I have one argument with one seemingly autist dude on this sub that flicks through a thesaurus before every post to sound superior, you deem me the 'resident angry-man' - your denial of racism has been the first time I've got angry on reddit as a whole, and if you think I'm the angriest on this sub then clearly you haven't been here long enough. Likewise, comparing me to any member of the DUP shows your ineptitude.

As for searching for victimhood, fuck off, seriously.

If she hasn't been seen by a specialist consultant yet, it's a case of googling private gps in your area and contacting them.

Private healthcare is quite expensive, but there are ways to combine NHS and private services, for example, if she had a private outpatient appointment and was told she needed a scan, she could request to have that on the NHS. She would be assessed and join the NHS waiting list according to her need like everybody else though, there's no queue jumping for patients who were referred from private. Some patients pay for the initial consultations, then revert to NHS when they've got the reassurance of a diagnosis.

false,lgf92,null,null,"Everything that's wrong? I've been here nearly five years, and here are some things I don't like about St Andrews:

* its location. While it is in easy reach of Edinburgh and Dundee, the town is still 10 minutes from Leuchars train station on the bus, although there's a bus link to Glasgow several times a day. Due to the paucity of stuff in-town (to be continued), and the fact that Stagecoach know they have the only route to Dundee and Edinburgh, you get gouged on the price. I think a day return to Dundee is about £6.50, and Leuchars itself is £5.05. That said, it's surrounded by lovely countryside and is a nice town in itself. If you're coming from south of the border, get ready to whizz as far as Newcastle then crawl agonisingly slowly along un-electrified Scottish rail. 

* The lack of stuff in town. Believe me, St Andrews does actually have a lot of shops. The only problem is that most of them are neither cheap enough for student life nor actually aimed at students. Not that there's anything wrong with that, and believe me, it was worse five years ago. Now we have an H&amp;M, Pret a Manger is opening, etc., but I tend to find that finding stuff like cheap homewares becomes a ""what can I find in the charity shop lottery"" game. The nightlife is good, unless you want like six-story nightclubs with massive club nights, which St Andrews doesn't have. I tend to find our reputation for poor nightlife is vastly overstated.

* Supermarkets. Tesco in town has a crap, expensive selection of stuff although it's not horrendous. Aldi and Morrisons are cheaper, but are easily 20 minutes' walk from the town centre, coupled with the fact that it rains a lot.

* the in-built snobbery, both from locals and students. This has definitely got worse since the fees rise, but the fact is that the majority of people in St Andrews, locals and students, have more money than most people. This leads to locals looking down on students who they see as people coming to trash their idyllic town, especially on events such as Raisin. Students, meanwhile, are very good at painting themselves as egalitarian and open while organising events like the KK Balls and posh-fests like DW and the Welly Ball. There's a charming tweeness about it, but as someone from a less well-off economic background, I have more than once felt out of place. I see a lot of snobbery targeted at Scotland and especially Fife, which makes me quite uncomfortable. Someone walked past my window the other night and I heard him describing Scotland as ""basically a third world country"". This so-called 'bubble mentality' is a result of St Andrews being very isolated and something of a microcosm compared to the towns around it.

* term dates. Get ready for your term dates to not be similar to anyone else's, since they moved exams back to December and we now start in the second week of September.

St Andrews is a great place and I've loved spending five years here, but there are many things which it isn't.

A lot will depend on where you currently live and they type of amenities that you already have close to you. YOu may find that the place offers more than what you were used to in Oz and so things will be fine.

A couple of quotes from Wikipedia :

&gt; D. H. Lawrence, in Lady Chatterley's Lover, described Mansfield as ""that once romantic now utterly disheartening colliery town"".
&gt; 
&gt; The 2005 and 2007 editions of Channel 4's programme The Best and Worst Places to Live in the UK named Mansfield as the sixth and ninth worst place to live in Britain, largely due to the poor performance of schools in the area at the time.  

&gt;   




The town has a certain sadness about it. There is just 1 decent book store and  no independent book shops; the daily market is 99% junk; In the summer at least, expect bouncers on some of the pub doors from 9am on a weekday.

There are a couple of good pubs with the best for me being The Brown Cow. Restaurants are a mixed bag. Places are either mediocre pub grub or good yet more expensive places like Red Gate. I find very few 'middle of the road' places that are not as cheap as a Wetherspoons pub but not too expensive either.

false,tessie999,null,null,"Thanks! I think the undereyes are just lack of sleep - I have 3 very severe allergic reactions in the past but all seemingly unrelated and never important enough to see a doctor (one was some sort of rash/insect bite, one was what appeared to be a metal reaction where my hand went blue+green, the most recent one two years ago my lips swelled up and went blue while my hands where red with white bumps everywhere). They are reluctant here to do blood tests on children if it isn't something that affects them too much.

I eat lunch and dinner at school so the food is a lot greasier, more carbohydrate based and with more preservatives. There isn't much alternative seeing as you have to pay for these meals in advance (before the year begins). I make half my meal corn (sometimes peas) so that I don't consume more than half of the school food. I exercise about 4x a week, no smoking. It was my 18th birthday a few weeks ago so very recently I have had some vodka+diet sprite mixes about once a week. Around 200ml of vodka in total. I am on no medication or hormonal contraceptives. I use Loreal Elvive re-nutrition shampoo and Loreal Elvive full restore repairing conditioner. I don't do anything with my hair apart from wash it about once a week, dry it naturally (takes a very long time though so I go to sleep with it wet sometimes piled on a towel above my head) and brush it each morning (provided it has dried).

By unnatural I'm referring to things with have fragrance or are very heavy on alcohol. In general, store-bought exfoiliant feel very harsh on my skin while the honey+mineral oil has not made my face feel very dry or rash-y. I can't for the life of me remember what they were called but I found them on /r/SCA and it was a big skincare brand in the UK (like clean and clear but not quite). I think they were an alternative to those Stridex pads - you wiped them on your face and left them there to do their thing.

I didn't know that honey bleached your face - my skin doesn't feel as tight as it used to (which I thought was how it felt to be dehydrated - but maybe that's how skin is supposed to be?) but it explains why the red pimples look better but I can't prevent new ones from popping up.

I do the honey thing about 2x a week - should I cut down to once a week? Use moisturizer religiously afterwards? Or just switch to some other alternatives?

Spent some time sleeping rough too as my family life was mental. 

Went to Oxbridge, had the best three years of my life, left, and since I left, even though I did something very very few people from my background do and did very well, it's done very little for me.

I've never had a job since with a contract of more than three months, and the amount of times people, who were given a lot more in life, have been a cunt to me about going is unreal. I even got turned down for a job because, according to the recruiter, ""you were both good but you'll be fine, you went to Oxbridge- this person will need the break though and be hungrier to stay"".

false,the-londoner,lfc68,,"As others have said, Matuidi would be unbelievable. I honestly think he's second in the world at CDM, behind Mascherano. But there's probably about a 0.1% he'd ever leave PSG for us, given that he's probably on a massive wage, and is guaranteed trophies and Champions League spots there every year. Same issue with De Rossi, as well as the fact that, along with De Jong and Inler, buying a 30-31 year old MF is not ideal. 

Bender for Dortmund or Gonalons from Lyon are both approaching their prime, and though we might have to pay a premium for Bender, they'd probably be worth it. If we didn't pursue a genuine CDM, I like what I've seen from Can so far, he's young and can only improve technically and positionally, whilst already being  monstrously imposing physically. If we stuck with Can, I'd like another high energy CM to partner/rotate with Hendo - Kevin Prince Boateng is my top choice for that. Aggressive, strong, quick, driving midfielder with a goal threat, and being at Schalke, probably wouldn't be impossible to get. 

The rest of the midfield is fine; we have a glut of small, creative attacking mid's/wingers/passers. I don't think the defence really needs additions. It needs stability. I'm praying Rodgers sticks with Sakho once he recovers, he's quality for France and gets brandished as a risk because of his unorthodox stance rather than anything he actually does badly. Far better than Lovren. And Manquillo and Moreno look decent prospects, with Flanno to recover by Xmas and provide depth alongside Johnson and Enrique (:/).

As expected we see problems with asylum seekers (often from war-torn countries where they may have suffered traumatic violence) and few problems from A8 immigrants who are generally moving for economic reasons and share European culture and religion.

The problems with Islamic extremism - a large factor behind the religiously and racially motivated crimes of the 'Asian youths' previously described - are really found in immigrant populations that are already settled here. It is difficult to know how to tackle these problems and given the amount of Government effort expended on the problem it seems it is unlikely to be amenable to a quick and easy solution.

It seems that EU immigration has largely beneficial economic effects and does not affect crime (and may in fact reduce it) but of course locals may still dislike a large influx of foreign workers - even if they are objectively beneficial - due to problems of culture, language etc.

Allow me to clarify. If the (perceived) left-leaning majority on this sub is the reason you think we'd want to see a huge rise in poverty, you have a long way to come in terms of taking an unbiased and point-for-point approach to mutual understanding of people. Mutual understanding is apparently part of quality of life anyway. Therefore quality of life is raised when you exercise good practices of understanding, instead of taking a hardline divisive us vs them approach.

The same policies that helped make London one of the largest French cities. Trade unionists should not be running government, and they should have a serious think as to how they could actually implement anything they are proposing without seriously hurting the country.

Edit - seriously have a look at their policy list. They oppose any cuts to anything except defence which they would translate to equal expenditure elsewhere, and want to increase all public services. And they don't want to raise any kind of individual taxes. Their only plan for affording this is to ""tax the rich"" and clamp down on corporate tax avoidance - as if a) rich people won't just leave the country as they did in France; b) it's somehow an easy and quick thing to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance that doesn't take billions in public legal costs and will likely not work effectively anyway; and c) strange our financial services industry which provides a huge amount of investment in the  UK. Basically their only option would be to borrow vast sums of money from other countries, putting us back in the risky debt-laden position Labour had us in back in 2008.

In my experience I don't think people tend to have a problem with immigrants from India, because they integrate into society very well due to the considerable shared history and culture between Britain and India. Furthermore, immigrants from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland all slot in perfectly and cause little animosity because they're barely any different to british people. It seems to me that the public don't really mind immigrants very much when they understand that they can relate to these people and share their communities with them. This is something people who go to uni tend to experience, as there are plenty of international students that you're bound to meet loads of people from other countries and form good relations with them. The opposite is the problem you describe where immigrants form their own communities and practice values that aren't compatible with wider british society.

Coupled with the fact that most Arsenal fans will have Baines's performance in Brazil in the front of their mind, where he was completely screwed over by Hodgson, people have a completely distorted view of Baines. 

Now I don't know about Gibbs because I only watch 2 Arsenal games a season and given that he's injured much I probably watch him even less. So I can't really comment on whether or not he is better than Baines. But I can say two things.

**How do we catch paedophiles?**

Obviously there are various ways one of which though is the kid telling a person in authority, another parent, a teacher etc.

**Who are the abusers?**

Often people the child knows, a family member for example.

--------------------------

Kids aren't stupid. They will have some awareness of what happens next. And given the threat of life to the person they are accusing, a person they know, this could put them off pointing the finger.

You basically want little Timmy to feel guilt for ending the life of his uncle, on top of everything else he has to go through. Without realising this potential guilt will put him off telling anyone in the first place.

This is of course ignoring the fact that not all family members are rational, some might even side with the uncle. Little Timmy tells his mum, but his mum doesn't want to see her brother put to death, she doesn't want to see the hurt that will inflict on her mother. Better to keep quiet and not let him babysit again 

Worst case scenario, they blame Timmy, which sometimes happens nowadays. Just now this blame includes the death of a family member.",0,1416151036,null,0,false,0,cm42brh,t3_2mf24j,t1_cm42brh,t1_cm401fk,null,1425999350,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;Not sure where you get those 40 per cent / 58 per cent figures from since the last census was in 2011. It found that 63 per cent of Londoners were born in the UK. And Londoners who gave their religion as Christian outnumber those identifying as Muslim by four to one.

In terms of ethnicity the 2001 census was 58% white British. 45% in 2011. That I suspect has come down now because of people being forced out of social housing, people moving to the HC, and following the general trend. As for religion, you're assuming 1 christian is balanced out by 1 muslim. I'm supposed to read this statistic and think oh my god i've been wrong this whole time. Well, Islam is a much more dominant religion that Christianity. Most Christians are only Christians in name in the UK. Just being baptised is enough to call yourself a Christian. Islam is more of an all encompassing ideology that pervades every part of your life. 

I think you would count as white British, as would your mother as she was born here, probably looks white British and readily assimilated in at-the-time British culture. My next door neighbour is Polish and came here in the 50s and his daughter is certainly white British. There weren't a lot of Poles that came here after the war I think only about 100,000 over about a 10-15 year period. Compared to 243,000 net for the year end March 2014. Do the maths and ask yourself are these new arrivals in the same bracket as your grandfather? And even if they were, can we handle 250,000 *a year*?

I do wonder if the diet is a part of the issue, might be worth tracking servings as per the UK official healthy eating guidelines.

Whole eggs are nutritious if you have access to those, as are any seeds or nuts if you can purchase snacks. You absolutely need fat and wholegrain carbohydrates whilst you are still finishing developing and your studies. If it's not possible to meet the official healthy eating guidelines then that would be something to discuss with your parents or family doctor.

Azelaic acid increases turnover of the skin so acts as a sort of exfoliant but it may take weeks for the results to reveal themselves, and there can be 'purging' beforehand.

You might ask your GP about 4% niacinamide (Nicam) to use alongside the azelaic acid - this is very gentle, anti inflammatory, helps moderate sebum production, boosts the skin's own ceramide synthesis. [We have a Wiki entry on niacinamide.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients) Benzoyl peroxide is very harsh and damages the skin barrier, it can be effective but is too harsh for some people. BP is my pet hate TBH.

Not everyone needs to or would benefit from cosmetic exfoliating, certainly not when they have a compromised skin barrier (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out) and only with extreme caution when using isotretinoin.

Issues with winter can include lower humidity, not getting enough vitamin D (esp. oily fish), lower levels of ceramides in the skin. IMO work on strengthening the barrier function: very gentle cleansing, very gentle or no exfoliating, moisturisers that contain skin friendly lipids like ceramides, cholesterol, medical grade lanolin.

Also review your diet and lifestyle ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Foods for skin health and mental wellbeing include oily fish, whole eggs, low sugar fruits, non starchy vegetables, seeds, beans and lentils. Reduce or avoid sugars, refined/ processed carbohydrates, larger servings of land animal muscle meat. Daily physical activity (at least 10,000 steps) is proven beneficial for mental wellbeing.

false,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;I meant uncomfortable in the sense that there are reports of people being assaulted and directly threatened. It was a euphemism I suppose.

This goes both ways. Using Bradford as an example, there are places where you're likely to be attacked as a young white guy. But there's a greater area where young asians are more likely to be racially abused and/or assaulted.

Poverty is the cause - not immigration. A 2 bed house in bradford is 2/3s the cost of a similar house in Leeds. There isn't a way out once you're in unless your income increases.

Restriction of freedom of movement is the key issue, both poverty stricken foreigners and locals are isolated in the same area, so tensions form.

&gt;To be fair the native chavs are just as bad but I have patience for neither. However, when the perpetrators are predominantly of one race and the attacks are sometimes racially or religiously motivated then I can understand why the locals blame immigration.

Except the locals are equally as likely to cause violence and more likely to throw abuse around.

It also makes knee-jerk response bills difficult to enact without at least a bit of academic rigour behind it.

The real problem isn't that it's undemocratic (the Parliament Act adequately solves that problem), it's that the appointments system favours too many retired politicians and not enough experts and academics. It is something that can be improved, and we will greatly benefit from it if we do.

To answer this question - no. I am a 16 (turn 17 by the end of this month) year old Russian immigrant. I live in a flat that we rent, and my family never had much money in general throughout their life (my mum gets slightly above the minimum wage, my dad gets somewhere around the median for our area, but income was much worse in the first 3 years of living here compared to now), so I can safely say that I'm from more humbler beginnings than most of my friends. This alone would be enough to put me into the ""working class"" category. But I won't. I don't feel as if this income bracket has defined my life outcome or opinions that I hold.


In my mind, working class is associated with less progressive views, lack of tertiary education, and negative stereotypes - think of the typical rude white van man. There are people that I know whose families are clearly richer, who didn't continue with education in college/sixth form and instead became apprentices or do plumbing or something. They also tend to like Britain First from my experience and lack progressive opinions. I'd associate them with the working class. I wouldn't even doubt that the plumber guys would earn more than me, no. But the cultural/personality factors alone are enough for them to be considered ""working class"" from my perspective.


Maybe the lines between the classes have been blurred at this age and would become more apparent as we grow up, but I don't know. I feel like I have somewhat enough socioeconomic mobility at this age to rise higher easily if you'd consider me working class.

Pros -

Night scene - I'm sure there is a great going out vibe in all your other choices, but Southamptons is really good. Not just in terms of clubs etc. but there are some cracking pubs, like The Hobbit, a LoTR themed pub, and the Union Bar is pretty nice. 

Getting around - everything is very accessible. You get a free bus pass if you're a first year (not sure that'll apply), but buses aren't expensive anyway. The town is reasonable, and is only a short walk from some halls, and a short bus ride from the university and the rest of the halls. Portswood, the main student area/highstreet, is also really close to the uni. 

Safety - Southampton seems to me a really safe city. Like all cities there a few areas you should avoid, but very few of my friends or acquaintances have been involved in crime, there is occasional crime, but it does seem to mainly involve non-students.

Evan Davis doesn't believe in planned obsolescence. 

Now, if I wanted to, I could make Evan Davis look like a fool, based on that, because it's a ridiculous thing to say. He might not believe in planned obsolescence, but Davis isn't a fool, he holds many other respectable views.

false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Your ethnicity is defined by you, personally, and most people define their ethnicity based on where they were born. 

Perhaps you're right and I'm mixing up race and ethnicity. However, as I say, it's mostly wrong when considering if someone is *nationally* British, which is all that should really matter, so I'm not too fussed. I thought ethnicity was to do with ancestry and race was to do with genetics, but if it's all one and the same or I'm completely wrong I'm happy to say I was wrong. It isn't important to me.

I don't care where you've come from, I only really care about where you're going to, and if you're an active member of society, working and living in Britain, speaking English, providing for your community and the rest of it, call yourself whatever you want.

My only objection to people in Leicester are the slow but sure increase of insular non-english communities that are gaining sure but steady ground on the backs of ""lets not be racist now."" And that would be an issue anywhere: if your family wants to be in England then learn English. Articles like [this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165075/Sri-Lankan-postmaster-refused-serve-non-English-speakers-sacked.html) - whilst taken with a pinch of salt - reveal that there are some communities where there are movements for other languages to be used alongside English. Leicester is where there was an attempt for non-english schools for example, though it was (thankfully) shut down very quickly. It made local newspapers, but I can't find any of the articles via Google. Things like the [Trojan Horse scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Trojan_Horse) in other racially diverse areas of the country make me wonder if similar things will happen elsewhere (if there ever was such an operation, as I never saw the resolution of the issue in the news).

I am somewhat cautiously optimistic about globalisation. I have no real objection to it, and no objection to immigrants - as anyone that does hiring anywhere says, immigrants have much less of an entitlement complex than anyone living in the country - so long as they are treated the same as everyone else. My dad stopped getting contract work because he couldn't compete with younger, harder-working, cheaper compute programmers. As I told him quite bluntly, good. That means that he didn't adapt, didn't change and deserved to stop getting work. Yes, it's a tragedy that he couldn't overcharge and drag his feet on every contract, but what was he expecting? Immigrants bringing an influx of talent and work ethics are great for a job market in my opinion because they ensure that everyone is pushed to work to their best to remain competitive.

Moving to statistics: whilst first generation immigrants are a minority according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester#Demography), the proportion of first generation immigrants in Leicester is more than double the average (23% compared to 9.2%). Which is statistically anomalous. Also suggests a lot of other interesting things: 18.6% Muslim compared to 5% Muslim is the easiest one to point out, and the 15.2% Hindu compared to 1.5% Hindu is perhaps an indication of the Indian population (which compromises 28.3% of the population). Following on from the ""english schools"" thing I mentioned about, nearly 1 in 2 children in primary schools prefers a language that isn't English (compared to about 1 in 5 across the entire country). Which is highly awkward, especially if they want to assimilate into society.. which should be aim of any immigrant into any place in my opinion.

When I emigrate to America in about 24 months time (following finishing my undergrad, postgrad and other similar qualifications) I'm not expecting the world around me to blur into my expectations and into my own little way. I'm expecting to have to compromise and adapt. If I was moving to Germany, I'd learn German (and when I was thinking of moving to Germany, I *was* practicing my German regularly) even though the majority of Germans speak English. How else would I conduct my day-to-day life? The issue Leicester has is that there's an increasing number of people who feel that they *shouldn't* have to learn English and that they *should* be able to live in the country without assimilating into the society that they're part of. And that doesn't work and isn't healthy... which is why I'm grateful that immigration policies are slowly increasing in difficulty.

Gaining permanent residency in England isn't as easy as some groups (such as UKIP) suggest. Somewhat easy? Definitely. So easy that you can waltz into the country? Of course not.

Cream cheese is great but you need a good sized serving to get enough bioavailable calcium.

You already sound like your diet could be deficient in a number of areas, highly restrictive diets are a disaster health wise. I work in lifestyle healthcare and I rarely (never) see keto/ low carb that is varied and balanced. 

To eat like our ancestors you would need to be eating piles of oily fish and other seafood (especially molluscs like oysters and mussels) including the mineral rich small bones, organ meats like liver and heart, a really wide variety of low sugar fruits and non starchy vegetables, plenty of nuts and seeds.

The sad story I have here is the library in Melton.

When I was young (as in, a decade ago when I was only 11), it was great. Open 9-8 every day apart from Saturday and Sunday (where it was open 10-5). They got a budget cut, so they started charging for reservations and interlibrary loans, so less people used those services, and their budget got lower again, so they reduced their hours to 9-5 and, unsurprisingly, numbers of people at the library plummetted. So they started reducing hours, or just dropping days again.

10 years later, no one I know in Melton uses the library any more.

Is this what's been happening over the entire country?
