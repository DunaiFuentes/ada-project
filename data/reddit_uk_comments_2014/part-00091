This doesn't surprise me in the least

Edit: last time I tried using their support site was in 2011/2012, but they were useless then too. Internet was intermittently down, I filled out their 30+ list of things to answer before posting a query, and the only reply I ever got was a member of staff asking ""what kind of problem are you having?"", Bitch I just fucking told you, are you mentally ill

Some potential red flags in this that apply to you are

* you have enough money to support and accommodate yourself without working or help from public funds, or you and any dependants will be supported and accommodated by relatives or friends;

For this you need to show that you have enough money plus a reserve to stay for your desired trip, if you are intending to live in London then be aware the baseline would be pretty high to live here for 6 months. Don't even mention anything remotely construed as work or you'll be on the first flight back to America

* you do not intend to live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits

I'm pretty sure using the flat as a base may flag up a few red flags if you keep appearing at the border every few weeks, all it would take is one arsehole working and you'd loose access to the flat. protip though, border staff seem to be a lot nicer outside the huge airports (heathrow, manchester)

Jumping up and down at every questionable decision that the current incumbent makes, and then celebrating ‘being right’ when he inevitably does fail is not, in my opinion, the role of a fan. Instead why not be open-minded and try to create a more positive environment for our players to play in? Criticise, of course, when it’s due – heck, there have been some abominations under Sherwood – but try to be broadly supportive. That’s my position, and that’s why I’m willing to give him a chance until he does something damaging to our club’s reputation, as with Redknapp and the England manager’s job."" 

I think this is the most interesting part of the article, is that it sometimes seems like people who disapprove of our managers want them to fail, and that this is toxic for the club. I thought that Sherwood was the best choice to (temporarily) take over for AVB at the time, but far from the best choice or a longterm solution. I will admit that when we went on a little run after Christmas I was excited and I like Sherwood's passion and energy. However, seeing him in the stands looking at his phone is probably the final straw for me. Mostly because, as the article eludes to, it was embarrassing. It's embarrassing when we are being laughed at and Sherwood is just sitting in the stands on his phone. 

The way I see it is that a new manger, especially an EXPERIENCED one like Van Gaal, can help right the ship with some consistency. I've always been a supporter of the Europa league for Spurs, but part of me is starting to think that playing less games, focusing on the league, and integrating our summer signings (probably from this summer as well by the looks of it) with a new manager and consistent system is way better for Spurs in the longrun.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"As a club, we have an identity and philosophy of attacking play. Arguably, this is one of the reasons that AVB was sacked in the first place. His system wasn't attacking enough for the fans, who were starting to get nervous and uncertain long before he was sacked.

I think we can all probably agree that we want to play attacking football, but I see people interpret that as ""two wingers and two forwards"" and others interpret that as ""a possession-based 4-3-3"" and any number of different possibilities in between.

For all his flaws, AVB had a clear philosophy and long-term plan for the team. Every player we bought last summer fit clearly and logically into his system. When we sacked AVB, though, we seemed to throw out the baby with the bathwater. I don't think appointing an inexperienced manager is inherently wrong, but I do think there needs to be clarity on the future of the team and what the plan is. If Sherwood was not behind (at least roughly) the same system that AVB was planning for, and we spent £100 towards, then we have a problem. And clearly we do.

Since we appointed Ramos in 2007, we've gone through four managers (Ramos, Redknapp, AVB, Sherwood) with wildly different playing styles and philosophies. In the same amount of time, Swansea have had 5 (Martinez, Sousa, Rodgers, Laudrup, and Monk), but they've been very careful about picking managers with a philosophy that matches the club's players, goals, and ideals.",0,1396299194,null,0,false,0,cggr2r9,t3_21thiv,t1_cggr2r9,t1_cggcerh,null,1433152099,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; . In the same amount of time, Swansea have had 5 (Martinez, Sousa, Rodgers, Laudrup, and Monk),

Its funny, i have cited this exact piece before on here when talking about managers.

When you look at Spurs, as you said, we have a philosophy of ""attacking football""...unfortunately we don't seem to care how that ""attacking football"" is player, nothing matter as long as we are going forward.  That is also the full extent of the team's identity, just get forward somehow, all that matters is attacking. 

It's not much of a defined identity adn it sounds like even within the club we didn't stick to the same ideas from senior squad to youth sides regardless of if the manager was AVB, Harry or Ramos.  It sounds like we had the youth do their thing and the senior side did their own thing (most notably that AVB played possession based football but Tim played a 4-3-3 attacking style with the youth).  We are disjointed from top to bottom.  There is a lack of true identity.

Swansea is actually a great example of what i think most of the fans want.  From top to bottom at Swansea everyone marches to the same drummer, senior side, youth team, parking attendants the fans themselves. Everyone is bought into what the club is doing and how it is being done. The philosophy stays, the management and players change.

Swansea are so bought into the system they have that it is what remains even when they make changes.  Martinez, Sousa, Rodgers, Laudrop all had their own spin on how they approached the ""Swansea way"" (for lack of a better description) but the tenants always remained. The basics stayed the same, the kids in the youth setup or senior squad didn't have to change anything.  If they need to change a manager they just need to make sure the manager can work within their system, as long as they can work within the system they become a viable candidate.

We lack this type of identity on every level, and this is one thing that could  make a lasting impact even if we didn't stick with a manager.

As far as following the team goes, it wasn't easy considering that this was probably the worst period in Liverpool's recent history for a wide-eyed, optimistic new supporter, with the only caveat being the new owners. I have to say though that it's been an absolute pleasure watching the team grow, despite a couple of false dawns, which I feel has strengthened my support for the club (i'm sure older fans will have experienced this but to a much greater degree).

My only recommendations would be to check the NHS Jobs website for admin roles.

Also, register and keep an eye on the civil service job site. The MOD (well Defense equipment &amp; support, Abbey wood) are crying out for staff at the moment. Although a lot of it requires qualifications/experience in commercial, finance, project management or engineering there are also a lot of inventory management roles with half decent pay. Well worth checking regularly, I know they've advertised in bulk for a lot of positions. 

My only other suggestion would be to go direct to companies.

Noble really needs better MF partners than what he got tonight from Nolan and Taylor. Nolan couldn't get forward (making him a terrible option at CAM) and Taylor's pace could NOT keep up with Sunderland.

I really liked the limited action I saw from the two Italians. They both played pretty well, especially what I saw from Armero coming on for McCartney.

The point I was making is that a lot of people lead the league. Some even do so for extended periods of time. It just isn't a very strong indicator of actual strength of a side unless you are competing when it matters, which tends to be after Christmas. I am not gerrymandering my qualifications to suit Liverpool--I'm being honest. 

Arsenal may well be a top side, but it isn't enough to say since you lead the league for a long time in the first half of the season, you are a title contender. This idea is actually very familiar to me as a Liverpool supporter, as we used to ""compete"" for the title for the first half of the season under Rafa before falling off and fighting for 4th. Sound familiar? No one thought we were actual title contenders then--at least not the supporters I ever ran into.

&gt;In May 2011, it was reported in non-UK media sources that Giggs was the identity of *CTB* in *[CTB v News Group Newspapers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTB_v_News_Group_Newspapers)*,  a footballer who had obtained an anonymised [gagging order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order) in relation to an alleged extra-marital affair with model [Imogen Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imogen_Thomas). Giggs took legal action against the social networking site [Twitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) after he was named by a user in a list of identities of individuals who had allegedly taken out so-called ""[super-injunctions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-injunctions_in_English_law)"".  A blogger for *[Forbes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes)* magazine remarked that Giggs had ""not heard of the [Streisand effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)"", observing that mentions of his name had increased significantly after the case against Twitter had been reported.

It's questionable whether we need one and the only purpose of an aircraft carrier is force projection. It could be to defend our overseas territories (but why we need three instead of one or two is still questionable) or to be able to take the fight back to anybody who threatens us, however the invasion of Iraq was done to pre-empt an attack on the West so having too much force projection could be indicative of a pro-active global foreign policy, rather than a passive and inactive one. 

I'm not sure whether I buy that he'd want to take a pro-active foreign policy. You can see from my flair that I'm not a fan of him, but I think there's plenty of legitimate stuff to criticise him over, without resorting to spurious hints that he might take a pro-actice foreign policy.

As far as I can tell, the design process on my R started with a perfectly reasonable bike - maybe the old R69S. They needed a bigger engine, but that meant a bigger tyre. Since with a shaft drive they couldn't just space a chain out a bit, they moved the rear wheel out of line with the front. The bigger engine's starter motor and things like indicators required a bigger battery, and there wasn't room to get it in and out of the top of the frame - so they made the back end of the frame bolt-on. Even though the rear suspension attached behind the joint.

The starter motor was a problem  - so just put it in the airbox. This meant a larger cover over the top of the engine, so make it out of thinner mag alloy (which rang like a bell) rather than plastic.

Then finally put the left and right footrests 1.5"" out of line with each other because the cylinders were offset.

Thankfully I'm old enough to have experienced the days of Matt le Tissier who, along with the large contingent of Norwegian players (Egil Østenstad, Jo Tessem, Claus Lundekvam) played their part in making me the Saints fan I still am to this day.

The moment that absolutely solidified my allegiance was when I was at the St. Mary's megastore in 2003-2004. I was there to buy a shirt since I'd out-grown my Østenstad one, and was trying to decide what name and number to get on the back. Who else walks in but the one and only Matt le Tissier? I was far too shy and humble to approach him, but there was no doubt in my mind about #7 Le Tissier once I saw him in real life. I like to think that the next time I walk into the megastore, Adam Lallana or Rickie Lambert is going to be there. But I shan't be buying a shirt until we get our stripes back...

3) rightfully so they're going to be hated by everyone else. 

Look you don't have to agree with me, personally I despise Suarez, I don't think he's changed and I hope he doesn't win footballer of the year because for someone who plays the way he does, biting people, getting people sent off and just playing unfairly far beyond what the majority of players do; I really don't agree with. 

I'm not saying we need a saint, Drogba had his faults, he was a prolific diver which I didn't like but he wasn't mean in the way he played. He was a hard player and got stuck in but he never did something which made me hate him. The same goes for terry. He was stupid in the CL semi's but it was a isolated incident of idiocy on the pitch.

On the other hand I don't want a player who could be potentially like Suarez, playing in a nasty way, and who could cause serious issues for the team. Of course I want us to win, i've supported Chelsea for 20 years and growing up in school in London full of Arsenal fans drove me insane, when they were winning everything, but the one thing I liked about Chelsea was the fact that they wern't and aren't nasty players like Keone and Flamini and Arteta and their countless number of cheats. 

I just don't get this concept of winning by any means necessary. Sacrificing all of your morals and standards just to see your team lift a cup isn't what I want. I want to like my team and see them compete rather than see it being taken over by players who I don't like and who no one else does either because they are bad sports.

Fuck me, it was depressing for me and the other few Liverpool supporters at my school. Then what happens? I move away and less than a season later we win the treble and I never get a chance to rub it in their smug little faces. I still remained friends with all of them and we always got on really well. We'd play football in the playground and we were all on the school team. But when it came to comparing teams and bantering, the only thing I had was ""well we have Owen"".

I would go back and visit every year for a couple of weeks to see family; still do, but very rarely saw them. What I **did** see though was a gradual progression in the area from a mostly equal distribution of Chelsea/Arsenal/Spurs shirts in the mid-90s to mostly Arsenal shirts in the late-90s/early-00s, to mostly Chelsea shirts in the early/mid-00s. The United shirts always remained constant throughout. But ugh, it was just depressing.

http://www.channel4.com/programmes/our-gay-wedding-the-musical

Although there is also a ''Watch Live'' function (which you can probably rewind on) and apparently it is being replayed now. So if you have an unblocker like Hola or Zenmate you might be able to watch it now. I use the Zenmate extension on Chrome. It's very easy. 

These are some trailers for it:

true,spiffing_,eng-GreaterLondon,Croydon't,"Detroit and Sunderland are not even in the same worlds. One was once an industrial revolution king pin, still full of factory and blue collar workers, not to mention facilitated as a dock. The other was a city piss poorly managed with no plan b after the industry folded, then unfortunately the 90s banking stupidity and somehow white flight made the place what it is today.
Detroit is not the single worst place, in the US it's all over. I've lived in Central Mississippi and Sunderland, Sunderland was nicer, even than people of Florida (where you get frisked going IN stores). Brits have a better cultural identity and are more community driven. You can see this with Redcar in the last general election, after their mine closed ... It was a landslide Lib Dem victory. 
The UK can't survive how it is, the gov needs to split like America where taxes are different depending on state. For example, in London people can't live on minimum wage, but in a place like Sunderland or Blackpool - work places can't even afford to pay minimum wage, then everything else adapts to that shape of life. Believe it or not Apple have a call centre in Newcastle which pay full time workers minimum wage, whilst Virgin/tesco/Thomson have them in Sussex that pay 1/3 more. Playing into hands, It shouldn't even be allowed! I digress...
Pallion - Sunderland hasn't got a lot going for itself; depressing box housing in Pallion and no regeneration make it dank. People settle down, have kids in their early 20s and are often grandparents in their 40s. These people are not like the south who invest their lives in monotonous offices, can afford work childcare (which Cameron has cut allowance for anyway).
