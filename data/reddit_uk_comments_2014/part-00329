&gt;Kaboul struggling

Kaboul is struggling in the higher line. Any striker that rides his shoulder causes him huge issues. When we played vs arsenal we sat a lot deeper which helped Kaboul out, seems better at intercepting crosses from deep and clearing long balls when not travelling backwards.

&gt;Soldado deal being £13m + addons

This seems to be revisionist history. No word of such a deal at the time and rumours first surfaced 12 months ago and sound more like spurs fans saving face. In fact, I remember a huge sticking point of the deal was that Valencia were in financial strife and needed a huge amount of ££ up front.

Soldado was very good in the first half, he put Adebayor through and Ade really should have done better, I would prefer him to start next week (in fact, I liked our offensive shape vs City).

false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"1 - The simple answer is that her sister had heard Maeve's plea through her worldwide call from the TARDIS and had decided to come home. She was hesitating at the last moment when the last of the vegetation dispersed.  

The complex (headcanon) answer is that Maeve was one of the the [Immortals](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Immortal) recently born of human stock, after all of the others had gone (back in the ‘70s… or was it the ‘80s). She was correct in believing that she herself had acaused all of the effects that we see - the instant forest and the otherwise undetected solar flare (which didn't have the same properties of a normal solar flare). The traumatic disappearance of her sister triggered (or possibly, was the first effect of) her powers manifesting. This, disturbing to her and those around her, prompted her being medicated, which subdued her powers again for a while, until the medication was forgotten on the museum sleepover.
Just prior to the museum trip, she had been given homework that inspired a vivid fantasy – one that she had drawn in her workbook. With the powers now free to operate, she subsequently, and unconsciously, formed the narrative of the world under threat and the sentient trees saving it overnight, only to find that it had become reality in the morning: she caused the solar flare and the global fireproof forest. Her call from the TARDIS included a command to her sister to return, so of course, she did.
The Doctor genuinely didn’t have a clue what was going on and the rationalisations that he was spouting were just for the benefit of the puddingbrains around him.
With a display of powers like that, the other Immortals will probably soon notice her presence and take her off with them.

For a cheap and cheerful option, make sure you skin is still damp-ish after washing, apply the toner, apply your moisturiser and a nice thin layer of Vaseline on top to seal it in at night. But definitely patch test the Vaseline just in case!

I'll admit to watching a lot of Napoli, as my dad was big into Maradonna some thirty or so years ago, so that and the love of Brazil is the only thing he really gave to me footballing wise. 

Napoli's been god awful this year (they're starting to turn it around) and it looks like lots of the players either don't like Rafa or aren't happy with the club in general for not strengthening the squad. The thing is, we'd have to get past De Laurentis, who I hear is a lot like a poor man's Levy. 

I think Callejon has been the highest scorer in Serie A thus far, and that's no small thing, even though teams up and down the table are getting more attacking than stereotypes of Italy would suggest. He's already played under Poch at Espanyol, so bedding in would be less of a problem I think, and has that J-Rod like advantage of being able to play on the wing or at striker, but is equally proficient at both. 

There's one other from Napoli we could even have a long shot at: Insigne. He blows hot and cold, but he's only like twenty and can be moulded. I'd love for either to happen.

Net contributions are easy to find: http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000273546.pdf thats of wiki but there must be newer sources too.

Imo financial impact of contributions/payments from EU is for UK rather small (5 pounds per months per person). 

The important factors are the ones that relate to business, migration and decision making (people here like to say they are controlled by EU and get no say, but UK is 3rd most influential country in the EU and gets to impact 500m people that way. I am not saying that UK has too much or too little power, just merely stating that it is more complex than many people paint it).

Unfortunately those factors are also the one that are not easily quantifiable into pounds, so yeah good luck with looking for unbiased sources ;)

Society is happy to routinely deprive people of Privacy in many situations. Society is happy for a criminal to be deprived of his right to privacy in order to be put in prison. Many are happy to have a drivers license, passport, so on. You are routinely deprived of privacy by your peers who monitor you on facebook, who see you IRL. You are probably happy paying with a credit or debit card to get a train, or go on a flight.

Data and information about you is constantly collected, monitored, even ignored through all of life's interaction regardless of who with.

Privacy is not something that exists in a vacuum. It exists dialogically alongside social and governmental interaction. You cannot have a predefined amount of privacy - you can't put a number on it. you can't ask the government for 82% Privacy, because that's not how Privacy works.

What you can do is show your emotion. Feel that something is not right. When you feel it is right, that's when you are subjectively experiencing privacy. 

We need Privacy. We also need to deprive people of Privacy.

I have no idea where the money came from - They axed the old chugging buses, cut the two First services that overlapped and stopped First operating the route. Sounds bad so far, right?   


However, these two cut First services with old chugging busses that broke down all the time were replaced with ""Stagecoach Gold"". The Gold service went to all the same places as the two First buses went to, they were a helluva lot cheaper, and nice new buses that are on time and kept in good condition. It's the best thing that's happened to the bus service there for ages.

Looking at the the threshold point:
&gt;Voted strongly against raising the threshold at which people start to pay income tax.

Finance Bill 2013-14 to 2014-15 — Third Reading — 2 Jul 2014 at 19:00

While upping the threshold, it also did:

Main rate of Corporation Tax reduced to 21% from April 2014. The Small Profits rate is set at 20%.
An increase in the ""annual investment allowance"", the amount spent on investing assets in a year which companies (or self-employed individuals) can deduct from their profits prior to the calculation of corporation tax due on the profits was increased to £500,000, whereas previously it had been £250,000.

I assume it's something to do with that.

Come on mate.

I share your sentiment, to a degree: We should have really put them to the sword once we'd scored, but the post and some good fortune came between us and adding to the goal tally. It was unsettling to see the way we failed to assert ourselves in the later stages, with panic even setting in as United tried for an equaliser, but I don't think the substitutions helped in this respect.

But we did win the game, deservedly. Depressed is a bit much. I was elated at the final whistle.

There was maybe a tinge of disappointment with the way the game ended, and likewise some concern, but there was still that satisfaction of coming out on top on derby day.

There's still work to do, and I share some of your disappointment at not smashing them once they had conceded and they looked vulnerable, but let's not forget how much a derby win used to mean to us not so long ago.

I'm so sorry your family has had to face what it has, nobody should ever have to rely on the NHS only to be let down so badly. The problems aren't something that more funding will magically fix, there is something fundamentally broken with the internal culture and structure of the NHS, which is only made worse by having Serco and G4S run things, but *won't* be fixed overnight even if all the privatisations were reversed. It is possible to have a public healthcare system without forcing people to accept all the current flaws of the NHS because ""it could be worse"". The CQC think that Mid Staffordshire was **not** a one off and the problems there are widespread, I agree with them.

We should be trying to work towards having having a functioning public healthcare system, instead of helping the ongoing privatisation and worsening standards which is happening *right now*, lower funding, longer waiting times, and unquestioned cultural problems in the NHS (not helped by understaffing and underpaying) because apparently people have got it in their heads that if you say anything negative about the NHS you hate public healthcare and ""just want to destroy it for profit"".

The decay heat from magnox fuel is low enough that spent fuel ponds aren't required (some power stations used CO2 filled cooling vaults, with some fans to provide circulation).

Magnox fuel that has had more than 1 month or so of cooling likely would be safe to store in air (from a melt-down perspective). The big problem with magnox fuel is that the cladding is very prone to corrosion, and is rapidly corroded by water - magnox cooling ponds and storage flasks are filled with water, with extensive anti-corrosion additives and a pH of about 12. If left in normal air, there is concern that water vapour in the air will cause severe damage to the cladding. In fact, there is such concern of the corrosion issue of magnox fuel that  has ever been exposed to water, that no one has ever tried to move fuel from wet to dry storage. 

The risk of explosion or fire seems rather exaggerated, unless the fuel is very ""fresh"" - i.e. removed from the reactor within a few weeks.

As you can see, 268 people are killed or seriously injured in collisions with bicycles each year. 2.44% of those involved are killed, which equates to 9 per year. On the other hand, 22,366 people are killed or seriously injured in collisions with cars each year. 6.05% of those are killed, equalling 1,361 people per year. Cycling also only accounts for 0.4% of deaths and 1.4% of serious injuries per year when it comes to collisions with pedestrians, despite making up around 2% of all traffic.

These figures don't separate who is killed on the road and who is killed on the pavement though, however the fact is that a collision with a bicycle is rarer than a collision with a car and is also less likely to end in death.

&gt;

&gt;The __broken windows theory__ is a [criminological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology) theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism) on additional [crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime) and [anti-social behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behavior). The theory states that maintaining and monitoring [urban environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area) in a well-ordered condition may stop further [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism) and escalation into more serious crime.

&gt;The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists [James Q. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Q._Wilson) and [George L. Kelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Kelling).  Since then it has been subject to great debate both within the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science) and the public sphere. The theory has been used as a motivation for several reforms in criminal policy, including the controversial mass use of ""[stop, question, and frisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-frisk_in_New_York_City)"" by the [New York City Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department).

This guy has done a lot of statistical analysis of the top European leagues--not just the Premiership--and has divided up the pitch into zones from which shots originate, and also divided up the shots into different kinds (headers, through-balls, assisted by crosses, etc.). From these two categories, he's calculated the shots that are most likely to score, and therefore each shot's contribution to the xG (expected goals, as you said). The larger and smaller squares represent the likelihood of scoring, calculated from both the area from which the shot was made and the variety of shot it was.

To illustrate, obviously the larger squares are mostly from right in front of the net. But, there's one big square from further. That's almost certainly Adebayor's shot from Soldado's through-ball: shots from through-balls are much more likely to score than other kinds of shots, so it appears as a larger square despite being further from the net than some other (likely headed) efforts.

Interestingly enough, what he's found challenges some football orthodoxy: crosses are pretty inefficient for scoring goals, while balls played to feet around the box are deadly.

It takes a couple hours, and then you go in a box and become effectively inert.

Who knows, being scattered afterwards might even be fun.  I'd take that over the prospect of weeks or months or centuries of feeling myself slowly rot away as insects and/or microbes chew through me.

And for that matter, if the story was true, Danny would have been feeling terrible throughout the episode.  It's not like the decomposition process would be much fun by itself.  And if he was in the morgue, he shouldn't have just been cold, he should have been *freezing*.  If his body was cold enough to prevent decomposition, that would be a hell of its own kind.

Yet he's merely a little chilly, and being told the worst thing imaginable is getting cremated.

Like, if this *isn't* a deliberate lie from Missy that's simply there to trick people into making it easier to convert them, the writers are being incredibly lazy about not thinking through their bizarro ideas to their logical ends.

Honestly, it's just a matter of disassociation. I don't feel any link to Britain at all. We are not any more economically tied to each other as Aus is to Germany. 


We apparently have a Queen that we do not associate or relate to at all - let alone feel any loyalty to. 



There is absolutely no dependability between our Nations, except me hoping you pull off a good Rugby World Cup next year. And indeed - that is the *only* thing we have in common at the moment: a very similar culture with historical ties, and therefore a similar Parliamentary and Legislature structure.


Overall, in this day and age it makes no sense for us to have a *British* Queen as the Australian (figure)head of State. The only arguable reason is historical ties. 



Essentially, becoming a Republic is strictly a figurative split. It's not like Scotland leaving - honestly, nothing will really happen except our Govt structure changes. 


The absolute largest supporting point I have for all of the above is the fact that if I want to immigrate to the UK, then it is no easier for me than it is an American. So why do I bother having the UK Queen as my figurative head of state? 


So you can see my thinking now. This proposal in and of itself would completely change my opinion of Aus becoming a Republic. If this link is re-established in the Anglo-sphere then I am more than happy to remain within the (figurative) British rule.

Haven’t you wanted to “borrow” the TARDIS to go back and undo or prevent a tragedy?  You have to do it before you get caught so you only have time to change one thing.  And doing so can result in unexpected changes to timelines – maybe for the better or maybe not.  Or no matter what you try to do it may not change anything.

What would you do if faced with having to choose only one tragedy to stop?  Which one of these real world tragedies would you choose to try to undo or prevent?  Would you:
   (1) Save a family member from death by their own hand
   (2) Save colleagues from horrific death and injury caused by fire 
        raining down on them from the sky
   (3) Stop a colleague from killing several others and then himself
   (4) Save thousands from 9/11

Personally, I am very conflicted between all of my short listed choices, especially between (1) and (4), but my preference is for (1).  Some might have a problem with choosing to save one who is close over a few thousand who are strangers.  I don’t.  What would your choice be?  Who lives and who dies?

Would you choose to save a family member, a friend, a colleague, or those you don’t know?  Would you choose to save one, a few, or a few thousand?  How far would you go?  What price would you be willing to pay?  What (or who) would you sacrifice to do it?

These are the questions that Clara never had to answer in the Time Heist.  What do you want most and what would you do to get it?  And her answer from the Dark Water dream sequence is “I would betray, even destroy, the Doctor to save Danny Pink.”  And what about Danny Pink?  Will he have to answer the same questions about what he would do to save Clara?  Will the soldiers in Pink and Blue be able to overcome their Cyber programming and fight Missy to save Clara (and maybe the Doctor)?  Or will they fight for different sides?

Clara’s descent into madness and her betrayal were what the Doctor foresaw when he briefly left Clara in Kill the Moon.  When he returned, his demeanor and comments made me think he had seen a bad future for her – now revealed as Danny Pink’s death and her betrayal of the Doctor in her effort to prevent it.  It may be a fixed point in time and the Doctor doesn't know if it can be changed or prevented from happening.  His comment to Clara was that the future is gray and vague.  He knew what would happen but not if it could be prevented or changed.

And if you were able to prevent something from happening, or change how it happens, are you sure that you could accept the consequences?  What if you know that when you change something others die because of what you change?  Or what if you know that if you fail you have to watch it play out again?  Would you still do it?

Would you even care about the consequences?  Are you ready to live with, or die from, the choices you make and the consequences that result from those choicest?  Are you ready to do whatever it takes?  What is the one thing that you want more than anything?  What would you do to get it?  Again, are you ready to do whatever it takes?

Here are other recommendations:

**First Doctor**

The Aztecs - One of the great historicals. Make sure you get the Special Edition though, because it additionally contains the only release of the newly discovered single missing episode of the four-part story Galaxy 4. (The other three episodes remain missing.)

The Tenth Planet - It's the first episode featuring the Cybermen, and the final episode with the First Doctor. It has the first ever regeneration. It also comes with a very good animated part 4 that replaces the missing final episode. The few surviving clips from part 4 are also on the disk (including the regeneration scene). 

**Second Doctor**

Tomb of the Cybermen - It's still one of the best Cybermen stories, and a classic.

The Enemy of the World / The Web of Fear - These two missing stories were the ones rediscovered last year, and they're both amazing! The Web of Fear also features the Great Intelligence, the Yeti, and the very first appearance of Alastair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, then a corporal, but who would go on to be the Brigadier. 

The War Games - This is the episode where we first learn that the Doctor is a Time Lord and we see Gallifrey for the first time. It's also the Second Doctor's final story.

**Third Doctor**

Spearhead from Space - It's the first Pertwee episode, the first color episode, the first Auton and Nestene episode, AND... the only one ever shot entirely on film, so it's the only classic episode available on Blu-Ray, which is *stunning*. SO worth it!

Terror of the Autons - More Autons, but more importantly... the first episode with The Master. A classic!

The Daemons - Just a good classic episode that's a fan favorite.

The Three Doctors - The Tenth Anniversary special features the first three doctors and delves into some important Time Lord back story. Another must-have.

The Time Warrior - The first episode with Sarah Jane Smith, and the first with the Sontarans. Another great episode!

The current whines are specifically asking for back doors on absolutely everything, for complete admin control on any technology provider. This is too much and any service provider that is specifically looking to offer its customers encrypted services it completely undermines the services they're offering to customers. Already we've seen many providers just shut up shop because they're actually ethical and refuse to continue their services following government demands that they weaken their services to permit a government backdoor. It can be assumed that those that still operate have obliged. We're starting to setup ""tells"" within the industry as the whole business is heavily NDA so if a certain part vanishes from the T&amp;Cs (e.g. ""we have never been asked by the government to open our services to them"") then we know that provider is in the process of government strong arming.  

The age of information changes the rules for everyone and just because they're feeling left behind shouldn't mean they get all the toys because they can't see a means of catching up. Specifically we should be able to offer the general public encrypted services without having to undermine them for government, if anything all we're doing is enabling more people to have access to these tools. If ISIS was a touch more organised they could write these tools themselves and use them completely bypassing any governmental backdoor into a tech provider.  

To repeat: this changes nothing for the worst of the worst just the new idiots that can't run their own tech.

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games(leave this one till last), Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World, Web of Fear (He is unfortunately the worst hit by missing episodes)

3: His entire first series is amazing (Particularly the Silurians)so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of Daleks but you alrady have that so  then I would recommend: Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), Logopolis.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good (He has audios but I don't really know much about his, I like Omega though)

6:the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did) (He is better on audio I would recommend Jubilee (the story Dalek is based on) and Davros)

7:Happiness Patrol, Greatest show in the Galaxy and his entire last season are all good (Audios again, I would recommend Master)

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it (He is better in the audios, as he gets good stories, but for recommendations ask someone more knowledgeable than I (for all the Doctors))


I realise this i a lot to choose from but for your 3 selected Doctors I would reccomend 

3: The Silurians or Inferno

5: Caves of Androzani or Kinda

First branch point I see was raised by /u/mithrasinvictus: if the silence's memory effect does not influence angels, the angel wins because the silence is in the same situation any other being (human, time lord, etc.). I will come back to not effecting a defensive state angel.  
Hence forth I will assume the memory effect is in play.  
Second branch point is freedom of movement. global freedom is plausible, but not entirely interesting, as the silence basically leaves by backing away. It then needs to only remain vaguely aware of angels, as this one will not remember to seek the silence out. So lets limit movement.  
Next we constrain the movement to, say, a pretty standard building. That means doors and walls. This still remains to the advantage of the silence as it merely needs to leave the room to be forgotten. It could buy time to rest by destroying the physical form of the angel, requiring it to be recovered. Then lets make it just a room.  
In this case, it comes down to relative recovery times and starvation periods. The silence again has a winning strategy if the angel recovers from physical form destruction slower than the silence rests. The angel wins if it recovers faster. Being the same gets nuanced in the mire of how either of their powers work on the other and the size of the room.  
Then lets consider starvation. The silence must need nourishment some how. If it starves before the angel wins or starves, I would call it a draw, with both losing.  
Since this is a staring contest, initial thoughts would be that they are looking each other in the eyes to start. This may doom the silence because of the angel's ability to imprint itself in the eye. More about effects of abilities nuance, but if the angel must transfer its essential self into the image, the silence wins, at the cost of its sight. Otherwise, it is the angel's match. Stop the image or stop the statue.  
Finally, one must question what it means for either party to 'win'. First to 'look away' favors the silence as it can move our of the angel's field of view while watching it. First to blink is a win for the angel: the silence must blink for the angel to blink. If the silence only needs to be forgotten and an angel can forget it, it only needs to move out of view and no longer see the angel.

Of three groups: Native Brits (born here); EU Immigrants; non-EU immigrants, only the EU immigrants are net contributors to public purse when considered over the period 1995 to 2011. The Brits took £11,000 per person on average more than they gave and the non-EU immigrants took £21,000. Each EU citizen in the UK actually gave £6000 on average more than they took. 

Note: since EU mass immigration is relatively new in comparison to commonwealth immigration you can't really rely on the statistics above alone to form your opinion on the subject. What you can do though is stop thinking that immigration from the EU has been bad for our economy, in truth we'd all be worse off if it hadn't happened, on average. This last word, ""average"", is very important - UKIP tend to rely on specific examples where one hard working Brit couldn't get a job in one small town to use emotion as a tool.

Yes, because we bought too many of 'tomorrow' players. Too much potential. Not enough seniority and experience. Not enough prowess and 'been there done that'.

No, because the kids look like they will deliver. I have high hopes from Markovic and Origi. Moreno looks the part despite some early mistakes.

There is very little reason to not use Vanguard for tracking indices, even where another fund is a bp or two cheaper. The methodology is generally better with Vanguard, with lower tracking error.

One thing that annoys me about L&amp;G is that they claim to use ""pragmatic indexing"", which means they won't always sell a fund on the day it leaves the index, or buy one when it enters the index. They claim this should help performance as they're not then forced sellers/buyers, but I would argue that they're introducing stealth active management, which isn't what most investors would expect from an index tracker.",0,1415095747,null,0,false,0,clsjbc9,t3_2l8wtc,t1_clsjbc9,t3_2l8wtc,null,1426199854,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

If the houses are about 6 years old, that's right on the cusp of the housing bubble - it's possible the people who bought, bought when prices were higher. You often pay a premium for a new build property because of aspects like brand new kitchens, the ability to choose certain features etc. so you'll frequently find that people have paid slightly more for new builds if they're the first owners. 

Also, it's a repossession which can reduce the price further for a number of reasons. Banks often don't make much of an effort with the state of repos, so they can sometimes stay on the market a while because of how they compare internally to other properties that are owned by people who live in them and take good care of them. This then affects the price because the longer a property is on the market, the more it is reduced in price in order to sell it. 

It's also possible that it is reduced in price because there's something wrong with the property structurally so they've reduced the price to account for that.

At least Borat led his interviewees down a dark lane by being as homophobic and sexist has he could to call others out. Dale Maley just seems to agree with them and that's it.

false,dicetheboss,null,null,"&gt; And that kind of clothing would be the kind of clothing that ethnic minorities tend to where, right?

Well, let me give you an example. In London, over 70% of gun crime is committed by blacks. So when a shooting occurs and the suspect is described as ""black male, wearing a hoody"", can you imagine how many suspects there are? This would go some way in explaining the ""disproportionate"" figures, I think. I'd be surprised if the police stopped and searched a black male in a suit holding a briefcase.

As for that article, it doesn't mention how the figures were calculated. Nor does it give any background information about why the figures are so high in certain areas. It makes it sound like there's absolutely no reason at all why certain groups in society might get stopped and searched more than others. For example, I'd like to know how many 60 year old black women they stop and search. Very few, I suspect. Why? For the evident reason they aren't a group which commits a lot of crime.

Of course, I'm not saying there aren't cases where people who don't deserve it get stopped and searched, but I think labelling the police and their tactics as racist and disproportionate is too easy, too vague and doesn't address a big part of the problem. It also helps in giving certain groups a victim mentality and that's one of the worst things you can create in society.

And another example would be the child abuse gangs that have been uncovered lately. If I remember correctly, in most cases over 90% of the perpetrators are Pakistani men. Now, when the police investigate these crimes, they'll probably end up interviewing, stopping and searching or arresting mainly Pakistani men. You could call this disproportionate, but when you look at the circumstances, it's merely a logical subsequence of the situation.

The formatting was manual, but I mod /r/ExpatFinance and made this:
[Reddit Post Formatter](http://expatfinance.net/reddit-post-formatter)

Could easily (and had planned to) knock together one for formatting portfolios too :)

I track all of my portfolio in Google Docs and built myself a dashboard from this with all tracking data.

[Example with some data redacted :\)](http://i.imgur.com/mgkOUGl.jpg)

The background stays in place and looks great, but it makes screenshots screw up...

All updates daily at 05:00 GMT and the charts update themelves.
The latest stock/find prices update themselves in real time so i can check through the day how the portfolio is doing.

I don't make any changes, but its just cool to check in on how it is doing.

&gt;Your portfolio is 20% non-equity, as cash and bonds could be roughly grouped together. It makes it pretty speculative but it all depends on the timeline/investment aims I guess.

I'm 27, looking to retire in 10 years with about $1.1m-$1.3m

Ill rebalance over time to a more bond heavy allocation, but for now I'm happy to push on boldly even on the understanding that this carries more risk.

&gt;REITs are an interesting one. My pension is only 5% exposed to property and I've been painfully missing out on the UK Property boom, but I'm just not a big fan of direct property fund holdings, for a number of reasons.

I am not a fan of property as an investment at all, but REITs allow me to tap into that market without the bollockache of owning a property.

Holding a REIT has actually made me more of a property fan.

The REIT is globally diversified so its pretty safe from any one market downturn, and it has performed very well.
I'm considering upping my allocation to REIT, but the global property market does feel very bubbly so I'm unsure.

I actually feel I will probably never own a house myself and probably own a $200k+ in a REIT and use the rental income from that to offset my rent.
Allows me the freedom to move as I please and massively diversifies my risk to any single property or property market.

I have no plans to return to the UK and may well retire in the Philippines where expatriate home ownership is prohibited anyway :)

To download a specific show, you can just use the PID.  This is the this is found at the end of the iplayer web URL.  So for the latest David Rodigan show, at this URL http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04n27pj the PID is b04n27pj.  To get this show, you use

    get_iplayer --pid=b04n27pj --type=radio

The --type is not needed for TV.  Also, if you use a PID, you do not need to tell it to --get.

To (kind of) use the command line as a PVR, you can use the programme index PID.  This is available on the main programme page, not the episode page.

So for Rodigan, this is available from this page - http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01q9qgc

If you use the command

    get_iplayer --pid=b01q9qgc --type=radio --pid-recursive

get_iplayer will step through the individual PID included in the index and try to download them one after the other.  If the programme is no longer available, it will skip it.  If you have already downloaded it, and it's still in your specified download folder, it will tell you this, and skip it.

So if you run this every week, you will just get the new episodes.  However, annoyingly get_iplayer will no longer name them correctly, rather using a generic title and the PID, so you'll need to do that after they are downloaded.

The idea of catching people after the fact is to then bring them before a judge and have them tried with the expectation of preventing a repeat offence (this is why prison is for rehabilitation, not punishment). This is not what is happening with mass surveillance. I have no problem with evidence-lead intelligence gathering. The problem is that the mass surveillance process is below the threshold of 'reasonable suspicion'. I would argue there is *no* reasonable suspicion that the *entire population* of the UK, or however many millions of people they're wiretapping every second through Tempura, are involved in illegal activity. Many thousands might, but *everyone*? Not in my opinion.

If this is all about crime, I'd question why things like [LOVEINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOVEINT) are able to happen.

I've seen this up for a few days but didn't think I could help initially.  But no one else chipped in so I might as well do something. 

My experience is working in IT infrastructure in London.   At lot of my friends are software developers  and it seems to me London is the best place to start looking because it has the most jobs in the smallest space.   That space being focused around the City of London Canary wharf where all the big finicial companies have lots of developers.   There is also the 'Silicon Roundabout' where lots of tech startups are supposed to be.   There are plenty of development jobs all over London though. 

I'm gonna guess that to give yourself the best chance you are probably going to want to already be living here.   I live in Hackney,  which is pretty close to the places mentioned above,  but still just about affordable if you sre working a bar job.  There are a lot of Spanish people here too,  mostly working bar jobs (and alike) while they persue their dreams.   Once here you'll be able to make yourself much more available and work on your English. 

Of course you might not have the money to move so you can and should start looking for jobs before that and save money while your still in Spain (I would have thought you will need 2000 euros minimum to move to London,  maybe more).  Anyway,  I would approach the jobs market in 2 ways. 

1. Lookup graduate programs at big finicial institutions, banks etc.  This will take a long time...

2.  Approach smaller companies about doing some remote work or an internship,  maybe for no money.

My issue isn't with the idea in principle. It may produce some outperformance, but equally it may not. That's the issue.

The point is, you're not paying them to make active decisions. You're buying a passive because you want the market return. If their ""pragmatic indexing"" produces a loss (which, all things being equal, it will half the time), they have failed at their basic objective, which is to track the index.

The effect of HFTs on indexing is overblown. Whilst an attractive concept in theory, the reality is that such a large portion of each tracker is effectively on a buy-and-hold basis, that any effect of HFTs on the small number of entrants/leavers in the index will be minimal.

They risk other people's money, other people's jobs, the common environment and finite natural resources, etc., they insist that the government takes the risk of basic general research and R&amp;D, builds the infrastructure, opens and protects foreign markets - by assassination and war if necessary, and so on.

My experience: I have zero experience at this job, since I'm looking for a trainning spot. I'm told that what I've been studying for is the equivalent of ""Certificate of Higher Education"" in UK. Other than that I know some C, C++, Java, PHP, SQL, MYSQL, HTML, CSS and others (no real life experience though)

My skills: I would say I'm a logic thinker and a team worker, usually been capable of resolving the problems I'm faced with

About me: I'm a 25yr old Spanish student, I've been studying English since I was 7 until 16, but since other than on the internet I hardly practice I may be rusty. I'm told though that my pronounciation it's surprisingly good

And you can't have efficient competition in a health service as to have real competition you need lots of choice for the ""consumer"" but to have 10 hospitals for everybody to choose from is massively inefficient as the cost of hospitals is so big.

Competition for contracts is not real competition as there are only a small number of providers that can give the service and the consumer does not really know who is providing what. I would argue universal health care is a natural monopoly and therefore competition is a problem and not efficient.

Also competition has other costs like competitive marketing, and profits which the NHS does not need to pay.

I think he's already an excellent player but that he'll become more rounded and 'professional' so to speak with time. There have been a few minor instances where I've felt like he went to ground too easily but from what Koeman has said in press conferences this season, he's strongly discouraging anything of that nature in training. 

With diving in general, you have to remember that when you're focused on running at such speed whilst controlling the ball in front of you, the slightest thing can put you off balance so even a fairly tame looking tackle or barge can cause someone to go to ground. So far this season I haven't really seen any of our team rolling around after a tackle but it's still perfectly acceptable to do so in my opinion. It's not like rugby or hockey where a tackle can wind you or genuinely injure you, a lot of challenges are similar to stubbing your toe on a coffee table; a very sharp and intense feeling of pain that you can shake off in a few minutes. The reason a lot of players can go to ground in agony and then get up to take a freekick is the same exact experience. Obviously that's not always the case and players do fake it but for most cases I think the above applies. But this season we've looked very much like we want to stay on our feet as much as possible!

In fact Last Week Tonight is really just Oliver doing an even more in depth Bugle on TV with a Daily Show like format and HBO levels of money. 

The issue is that most of what is tried in the UK TV tends to have too much extraneous crap for one reason or another. No one really wants to commit to basically just having one guy at a desk talking about serious stuff in a funny mock newsroom way for half an hour because that is, in fact, really hard to do well.

Main point being it's not that the format that wouldn't work here it's just that the format *is really hard to do right*. Remember we are effectively only talking about three programs of any kind of quality in the US with the two that aren't the Daily Show being from people who worked at the Daily Show.

**SUMMARY** 

Non Pension Savings:

* 50% Cash. Santander 123 Accounts yielding about 2% after tax.
* 45% Diversified Global Equity Trackers
* 5% Global Bonds


**SIPP** (Just Started this year with 6% Employee contribution, claiming 40% tax relief). I'm currently adding a decent top up amount per month to my salary and employee contribution. I figure that the 40% tax relief opportunity should be taken advantage of now.

* **FTSE Tracker** - 50%
* **All World**  - 40%
* **Japan Tracker** - 10%

My pension fund selection is manual and a bit ad-hoc. As time goes by I will probably normalise it by paying into a Lifestyle strategy fund.

**ISA** - Charles Stanley Direct .. It's a total mess of multiple funds as I got a bit carried away!

**Vanguard FTSE Tracker ACC** - 20%
**Vanguard US Equity Tracker ACC** - 10%
**Vanguard Japan Equity Tracker ACC**- 10%
**Vanguard Ex UK Europe ACC** - 5%
**Vanguard Pacific Ex Japan ACC** -5%
**Vanguard Global Small Cap ACC** -5%
**Blackrock Europe Tracke ACCr** - 10%
**Blackrock Global Property ACC** - 5%
**Blackrock Emerging Markets ACC** - 10%
**Vanguard Global Bonds** - 10%
**Vanguard Short Term Bonds** - 5%

I tend to top up the Vanguard funds on a monthly basis manually when I feel the market is a bit lower than usual.

**CASH**
About 50% of my current total savings (Including ISA but not Pension) are in Santander 123 accounts. This yields about 2% interest after tax.

I'm sitting on this cash as I think I may need it for a house deposit in the next year or so.

I certainly think it's unfair to drop Coutinho and Sterling. Aside from Newcastle where everyone was poor, they've been excellent. But Sterling definitely needs a rest. 

Gerrard is probably resting because let's be honest BR doesn't seem to have the balls to drop him due to form.

Lovren has probably been dropped. He's been awful.

Allen? I'm not sure. I don't think we've seen enough of him to decide what form he's in, I suppose Rodgers has made that decision based on him in training. 

Manquillo and Johnson seem to be battling it out for that RB spot so I guess it's just whoever BR thinks has been better in training and will suit the tactics for the match. 

It's certainly interesting. Depends on the formation we play with them as to how successful it'll be (not that that will change the result much).

I will support Markovic as long as he is a Liverpool player, as I have done my entire life and I will never damn a player forever, but I will NOT make excuse after excuse for players who haven't shown even an ounce of encouragement. 

Yes I believe he can be a good player for us, he's only played a handful of games and I will reserve my judgement but that doesn't mean he hasn't been awful for us because he hasn't put in a decent shift in a red shirt yet.

Your point was that - hypothetically - this teacher may have been bullying him, and for a 15 yr old boy this can amount to a serious problem.

All I have heard is that he fostered a deep irrational hatred, and offered no explanation. So sure, for all we know it is *possible*, but it remains a baseless hypothetical for now.

An act that ensures he will be reviled by all for what remains of his now useless and despair-filled existence?

Look at Stargate Atlantis for example. Alot of the series went down hill when repetitively the writers included filler episodes that included 'lovey-dovey' personal background sub-stories and that pointless to the story line. It less off-world activity, less fun to watch, and sometimes you'd switch off the tv/computer

However this because the series was budget restricted. So a certain restrictions on the quota for offworld location or CGI episodes could be filmed",0,1415109287,null,0,1415109473,0,clsmain,t3_2l6r92,t1_clsmain,t1_cls3wgp,null,1426198423,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If 12 met...

Rose: It would be a reunion between two ex-significant others.  It wouldn't be painful, nor awkward; 11 had since found love and has had a millennia to get over Rose.  It'll have been weird because Rose was supposed to be the one to age, and here we have 12 who looks decades older than 10.  He'll approvingly nod at Rose and be reluctantly hugged.  Then he'd shake hands with meta 10 and be on his way.

Martha: He would brag to his current companion about how this one saved him and the world from Missy (when he was a he (long story)).  I imagine there would be Blink references.  He would call Mickey an idiot once last time and fly off.

Jack Harkness: I feel like he would be extra intolerant of Jack's flirting but still regard him as a really close friend.

Donna/Wilf: I'd imagine he would visit at Wilf's eventual funeral from a distance and leave something behind for Donna.  There couldn't be any interaction because Donna can't remember him.  He'd then go back in time to a few days before Wilf's death and secretly take him for a last stargazing on the TARDIS.

Amy and Rory: I would imagine he would observe them live their lives in the 50s from a distance due to some timey wimey excuse.  If they did meet, Amy would definitely question the accent.

River: He would carefully watch her and 11 from a distance as they honeymoon somewhere in the universe and reminisce the times he shared with the woman who would've let the universe unravel just to keep him alive.

The reason, according to this accountant, is that the government of the day would have had to go through different legal channels to introduce it if it were a tax so called it something else. 

So whilst it's very clearly a tax (which is how I suspect you are visualizing it) the country maintains the fiction that it is NOT a tax because otherwise its introduction would have been illegal. It's insurance - just a form of insurance for which they'll send you to prison if you don't pay it. So quite definitely not a tax. No siree.

Ideally there'll be some sort of compromise which redistributes the HoL representation  more fairly to the regions but doesn't scrap the wealth of experience it boasts. There are plenty of older members who could probably be persuaded to take early retirement to let in new blood.  

If it was up to me I'd solve the representation issue by making the Lords move out of the wealthiest areas of central London and have them live in ordinary middle and lower class areas around the country such as run down council estates, it could be a reality TV show. Except for the technocrats, I'd let them live in luxury. In fact, I'd rather just wait for the point where we can be ruled by technocratic supercomputers, dressed in lovely red robes.

And no it's not easier to ride a bigger bike. Riding skills and road awareness are learnt over time. I agree the licensing system is very protracted, but it's what we have.  More power makes nothing easier, except overtaking.

We also have an extremely low mortality rate when compared to open to open licensing on the us. I made an argument with a us guy some months back that I'll link showing comparable figures per rider. Weather I or you agree with how long it takes to get a license, numbers don't lie.

Here is the post I made about mortality rates

Your maths don't add up to me...

The US had 4 million motorcycle (ish) and the UK as of 2011(ish) has 1m

By your own governments admission the fatality rate of bikers in the US per 100k bikes is 73.42

We don't have that direct result but my maths work as follows;

1m bikes with 362 fatalities. This results in  =0.000362 fatalities per uk bike registered, resulting in a figure of  =36.2 deaths per 100k registered bikes

Your inflation of the numbers was incorrect, The actual numbers are 

US = 73.42
UK = 36.2

By my reckoning if the UK had the same amount of bikes the results would look like

US = 73.42 x 40 = 2936 total fatalities

UK = 36.2 x 40 = 1448 total fatalities

So about half the fatality rate per rider, on as stated, worse roads and with higher congestion.

Either way, the UK figure is to high...The less bikers die the better. It is clear and proven that improved rider education and training leads to reduced fatalities and accidents. 
However in the interest of full disclosure, a proper evaluation of all injured persons and how they correlate would be better, fatalities aren't the whole story.

I'm not saying its a likely deal but Khedira is available on a free and the fee received from selling Mikel could more than cover Khedira's wages for a couple of seasons - not only that but every aspect of Khedira's game dwarves Mikel. Why people insist we keep Mikel when there are clear upgrades available for relative inexpense on the market baffles me.

I think when people criticise Mikel some all of a sudden become sentimental and remember a handful of games where Mikel's style has helped us win and argue his vital importance to our play. They don't however realise that its taken Mikel 8 years to rack up so few great performances, when players like Costa and Fabregas were winning us games week-in-week-out from day one. I've never said Mikel was an awful player, but he's not even in the top 30 in his position in my opinion and why should one of the best clubs in the world settle for that

For about 3 years on the bounce Arsenal were the premier league crisis club at this time of the year after losing big players, but their form improved when players adapted (I remember Mertesacker getting heavily criticised the year he signed).

I definitely think attacking wise we're suffering due to a lack of knowing what we're supposed to be doing, and sometimes it takes time for a manager to get that understanding across.

People seem to think things have to keep going up for progress to be made, but sometimes it's not always that linear. Which is why it's paramount Rodgers gets the time to sort things out, and 10 games isn't the time to complain that we're not getting any better.

As for the fear of losing players. I'd like to think we're safe for another year at least on that front. The difference somewhat with Arsenal is that players like Van Persie, Fabregas, Nasri etc joined with the belief that they'd be part of a title challenging side, I don't think Sturridge, Sterling, Henderson or Coutinho would have those heights of expectations for Liverpool in the immediate future.

There's your first problem. Don't do that.


&gt; every other week we get the rubbish bags torn open and emptied around the area)


are you sure this isnt just foxes ? its common for them to tear into rubbish looking for food scraps.




&gt;    Huge alcohol problem

you live near a pub, this is your real problem. While there is a certain argument for there being few things to do except drink, I wouldnt say alcohol ever causes me any problems, day to day.


&gt;    Chavs everywhere who looks like they cannot mind their own business and keep on harassing other people (usually older or generally weaker people)

It has never been an issue for me in any city i've lived over the past 33 years. Even in doncaster which is full of low income families.


&gt;    Violent behavior (often connected to the alcohol problem)

I've never encountered violence , even living in london where its supposedly worse.

&gt;     Anti-social behavior (I live in front of a pub and every other week we get the rubbish bags torn open and emptied around the area)

see above points.



&gt;    Second-world hygiene

what does this even mean ? What are your hygiene standards ?



&gt;     Pollution and dirt (keeping the rubbish bins next to the front door does nothing to alleviate the problem)

I've yet to live anyhwere these are problems. 

&gt;    Dangerous driving/speeding/tailgating

There are some idiots, but generally we have the safest roads in the world

&gt;    Generally, it doesn't feel like a very safe place to live, especially if you walk alone in the evening/night, chances are you are going to run into some drunk bloke looking for trouble

Even when i lived in the worst part of london I never felt like this. I've never encountered trouble with drunk folks, and i have no safety concerns going home even at 1am which I do sometimes. This has been the same in York, Doncaster, when i've visited scotland or manchester etc.

&gt;   Absolutely dismal standard of living due to the cost of living (note that I am not saying anything by the cost of living per-se, it's the income/outcome that is a joke)

never had an issue with this. I save over 60% of my income living in london , and this %age has increased a lot  from when i was living up north.

&gt;    Poor housing standards: homes are very low quality and extremely overpriced (understandable perhaps because of the area) and energy efficiency is a dream

not found this a problem either. The only home i've ever lived in that was 'low quality' was also very cheap and included bills in the cost. I moved out after 18 months. Everywhere else i've lived has been fine. Expecting energy efficiency seems odd - given that most houses in the UK were built at least 20 years ago before it was even a concept.

The UK were in many ways on the leading edge (probably behind France and the US) but Liberalism had been an idea who's time had come for a century before the backs of the nobility finally broke. It was only in 1911 that the old establishment was finally put out to pasture. Only slightly more than a century ago.

For pretty much the entire 1800s Liberal governments were returned. They were either actual Liberal governments or Conservatives with a mandate to reform.

I live in a nice village in a rural location, but it does have a high number of social housing properties. 

There is no evidence of an alcohol problem, there are two pubs in the village, but you never see people walking the streets with can in hand.


The Village 'Chavs' say hello to you as you walk past.

There is no 'reported' violent crime in the village, or surrounding area. But I do live in one of the safest places in the country.

A recent case of anti-social behaviour (graffiti on a fence) lead to the police knocking on doors asking people about it. If the police have time to tackle this level of crime, there can't be much in the area.

Not sure what you mean by second world hygiene.

Pollution and dirt - very little, if any litter, and very good air and water quality in my area.

Driving - we do have a high number of car crashes and accidents. But there are a lot of fast country roads, motorbikes and cyclists. Most the accidents tend to be 'city' folk who are inexperienced in rural driving.

I don't think my current living standard is too bad. I live well within my means and have a good amount for disposable income, and a good rate of saving.

Poor housing - I'd agree for new housing stock, but the old houses are solid beasts.

Now if I was to run through each point for central Salford (where I used to live) I would very much agree with you.

The UK is a country that varies so much from rural to city, north to south, country to country. I don't think things are getting worse, I think things are either improving, or staying the same.

It depends on what you value. For the average Englishmen, that would be a fantastic life. I mean, for anybody on less than that it would still be nice. But really, all it gets you is more stuff and chances to escape, but in reality it doesn't change your situation. You need a lot more to do that.

£50k a year in many other places would grant a really, really nice life. But IMO the biggest problem in the UK is the issue of SPACE. Money here buys you space which is the main factor in the quality of life. Smaller villages with bigger houses and gardens etc. 

In other countries you can still buy a decent sized house, with decent land on the plot, on an average salary. That's when you truly feel like your own man.

Personally, I think we need to mix up the playing style more and manage games better.

We need space behind the opposition defense to exploit Sterling, Borini, and to give Balotelli more room to work in.

Back to serious bizness, though-- so I gather it's not that you're *unaware* of the concept of homoerotic subtext; more that you disagree with it? Because to my ears, that's essentially saying that if a random character's sexual orientation is not explicitly stated in text to be gay or bi, they are automatically to be assumed heterosexual because heterosexuality is the default.

To me, that seems an odd assumption to make about a being (The Doctor) who has both received and initiated kisses-- on the lips, no less-- with males onscreen and shown no distaste in doing so. And, oh, by the way, we now know that members of this species can change gender during their lifetimes.

So, what textual proof from the show have I missed that the Doctor and The Master are both good little heterosexual or asexual aliens who would never think impure thoughts about each other while, say, having heated conversations on the telephone, or forcing one another into nonconsensual pet-play scenarios, or, y'know, *swordfighting*?

You're thinking of *The Five Doctors*, but I have to disagree. President Borusa promises that if the Master helps the Doctor reach Rassilon's tomb at the center of the Death Zone, Borusa would give the Master a new regeneration cycle. But by the end of the episode, President Borusa is neutralized and the Master is sent away without gain.

The next time we see the Master, in *Planet of Fire*, the idea that the Master is in another regeneration crisis is shot down only because ""his present body must be good for a few years yet"" and is described as ""an injured Time Lord who can't regenerate"".

The Master did gain a new set of regenerations, of course. A plausible origin for his new set is that they were part of his resurrection by the Time Lords, hoping he would fight in the Time War. Some speculation is required because, though his resurrection by the Time Lords was mentioned in *The Sound of Drums*, we didn't see it in any episode.

As for mechanism to grant people regenerations, there is some history beyond the Master merely being promised a new set.

I would argue that all the things they are reporting aren't hyper-violent in comparison to our past. Much of the stuff you are comparing too is probably the 80s or the early 90s which with nostalgia probably feel a lot safer. (because god knows that 50-70 certain weren't violence free, riots and other bits and bobs).  But you had stuff like the miner-strikes and open-violence against gays and lesbians etc in the 80s.

First of all, the name ""Missy.""  When she said  ""Missy.  Short for Mistress.  Well, I couldn't very well keep calling myself 'the Master,' now could I?"" I almost rolled my eyes because it was exactly what I was expecting.

Secondly, I didn't really think she was in ""Heaven,"" I figured that was a red herring and Missy, like the Doctor, lies.

Thirdly, I remember there was a point where she welcomed someone to ""heaven"" (I think it was the soldier in Into the Dalek) [she](http://cf.foreveryoungadult.com/_uploads/images/dw-8x01-deep_breath-6.jpg) tilted her head back and spread her arms, kind of like how [every](http://youtu.be/M2RSVNDUfXA?t=1m32s) [single](http://youtu.be/XEObBX_HwFc?t=3m23s) [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm0rc5Rzxuk) [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvz_uRp8xzA) timelord has regenerated on screen (since the reboot at least), they have assumed that pose, the exception being Paul McGann.

Fourth, her familiarity with the Doctor.  I figured this could be a red herring too, but in the end it wasn't.

The only one of these things that pointed to her being the master specifically was her name.  What this really all meant was that she was at the very least a Timelord.  But I didn't think that Moffat would bring back an old character/villain from before the reboot because that would exclude a great deal of the viewership from the excitement about the reveal of Missy's true identity.  So that excluded the Rani and Susan Foreman.  The only other Timelord character of any importance was River, but I thought it would seem stupid if they brought her back (she literally died twice) to be a villain after she started out as a villain and then turned good again.  The only time when I thought that she might not be the master was when Missy said that she's the ""one [the Doctor] left to die"" because the Doctor didn't really do this to the Master, but he did kind of abandon Susan Foreman, so I could see her being pissed off about that.",0,1415117795,null,0,false,0,clsq72u,t3_2l98mg,t1_clsq72u,t1_clsp5vd,null,1426196556,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

false,gabsygabs,null,null,"The Doctor, as I've said, is a character with limitless possibilities. I would also argue that a lot of the writing is done after the casting, besides a more general overarching story line at least. Writers would cater for whoever was picked for the role, and because of the way the character functions, there WOULD be a lot of 'wiggle-room'.

Whether it's sexist/racist to have restrictive casting is a complex question, but saying outright that The Doctor shouldn't be a person of colour or a woman *is* sexist/racist, because it defies the limits of the character.

edit: sorry, had another thought:

A lot of people say that a character should be black/a woman/gay/whatever if it's important to the character, or if it's necessary. I would argue a lot of the time that having a white character, or a male character is not necessary in the slightest. People need to justify their reasons to have a character who belongs to a marginalised group, but for white/cis/straight/male/whatever characters, writers rarely do that. What these writers forget is that *yes*, marginalised people exist in real life, and their status as marginalised doesn't have to serve a function. It can add to character, but it doesn't have to feed a story directly. This is why most attempts at writing queer characters tend to focus on their queerness instead of them as a character. For a polarising example in Doctor Who, Captain Jack is pan/polysexual, but there is waaaaay more to his character than that. A bad example of this writing would be the Fat/Thin Gay Catholic Whatever Soldiers - they are literally defined by their identity and nothing else.",0,1415118011,null,0,1415118718,0,clsqb4q,t3_2l0dq2,t1_clsqb4q,t1_clspr9w,null,1426196505,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I work in the NHS where this is literally the staple of everyday life. Nurses and doctors usually get paid on nationally agreed ""salaried"" contracts. i.e. £25K per year full time, based on a full time week. However, in reality many may end up systematically working as many as 2-3 hours extra every day - not out of choice, but because they have a legal responsibility to provide a certain level of care. If they get paid to work 8 hours a day, but meeting their responsibility means working 10, then they work 2 hours extra every day. Some employers try to make up for it by giving people that time back from future shift patterns, others have nationally agreed pay banding where they get extra money for working those extra shifts. 

Now, I believe in the most part the NHS actually does pay holiday time inclusive of overtime banding, So let me give you a theoretical example that could apply to those affected; a staff member earning £30K on paper, but with an overtime bonus of 50% for working 48 hours a week actually earns £45K... so a third of their pay is made up of what is ""compulsory overtime"" (i.e. time over 40 hours a week). That works out to about £3750 before tax each month. Now, if they took 2 weeks holiday one month under the current system some employers could pay £3125 a month instead of the £3750 they would otherwise get... that doesn't seem right to me.",0,1415118894,null,0,false,0,clsqryz,t3_2l91hw,t1_clsqryz,t1_clsm0h3,null,1426196287,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Many jobs, particularly those in the public sector, pay an annual salary that is nominally based on a certain number of hours per week... however it is often impossible to do the job within those hours, so you are effectively working for free for the extra hours.

In the NHS where I work there are two main mechanisms they use to deal with this;

* In the case of nurses they usually get overtime hours back as additional holiday since they are on shift rotas, where the number of hours worked over their shifts is added up to make a monthly total, of which they have a minimum commitment. i.e. if they have a minimum commitment of 40 hours a week that's about 160 hours a month. So if they work 13 x 13 hour night shifts one month that would mean they could do one less 9 hour day shift the next month, so it all balances out in the end.

* In the case of doctors they undergo exercises called ""band monitoring"" where they record the number of hours they actually work vs what they should work. The average is then calculated and they are given a pay multiplier based on the number of extra hours. So for example working 48 hours a week (instead of 40) at mostly unsocial hours would give them a whopping 50% pay multiplier. It's significant because that means 33% of their annual salary is made up from compulsory overtime. However, even then it still isn't based on a specific number of hours.",0,1415119746,null,0,1415119955,0,clsr8sl,t3_2l91hw,t1_clsr8sl,t1_clsqkhm,null,1426196069,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think there are also stories that should be told directly about someone's identity, but in a sensitive and exploratory way. You can write a story about a female time traveller, and explore what that might be like for a woman specifically - chances are your story would be different to what the story of a male time traveller's would be like.

Both these kinds of stories are fine if handled well, but the issue comes from an over-saturation of both in the media from a majority perspective. For instance, out of every Marvel film made or planned so far, there is only one black lead and one female lead. Superheroes can explore a variety of scenarios, but writers consistently choose to make their heroes white/male/straight... you see where I'm going.

I think the basic request is for variety. We want different characters in all types of media, whether those media be directly about their differences or not.

Actually, it is. If you're a nurse or doctor and fail to provide adequate care it is **you** the individual who have to answer for it. You cannot simply punch out because your shift has finished. This isn't software engineering... If you are giving chest compressions because someones heart has stopped beating you can't just save the situation to disk and load it back up tomorrow morning where you left off. You're there until the situation is over, regardless of when your hours ended. As such the NHS has to have mechanisms to be flexible about hours - and indeed it is. That is why staff pay is not hourly, but rather based on annual contracts. If it was based on hourly payments the government wouldn't be able to afford it. 

&gt; The NHS treat their staff like shit and we all know it. It's not like that everywhere else, believe it or not.

The NHS are known for being an exploitative employer, but I think its more widespread than you would realise outside of that industry to.

If the sole qualifier for getting into the debates was having an MP, you'd have an excellent point.

However, it isn't, so parroting this desperate cry of ""but we have an MP!"" doesn't change anything.

UKIP isn't getting into the debates simply because they won an MP.

UKIP has come second in every by-election for the past two years, when was the last time the Greens came second in *any* by-election?

UKIP's polls have had them trending in the teens for a year

UKIP became the first party in over one hundred years to beat the Conservatives and Labour in a national election, the Greens on the other hand, actually had their vote share go *down* in the EU elections of 2014, from their previous result in 2009.

These are the reasons UKIP got into the debates, if you want to argue that the Greens should be there for balance, that's one thing, but pretending they're worthy of being there based on popularity and support is just false.

&gt;I am not aware that the Ofcom ever said that the Green Party was not deserving of the same treatment. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10674846/Ukip-must-be-treated-like-any-major-party-Ofcom-rules.html

Ofcom ruled UKIP deserves to be treated as a major party, for the EU elections atleast. They did not say the same of the Greens, ergo, the Greens were not deserving of the same treatment.

Since then, UKIP has come first in the EU elections, and their polling has remained high, the Greens have had a trickle of increased support, but the biggest boast I've seen is that they're outpolling the libdems. Which on the face of it is a great achievement, but considering that's more the result of the libdems support plummeting rather than the Greens rising, it's hardly the resounding success it's claimed to be by Green supporters.

false,SillyNonsense,troughton,Troughton,"On another forum I put together a post describing how the Master got to each form to help confused folk. If you pick at it you'll find holes and discrepancies. Much of his history is scattered across multiple conflicting media and filled with assumptions. I just did my best to set it fairly straight and fill in the blanks. Differences *can* be argued, this is for ease of understanding. 

* [Delgado](http://i.imgur.com/7vXpEci.jpg) When we first meet the master he is already on the final incarnation of his original regeneration cycle.

* [Pratt/Beevers](http://i.imgur.com/lrpyCd2.jpg) Technically the same incarnation as Delgado. The master's newest plan gets foiled and he gets hit by his own weapon, which severely deforms him, causing him to deteriorate over time and look like a corpse.

* [Ainley](http://i.imgur.com/5RQ132j.jpg) To restore his health he takes the powers of the leader of the planet Traken, which allows him to steal the body of one of Traken's inhabitants. However, he is possibly no longer a Time Lord.

* [Roberts](http://i.imgur.com/J4W7rOQ.jpg) At a later time he was captured and put to death. However, before death he had merged with a symbiotic life form that could contain his consciousness. It slithered out of his ashes and merged with a human man, restoring him to life in another stolen body.

* [Beevers](http://i.imgur.com/i21kEeX.jpg) The symbiote causes his body to rapidly deteriorate so he hops from person to person for a while, using each one up before moving to the next.

* [MacQueen](http://i.imgur.com/1MLxr9w.jpg) The Time Lords restore the Master as a Time Lord in a new body with the intention of using him against the Daleks. He suspected that they had bigger plans for him, but he did not know what.

* [Jacobi](http://i.imgur.com/wzEGAN1.jpg) The Master (possibly in this new Time Lord body's second incarnation), learns that the Time Lords resurrected him for the Time War. He flees to the end of the universe and uses a chameleon arch to hide.

* [Simm](http://i.imgur.com/3Snj6xe.jpg) He gets shot and regenerates into a new younger body. This incarnation dies after getting shot again, and he refuses to regenerate.

* [Simm](http://i.imgur.com/kvtL5Jw.jpg) His essence had been stored in a ring he wore, so that combined with some of his DNA was able to restore him to life in a new identical body. However, the process was tainted by poison which messed him up and did some weird shit.

* [Gomez](http://i.imgur.com/Esm1pp8.jpg) He got sucked back into the Time War on Gallifrey and through unknown means achieved a newly restored Time Lord form... as a Time Lady.

Basically wondering ""are we shite or have we had a pretty difficult run of fixtures?"" I thought this was helpful in comparing us to teams like Southampton and Newcastle, who have played more top 6 fixtures at home or fewer overall than have Spurs. When you look at it, 6 teams have payed fewer of these fixtures than we have (only 4 have played more) and we're tied for the second least still remaining (with the caveat that we only play 10, compared to 14 teams that have to play 12 such fixtures).

Basically, my attempt was to illustrate that we've had a more difficult run than I think people are giving us credit for (This also highlights that QPR and Aston are probably better than their current table placement), and perhaps with the upcoming fixtures--Stoke, Hull, Everton all at WHL--we'll see a solid bounce-back and be sitting in a favorable position while we wait for the December Wallpaper to com out from /u/lou3000.

You are suggesting the only choice we have is between a monolithic state-owned state-run healthcare system and a totally open market where people pay for the treatment they receive, either directly or indirectly through insurance. More fear. Private providers in the UK are very good, especially when compared with the NHS.

Quite true, it's certainly not binary. I still think the state is a better provider of healthcare without the involvement of the private sector. I don't think the feedback loops are there for a market. It's beyond me to write out what kind of healthcare system I want in less than a few 100 words though.

Ultimately I just feel we're being pushed into a much more American system by the back door. I've been plodding through NHS SOS on the topic. What would you advise me to read advocating an alternative to a monolithic state owned system?

It's just that sometimes change can help others more than it hurts you personally. For instance, though I don't want to get into all the GamerGate stuff, a lot of people just want more inclusive games for the same reasons that I've already laid out. Some of the opposition seems to think that this means a decrease in media they can relate to, when that's not true.

There are inherent systems of sexism and racism in culture that are hard to see without questioning yourself, and it's always positive to question the things around you in whatever context.

Asking yourself why change makes your uncomfortable, especially in regards to diversity, is an important question to think about. I think part of it is that when you've grown up in a society where white/straight/etc is the norm, it almost seems invasive to see anything else - but what most people don't realise is that's how marginalised groups feel everyday. That they have no voice or representation.

There was an interesting experiment - which I can't remember the name of - where people were asked to describe groups of people where about a third of the group were women. The people described those groups as dominated by women. We are used to seeing women and people of colour as a small part of a wider group. We call the Avengers diverse because it has one female character (in the MCU at least), when really it's not. A better example would be the current Avengers in the comics - Falcon has taken up the role of Captain America and the new Avengers has around 3-4 black members. People are calling them 'The Black Avengers', even though not all of them are black. Do we call the Avengers 'The White Avengers'? No - because we see white as default. We see straight as default, and so on.

Mainstream society seems fundamentally uncomfortable when marginalised characters start taking up space in mainstream media. There are many reasons for this. While you're not 'racist' or 'sexist' for being uncomfortable with it, it's important to realise that society does influence the way you feel about things on a certain level. It's also important to try and unlearn those things - otherwise, if you try and deny any kind of variety (The Doctor being a woman/black) that IS racist/sexist since you're making a conscious effort to prevent equal representation. Plus, presumably The Doctor wouldn't STAY a woman - what's one female Doctor in a pantheon of male Doctors? People see it as an invasion of the character, when really female Doctors would be in a heavy minority - just like the 'Black Avengers' example.

During 2009-2012 there was a general drought of new projects globally, and we're now seeing the effects of that.   Defence spending is actually likely to increase soon, especially with the deteriorating security situation in Europe and the Middle East, but the effects of that won't be felt for another year or so.

I am well aware that it's not unique to the NHS, that's why I have switched job to an employer that treats its employees with dignity.

Best to get to know as many people as you can, but prepare for your best mates in freshers week to not be your best mates in the weeks after until a friendship group settles itself down. 

The timetable and stuff will all be dependent on your University, I got module options (either in the post or in a welcome meeting?) then a timetable was given to me. Go to everything. Seriously. I skipped loads, then skipped stuff because I hadn't been the week before. Seriously, just go. And not only that, actually be interested and read up around the subject to prepare for future lectures. Doing the bare minimum is easy but it is such a good opportunity to learn everything about a subject. Some of the people I know now with the best jobs all worked their arses off in Uni. A year in industry is good for that also as you get an idea of how things work in the real world and a route into work (depends on the subject really)

Feed yourself well, you don't have to go too nuts but a few good one-pan recipes and keeping a well stocked cupboard will stop you from getting greasy takeaways. Don't spend too much on pointless shit, but don't be boring and always stay in either.

Look at his performance on Newsnight with Evan Davis. If he is ever challenged to back up any of his points or even the stuff he wrote in his books he misdirects. Davis tries to make a point that capitalism, for all it's flaws, has improved conditions for a lot of people. Brand spends a great deal of time taking the piss that Davis has a graph. He tries to belittle Davis' point by shouting, a number of times, that ""oh everything is ok because we have a graph!!!"" which wasn't Davis' point at all. Instead of addressing the point he dismissed it with the argument technique of a 5 year old shouting ""i am not listening"".

Prior to that Davis quoted Brand's views on the 9/11 attacks being a inside job. Brand says the links between the Osama Family and the Bush family are ""very interesting"" which is a bit of a dodge (and not that interesting, the Osama family is massive but Bin Laden was ostracised decades before) so Davis presses him on the actual point to which Brand responds that he doesn't want to discuss silly conspiracy theories! Why did he put in his book then!? 

No, it's the same Brand technique all the time. Spout vaguely revolutionary cliches in the most verbose way possible and mock those who seek to go beyond the populism and into the issue themselves. Appeal to people who confuse verbosity with depth and lap up their plaudits whilst accusing those that challenge him of sinister intent.

You could. But I don't see why somebody would choose to qualify what parties matter based on statistics and results from 5 years ago rather than ones from nearer to that time.

&gt;All parties represented in the Commons should participate in any debates held in the run-up to a General election. 

Why?

Why should George Galloway and  RESPECT participate when they're not standing in enough seats to win a majority?

Why should Plaid Cymru and the SNP and the NI parties participate when they're not standing outside of their national regions?

&gt;Not saying something is not the same as saying no to that something.

In this case, it actually is. Any party not specifically cited as needing majority coverage by OFCOM is automatically deemed as not deserving of majority coverage.

I left poor Tipple out unfortunately because his depiction is left entirely in shadow, making it impossible to know whether it was meant to be an older incarnation or a newer one.

I did admit that some assumptions had to be made to make a coherent list, and that holes *can* be found if you poke too hard.

I am aware of Hughes, I just didn't include him because he isn't a major actor in the character's history. Just a brief and silent flashback. But you're not wrong, he'd go before Delgado technically.

false,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,"&gt;I still think the state is a better provider of healthcare without the involvement of the private sector.

Well.. the private sector needs to be involved to some degree - I expect it's cheaper for the NHS to buy from a company which produces certain medicines for many countries' health services than it is for each country to produce their own; that's just economies of scale. It's just a question of where do you draw the line. I don't know where I would draw the line where a market no longer makes sense though. I just don't think we're going full-American.

&gt;Ultimately I just feel we're being pushed into a much more American system by the back door.

To my knowledge, the problem with the American system is that you have to buy private health insurance or get stuck with a massive bill (or worse, go without). In the UK, the very furthest we would go would be to have a state insurance provider which everybody is entitled to use - not breaking the principle of free at the point of use. Some services might be paid for, but only if you can afford it (see dental care). 

I took a quick look at NHS SOS - just in the description it seems to use a lot of emotive language designed to get the reader very afraid and emotional about an important topic. Stuff about the NHS is riddled with this sort of thing, and I tend to be very sceptical of literature which uses language like this; it suggests an absence of actual arguments. As for what you can read about alternatives to monolithic state owned systems - I don't know. I'm not really a big reader. Sorry.  My main issue is with the fearmongering.

&gt;I work, and don't qualify for any benefits, can I still get dental treatment?

Probably not for free, but it's not too expensive either. A basic check-up only cost £18 at my NHS dentist, which isn't so bad for a six-monthly thing to keep your teeth in working order. If you needed costly treatment you might be entitled to some help - an HC3 certificate would entitle you to have the cost above a certain amount paid by the state.

http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/HealthCosts/1136.aspx

I mis-spoke earlier, HC1 is the form you fill in, HC2 is the certificate you get (for full help) or HC3 (for partial help). If you're in England, you and your housemate can [order one online](https://apps.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/LISWebAppStaticData/begin.do) (otherwise for other countries you probably still can - and if not you can print it off or your dentist or GP probably have them in stock too). You can use it to claim back what you've already paid too (I think that's an HC5D - same link), so your housemate might be able to claim his or her dental bill back afterwards, but I'm not sure what the rules about that are.

Invalid comparison. The Roman Empire isn't analogous to any modern nation state.

&gt;the Ottoman Empire

Invalid comparison, again for the same reasons.

&gt;Canada is an incredibly multicultural country.

That's a better basis for comparison. You can't describe it as harmonious, though. 

* Ethnic gangs in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto. 
* Resentment and racism against Filipino foreign workers in Calgary. 
* The recent attack on Parliament and murder in Ottawa by an Islamically-motivated extremist. 
* Canadians joining ISIS. 
* etc 

Does that sound like a success story?

&gt;The USA could be considered to be multi-cultural (it has a sizable African-American and Hispanic population).

The USA is not a harmonious society, racially, religiously or culturally.

&gt;Bulgaria is considered the model example for multiculturalism in the Balkans with fair representation of its Turkish minority.

I'll read up on Bulgaria. I don't know much about the country.

Our reoffending rates in the UK are going to be ridiculous in years to come as prison has gotten far too lenient and the prisoners pretty much rule the jails. Extremely lenient treatment for juveniles and young offenders is going to bite us in the ass big style.

Yes most juveniles committing crimes need help and most have awful backgrounds but if they are untouchable, (they near enough are and they know it!) they will keep on offending as they usually enjoy it and there are no consequences.

A Juvenile Justice Centre is no punishment when it is much better than their home lives. They keep breaking bail conditions as they will usually get bail several times, they will keep offending when nothing happens to them.

We need a carrot and a stick approach, really do our utmost to help them, reward good behaviour and give them the chance of having a future to work towards while also punishing bad behaviour and instilling respect for authority.

No money is lost/stolen, it's just 'not spent'. i.e You can't really say piracy equals lost sales, because the people pirating aren't buying, therefore there's no sale to lose. Also the source material is 100% in its rightful owner's possession.

However, the other side of the argument is that the 'lost sales' are actually *potential* sales, and the loss is where actual sales don't meet the potentials. This way, tax allowances can be called benefits, because they represent a significant shortfall between the potential results and the actual results.
