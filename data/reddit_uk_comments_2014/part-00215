This means that if your salary does not change (and no overtime, bonuses, etc. occur) you would take home the same amount every month.

However because you have started your job part way through the tax year (which starts 6th April each year) and have presumably earned nothing else this year, you will have nearly 4 months worth of allowance unused which is going to be somewhere around £3000 which is of course more than your gross monthly salary of £2500, hence I'd not expect you to pay any income tax this month. Next month you should see some tax taken off but you will still have some unused allowance, so something like £1300 would be untaxed. 

Your September pay will see a bit more tax taken because at that point you'll only be getting £833 of personal allowance (assuming your tax code hasn't changed in the meantime).

Also note that a tax code of 1000L doesn't necessarily mean HMRC ""is still figuring out your tax code"" - 1000L is the default choice because it's right for a lot of people and it may well be right for you.

Be aware that there are [major works being done on the West Coast Mainline](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/august-weekends-see-huge-disruption-7505858) (the railway line which runs from London to Liverpool) during August.

That said, if I was in your place, I wouldn't drive. It's quite a long way and if you're not used to our roads, driving on the left and all the little differences in how traffic may behave, then it may be something of a baptism-of-fire. If you do decide to drive, familiarise yourself with the [Highway Code](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code).

If you're from America, remember that there is no turning on a red-light. Don't forget to indicate. If hiring a car you may want to state specifically that you want an automatic rather than a manual (stick shift). Whatever you do, don't try and attempt to drive in central London if you're not familiar with it.
Also [roundabouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8n9Fw4gInM) :-)

I'm not massively familiar with railway stations around London but the route I take between Liverpool and London is [Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston](http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/) on the Virgin Pendolino. That usually takes between 2 and 2½ hours and Standard Class is quite comfortable, especially if you book a window seat with at a table with a power socket.

Remember the escalator rules (this is for Liverpool as well as London): If you want to stand still, stay on the right-hand side of the moving steps. If you want to walk up the escalator, do so on the left hand side of the steps.

If there are two or more ""up"" escalators near each other, then treat them individually (that is, don't think the left-most escalator is only for walking up and the rightmost is only for standing on - whichever one you get on still has the stand-right, walk-left rule). Watch out for people with suitcases and other luggage trying to get past.

When getting off a train, don't dawdle in front of the doors - move as quickly as possible to get out of the flow of people exiting the train (this especially applies on both the London and Liverpool underground systems).

For all public transport journeys in and around London, such as getting from Tadworth to London Euston, there's the TFL (Transport for London) Journey Planner: http://journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk/

Within the Liverpool and Merseyside areas, there's the Merseytravel Journey Planner: http://jp.merseytravel.gov.uk/

Also be sure to check the homepages of the two, for info such as delays, engineering works, etc. as well as special offers.

http://tfl.gov.uk/

http://www.merseytravel.gov.uk/

Within Liverpool and the surrounding areas, I would advise purchasing either a [daily pass](http://www.merseyrail.org/tickets-passes/daily-travel.aspx) (which one will depend on how far within Liverpool you will travelling, but an all-areas SaveAway should be fine) or a [Weekly Trio](http://www.merseyrail.org/tickets-passes/season-tickets/trio.aspx) pass.

Bus fares within Liverpool are quite high, even compared to London (in fact I've yet to visit a city in the UK with higher bus fares than Liverpool) although trains are reasonably priced for travel within the Merseyside area.

If you're spending any time in London and using public transport, look at getting a [Visitor Oyster Card](http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/). Your friends in Surrey will be better placed to advise on this than I :-)

Once in Liverpool, if it's a Beatles related trip, there's the [Magical Mystery Tour](http://www.cavernclub.org/the-magical-mystery-tour/) which I believe goes to Mendips. I've never been on the tour so can't say if it's worth the cost. It may be worth checking TripAdvisor for reviews.

A final tip - in London there is a railway station called Liverpool Street - be sure not to mix this up with Liverpool Lime Street when booking your tickets :-)

Good luck, and I hope you have a lovely time over here :-)",0,1406432435,null,0,1406433033,0,cj8ve9g,t3_2btr3n,t1_cj8ve9g,t3_2btr3n,null,1434918684,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13

That's true, but I think that it wasn't just the striker. Oscar was shaky for a good bit of last year. Willian isn't the type of player who can win a game by himself. Hazard sometimes is. The team seemed too reliant on Hazard sometimes, and he isn't the finished product, so he can't always pull the team out of holes. They oftentimes looked uninterested against bad teams.

I will be heading into a similar financial position as you, in terms of job and student loan etc. Your family is right, your student loan isn't worth paying off. It won't affect any financial services you apply for like mortgages as far as I know. Also, even if you put the money in a bank and make 2% interest, the money is increasing faster than the loan is. 

That said, if I had 54k coming I would seriously consider getting on the housing market. I am dreading getting together the deposit, even with the help to buy scheme. I think the average cost of houses went up by nearly 10% this last year. Also when you make mortgage payments, your just increasing savings really, while rent is just money spent. From what I've looked at, to apply for a mortgage you need 3 months pay slips whilst not in probation, so with 2 years of work you would be eligible. 

This is all just the sort of stuff I've learnt from looking at my financial situation myself, so not sure if it's the right thing to do or if there are better options. Hope its helped.

As stated, yes, many good things, infrastructure, trade links, the scientific work done it there with animals/plants that we know about now.
But, there's another issue, colonisation means taking over, hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered, houses burned, previously peaceful areas were turned into war zones as they removed local leaders to place their own, confiscated farms/land etc. Tribes fought the colonisers, then each other, then everyone which carries on to this day.

true,aoeuisnthd,null,null,"Gonna have to disagree here.  I would argue Sam's stubbornness had us flirting more with relegation than was necessary.

Bear in mind that the month of February -- *where Sam won manager of the month* -- he was largely unable to play the kind of football he wants to play.  Andy was out on red after the match vs Swansea, but we can credit him with two assists there.  Still, Sam being stubborn and banging straight route 1 didn't exactly work great last season with crosses from Jarvis and Downing (to whose credit, I will admit, they've been much more on form in the pre-season so far).  

I get that Sam wants to go the safe route, but if the player you've put all your hopes and dreams on is injured or suspended, you can't pretend that your plan isn't hindered at all.  Moreover, I'm still trying to figure out why Sam will apparently never not play Nolan, in spite of all his shortcomings as a player.  I'm not denying that he's stepped up on occasion, but if the argument is that consistent scoring is what we want, then the record last season shows that Sam's secret hot sauce recipe is pretty weak.  The entire time Andy was out on reds (or Nolan, for any of his *seven matches he was out*) would have been a perfect time to experiment with players that provide something different -- but he never even considered finding another viable path to the net with the players he had available to him.  That's why he lost the fans -- it's not just that we lost matches; it's that while we were losing, he steadfastly refused to try anything different, even if our typical approach was getting us slaughtered.  

Also: anytime Sam does something to capitulate to outside opinion, he does it cynically. Reference the youth approach to Nottingham Forest in last season's FA Cup.  I won't be surprised when he does something similar to Valencia or Zarate.",0,1406441076,null,0,false,0,cj8yfy6,t3_2bt0en,t1_cj8yfy6,t1_cj8n3wy,null,1434920243,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

* Dawson actually looked substantially better against Chicago than he did in the previous two.
* Fredericks is great, we have amazing depth at RB
* Fryers just doesn't look like he's going to cut it. Too slow for LB, not enough presence for a CB, not vocal, just seems to kind of show up really.
* Lennon's great for this high pressure system, but not for 90min. Same with Townsend and probably Chadli. I think we'll see a lot of rotation in our attacking three behind the striker. Haven't seen enough of Lamela really to know how he does later in matches.

I met a QPR fan at Leipzig station who turned out to be an r/superhoops redditor. He gave me the news we were at the wrong location and should be further into south Germany.

We spoke to a train guard in Leipzig who turned out to be a Leipzig fan who was going to the game. He sold us some cheap train tickets and put us in 1st class.
At Gera station he gave us a lift in his car to the match. 

A few mins after finding the visitors end a storm started brewing up. There was very heavy rain for the first half, the fans and players were drenched.

We had barely a shot on goal in the 1st half,  the quality of play was a bit Sunday league.

There were big changes in the 2nd half with Zamora,  Faurlin, Anouha and a bunch of EDS players coming on. 

Zamora bottled a couple of clear chances to score,  deciding to dribble the ball and lose possession instead. 
Suprisingly SWP looked more like scoring in the game.

Passing the ball around our back 4 became our main tactic. I missed the first Leipzig goal,  the second was a simple loss of possession from our defenders.

All in all a very bad quality show from QPR. 
Only Zamora and Faurlin made half an effort to walk towards the fans and acknowledge the 100+ who had made the effort to attend. Not a good day at the office. 

Sitting in the train at Gera, waiting to go to Leipzig, 
 we saw a couple of fashion disasters standing next to us on the platform,  they looked a cross between Miami vice and the 80's pop group Bros. I'll see if I can upload a pic.

Why do you expect someone who is in the most important years of their career to sit around and let other senior players take his game time? He is a starter for almost every team in the world at the age of 21 (not including the top few elite). If you don't stand up for yourself and demand game time in this footballing world you **will** be washed aside. Pogba is probably one of the best recent examples of this. Sir Alex Ferguson just wouldn't give him decent time playing in midfield,  in fact he actually brought Scholes back into the team instead of playing him ( Drogba..). He left and got a team that would actually give him game time develop him into what he is today. Hell, even our own Sturridge was smart enough to leave and not destroy his career by being wasted in the bench and is now one of the best strikers in the league.

It was enjoyable and my family noticed I gained confidence. When I went to univeristy I could see how much of what we were learning would be applied in practice.

To be honest though, the reason I did the year, is because I didn't feel ready for uni, and a year out, earning money, and getting some life exeperience was a way to avoid going. 

It sounds shallow but one of the most valuable things for me was the money. It meant I could afford driving lessons, and meant I never worried about money at univeristy.

true,KaiserMacCleg,wales-denbighshire,Powys Fadog,"&gt; We had the same three TV channels for something like 50 years; we got 4 channels in 1983.

I think that's the key thing, really. Everyone of a certain age grew up watching (and listening to) the same TV (and radio) personalities, the same shows and the same news reports. That really isn't the same now, when even the basic Freeview package contains half a hundred different channels. People's viewing experiences have diversified immeasurably since the eighties and nineties, so that commonality in knowledge and humour - where everyone is familiar with the same personalities and everyone gets the reference - is going to diminish going forward.

I don't agree with your first point, though. There's definitely enough room in the UK for plenty of diversity in terms of shops. In fact, there are surviving chains of supermarkets in the UK which are restricted to particular regions - CK's in South-west Wales and Tuffins in the Welsh Borders spring to mind. It is the omnipresence of the big four supermarkets that strangles the life out of smaller retailers, whether they're independent high street stores or aspiring supermarket chains themselves.

Those panel shows require the viewer to be fairly knowledgeable in current affairs and popular culture. Try an experiment. Read the paper every day for a few weeks, watch some reality TV shows, and then watch those panel shows. See if your comprehension of their jokes improves.

&gt; Everyone seems to have grown up with the same iconic food products, same tv shows, same shops.

Isn't that the same in Australia? Everyone knows vegemite, prawns, and pavlova. The older generation would have watched old shows like Skippy and possibly saw Kylie Minogue on Neighbours. We have cricket, aussie rules and rugby, kangaroos and koalas, dodgy politicians, the outback, bushfires and floods. There's lots of common ground.

There isn't much variety in shops as you go around Australia, and most Australian towns look the same as the next town. EDIT: Except for [Franco Cozzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZUVd9NMM_k). That's a Melbourne institution.

One thing that is certainly different about the UK is the size of the place and the way the towns/villages are evenly spread out. 

In Australia, it's more about *suburbs* than the peculiarities of the towns and villages.

true,WobsJack,welsh,Wales -&gt; Switzerland,"I was just visiting friends from University for a few weeks. I wasn't working. 

But yeah its a great place. It is an easier place to get accustomed to because there are no great language barriers. The weather was great. Humidity took some getting used to but it was nice. I was there in June/July and I think monsoon season there is around November (?) so I'm not sure what that is like. 

It felt busy in parts such as the main business district (CBD) or the shopping centres but there were also plenty of parks to get away from it all. The Metro system is brilliant. Super efficient, on time and air-conditioned. Just don't eat or drink on it! 

The people were a bit stand offish but that is to be expected in most major cities. I'm currently studying in London and find people equally cold UNTIL you get to meet them. I got to know a few Singaporean lads at University and they are really nice people, their families too. Really genuine and really friendly. I got on with them really well. I just showed an interest in them and Singapore and they were happy to tell me all about it and show me around. Great people.  Lots of expats there, sat and watched a few football games (not the best quality!) and there was plenty of Brit representation. 

As far as I know I think it is now slightly harder to get a job in Singapore for expats. They had a recent crackdown after some local backlash. It was apparently quite easy in the early 2000s. 

I would certainly give it a go though. Can't do any harm. Ask the people over at /r/singapore for more details. It is expensive (forget owning a car) but the quality of life there is great. Imagine going on an Easyjet equivalent in Singapore, you go to places such as Taiwan, Tokyo, Seoul etc. It is well worth the risk!

The funniest thing I see in some comment threads though, is people moaning about unemployed people never having a job in their lives and how they're constantly taking away from the system. But as soon as those unemployed people get old enough and they're eligible for the state pension, it all becomes ""No, they're entitled to that money and we shouldn't be making any changes to the pension system.""

And it's (as we have both said) because old people vote. Changing anything to do with pensions is a huge vote loser and a guaranteed ousting at the next election. This is also why I think we should have mandatory voting like Australia. We could also extend the voting period to a whole week and give people a national day off of work as well to allow as many people as possible to vote.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; Lukaku wants to play, the club has not let him do that for years

He has not proven that he can compete with the top strikers. I really don't know why you have so much affection for Lukaku that you're defending him in every single thread. He has never really said that he wants to stay and completely meant it. All his ""i want to stay at Chelsea"" quotes seem totally generic, i.e. ""I'm not sure what's going to happen next season so I don't want to piss anyone off"".

&gt;He is a starter for almost every team in the world at the age of 21 **(not including the top few elite)**

So why should he be a starter here? Do you think we're not an elite team? Farcical.

&gt;If you don't stand up for yourself and demand game time in this footballing world you will be washed aside.

Lassana Diarra. Ryan Bertrand. Jesse. Varane.

&gt;in fact he actually brought Scholes back into the team instead of playing him ( Drogba..).

And won the league.

&gt; He left and got a team that would actually give him game time develop him into what he is today. Hell, even our own Sturridge was smart enough to leave and not destroy his career by being wasted in the bench and is now one of the best strikers in the league. 

Hence the loan system, ala Courtois. But Lukaku has a problem with that too.

Sturridge being wasted on the bench? lolol. This proves you've not supported the club more than 1-2 years. Sturridge left because he didn't want to play on the wing out wide, and we wanted to get rid of him because he didn't contribute defensively. He may have scored 20+ goals last season, but look at Liverpool's defensive record. Look at their defensive structure. That's right.. It's awful. Even Crystal Palace had a better defensive record than Liverpool.

&gt; So you can honestly go fuck off if you think any talented young player of ours shouldn't stand up for themselves and get walked all over. Players like Lukaku and Pogba have the right attitude, either get the playtime from your club or find one of the many suitors who would.

Errm.. Weren't you the one announcing in every thread that no where has Lukaku said he wants to leave? Finally realized you were wrong and changed your argument?

What you don't understand is nobody has a problem with players wanting regular first team football. The club would have been happy to loan Lukaku to a good club for 2-3 seasons in a similar to Courtois. What people here don't like is Lukaku constantly being disrespectful to the club and the fans by being an arrogant cunt and not keeping his mouth shut.

Other than to read the above series, I would say that since you're 22 you probably don't need to worry about government bonds. If you want to save for retirement or 10+ years in the future, then you don't really need the stability that (some) bonds provide. It's probably better to take on riskier investments which will pay off over the long term (i.e. stocks). If you read the above guide you'll understand why 'risky' doesn't necessarily mean 'bad'.

* Can take constructive criticism on board.  
* Willing to commit time to gameplay and team improvement.  
* Have played team games all my life - county cricket player, know about commitment, attitude, constructive feedback and all that malarkey.  
* Can play any role and any hero, but most effective and experienced on the offlane (position 3).  
* Favourite heroes in general = Mirana; Rubick; Sand King; Meepo; Clockwerk  
* Favourite offlane heroes = Clockwerk; WindRUNNER; Nyx Assassin; Mirana; Invoker (yes, believe me it works!)  


**More about me:**  
* I'm 21, a student at uni near Liverpool. Therefore I have a lot of time for playing a practise in term time - 7pm til 10pm is ez with me.  
* Currently have the most awful connection which is limiting my play time. So in all likelihood I cannot commit to anything until september comes around again and I move back into my uni house with my sexy fibre connection (Kappa).  
* I'm a twitch addict, sing2x fanboy and  hardcore C9 supporter.  


**Tech aspects:**  
* Have skype, can get Teamspeak if needed  
* Have a mic.  
* As above, currently restricted due to net connection. Situation infinitely better after September.  
* Occasionally stream @ http://www.twitch.tv/theriverstyx

If you do nothing with money, inflation eats it. Often if you put it in a savings account, tax and low interest eat it more slowly. If you put it in shares, there's a chance of a good return, but also a chance of losing at least for a while in a market downturn (the trick there is having the courage to buy in during a downturn, in anticipation of a recovery). If you put it in property, you may lose in a downturn, and you have to work to maintain the property.

My perspective is that if you're sure you're not going to be moving for say 5 or more years (jobs can be funny things) then a mortgage that's even part paid off puts you in a much better place later in life than renting.

It's early days but it's been encouraging so far from Deila. I would build the attack around Commons as the creative influence and encourage guys like Griffiths and Forrest to work a bit of magic. Lennon's mistake was thinking that Celtic needed to win every game no matter what, working towards records like  'most clean sheets' or 'longest run undefeated'. When the league is in the bag from day 1, it makes it more important to develop a creative, exciting style of play, preferably with young guys coming through. I think this is the main reason people haven't been renewing season tickets - yes, we lack the competition, but we need to be winning with a bit of style rather than grinding out results against teams with a skliff of our budget.

Agile approaches are more like firing a cruise missile. You aim broadly in the right direction and adjust in flight. Not only that, but because you're regularly delivering value, you can check on your progress towards the target regularly. 

You should read some of the Gartner reports on agile if you genuinely believe it doesn't work (I find it hard to believe there's anyone who genuinely feels that way at this point though, other than those who personally have something to lose).

I'm pleased to be able to reply to this one, because these are many people's queries about the reason for the service - including mine before I joined!

* We absolutely can get involved in their angst, or letting them vent! We do that a lot - but we are careful not to offer opinions. We haven't lived their lives, and we are not here to side with them in whatever argument they have in life because we don't know the whole story. But they can absolutely tell us whats wrong, we can sympathise with them and perhaps guide them to a solution they already know deep down, but they couldn't see on their own. Or maybe it will be the start of a series of calls from that person, every time getting braver and more confident and finding out what they should do next.

* We might call the police (although i can't think of a situation where I would have had to yet), and we will call an ambulance if they want us to and have given us enough details. We encourage them to do it though, firstly because they know their situation better than we do, and secondly it helps eliminate the hoax calls.

* We don't exist to chat to people who don't have problems, you're right. We do get those calls though, and we don't tell them off or ring off. Sometimes people talk about their day or the weather because they're putting off the main reason for their call, so we help get to the nub of the issue early on. But if they genuinely don't have a problem to talk about, we do advise them that there are dedicated helplines for chatting - for example, Silverline for the older generation. I wouldn't say we get many of these though - usually if they've rung Samaritans then they are already in distress.

As I said above, a while ago I wondered the same thing as you. And i didn't realise the power of just talking to someone.

Which is a ridiculous way to take out of context a completely innocent and rational line in a news report to try and muster outrage. Most newsnight viewers would probably wonder ""why would someone watch this?"" so it's completely natural and common practice to address that question first - which they did.



There was nothing wrong with the newsnight report. It wasn't made for gamers, so of course they would find a slow explanation of it condescending.

Yep.

Not as complicated, there's a total £40k limit, but you can move money in and out at any time (so you can put £40k in, take £40k out and put it back in if you want). No yearly limits like ISAs, just a total cap.

The only ""cost"" to doing this is that your money needs to be in for a full month to go into the draw, so taking it out and putting it back in stops you from being in the draw for a while.

I sat in Piccadilly gardens one Friday night and it did feel amazing, helped it was boiling hot, the World Cup was on and all the boozers had their doors wide open.

I stayed in a nice hotel up past the Brunswick bar, and the bird I met stayed with me.

That Friday night we must have visited a dozen boozers and they all seemed so much better than here down south, friendly for the most part and a lot cheaper

We'll probably end up getting Moreno, and if we don't we'll buy Bertrand.

To clarify something I said:

&gt; The only ""cost"" to doing this is that your money needs to be in for a full month to go into the draw, so taking it out and putting it back in stops you from being in the draw for a while.

This only applies to the amount you took out. If you have £40k and take out £100 and put it back in, £39900 will be in the next draw, then £40k in the one after that.

Here are your odds for £40k over one year:

true,pizzapiejaialai,1972crest,,"Hi both, I am one of those aforementioned City fans from Asia and I just wanted to butt in and explain why I think having a us vs them mentality with regards to new fans isn't perhaps the most helpful thing. 

I wrote about this in another thread but I became a city fan around 88-89. Why? When you have a whole load of older brothers and football mad cousins like I did, you end up getting the last pick of which team you get to support. So, of course, I ended up with the team that had just got relegated to Division 1.

Follow that up with a continual decline and eventual relegation to Division 2 and you end up realising that being a Manchester City fan is a bit like Stockholm Syndrome. 

Two memories stand out from the 90s. The first is trying to find news about a Div 2 team in pre-Internet days. I remember bugging a distant cousin (studying in London) to bring back football mags during his holidays to get a glimpse of City news. The most we got from the local papers was the weekly Div2 table, and City scorelines (usually dismal).

The second, was going on a school trip to the UK in 1999(?). We stopped at Old Trafford for about 2 hours for all my classmates to gorge themselves on Utd pencil cases, jerseys, mini footballs, etc. Once done, and about to set off, I asked my teacher if we could stop by Maine Road for me to take some pictures, but of course, the reply back was ""No, we have to keep to the schedule."" 

The one bright light in that was the coach driver, I bet he was a Mancunian, overhearing, taking a detour off the motorway, and driving past Maine Road for my sake. Plus, he let me sit in the driver's side seat for the rest of the trip!

My point is this, any Asian Utd supporter under the age of 30, was likely to have started off a gloryhound. If Utd have another three or four dismal seasons (fingers crossed) some of them might stop, but many of them will continue supporting Utd.

I'm happy to see more gloryhounds. There's enough glory to spread around. It doesn't detract from the legions of supporters (like u/Melberger) who have been life-long fans. It may affect stadium atmosphere, I wouldn't know....

What I do know is this. Some of today's gloryhounds, will be tomorrow's die-hard fans. You gotta start somewhere. But which fan (so flippantly written off as a day-tripper) who has taken the time, effort and money to make a pilgrimage to the Etihad, would be able to form a long, loving relationship with the club, if he/she's booed and denigrated as being less of a fan by others of the tribe?

By all means, the price increases in tickets to the games is not a good way to repay supporters loyalty, absolutely not. But I would caution against turning that anger into anger against foreign fans. It's just not very fair.

true,Gungunum,null,null,"OK...Here's where you've got the fundamental ideology (I believe) wrong:

&gt;We don't exist to chat to being who don't have problems, you're right. We do get those calls though, and we don't tell them off or ring off. Sometimes people talk about their day or the weather because they're putting off the main reason for their call, so we help get to the nub of the issue early on. But if they genuinely don't have a problem to talk about, we do advise them that there are dedicated helplines for chatting - for example, Silverline for the older generation. I wouldn't say we get many of these though - usually if they've rung Samaritans then they are already in distress.

I'm Agoraphobic. Most of my friends have left, built up their own families, and my own family largely finds me too difficult to deal with; up until recently with reddit, I had no...And I mean *no* contact with the outside world because frankly I was too proud - I didn't want to admit I needed a carer, I didn't want to admit that there's something *fundamentally wrong* with my brain chemistry, and most of all, I didn't want to accept that I was alone and felt lonely. I don't see the world the way other people do; most of the time, I'd honestly rather read a book or watch a documentary, and I have an *extremely* low tolerance point for people.

But. BUT.

In one of my lowest moments, when I just needed someone to have a simple conversation with me and find that it was ok to be scared of the way I am, to feel alone, and to know that there is someone out there that cares enough to even peripherally ask if I was ok. I didn't need much from Samaritans; I needed a conversation. I needed a discussion as simple as discussing your favourite blend of tea because I *constantly* struggle with voices in my head, and just needed to hear someone friendly say hello. I didn't even need a hug. I just needed someone to help in the simplest way that I'm *told* a human with a modicum of empathy would. Instead, I got silence on a phone from someone who was waiting for me to talk, an awkward feelings on my part and the sense of feeling like an idiot for allowing myself a moment to hope.

&gt;We might call the police (although i can't think of a situation where I would have had to yet), and we will call an ambulance if they want us to and have given us enough details. We encourage them to do it though, firstly because they know their situation better than we do, and secondly it helps eliminate the hoax calls.

So let me be clear on that - someone could be bleeding out on the floor, and unless they asked you *specifically*to call an ambulance in their final moments, when the phone went silent you'd simply put the phone down and take the next customer on. Am I reading that right? I mean don't get me wrong - I'm an ardent support of Euthanasia, but I think if *thats* what I'm reading? That's pretty damned cold.

&gt;We absolutely can get involved in their angst, or letting them vent! We do that a lot - but we are careful not to offer opinions. We haven't lived their lives, and we are not here to side with them in whatever argument they have in life because we don't know the whole story. But they can absolutely tell us whats wrong, we can sympathise with them and perhaps guide them to a solution they already know deep down, but they couldn't see on their own. Or maybe it will be the start of a series of calls from that person, every time getting braver and more confident and finding out what they should do next.

But you see, sometimes an opinion can offer a spark. Sometimes a simple opinion, a moment of kindness or a little advice can set a signal fire in someone's life that could turn them around in an unlimited number of ways that neither you nor I can anticipate. People phone Samaritans because *they have no one* to turn to; you know as well as I do, that many people that phone are the very definition of hopelessness, and I personally believe that *all* it would take to give them a moment of grace and something as divine as hope is an opposing view that makes them assess their situation.",0,1406463930,null,0,false,0,cj9309i,t3_2bs2oa,t1_cj9309i,t1_cj92my4,null,1434922629,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I like cities in small doses and enjoy skiing. Switzerland is a nice place to live if you have no wish to become Swiss, though it seems integrating would be a non-starter. After that cold, time on a tropical island would be quite nice. 

The English and Irish countryside will always feel like home, so it would be nice to go back there more often. I couldn't live there full time though, or I'd go mad. Having a farm to go back to every now and then seems to leave people much happier than running the farm themselves.

Capoue - Got tons of responsibilities and really stepped up to the plate. He didn't seem 100% fit and was pretty sluggish in the first game but it got better s the games went on. Excited for this one.

true,Maverrix99,null,null,"&gt; Niall Ferguson doesn’t bother telling you that in the 18th century, India was one of the commercial and industrial centers of the world. England was a kind of a backwater – it had much greater force, but not commercial or industrial advantages.

This is total bollocks, to be honest.  Great Britain was probably the leading global power from 1714 onwards.  Chomsky completely misses the point that the reason Britain was able to project military power globally in the 18th Century was the strength of its commerce and industry.

Just to pick a few points:

* The agricultural revolution had started in England, and was a necessary precondition to the industrial revolution which followed a couple of decades later.  Essentially Britain got first-move advantage which meant its citizens were considerably more productive than anywhere else in the world.

* English and other European ships had been sailing the world for a couple of centuries at this point, and their naval technology was vastly superior to India.  How many Indian ships were sailing to Europe? 

* The banking and financial system that Great Britain had developed was the second best in the world (after the Dutch) and resulted in a significant increase in military power - essentially the country could buy whatever it needed for a war immediately, and pay the bill later.

* Linked to this, the constitutional monarchy that was in place after 1688 meant that taxes were raised only with Parliament's consent.  This was actually far more effective at raising revenue for the state than the absolute monarchies of France, Spain or India.",0,1406465776,null,0,false,0,cj93elk,t3_2btu6e,t1_cj93elk,t1_cj91fmw,null,1434922863,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,secret-samaritan,null,null,"Everything you've written sounds perfectly fair. Let me reply to each point again, and I genuinely hope this exchange helps you gain a little more trust in Samaritans

* For what it's worth, I take calls quite regularly from an agoraphobic, and I have learnt the debilitating effects of it from those calls - but I know each case is different so I won't pretend to know your life and challenges. Your lowest ebb is EXACTLY why we are here, and I am very sorry you felt the way you did. What I've noticed is that each Samaritan takes the vital training and limits, and then uses them in their own way. Some of us do it better than others. Some of us have bad days, and I'm pretty sure it will effect our calls, even if we don't realise it. The silence that pervaded your call is something we do try and do to allow the caller to get things off their chest - but only if the call demands it. Maybe the Samaritan misjudged it. Maybe you and the Samaritan didn't ""hit it off"" in terms of personality - it's something that does happen, sometimes callers cut off and call us back many times until they get someone they like!

* So I hope you know that you weren't an idiot for calling us, and I am sorry you didn't get the support you needed. I hope you might try again if you need to, because what you needed is exactly what we hope to give. Sometimes, like every charity or company, we'll fail, but also I hope we can make good on those failures when we get a chance.

* If someone is bleeding out on the floor, there is no way we can call the ambulance or the police or anyone unless the caller has given us their location. The system we have is totally anonymous. We can do nothing but be with them on the phone if we don't know where they are. Sometimes, that's exactly what the caller wants. The power is with them to tell us their location or not.

* If there is a ""suicide in progress"" and the caller has given us his/her details, then we will absolutely do everything in our power to get them help. The fact that they have given us those details indicates they want to be helped, and we do not fail to do that if we can.

* I absolutely agree - opinions could well offer a spark, and often make the conversation fly. The problem we as a charity face with offering opinions is three-fold - and believe me when I say that these ""limits"" are constantly agonised over and analysed by our members.

--We do not know the caller's lives. If we were a friend of theirs, we would be able to offer an opinion based on their circumstances, their family, their mental strengths, and whether they were telling the whole truth. All we have to go on as Samaritans is what has been said in the phone call, which may well be only one side of the situation. We as strangers to the caller are not best placed to give advice or opinions.

--We are usually not professionally trained in the subject matter. so for example if a woman doesn't know if she should have an abortion, we do not necessarily know the legal complexities of the matter. We can sympathise, we can empathise, we can perhaps talk through the issue and help the caller come to a conclusion of their choosing - but we have not experienced everything that the callers have. 

--If the caller acts on our advice or opinions, then if their life becomes worse because of it we leave ourselves open to being sued as a charity. It's sad, but true in this day and age.

Inside they just have stands full of every colour &amp; collection, and they have the 6 for £20 offer on too. I don't think you can get your nails done there or anything, but they do have a million times more stock than what was on offer at Boots. I've not taken much notice, but thinking about it, I don't think I saw the Model's Own section in Boots when I last went in. My guess is that they're trying to launch little stands like that as they'd likely be more profitable, it's certainly unique and exciting and it looks amazing, and it's been hugely successful (judging by how busy it always looks and the number of Model's Own shopping bags I see). I just thought they were doing it here because of how much traffic Meadowhall has, but this makes me wonder if they're going to pull out of shops and try to establish themselves as *the* shop that sells nail polish.

From BR's first season to the second, Skrtel improved and looked more and more comfortable working the ball from the back and playing a higher line. It wasn't perfect, but there was noticeable progress.

I love Agger, but he's proved to be injury prone over nearly his entire career at Liverpool and hasn't really improved or adapted under BR. It's disappointing, especially considering he was supposed to be the perfect ""ball playing"" defender for BR, but there's no room for sentiment when top 4 is now a bare minimum.

 [**Dollar cost averaging**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar%20cost%20averaging): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Dollar cost averaging__ (__DCA__) is an [investment strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_strategy) for reducing the impact of [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance\)) on large purchases of financial assets such as [equities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equities). By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g. $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g. $1000 over 100 weeks), DCA reduces the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire ""lump sum"" just before a fall in the market . Dollar cost averaging is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it minimizes downside risk.

In the premier league the top four teams all go into the Champions League (top two go direct, next two have to play-off to qualify). Positions five and six are entered into the Europa League.

Then there are the domestic cups, of which there are two:

  - FA Cup
  - League Cup

All teams from all leagues enter both competitions and play in a standard knock-out tournament format in rounds until the final.

Both competitions reward the winner with a Europa League place too.

&gt;The __English football league system__, also known as the __football pyramid__, is a series of [interconnected leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_system) for men's [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) clubs in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), with six teams from [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) and one from [Guernsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey) also competing. The system has a hierarchical format with [promotion and relegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation) between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the hypothetical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system. There are more than 140 individual leagues, containing more than 480 divisions.  The exact number of clubs varies from year to year as clubs join and leave leagues or fold altogether, but an estimated average of 15 clubs per division implies that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are members of a league in the English men's football league system.

I support Manchester United so I like it.  I also know that Manchester City is in Salford (which *used* to be a separate borough/town, but has been engulfed by suburbanisation).

The song: ""Dirty Old Town"" (one of my favourite songs) was written about Salford by Ewan MacColl (my preferred versions are by The Pogues and The Dubliners), which paints Salford in a gritty-yet-oddly-reminiscent-of-home sort of place.

I passed through Manchester once on coach, it seemed too big and multi-cultural for me to feel I belong.  One of my parents is Asian, but I'm used to living in a town with 90% whites, so I always feel overwhelmed going to cities with a zillion different ethnicities, and feel like I don't belong/get lost in the crowd.

I've known a few girls from Manchester and they *all* seem to get wet at a Northern Irish accent, much moreso than anywhere else in the U.K., actually.  My geography teacher -- Northern Irish -- met his wife in Manchester and remarked himself: ""English birds *love* the accent.""

&gt;

&gt;The __Angus L. Macdonald Bridge__, known locally as ""the old bridge"", is a [suspension bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge) crossing [Halifax Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Harbour) in [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada); it opened on April 2, 1955.

&gt;The bridge is one of two suspension bridges currently linking the [Halifax Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Peninsula) to [Dartmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth,_Nova_Scotia) in the [Halifax Regional Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality).

&gt;It is named after the former premier of [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia), [Angus L. Macdonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Lewis_Macdonald), who had died in 1954 and had been instrumental in having the bridge built. The bridge was designed by [Philip Louis Pratley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Louis_Pratley), one of Canada's foremost long-span bridge designers who had also been responsible for the [Lions Gate Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Gate_Bridge) in Vancouver [(http://www.eng.ucalgary.ca/Press_Release/2005/Bridging-Success-April2005.pdf). The bridges have a similar design, which is most notable in the towers. The contractor was [Dominion Bridge Company Ltd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Bridge_Company).

true,vonbond,null,null,"&gt; And if I apply while I'm still going to school.. How will I be able to give my exam results and stuff ? I won't even get my results so early. Exams are done when the school is at the very end.

&gt; Also, how does the process of giving your exam results look like ? You send them the copy of your documents or what ? 

This is something that is built into the UCAS system: you apply with your predicted or expected grades. So if you and your teacher expect or predict that you will get an A or a B (or whatever and however you expect to receive grades), then you put it in the form and you apply to universities that want roughly the same grades as you are expected to get. 

Obviously there are problems with this system but I won't get into that now!

Also, FYI: UCAS opens for applications on September 1, Oxbridge and medicine deadlines are October 15 and the general deadline for guaranteed consideration (i.e. they will NOT treat you first-come-first-served) is January 15. So if you want to go to university when you are 18 going on 19, which I assume is the academic year 2015-16 from what you have said, you will need to apply this September-January. Here is a great timeline that will help you. http://www.ucas.com/apply/key-dates

Any other questions about UCAS, do please ask away, I am a researcher and professional in higher education so this is my area of expertise!

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Jesus, you didn't really read that other reply. There is fuck of a lot of preparation going into matches. It's also why I said Van Gaal is the exception. He is likely to do specialist training for more or less every team.

Most teams will go in with default tactics or experimental tactics. In which case, they will be learning new default tactics or creating experimental ones. All of which means they are far far far less prepared than a team that is already started the season with their default tactic for the season. The tactic they revert to in order to impose themselves on the opposition rather than a reactive tactic.

Van Gaal is the exception in my eyes because he likes to prepare in some way for what every opposition team can do regardless of how shite they are. He does not want to be caught napping. Other teams simply won't dedicate this time, they will be doing Fitness and then recovery cycles endlessly. Van Gaal will be too, hence his double training regime.

I've clearly explained this to you before but you're not paying attention. The pre season is partly preparation but tactically it's not that much preparation. It's about fitness. Once the games being played are one's where you don't rotate everyone, then you're focusing on your tactics. Otherwise you're generally just seeing what people can do as individuals. Which is the point of blooding in the young talent obviously. But as you've picked Izzy Brown, I'll just point out what he hasn't been given the time to do as an example. He hasn't gone through 2 to 20 hours of how to attack the opposition full back, what the weaker foot of the CB is, how quick he is on the turn or who the best defender to sit on the back of is. All of these things will have to be worked out in the game, which is considerably more difficult, and then ridiculously difficult if you've only got 45 minutes.

Oh, and most healthcare in Britain is free at point of access but you have to be pushy. I had a Brazilian aunt (married in) who was having problems breathing or something and was dismissed by lots of British doctors, when she went back to Brazil and saw a doctor they found heart issues and she had to have open heart surgery. So be pushy with the NHS and you'll get your way. 

Assuming you're set on Belfast here's the score. Unlike England, you don't pay for prescribed medicine. Rent is A LOT cheaper, people are more friendly to foreigners and you'll always find someone up for a drink but the bars and clubs close quite early. 

You should move to South Belfast (see Property pal for some general prices) near the university with some students for your first year. Check out Dunluce avenue on if you don't mind a bit of noise, but be aware  that most students go home on weekends. Any more questions I left unanswered?

The commitment is quite full on, at least at first (training, mentoring, more training etc) but it then settles down a few hours a week. I'm wary about saying exactly how many hours, and when they are, because we want to keep that information internal. But it's definitely a commitment, and not one you can just cancel on a whim. You can swap shifts with other Samaritans if you have a clash, but you're expected to try your hardest to be in when needed.

Age - no age limit! But I would say that we need more young people. So you sound ideal!

true,Baggzio,null,null,"It wasn't a great game but there were some positives. For me Duffy was very good aside from maybe a mistake or two but you can't use that against him when the senior starters week in week out we're making worse mistakes. I'd love to see him and Stones be given 90 mins together because I definitely see them as the 2nd choice Cbs especially when Duffy has shown much better than Alcaraz in the last 2 games as well as Alcaraz being injury prone.

Another thing which I actually see as a positive which others may not agree on is the fact the majority of the youngsters are no where near ready which might spur Roberto onto some backup signings because in my opinion the only youngsters that should be anyway near the team are McAleny, Duffy if you count him, Garbutt although unless Roberto changes Baines to the CDM position he was saying I'd prefer him going out on loan because he's much too good for the u21s from his recent showings and maybe Browning if we were stuck for injuries. Personally I think Long and Hope won't make it here and we should cash in while we can and I'm still uncertain about Lundstrum maybe another years loan would help because  he won't get anywhere near the team currently not even the fact that he's not good enough it's just that CM position is filled to the brim this year. 

Another concern is obviously Joel, I've always wanted to support the lad but he's seemingly got worse and worse every time he plays the only thing he's done well really is a somewhat decent backup for Tim so Tim's performance obviously increased from that ""pressure"" but Joel is definitely not the man to replace Tim and that's just a fact.",0,1406473531,null,0,false,0,cj95n0l,t3_2buw0y,t1_cj95n0l,t3_2buw0y,null,1434923900,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

Agger though extremely positionally aware is awful at defending set pieces, loses his man way too easily when crosses are put hard and low on the ground when entering our box, and is not as mobile as he used to be. On top of that, he's very injury prone. He's still amazing at playing the ball out of the back but he's not vocal nor does he organize the team in a way that Carra/hyppia did and yet we still hold him to the same regard. Don't get me wrong, my first kit had his name on it. But there's a reason why we're not getting £25 mil offers for him. He's on the decline, BR sees it and is acting accordingly. 

Defenders should never be based off ""stats"" either, as most if what defenders do is what is not recorded. Making a tackle usually means something happened defensively that led to the need for a tackle rather than it being an interception. Sahko is arguably one of the best technical, powerful, and impressive defenders I've seen in a while. I rate him as highly as Varane. He captained PSG at the age of 17/18 if I'm not mistaken and was the youngest player to captain a Ligue 1 side. There's a reason he is at the level he's at at the age of 24. For gods sakes he BROKE the strength machine at our medical exam. 

Martin Skrtel, for all his flack he's received over the past two years, has without a doubt in my mind earned his spot.

Personally, I think Manchester edges it away from Birmingham. It has a stronger brand, a stronger economy, faster population growth, a bigger cultural offering, is further along the regeneration path, and has some serious mega projects in the offing that will push it further ahead like the airport project, media city, the massive expansion of its tram system, and so on.

I was merely saying that the high proportion of children dying might have less to do with aiming at areas that are known to have children and more to do with the lower age of the population. A matter of statistics rather than targeted attacks at kids which is a reasonable way to view the figures without this knowledge.

I am sitting in the middle because neither side has an answer. I am anti war but not pro IDF or Hamas. Death of civilians is never justified no matter if they are children. I am in the middle because of partisan idiots like you who think in black and white who cause these conflicts and sustain them.

For the second point I'm talking about people involved in the scene, people knew it would become bigger because they could *see* it becoming bigger every year. If you ask a random person on the street if video games could be huge in streaming they'd probably say no even now.

Again, vast majority of Twitch users are over 18 - alongside the stat of 36% of all gamers are over 35 while only 32% are under 18 you can come to the conclusion that most video gamers/viewers are *not* teenagers (I guess or young people, but that depends on what you'd define as young - a 60 year old person might consider a 30 year old to be young while a 12 year old wouldn't)

He DOES however, have the power to forbid England playing in that World Cup (assuming his party wins the next election). I'm sure there are plenty of ways he can do this, but the most obvious would be issuing a travel ban to the England squad f they intend to go to Russia to play sport (a power the Home Office has, although as far as I know never used in this context before).

So why doesn't Nick Clegg make this an official plank of Lib Dem party policy? He could run into the next election with a clear policy on sanctions against Russia, if he believes in the moral case for doing so strongly as to suggest FIFA should act on his behalf. 

I predict, however, Nick Clegg will not do this. It would be extremely unpopular with the public, who inexplicably enjoy watching England lose at football every four years. His call to move the World Cup therefore looks a spineless attempt at political posturing, since Clegg lacks the courage of his political convictions to propose a policy which would be unpopular but within his power to accomplish should his party win the next election.

Here are some random answers to your question in no particular structure:

In terms of tax, the stipend you'll get is tax-free in the sense that you don't owe the HMRC anything after you receive the money in your account - it's yours to do whatever you want with. You can invest it in whatever you want and you won't have to pay tax on the money you use to invest, but of course you'll have to pay tax on certain types of capital gains (e.g. dividends from shares).

There's a threshold of earnings over which you start paying tax. I can't remember what it is but you don't include your stipend as part of your earnings (think of the stipend as a 'donation' towards your living expenses while you study for your PhD). Therefore you can earn quite a lot from capital gains before you have to start paying tax.

If you earn extra money during your PhD from doing lab demonstration or marking or whatever (i.e. work in addition to your research), this income is taxable, but again you probably won't earn anywhere near enough to ever pay tax on such income.

Income from capital gains from stocks inside a stocks and shares ISA is tax-free, no matter how much it is. The limit here is how much money you can put into an ISA each year, which is how the government controls how much tax you can avoid paying.

If you end up buying into an index fund or ETF, sometimes these are domiciled abroad. Often they are in Ireland or the USA, where you pay dividend witholding tax even if you own these stocks inside an ISA wrapper. This is charged directly by the foreign government and is taken out of the dividend before you receive it, so you aren't liable for additional tax. Note however that you can still own foreign domiciled index funds and ETFs inside a UK ISA.

Hope this helps.",0,1406475408,null,0,false,0,cj96b2h,t3_2bum3q,t1_cj96b2h,t1_cj9360e,null,1434924357,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

true,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; English and other European ships had been sailing the world for a couple of centuries at this point, and their naval technology was vastly superior to India. How many Indian ships were sailing to Europe?

Bit of a moot point, India didn't directly trade with Europe at that time, most of their trade was conducted with Arabs who then traded it on with the Europeans.

Most Europeans didn't even know where things like spices came from and the Arabs used to lie to them about the origin of their spices to maintain the monopoly. 

&gt;This is total bollocks, to be honest. Great Britain was probably the leading global power from 1714 onwards. 

This is also untrue and a rather bias view of history to be honest.

That said, my head canon is that the act of saving Gallifrey in DotD is actually where the Doctor's time line forked because at that point the Time Lords were destined to change his future.  This runs contrary to the idea that Gallifrey was saved all along and the Doctor ""forgot"", but I never bought into that hogwash.  Too much evidence to the contrary.

&gt;Sport (or sports) is all forms of usually competitive physical activity which,[1] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing entertainment to participants, and in some cases, spectators.[2] Hundreds of sports exist, from those requiring only two participants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.

&gt;Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,[3] and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports,[4][5] although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1]

From what I understand, most of this could be rolled into the new mortgage, but then we would be paying it off over 25 years with interest, so we saved up enough to cover the fees and are using the equity in our existing house to cover the deposit on the new one.

This is a complete false equivilancy!

The SOLE reason the British were so successful is because of how repressive we WEREN'T. That said, we're still talking about the 18th, 19th centuries, which were repressive by anyone's standards today.

Unlike the French, Dutch, Belgians, and later the Germans and Italians, we didn't try to supplant native rulers to the same extent. Even the British Raj, the jewel in the crown of the empire, exploited a system of existing principalities to maintain local control.

Was it 100% peachy? no it was not. Was it fairly Racist? Yes it was. But to compare the empire to its contemporaries, it was notable for its laxness.

Yup. Here's the first:

Can't find anything about the latter with a quick search.

For the fuel bill for a couple of hours flight time you could probably afford to put a couple of ex-military engineers on a year's salary too anyway.

true,slippyg,null,null,"&gt; Do you think Council will sell a property?

Unlikely. It sounds to me like it's due for demolition but councils usually do not start this process until they're sure of what is going to be built on the site. If they cannot persuade anyone to build privately and won't build on it themselves, they will leave it as is. It may also belong to a Housing Association, Ministry of Defence etc who will be doing the same thing.

Council tenants do have the right to buy their property after living there for a certain amount of time and fulfilling other requirements.

&gt;If Council agrees to sell, can I send in a building inspector before buying it? Can I back off if the inspector says it's not worth to repair it without having to pay penalty to Council?

My understanding of right to buy is based on the way it works in my local authority and normally the buyers solicitor will negotiate with the legal dept. at the council. Obviously at this point though the tenant already lives in the home, though. I would assume that you would want a surveyor to look at the house as you would any home purchase and that the council would be accepting of this as long as you're paying.

&gt;Is there additional rules for EU citizens in regards to buying a property in the UK?

None that I know of I think your biggest hurdle here is that the council will not sell off stock to private individuals. People are absolutely desperate for affordable property in the UK and there have been several high profile articles in my city about houses that have been left empty. Most big local authorities will have a team or individual that deals with empty homes. 

&gt;If I find out that property doesn't belong to anyone (or someone that has died/company was shut down), is there way to buy it?

I am not a solicitor but would assume, as assets go to the crown when there is no will and no living relatives, that you would be able to buy the house at auction. Though if it's been like this for 10 years you would also assume that it is in fact owned by someone living.",0,1406480076,null,0,false,0,cj987tu,t3_2bv70o,t1_cj987tu,t3_2bv70o,null,1435464183,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I just studied for and passed the test. 

I really enjoyed reading the book, but I hated studying the book.

What do I mean by that? Well, the book was enjoyable because it gave me lots of detail about the history of the UK. I especially liked reading about the constant battle between the Catholics and Protestants, and the situation in Ireland and then Northern Ireland + Republic of Ireland. The history put a lot of the modern day conflict in to perspective.

Similar for Scotland.

I hated studying it because I had to learn and memorise the book. That completely sucked the joy out of it. I spent days remembering famous battles, the names of Henry VIII^th 's wives, the number of people in the Welsh assembly.  

I felt like learning all that stuff in the finest detail was a complete waste of my time. Familiarity bred contempt.

By the way, I'm Australian, 40+yrs old, educated, lived in the UK for a total of 3yrs now. I grew up on diet of BBC television. I could barely pass any of those online tests when I first started studying. By the end of my study, I was able to average about 96% in any of those online tests. But even after weeks of study, and writing a 20 pages summary, I still couldn't get 100% in every single test. There were always some really weird and obscure questions that I couldn't remember (or care to remember) the answer to. 

The real test was much easier than any of those online tests. I did the real test in about 2 minutes, then I spent 2 minutes checking my answers, then I left the room.


**EDIT:** I studied using these tests: http://www.theuktest.com/life-in-the-uk-test/1

true,Chinerz,chen,Chen,"Hello there, 
Whilst I write this from my iPad, in a hotel room in Tenerife. I hope to get all the information I can across about myself. 

About Me:
I am 20 years old, I live in Ipswich, Suffolk. I have been working for over 2 years (9-5). I have two major passions, one being football(running around the country watching Ipswich play every Saturday) and the other being dota. After attending ESL one it has spurred me on to want to get into the competitive scene. (However long a road that may be).

My Dota2 experience:
I started playing Dota 2 in February last year, which kind of shows my dedication/madness that I have grown to love over past two TI's. I have played roughly 2000 games of dota (pubs) with a few in-house league games. I have attended two Insomnia LANs (With my friends) however these didn't go too well. My biggest regret is not being able to attend insomnia 52, however I would be able to attend any future LANs.  
I play roughly every weekday evening between 6pm and 11pm and all day Sunday playing. Saturdays depend on whether ipswich are playing home or away (as I will be there). My current Solo MMR is currently 3.8k which has peaked at 4k. I have played roughly 1000 ranked games as you can see from the links below. 

What I play:
Predominantly, the role that I would like to play would either be the role of the 4/5. My three favourite heroes are: Dazzle, Chen and Invoker. My best heroes are: Dazzle, Chen, Maiden, Shadow Shaman, Tide, Skywrath, Earthshaker and Sand king. I can play a large array of support heroes and am always keen to take advice and learn new tactics. I am not a confident drafter, just thought I'd put that in there.

Set Up:
I currently use a Razer Naga and a Razer Lycosa. I have access to Skype and team speak, with once again a Razer product being my headset. 

Realistic Goals (maybe too optimistic):
To play competitive dota against some of the big name teams in Europe that I look up to.
Attend a LAN event by invite.
Be involved with the first English team ever invited to an International. (Dream big). 

If you would like to consider me as a potential player, then by all means add me on steam. I will back in England on the 9th August 2014. As I have stated I am always available for some trials, at your convenience!

You could argue less but that's mostly due to his lessened amount of playing time. All I'm saying is that Rodgers knows far more than we do, seeing them play on a regular basis. 

As for the shirt grabbing it pisses me off to no end when people complain about that. These are behemoths of men able to jump and move so well that it's supremely difficult to defend. It happens at a high school level in the US and I'm sure at some points of the Academy level as well. Every defender does that, from Kompany to Cahill, that's how it's done in the EPL I'm afraid. I never said stats aren't useful in football, I'm saying they're near useless for defenders because what they do best is not usually recorded. 

This simple stat can be skewed by a bias where Sahko played against higher quality teams and Daniel lower tier. Now I'm not saying that's the case, I'd need to go back and do a significant amount of research and that's just not gonna happen as a I take this poop.

Basically your definition of pride is wrong and your argument is to keep using it wrongly (or you actually believe you affected the empire surviving into the modern world (whatever that means?! things happened the way they did)) because you don't want to realise either that your sense of national pride is unfounded or that you've been using the word pride wrongly for your entire life.

&gt;Maybe they UKIP-Tory competition would let Labour get an easy victory. Maybe they thought there would be more left-wing voters, only for just enough of those voters to choose Green.

Well, if there were 1682 voting UKIP/Tory and 1269 voting Labour/Green, the chances of an *easy* Labour victory is quite slim. Especially if the percentage in the left-leaning demographic is 87% Labour. It might be that those 160 Green voters don't *want* to vote Labour, and want to support their own party instead of ""the least worst alternative"".

My point is that going from this one election's results to saying ""Vote Green, Get UKIP"" is at best disingenuous.  

&gt;&gt;Or maybe they would have voted UKIP, who knows?
&gt;
What would have been the point in that? UKIP won.

It was sort of a counter-point to what I was saying. *If* the 878 had all voted Labour, that would have also beaten UKIP - but on the other hand, we can't tell how they would have voted.

Really, it isn't. 

If you'd ever tried attaching a GoPro to a model aircraft, you'd know how poor a setup it is for spying on anybody. Even if you're the paranoid type that thinks every~~one~~ man with a camera is out to stalk you or spy on you, just consider the practicalities for a moment. The obvious options are:

1) Covert camera setup on the ground - long lens on a stable tripod, or small concealed cameras - silent, no vibrations. You could set something up which could record almost indefinitely with mains power and enough storage. Like the CCTV cameras all around us...

2) Camera on a quadcopter - obvious buzzing flying thing in an otherwise-empty sky, getting fairly poor footage due to distance, vibrations, the wind, and the difficulty of both flying it and trying to aim the camera. Oh, and the added cost, and very limited battery life (~10min flight time for most hobbyist quadcopters)

As for looking through windows... well, you can do that from ground level too. Probably more successfully for the above reasons...

true,L2Kenny,lfc99,,"You've got a point, but Sturridge at the time wasn't considered one of the best strikers in the Premier League, just a winger with attitude problems. Whether having Rafa as manager helped I don't know, but Chelsea were looking to sign Demba Ba to replace him for £7m and the general mood at the time was that Chelsea have replaced an overrated winger/striker for one of the Premier League's leading goal scorer and made £5m profit.

Lukaku on the other hand has no questions on his ability. He is a good BPL striker. Chelsea don't have a replacement lined up for him, Costa is obviously the main striker but no worth backup. Drogba will probably be used the same as Eto'o last season - an experience striker who can lead the team - and won't get first team football at 36, regardless of his history with Chelsea.

Mourinho doesn't seem keen on Lukaku and is fine with selling talent if the price is right, but will he? I don't think so. I think Mourinho can recognise when he's got something worth keeping and I reckon he'll keep Lukaku and use him in rotation with Costa rather than sell him to Everton, Liverpool Atletico Madrid and wherever he's been linked to.

Then again, I also said Barcelona wouldn't bid for Suarez since they needed a CB not a striker, so what do I know?

umm... no they didn't. Do you actually think that?? 

From the Savile report: ""3.76: ""Despite the contrary evidence given by soldiers, we have concluded that none of them fired in response to attacks or threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers. No one threw or threatened to throw a nail or petrol bomb at the soldiers on Bloody Sunday.""""

You must be a little behind the times. The long discounted Widgery report claimed that the IRA had shot first: ""I am entirely satisfied that the first firing in the [Rossville Flats] courtyard was directed at the soldiers.""""

£28k is £2333.33 a month.  Employer pension contributions come off gross pay (at least mine do), so assuming your contribution of 5% you're looking at your month's gross pay being reduced to £2333.33 * 0.95 = £2216.

Other deductions?  Student loan: £72 pcm.  After tax and NI, you're down to £1680.52 (according to ListenToTaxman).  Other deductions, such as private health care or employee share plans?  Assume maybe another £50-100 at least.

Your rent is £360.  Other bills?  You'll probably have to pay your share of council tax (no single occupancy either), share of electric, gas (if you have it), phone/broadband, food (if you share those bills).  Assume another £200 give or take.

West Ham is Zone 3, so assuming your work is Zone 1, that's at least £100 a month for rail-based travel depending on how you choose to do it.

All tolled?  £1680.52 - 100 - 360 - 200 - 100 = £920.52 just for you at a conservative estimate.  What's your social life like?  Got any hobbies?  How much do you want to save?

I'm not saying it can't be done and that you shouldn't do it, and I wish you all the best, but you're not going to have champagne baths or a Bentley just because you're house sharing.

&gt; If you say, have a student loan, you will be on about 2k after tax a month. After rent and bills, you will have what, £1250-1300 left? If you cant maintain a good lifestyle on that something is very wrong with your money management. 

No student loan :)  Sadly my take home is a bit less than £2k due to some employee deductions which I'm needing to restructure.  My total bills before food are about £800 a month all in, and I also reckon I'm trying to save too much.  Restructuring should allow me to save more, but more comfortably too.

I've also got about £1000 of car upkeep expenses needing paid off first.  My financial management has been pretty dire in general lately.",0,1406488359,null,0,false,0,cj9bwr3,t3_2bsuta,t1_cj9bwr3,t1_cj95j2o,null,1435464062,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Townsend, while fast as hell, has proven that he still doesn't ""get it"". On the NA Tour, he dribbled to open space for the sake of dribbling. It doesn't accomplish anything. Outside of his sexy goal, the only bright spot I saw from him was in the Chicago game when Lamela dropped it off for Kane who missed Andros streaking through the wide-spread CBs.

/r/Iwantout is better for these kinds of things, but as a US citizen it is fairly straight forward to get a UK student visa which will let you stay in the UK for as long as your course lasts, and allow you to work up to 20 hours a week to support your studies. I think you have to demonstrate a certain amount of savings and be accepted onto a course. I study at St Andrews and there are tonnes of Americans here so it's not that hard to get a student visa. And who knows who you might meet and end up getting a spousal visa if you wanted to move here long term (although that's a complicated process).

As for the Tier 2 employment visas, which are visas for non-EU workers in the UK, those are much harder to come by. They are subject to an annual cap (I think it's 35,000) and employers must demonstrate that they are unable to find a worker with a similar or better skillset in the entire of the EU before applying for one. So your only hope of getting one is being an expert in your field which also has a skill shortage in the UK, or being seconded here by an American firm who has a UK office.

Israel have diplomatic relations with the UK, RoI and the EU. ISIS do not. That means ISIS can not be challenged by the citizens of other countries, they cannot be boycotted (I don't actually agree with boycotting personally) and they are not presently funded by western countries to carry out their deeds. Why is that so hard to grasp? It is also why the attention is much greater. People want their governments to put diplomatic pressure on Israel. So with that cleared up, can you suggest how the same pressure can be put on ISIS?

America is one of those very few bullshit (sorry, but it's true when it comes to taxes) countries which require you to fill out annual tax paperwork even if you work, live in and pay taxes elsewhere. You might even owe them taxes even though you've already paid them in your country of work! And they're actually getting more vicious about it. They've passed laws stating that if a bank that does business in the US and also around the world doesn't report on Americans' saving accounts/current accounts when they go over a certain limit (say, $10,000), they could face monetary sanctions relating to the bank's business in America. In other words, banks have to tell on you if you're American and have money, and if they get caught not doing it, they have to pay. 

[This has actually led to a marked increase in American expats refuting their American citizenship.](http://rt.com/usa/158736-americans-citizenship-us-refuse/)I can personally tell you the laws involving this American-living-outside-America tax thing is so complicated you have a very hard time finding lawyers or accountants who will take you as a client.

It would take a gargantuan amount of money to challenge for Europe, let alone the title. That's not me being unambitious, it's me being realistic. Only one team has broken into the group of title challengers in the last 20 years, Manchester City, and that's exactly what they did. They used gargantuan amounts of money.  

Unfortunately, Cortese had Saints fans believing that we could do it. Obviously, we can't. The reason he left is because he wanted Liebherr to spend that kind of money and she didn't want to, understandably. It's her money, not Cortese's.  

In all likelihood, we will be a mid table Premier League side at best for the forseeable future. The only person who can be blamed for that is English football. The game is built so that the successful and rich continue to be successful and rich. If Tottenham and Everton can't break into that exclusive group, why should we be able to?  

Essentially, we are victims of our own success. We had a blinding season and Cortese convinced many (Pochettino, Lovren etc) that we could go higher when realistically we can't. Top clubs saw our young players and decided they wanted them. Surprise surprise, a top club comes calling offering a youngster the chance to play alongside Gerrard or Van Persie as well as tripling their wages. Of course they're going to want to leave.

true,pseudopodia,null,null,"Just wanted to comment to give you a better idea on living costs, as I've lived in London for the past 4 years. Generally, the price of living depends greatly on how much you're willing to pay for rent. To be close to my university, I've lived in one of the most expensive parts of London (Chelsea &amp; Fulham area), where I paid rent between £150-£180 a week while sharing with 4 or 1 other housemate. A friend of mine paid £200 a week for a studio flat near Hammersmith. This is not including council tax, which was exempt for me as a student but I think can add up to another 1-2k to your bills annually. Conversely, other areas in London are a lot cheaper. During a work placement I lived in Zone 5, where I paid a weekly rent of £120 (another shared house). 

I'm not sure where in the UK you live in, but I heard from friends from other universities that alcohol, going out and groceries can be a bit more expensive in London, again depending on which area in London you're living in. 

The main thing you'll have to factor in when moving to London is that unless you live walking distance from your job, or are happy to cycle in manic London traffic, you'll probably want to buy a travel card for public transport, which costs £120 a month for Zones 1-2 alone. 

Personally, during a placement year, I was able to live on a salary of £13,000 (though only paying National insurance contributions, but not tax, as it was spread over two tax years), living in Zone 5, not paying council tax and using the public transport very minimally (I walked to my job every day). Though I wouldn't recommend it, as I had little to no savings and was living on a fixed budget of £70 a week for all things other than rent and bills. 

Unfortunately I can't comment on potential salaries in your industry, but I hope that what I wrote can help you decide whether a potential job will offer you enough money to live comfortably in London. :)",0,1406492997,null,0,false,0,cj9dznb,t3_2bsuta,t1_cj9dznb,t3_2bsuta,null,1434928046,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The IRA also had limited resources, and coded warnings were a method of remaining active and causing substantial fear and disruption without having to have the resources to follow through.

The IRA did not blow people up because 'something went wrong' (unless it was the terrorists who blew-up themselves). There had to be real casualties, or the threat of real casualties in order to be able to use the telephone as a weapon of terror.

It is true that the IRA sometimes needed 'good publicity' to avoid alienating their American supporters, which could be achieved by minimising civilian deaths. This wasn't an act of humanity, but political pragmatism. 

Using the telephone and coded warnings was a genuine terror tactic that has been acknowledged by former IRA commanders, that is why you are being downvoted.

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"Israel deliberately undermined efforts to have a lasting peace with the PLO. In fact they created Hamas to weaken Palestinian unity.

&gt; Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamist movement in Palestine, returning from Cairo in the seventies, established an Islamic charity association. Prime Minister Golda Meir, saw this as a an opportunity to counterbalance the rise of Arafat’s Fatah movement. According to the Israeli weekly Koteret Rashit (October 1987), ""The Islamic associations as well as the university had been supported and encouraged by the Israeli military authority"" in charge of the (civilian) administration of the West Bank and Gaza. ""They [the Islamic associations and the university] were authorized to receive money payments from abroad.""
&gt; 
&gt; The Islamists set up orphanages and health clinics, as well as a network of schools, workshops which created employment for women as well as system of financial aid to the poor. And in 1978, they created an ""Islamic University"" in Gaza. ""The military authority was convinced that these activities would weaken both the PLO and the leftist organizations in Gaza."" At the end of 1992, there were six hundred mosques in Gaza. Thanks to Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad (Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks) , the Islamists were allowed to reinforce their presence in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the members of Fatah (Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine) and the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression.

[Source](http://globalresearch.ca/articles/ZER403A.html)

In 2007 the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert openly accused Binyamin Netanyahu of creating Hamas to counter the PLO.
 
&gt; ""Netanyahu has gone back to being the same old Netanyahu,"" and accused him of directly contributing to strengthening the Hamas movement by releasing the movement's founder, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, during his term as prime minister. ""Netanyahu established Hamas, gave it life, freed Sheikh Yassin and gave him the opportunity to blossom,"" he said, adding that the current political situation in the Palestinian Authority came about ""because of the nonsense that was done while Netanyahu was prime minister.""

true,UncleArthur,null,null,"Okay, then. You are implying you are a Higher Rate taxpayer and that you are using your own car for business purposes, being reimbursed by a car allowance and a fuel card. On that basis:

- The £4,800 is taxable @ 40% and the cost to you is therefore £1,920.

- The car allowance is a Benefit in Kind and therefore you personally will not suffer a National Insurance Contribution liability on the amount (although your employer will, under Class 1A). Good-oh.

- The fuel card business mileage is irrelevant to you for tax purposes. However, the 10,000 mile personal element would be deemed a Benefit in Kind (rather than subject to the Fuel Benefit Charge, as you haven't got a company car).

- Here's where the guesswork begins! Given the above, I would therefore assume that whatever the cost of fuel used to fund your 10,000 miles will cost you tax @ 40% of that value. Obviously, this is quite difficult to work out, but if we assume that 1 mile costs 10p in fuel, then that gives a  total cost of £1,000 for 10,000 miles, which generates a tax liability @ 40% of £400.

- Total cost to you is therefore £2,320. If anyone can confirm I've got HMRC guidance right or wrong, I'd be grateful. I'd also suggest that OP talk this through with HR, who should know the maths and the situation very well.

Relevant HMRC pages:

http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/nimmanual/nim05819.htm

http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25530.htm

- Edit: I believe you can offset the Benefit in Kind by claiming up to 45p for the first 10,000 miles travelled (after that, 25p per mile); therefore, rather than costing you money, you might actually find the fuel allowance saves you tax.

Meanwhile, the way in which most countries become independent was incredibly asinine and lead to significant sectarian violence. For example, the existence of the state of Nigeria made little sense when it consisted of many different ethnicities, a lot of whom didn't like each other to the point that they went to civil war to split up the country and have their own land, leaving millions dead.

If I can get most of those questions wrong, how is a migrant supposed to fare? These quizzes should be kept up to date and pertain to *modern* British culture, not historical facts (most of which, according to this quiz, I was never even taught in school).

I'm not saying the questions should be about who won the last X Factor competition but they should pertain to aspects of living in Britain that would be *relevant* to an immigrant as well as to a native citizen. Current events, especially (as in, shit that has happened in the past 5 years).

How am I supposed to know when slavery was abolished? Nobody taught me this in school and I've never cared to find out when it happened. I was simply happy to know that it happened. As for these random battles, who the heck is supposed to know what order they occurred in if they haven't grown up here? If I migrated to a foreign country I wouldn't be looking up on their ancient history, I'd be learning how to live there as it is *now*.

I have no idea how many national parks we have. I just know that we have them. I knew who authored Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but that's because I grew up here as a British *kid* and read his books. If you're migrating to the UK as a 37 year old Nigerian, how are you supposed to know that? It'd be like me migrating to Germany and being expected to know a bunch of German childrens' book authors. I just wouldn't, even if I became fluent in German. I'm an *adult*.

The question about Romans is also insane. This was what, over 1000 years ago?

Daniel Agger is not included in Liverpool's squad for Sunday's game against Olympiakos, the Dane has returned home from the club's training session in the United States.

Spanish media reports that Barcelona has made a new bid for Danish Daniel Agger, the situation in Liverpool seems increasingly untenable.

Daniel Agger has previously announced that he did not want to be in the English big club if he is not reckoned to be good enough for the starting lineup.

It was an issue already last season, and the situation has not improved after Liverpool recently confirmed that it has acquired center defender Dejan Lovren from Southampton for up to £ 20m.

Now generally reports the usually well-informed Liverpool website the Liverpool Way on twitter that Daniel Agger has been sent home from Liverpool's training run for the U.S. along with Fabio Borini who also has been linked with a move away from Liverpool this summer.

Liverpool have reached an agreement with Sunderland on a sale of the Italian striker, although supposedly has so far been reluctant to accept the offer. Fabio Borini also struggling with a minor shoulder injury.

Remarkably, it may be that newly acquired Adam Lallana, which has recently been reported out with a knee injury for six weeks, supposedly still in the United States along with the rest of the Liverpool players.

Daniel Agger has been in Liverpool since January 2006, and he is noted for a total of 232 matches and 14 scores in the red sweater. Only Steven Gerrard in the current Liverpool squad have played for the club for longer than the Dane, who before last season was named as vice captain.

But it might be a good idea.

Of course, trying to wrestle with a multi-ton truck while in a Citroen Saxo is one of those life-defining moments; sure, there is a chance you might 'win', and defeat the truck, but chances are you're going to lose and discover just how useful the NHS is.

And your point of ""...unless it's an emergency"" is interesting.  Assuming the car driver doesn't have telepathic abilities it's hard to know whether the truck driver is indicating because it's an emergency.  Best to assume the truck driver has a good reason to pull out and allow it to happen.

But otherwise we're basically in agreement here.  The truck driver should have held his position.  And the car driver shouldn't have been in such a hurry to get squashed into the crash barrier.

The main point to me about your comment. You call it ""letting cars through"", you are using the wrong language.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I would quibble about some of the categorising.

I think Walker should thrive under Poch because his is a very direct style of play.  We all saw how Shaw went last season... Davies is not quite as attacking as him, which should mean Walker could be our main attacking fullback.

I would've thought Kaboul and Eriksen would do great too, as Kaboul has the pace to play a high line, and Eriksen should have lots of players making runs for him to pick them out.  He created a lot out of nothing for us last season (which he is great at), but I think he'll do even better when the rest of the team's attack is intense and fluid.  He lacks the high-press energy style, but that will be his only downside.

I'd also take Bentaleb and Paulinho out of the first category... the former because I think he's good at both possession and more direct styles, the latter because he just isn't very good.  His style of play possibly suits Poch's attack ok, but he doesn't have the defensive discipline to press and position himself properly when we concede possession I reckon.

I also agree with smokey's assessment of Townsend.  Regardless of his overall quality, his main attributes (pace, dribbling ability), are the exact things you need in this system to break quickly and force your opposition backwards.

What is somebody going to do if they fancy a mid-week drink?

There have been social changes. Drink driving used to be commonly acceptable a few decades ago, now, thank god, it isn't. That is a good thing, but there can be no doubt that a large number of potential customers now find a night at the pub a slightly less appealing prospect than they used to. Similarly there has been a clamp down on under-age drinking, and a ban on smoking.

It isn't impossible to run a successful pub, but in general the sector has been in decline for many years and it isn't likely to turn around anytime soon.

There has been a resurgence in people taking holidays in the UK rather than travelling abroad, so maybe a B&amp;B might be a more viable plan?

&gt; Special mention ought to be given to the Environmental Protection Act 1990.  Under s80 of this Act a local authority officer who is satisfied that a nuisance exists can serve the perpetrator with an abatement notice, compelling them to stop the nuisance.  Failure to comply with the notice is a criminal offence.  Also of importance is the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993, as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.  The Act makes certain noise in the street, such as that from loudspeakers or car alarms, a statutory nuisance.  The local authority can also charge the person responsible for any expenses the authority incurs when abating or preventing the nuisance.  The procedures, however, are complicated, and many local authorities may be wary of attempting enforcement.  There is also the Noise Act 1996 which imposes a duty on a local authority to follow up complaints of excessive noise coming from a house.  A warning notice may be served if the noise exceeds permitted limits and occurs between 11.00pm and 7.30am.

true,MICOTINATE,null,null,"To be honest I don't think we'll spend even half of what we've earned through sales.

I'm kind of becoming subscribed to the theory that Katharina has wanted to sell the club since she inherited it and she's wanted to maximise her profit from the club. Of course for a while her desire to maximise profit had a mutually beneficial relationship with the football side of things, premier league status being essential.

With the sales money the board can clear out any of those outstanding transfer debts reported a while back, maybe even make some ground up on paying off the stadium and new training facilities. I don't know if 100M is enough to clear all the clubs debts but if it is then that's it, she can sell and pocket most of the money.

So the silver lining here is that if we *do* get sold we'll be a relatively large football team with very little (or no) debt, a modern stadium, one of the best academies going and a brand new state of the art training facility. That's an attractive prospect, maybe we'll get our own Abramovich or whatever. I wouldn't mind a bit of stability or continuity but whatever.

Whatever happens we've still got the usual things to enjoy about being southampton fans like seeing great british talent burst out and make a name for themselves. It's a shame to finish 8th and then not try and push on from that point but that's life, the owners aren't diehard Saints fans who'll invest everything they have to lift us up into top team positions they're business people. Players don't have the life ambition of walking the halls of St. Mary's when there are Old Traffords, Anfields and Nou Camps out there.

Honestly while we did superbly last season and it was a proud moment for us it was a bit boring wasn't it guys? 8th place for how long? A good old relegation dog fight might be a bit exciting.

true,SuffragettePizza,null,null,"With regards to buying a house in England, you can pull out of a purchase at any point until exchange of contracts, which is usually done late in the game. This is why the English property market can be volatile, because it is very easy to pull out of a purchase (or be gazumped!) up until you have exchanged. 

The process usually goes as follows: You put in an offer for a property and the seller accepts. You then both hire solicitors who will do the necessary legal work behind the purchase. During this time, you have the opportunity to do as many surveys as you need on the house in question, usually carried out by a chartered surveyor. They will tell you if there are any major structural works that need doing. In England, you can pull out at any time before you 'exchange contracts' without incurring a penalty.

If was approaching a car in front of him that was going too slow for him at his current speed, then he brakes to adjust HIS speed in his current lane - he does not pull out and make OTHER people brake.  Incidentally, I think this might be the reason he pulled out, it looks like a lane has just merged from the left, so he might be trying to avoid slowing down for a car that has merged and not got up to speed.

That said, short of swerving to avoid an accident, there is no reason to manoeuvre the way he did (and you don't indicate like that to avoid an accident).

true,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,"&gt; The £4,800 is taxable @ 40% and the cost to you is therefore £1,920.

&gt; The car allowance is a Benefit in Kind and therefore you personally will not suffer a National Insurance Contribution liability on the amount (although your employer will, under Class 1A). Good-oh.

The £4,800 looks like a flat-rate allowance.  *(Paid irrespective of the cost incurred.)*  If this is the case it's just earnings plain and simple.  A flat-rate allowance will incur employee's NICs

&gt; The fuel card business mileage is irrelevant to you for tax purposes. However, the 10,000 mile personal element would be deemed a Benefit in Kind (rather than subject to the Fuel Benefit Charge, as you haven't got a company car).

&gt; Here's where the guesswork begins! Given the above, I would therefore assume that whatever the cost of fuel used to fund your 10,000 miles will cost you tax @ 40% of that value. Obviously, this is quite difficult to work out, but if we assume that 1 mile costs 10p in fuel, then that gives a total cost of £1,000 for 10,000 miles, which generates a tax liability @ 40% of £400.

This may depend on implementation.

If an account is taken out with the fuel company in SkyBlue's name and the employer pays it off the whole of the payments made are a benefit *(meeting his liability)* and a claim could be made for the part which is incurred for the purpose of the employment.  The net effect of which would be that only the personal mileage is a benefit.

Either way, getting into the habit of keeping good mileage records will be a must.  Also...

true,staptiudupe,null,null,"1) As other posters have pointed out, it won't be a cakewalk. However, I think the players we have in the squad are more suited to the Prem than they were to the Championship. So I think anything from 20th through to maybe 13th is realistic (if the table is anything like it was last year).

2) By all accounts we will be playing a 3-5-2 with Rio as a sweeper behind Caulker and Onuoha, with two full backs, currently Danny Simpson and Yun Suk Yung. The battling midfield will consist of the ever-present Joey Barton (love or hate him, he works his ass off), supported by a combo of Matty Phillips/Armand Traore/Hoilett on the wings, backed up by SWP with Austin and another striker up front (currently we only have Zamora on the books, but he figures to be more of a back up than a regular starter). 

3) **Barton** - we struggled without him last season, he does the little things, tackles, moves forward, picks out players and isn't afraid to get stuck in. When he's feeling it everything seems to click. **Austin** - without him it felt like we would never score last season, he works hard and he has one hell of a fairy-tale/feel good story (having been a bricklayer not too long ago!). Great finisher, looking for 8-12 goals from him. **Hoilett** - a winger who has days when he seems to be utterly unplayable, but lacks consistency and seems to be made out of glass, but hoping for a few great games which could save us from the drop.

The answer to that talking point is obvious. It's a hard sell question. An attempt to justify the killing over a thousand people. Thousands injured and 150,000 people homeless. 

Israel are the aggressor. Believe the propaganda if you want. Or look for yourself.


* JUNE 2nd Palestinian unity government of Fatah and Hamas sworn in

* JUNE 12th Three Israeli kids were kidnapped

* Netanyahu said.....

&gt; ""Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas – the same Hamas that Abu Mazen [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas] made a unity government with,"" 

* **The Kids were DEAD**

* Netanyahu knew the kids were dead. 

* Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency **imposed a gag order on the national media**, barring news outlets from reporting that the teens had almost certainly been killed, and forbidding them from revealing the identities of their suspected killers. The Shin Bet even **lied to the parents of the kidnapped teens**, deceiving them into believing their sons were alive.

* **#bringbackourboys ... ring any bells ?** (they were dead and Israel knew)

* Netanyahu staged an aggressive international public relations campaign, demanding sympathy and outrage from world leaders, who were also given the impression that the missing teens were still alive.

* The search for the missing teenagers prompted a vast Israeli military operation in the West Bank 

* **six Palestinians killed** during the search operation

* More than 560 Palestinians – (mainly Hamas members) ""arrested"". 

* Israeli troops ransacked countless homes

* [Israeli forces stole USD 3 million in cash, property from Palestinians during West Bank raids](http://euromid.org/en/article/533%E2%80%9D)

* **Palestinian teen kidnapped and burnt alive**

* As they did after the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens, the Shin Bet imposed a gag order on the investigation, seemingly hoping to delay the news that Abu Khudair was the victim of Jewish extremism. And as before, the police flooded Israeli media with disinformation, this time by insinuating the murdered teen had been killed by members of his own family for being gay.

* JUNE 30th...  Israel Vows Revenge for Teenagers' Deaths

* JULY 1st .. **Israeli bombs targets Gaza after three teenagers killed**

Israel admits HAMAS didn't kidnap the 3 Israeli teens after all. *Ooops.*


     

  

    

    


 
 
Do Palestinians have the right to defend themselves?


   

  
    

    


The believing Israeli propaganda thing. **Don't do it**. It is done by the same guy who sold us ""the war on terror"" and ""WMD's in Iraq"".   http://www.khanfactor.com/blog/?p=839  ""terror tunnels"", ""human shields"" ???? familiar ????

Look, hamas are dicks, but Israel are dicks too. **Propaganda can only fool stupid people** into making the killing of hundreds of innocent people into an ok thing to do. Are you stupid?

true,MadArend,num20,,"Yeah, he was the ""last CB standing"" for much of the season.  But he also played a fuckton of minutes, oversaw virtually all of our clean sheets (at one point pretty late in the season, I seem to recall him tied for most clean sheets amongst PL CBs), and was generally better than most people give him credit for.

I know that I'm one of the few who defend Dawson on this sub, but the anti-Dawson circlejerk is, I think, not entirely rational.  He certainly has his shortcomings, and he's not quite good enough to be a starter for the team we want to be, but he's better than most people here give him credit for.

I think most people would be shocked to learn that his average whoscored rating last year, in 32 PL appearances, was 7.16 -- the same as Vincent Kompany, and better than John Terry or David Luiz.  Whoscored ratings aren't the be-all/end-all, but they're useful as a grounding point.

Kompany had a down year, and Luiz is hugely overrated as a CB, so I'm not trying to make Dawson out to be a world-class CB.  But statements like ""Dawson isn't PL quality anymore"" or Dawson is shite"" are lunacy.  

He played in 84% of our league matches last year, in a system that didn't suit him, with a rotating cast of partners that sometimes included non-CBs, and played well.",0,1406504403,null,0,1406504672,0,cj9j1tt,t3_2bv3hm,t1_cj9j1tt,t1_cj9i6fe,null,1434930729,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,strifeblood,null,null,"I completely disagree with your argument. We've supported Torres for the past 3 years and he has been every chance to succeed. You do know that Torres has played more than twice the amount of games as Shevchenko right? Shevchenko was a flop but not nearly as much as Torres since he was at least 30 when he flopped, around when players usually decline. We played £50 million and Torres averages like 1 goal in like 4 games or something like that. That's not just mediocre or average, that's just bad.

Think rationally for a second about what Torres has done by being a flop (not just a regular one, but an expensive flop) instead of trying to ignore 9t, it's not us being swayed by the media, it's you not thinking about it critically. We spent £50 million to get Torres and we offered £150k with weekly wages, so we were stuck with him because he's too expensive to bench and we had to give him chances to bounce back. He's has 3 years and he's missed countless of these sitter type of goals, it's sad. Since he was so expensive and we hoped he would recover to form in which he was great, our managers were asked to build around him. When you build around to make a team to set up a mediocre striker, there's only so much managers can do. They can't bench him forever due to his price. The managers were screwed because they were told to build around Torres and then Torres misses easy chances for a professional striker like this. Then you lose games because Torres can't even be decent and then you get sacked.  

Your idea of what support is just wrong. Chelsea supporters should be wanting the best for the club and there is no one player above the club. We've been supporting him for 3 years now, he's not going to be a competent striker for us again. It's best for the club to move on.

Don't take that as me claiming Duffy is better than him or that Stones isn't good enough, it's just Stones wasn't really at his best today. A good comparison I'd take from the two is Stones is unquestionably the star and Duffy the backup/fringe player but Naismith was given a great chance last year and shone when we all thought he was shite before and he outplayed Lukaku in a couple of games. All I'm saying is give him a chance and he'll either prove he's good enough and if not well I'm sure we'd egg a reasonable price for him or let him go free and win the World Cup 2 years later (Slight Mustafi Joke/Dig there) 

As for what u said about Long I agree we do need players willing to be and I'm gonna be blunt here, bench warmers just in case. I probably worded that part of my original comment wrong but I was kinda pointing out players that I could see become starters for the team but that doesn't mean that if let's say someone came in with £1-2.5m offers for Long or Hope or some of them I would say no, I mean there are a lot of youngsters at the club with ""potential"" but realistically before Ross when was the last time an academy player came through and fulfilled their potential? And even though I think he'll be up for player of the season next year in the league there's every possibility that Ross drops a little bit and becomes more of a central midfielder rather than a number 10 this year and loses his spark a bit. I'm not saying that'll happen and I hope it doesn't but it's entirely possible. All I'm saying is just because a player is cracked up to be a world beater doesn't mean they will become one. 

We will see this is let's say 5 years because in 5 years if Ledson Kenny and Green aren't starting for us and England then this whole ""potential"" malarkey is just a hype machine designed for us to request big money if a club wants one of our so called ""wonderkids"" then we are no better than United with their academy. 

Quick offshoot of that but not really Januzaj is crap enough it's all United academy hype that got him into the Belgian squad especially ahead of Eden Hazards little brother who scored like 30 goals and was Belgian player of the year. I don't want us to become that, I want our players in national squads because they deserve it not because they're hyped up.

true,HorriBliss,null,null,"&gt; Do you think I'll have trouble finding a job? 

Honestly?  Yes.  Most likely you're looking for minimum wage or service-based jobs with little technical skill/qualifications needed?  Then yes, you're up against hundreds of people for every job that is available.  For example, a few years ago my friend got a job at Tesco (a super-market).  There were 30 jobs available.  300 people applied for those 30 jobs.

I know plenty of friends with months/years of service-based experience (waitressing/waitering, bar-man, etc.) and yet they struggle with finding a job.  They're all young (early twenties/late teens) but the jobs simply aren't there.  They ask for experience, and even then, it's hard.

Your accent/English skills shouldn't be a problem (if your texting here is indicative of that). 

&gt;How would I apply for college? 


I know you're young, but if you're serious about moving to another country you need to be able to independently research these things.  But in the U.K. college (I assume you mean University?  We call the last two years of high-school: ""college"", it's far less common to refer to University as College.  However, some Universities/tertiary education institutions do have the title: ""College"" in their name, which is moreso confusing).

UCAS is how it is done, though, have a poke around the website: http://www.ucas.com/

&gt;When it is safe to do so, signal to indicate your intentions to other road users

I guess there could be some debate about what it is ""safe to do""

But Mirror Signal Maneuver is a series of steps. Why check you mirrors if you are going to signal anyway? Surely then it would be signal, mirror, maneuver?

Of course, the reason I said in theory is because in practice signalling intent has to be done in some situations, and the lorry was in one. But it doesn't give you any right to change lane.

Ignoring the highway code because of the aforementioned impracticality. 

A signal in this situation isn't a declaration ""I am going to move"" it is a request ""I would like to get out, would someone be kind enough to flash me out""

If I see someone pulling a dick move, I give them the space to pull it. There are a few times when I intentionally fuck other drivers over and it's not wise to do it but technically, technically I am in the right when I fuck them over. Example being a local road near me, the left lane forms into two lanes and the right lane goes up on a fly over to a tunnel toll road. Often you will find people sit in the right lane expecting to be able to simply push straight in.

* I have a few weak heroes such as vengeful spirit who I am constantly trying to improve with.
* I love to play all heroes however and really enjoy a challange
* I have captained a couple of teams now but my current team is falling apart due to lack of playing by some of the other players.

* I'm 17 and I'm commited to dota and have been for 2 years and would love to play in more tournerments

The way he drops deep and solves the problem of moving the ball forwards was great to watch at times. Sturridge dropped to the right side too which made me mix them until the commentator corrected me. But he was still doing the majority of the work on the right and moving inwards with the ball.   
I don't know whether it's confidence or reputation but he has that space that he makes out that no defender or midfielder wants to step in too quickly. The kind of second thoughts that great dribblers force on the defenders and when they commit he passes it or moves out of the way.  
Towards the end last season he would receive the ball and turn with it right away due to defenders not wanting to close him down and lose space, but now he doesn't even need that, his spacial thinking is so great that he lays it off and moves to space. His technique and style is so advanced it's common sight for us these days, but I thought I would just remind people of how brilliant he is with the ball and off it. 


His finish was also brilliantly average, because we expect that of good finishers we take it for granted, but remember when he used to hesitate, over do a bit and try to make 100% it went in, or how he stopped working towards the goal once the pass he anticipated doesn't happen instead of remaining alert to anything (something Suarez loves ex. v Southampton, ManU, Stoke and numerous failed passes turned into successful dribbles). He is focused and calm at the same time, doesn't let his nerves get to him like some of the debutantes this season who are trying a bit too hard to get a goal. Him and Coutinho are moving with the ball at the highest level there is and we are so used to it we don't notice it much, I can't wait until Coutinho adopts this calmness that Sterling has picked up.

Amy: Yes, Amy was attracted to him, but she accepted the boundaries he set for their relationship.  After that it evolved into a very deep friendship.  I never had any sense that Amy was ""pining"" for the Doctor (""turned on"" would be a better description for her feelings during the early days of their relationship)\*.

Clara: She isn't pining for him.  In fact if there is any pining going on in this relationship I would say it was the Doctor pining for her.  Though, again, pining suggests that the feelings are one way.  Since she seems to return his feelings, it really isn't pining.  I don't want to comment more on it because I've read the scripts and seen the screener.  

These all qualify as ""elements of romance"" but don't really meet the definition of pining.  Nor have you addressed why any of this should be objectionable.  It's also probably worth noting that none of the ""romances"" repeated themselves.  Each has had it's own unique character.

\*Actually it seemed to me that all of the ""romance"" between the Doctor and Amy was dealt with in about 5 minutes of screen time.  Everything after that was much more about Rory gaining confidence and believing that Amy really did love him. 

Edit:
&gt;Donna was literally the only female NuWho companion without some sort of romantic tension.

Donna was also the only female NuWho companion that wasn't very attractive (awesome character, but still not attractive).  Why would you expect there to be no romantic tension when two attractive people start traveling together?  It wouldn't be very realistic at all if you didn't at least have an initial period where they are figuring out the boundaries of their relationship.  Even with Donna the Doctor was very clear about what the boundaries were before he agreed to let her come with him.

In six months he went from being a defender at a club that would get sent down to the Championship on the last day of the season, to starting in and winning a Champions League Final against Bayern in their own backyard. He went from being a part of a squad that lost 5-0 to Stoke in an FA Cup Semi to winning not only the FA Cup but the Champions League in the same season.

He's had an incredible rise from winning Burnley and Bolton Player of the Year honours, to being on the PFA Team of the Year and holding both continental honours.

In two and a half seasons he's matured into Chelsea's go-to centre back option. He went from a signing that people, people in this subreddit, were a little cold on to being one of the few players people unanimously agree should start most if not every game at centre back.

And now it looks like he might be a vice-captain this season. A possible heir apparent to John Terry, the man who has held the armband since taking over from Desailly over a decade ago.

At 28 his star is still on the rise, and it's been really fun to marvel at.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; You do know that Torres has played more than twice the amount of games as Shevchenko right? 

Sheva spent 3 seasons here, and Torres completed 3 seasons at the end of last season (2013/14). So comparing their performances in 3 seasons, Sheva had half the number of games as Torres and averaged around the same number of goals per match.

&gt;Shevchenko was a flop but not nearly as much as Torres since he was at least 30 when he flopped, around when players usually decline

30 is the age where most players hit their peak. You need only look at Drogba and Lampard, both of whom had their best seasons at the age of 31.

&gt;it's not us being swayed by the media

You say that, then you go on and say this: 

&gt; our managers were asked to build around him.

Based on what are you claiming this? 1. Based on media speculation. 2. Based on the fact that we got Benitez in as an interm manage.

Now before we go further, let me first remind you of the managers who were appointed while Torres has been at the club:

1. AVB - Think Torres was the reason he got sacked? Wrong. He got the sack because he could not sort out his high defensive line and we were conceding too many goals and losing too many important games.

2. RDM - was Torres the reason he got sacked? Wrong. He lost too many important matches due to fielding a completely unbalanced lineup. Hazard, Mata, Oscar, none of whom were asked to track back and help full-backs. Combine that with the fact that we were lacking any proper depth at DM. Ramires was good, Lamps was ok, but even under Jose, we needed to sign Matic until we got that stability in midfield. Go back and watch our Matic-less matches if you don't believe me. By the way, Torres helped him win the Champions League.

3. Rafa Benitez. I know people think Roman brought him in to help Torres and maybe that's partly true. But perhaps the reason he brought Benitez in was because we had no-one else ready to take up an interm role as manage of a club that regularly sacks managers? And perhaps Benitez played Torres over every other striker because of his affection and friendship with Torres? Regardless, Torres was scoring again under Benitez, so its not even applicable to say Torres hindered Benitez. We've had much bigger problems than just Torres. 

If your argument is regarding the money, then consider Zidane's tranfer to Madrid, and how much he contributed to their team in his first 3 years. For all intents and purposes he was a flop. His numbers where no where near as spectacular as his transfer fee. A direct comparison would be Rivaldo who played in the exact same role as Zidane and still had over twice as better numbers yet cost under £15m compared to Zidane's +£50m.

This is where people who understand the tactical side of the game understand that Torres is not SOLELY to blame for our very recent lack of success. He has definitely become a scapegoat. Whether that's justified is debatable. He's been beaten down in the media since day 1. But as fans, the least we can do is not join in the hate? I'm not asking you to shower him with your panties, but the least you can do is not kick a man while he's already down? That's the very least thing one would expect from a football fan. It is possible to want the best for the club AND not dump hate on a player at the same time.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but technique/dribbling/smarts wise I always thought Bale was severely overrated. His strength to me was his athleticism - toe poke past a defender and use his pace to beat them. He always looked really awkward without space. I think what really swung it for Bale was his confidence at trying those outlandish things and the fact he was a good athlete. Of course it's not that easy and he wouldn't have ended up leaving for 80+ million if that was the case - but I always felt that. He drifted out of games for 89 minutes then would smash it in from 25 yards and the rest is history. I hope you kinda get where I'm coming from. 

Lamela I think is much smarter. I actually think he would excel more centrally than out on the wing trying to beat players 1 on 1 - a ton of Roma fans felt he was Totti's heir and the only reason he played RW was Totti. But saying that, I genuinely think he has that ability to boss games with his athleticism just like Bale once did. He's not a 5'5 tricky winger, he's a pretty tall dude in the Ronaldo/Bale mold and looks like he's bulked up (ignoring that shitty ''tensing'' instagram pic). Lets not forget he said recently ''this is the first match I played without pain in xxx time'' (words to that effect), yet there's times last season he drove into space shoving 'strong' DM's off him like it's nothing (the one moment I remember is v Villa and him casually swatting away Sylla, who is a strong DM). [Here's the moment I mean](http://youtu.be/r4iZDtWVX4E?t=35s), he was actually pretty awesome that whole game. I watched quite a lot of him at Roma, and could sit here all day like ''at 0.54, you can see how he plows through 3 players with sheer athleticism''. [Like here ;), you see a lot of it in the first minute - the run at 0.40..](http://youtu.be/dxLT9LwgLrg?t=12s)

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"Will no doubt be a war of words between the two managers bad mouthing each other and throwing digs around to the press but I don't feel threatened by Arsenal at all. In fact, I don't feel threatened by anyone. City will obviously be our main competition but I feel we could win the league fairly comfortably this season. 

We got all the right results against the competition last season but failed to break the down the teams we should be beating who often ""parked the buss"" against us. Funny how the thing we are often criticised for is what played the biggest part in us not winning the league. I mean, besides Liverpool away, where we pretty much fielded our B team, when did we even ""Park the buss"" in the Prem? 

The two biggest problems we had was the fact that our strikers rarely score and often roam out of position, I think Torres spent more time on the wing than he did up front last season, almost as though he was scored of being in front of goal. That problem is more than sorted in the form of Costa. The second problem was always having to relying on Hazard and sometimes Oscar to create our chances and we very rarely created chances from deep, now we have Fabregas. Left Back wasn't really a problem last season but with Cole leaving it definitely became an issue for a very short amount of time until we signed Luis. Luis will be 29 before the start of the season and is definitely not a long term solution but he's one of the best around right now! If we can win back to back league titles and a couple of cups with him at left back I won't criticise paying up to £20m on a 29 year old left back.

So while we've signed three top draw players in positions that needed improving, Arsenal haven't. Arsenal have signed one top draw player and in a position that imo, didn't need improving. Sanchez is definitely an improvement than any wide player they have but they still have plenty of good options in Cazorla, Walcott, Oxlade and Podolski. They've yet to bring in an alternative to Flamini, who imo isn't good enough for the top 4. They need another striker, in fact, they need a starting striker. I'm not really sure if Debuchy is an upgrade on Sagna and they could probably do with another center back and left back before they go looking for wide players.

All in all, we were the better team last season and have made massive improvements in all the right places. Arsenal have made an improvement in an unnecessary area and besides that haven't really improved.
