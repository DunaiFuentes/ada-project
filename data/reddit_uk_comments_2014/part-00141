&gt;__NO2ID__ is a public campaign, formed in 2004 to campaign against the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) government's plans to introduce [UK ID Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_national_identity_card) and the associated [National Identity Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Identity_Register), which it believes has negative implications for privacy, civil liberties and personal safety.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Three posts and you haven't adequately defined either left or right wing favouring the anti-intellectual slur of ""insane"", some vague hand waving and anti-intellectual spurious snobbery. You've also tried to reduce my argument to ""it was began by oligarchs"" and side stepped ""99%"" of content. However, that alone is interesting. If it was conceived as a pet project of the ownership class to steer prole consciousness at what point in time did that cease to be the case?

The guardian has also withheld 99% of snowden documents. It's a limited hangout operation coordinated by the state. Every story was given approval. The Guardian were so compliant they've withheld the names of the hired goons that convinced them to destroy data, and so ineffectual that not a single person has even so much stepped down let alone been criminally prosecuted. Most importantly the big surveillance companies like Google and Facebook have been protected.

&gt; Your source is hilarious by the way, it reads like a conspiracy nut has read a thesaurus.

And you read like a self important politically illiterate cliched ridden arsehole. At least you didn't call me a specky-four eyed nerd—I do wear glasses btw. What isn't insane but intellectually slimy is the idea that I'm insisting on Karl Marx, Stalin or Che. I'll ask again, What meaningful way is the Guardian ""left wing""?

&gt; Again not all left-wing people want IP and copyright abolished because they're necessary for people to invest in risky projects. 

By definition it is mutually exclusive and this is another prejudice masquerading as fact, another baseless assertion. Nearly all risky projects are ultimately shouldered by public funds, generated through the public education system, and only is required because the Capitalist class needs something (spuriously) tangible to claim ownership of. The idea that ideas can be ""owned"" is the worst form of social and intellectual violence that there is without resorting to violence, but IP makes the latter inevitable. The idea of intellectual property is not only rightwing but overt fascism—literally certain thoughts and conversations become illegal. This is part of the problem, you wouldn't know ""left wing"" if it was delivered in a left hook. Publicists like the Guardian and Blair have long helped shove left to the right. The values traditionally held by ""the right"" are fed and internalised by the conscious and unconscious ""left"".

&gt; They are also not run by shareholders but by a trust that changed its structure for legal purposes. 

[Antony Salz](http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/the-scott-trust-board/) a former Rothschild director, Andrew Miller previously Pepsico, Johnathon Scott previously a director of KPMG Corporate Finance and SBC Warburg, chair Neil Berkett who sits Board of Directors for the Bank of Queensland and was a former Virgin director, is a non-executive director of The Sage Group plc, and I really could name a slew of other capitalists and venture capitalists, literally make up the capitalist order at the Guardian and therefore by definition rightwing order within the Guardian. At the very bottom you've even got unpaid interns and unpaid unaffiliated ""users"" who generate content which the Guardian claims ownership of.

It's a corporation not a trust and for reasons of Capitalism and limited liability so let's put aside the marketing propaganda and bullshit semantics. If you have an ownership class especially of intellectual property you necessary have Capitalism which is 100% the antithesis of what left wing means in any of the varying definitions. What you mean is you have right wing branded left, and not at all convincingly, but the political literacy of the UK is such that it's happily swallowed.

&gt; Advertising also pays for the website. Again you think we live in a world were people willingly work for nothing.

Please do squat forcibly on each and every straw man that you have built. The world where people work for nothing, the one with workfare, unpaid interns, and users generating content for the Capitalist class is the Guardian's.

It's a dormant volcano in the middle of the city with some really fantastic views. [The Water of Leith](http://www.waterofleith.org.uk/) is an easy, but long (12 3/4 mile) walk which takes you through some beautiful areas of the city. If you want to go to a Scottish seaside town, I'd recommend heading out to the [East Neuk of Fife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Neuk), St Andrews is there, and is nice to visit, but my personal favourite there is Elie, which has lovely beaches.

With regards to museums you can't go far wrong with the [National Museum of Scotland](http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum_of_scotland.aspx) or the [National Galleries](http://www.nationalgalleries.org/) - which is comprised of the National Gallery, the Modern Art Gallery and, my personal favourite, the National Portrait Gallery. The [Georgian House](http://www.nts.org.uk/property/georgian-house/#) in Charlotte Square is a lovely place to visit - it's a very well-preserved house from the Georgian period, and a fine example of middle-upper class living at the time. People always recommend the castle, but it's very expensive, and if you want to see a castle from that period, I recommend [Strling Castle](http://www.stirlingcastle.gov.uk/) which is a slightly smaller but much better preserved castle which was once the Royal seat of Scotland. Stirling is an hours train ride away. I would also suggets you head on through to Glasgow if you fancy it, the [Kelvingrove Museum](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/kelvingrove/Pages/default.aspx) is free and, in my opinion, one of the best museums in Scotland. Back in Edinburgh, I'd suggest a trip to [the Palace of Holyrood House](http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/palace-of-holyroodhouse), the Queen's residence in Scotland and a trip to the [Scottish parliament](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/135.aspx) which is just opposite. You can go in and see the debating chamber for free any time, or book a free guided tour of the parliament. Despite how much people moan about how ugly it is outside, the interior is rather beautiful. You can do tours of the art, literature, history and politics of the building.

With regards to food a beer, [Brew Dog](http://www.brewdog.com/) is somewhat in vogue, and does locally brewed craft beers of varying strengths. I particularly like the [Holyrood 9A](http://www.theholyrood.co.uk/) which does a fabulous draft and bottled selection and also has a really great gourmet burger menu. For something a touch more upmarket, I really love [The Dogs](http://thedogsonline.co.uk/) which does eclectic, meaty, British/Scottish food, it's quite hipstery, but the food is absolutely top-notch. I'd advise you to avoid the Royal Mile for food and drink, locals do, mainly because it's over-priced and often sub-par. For cocktails, try George IV Bridge for Bar Kohl and the Villager, there's also a great (but pricey) restaurant there called The Outsider (which considers itself way too cool to have a website). Also try heading down to Leith, it's become somewhat cosmopolitan and had come great cocktail bars and a couple of Michelin starred restaurants.

With regards to where to stay, I'd recommend you stay central: Old Town, Tollcross area. It depends where your business will be taking you of course, but those areas are easy to reach everything from.

&gt;""Neuk"" is the [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language) word for nook or corner, and the East Neuk is generally accepted to comprise the fishing villages of the most northerly part of the [Firth of Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth) and the land and villages slightly inland therefrom. In effect, this means that part to the south of a line drawn parallel to the coast from just north of Earlsferry to just north of Crail. As such it would include [Elie and Earlsferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_and_Earlsferry), [Colinsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colinsburgh), [St Monans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Monans), [Pittenweem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittenweem), [Arncroach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arncroach), [Carnbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnbee_Parish,_Scotland), [Anstruther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anstruther), [Cellardyke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellardyke), [Kilrenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilrenny), [Crail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crail) and [Kingsbarns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns).

For that reason they're probably willing to give the Tories an easier ride if it, at the very least, prevents the radical right from setting the agenda.

Also, as the parent commenter says, this stuff is at least true. It's not as if we're talking about a Max Clifford style barrage of false information smear campaign.

You need a budget! Literally: http://youneedabudget.com

Before even considering buying a house or investing you **need** to have a grasp on your income and expenditure, if you're living pay cheque to pay cheque you're in the danger zone, you **need** to have at least 3 months expenses in an emergency fund, preferably 6 depending on your job. Surprise expenses come up every now and again but there's no justifiable explanation for having surprise expenditure every single month, that's an indication that you're not taking full control of your spending.

1. Learn about your spending, you should know where your money is going (I recommend YNAB)

He's fast and would work well with our counter-attacking style. He is better than average on the ball, wins a lot of dribbles, and would probably fit well in the Premier League. He does pick up a lot of fouls (he was sent off in the Champions League), but that is something I think he can grow out of.

&gt; The reason that it was boring was because the audience did not respond well to her after relatively early on in her performance, she showed the level of her psychic abilities.

First this appears to be a comma splice, which is wrong. Second, before the comma the clause inherently makes sense; after the comma it suddenly becomes ambiguous: does it mean that she showed her abilities early in the performance? Does it mean that she lost the audience's attention early in the performance, and then she showed her level of psychic abilities? It should be rewritten as two sentences for clarity, or at least a semi-colon should be used to separate non-connected clauses.

6) Orders will be done in order of price (of course) and if multiple orders are on one price tier, and it does not get completed it shall be done proportionately (i.e 10% of each order). Hope this answers the question.

7) Already planned.

8) Working for us

I totally agree with your point, although I disagree with the reason they fail in the UK. Previously it has been banking, I have been speaking with someone who was *somewhat* involved with all the previous UK exchanges - and what I heard was fairly shocking as to how amateur they were with the whole situation.

We won't be starting off with no transaction fees, however we will be giving a small handful of people who use trading bots and provide liquidity to trade with no fees. This should tighten the spreads (and of course improve liquidity). Its not definite yet but we may be working on a maker-taker system.

Most of the larger Jewish schools (King David Manchester/Liverpool, JFS, etc.) are fairly secular in that all lessons are taught as per curriculum, the majority of students are non-practising, graduates tend to go on to university, and so on.

But more strict Orthodox Jews will send their children to another type of Jewish school. Now these schools are strictly same-sex, have a large emphasis on Jewish learning (5-10 hours or more per week), and will encourage the students to stay within their sect and not mix. Most of the students won't go to university but will either study at a yeshiva (purely biblical learning for post-school kids) or just get married once they hit 18. Not only that but a lot of the kids don't even speak English - they are brought up and taught in Yiddish.

I read about libertarianism and the free market a few years ago - a lot of the argument for private healthcare is that it encourages competition which helps to progress science. That is to say, if hospital trust X can better treat (or even cure) something they will get all the customers and money and so have an incentive to do so.

In reality, of course, hospitals realise it's more profitable to treat and not to cure so we never progress.

Alas, as we know the world isn't a simple as that.  For example if the NHS needs a supply of medical quality latex gloves then they could set up a facility to make those gloves or they could go and buy them from a private company.  The potential advantage of the second option is that the company might be making all kinds of latex things (not sure why I chose latex but beginning to regret it) for all kinds of industries and thus be able to offer an economy of scale the in-house NHS option simply can't compete with.  Even though the private company is also out to make a profit from the sale of the latex gloves to the NHS.  Thus the gloves are cheaper to buy than they are to make.  The NHS is also free from the setup costs of buying the facilities and hiring specialist staff and can also opt for other suppliers if cheaper or better gloves become available.

Thus further imbedding structured inequality and ensuring future generations of ordinary people are born with less and less freedom.

&gt;cutting red tape

Including how much which will reduce ordinary people's freedoms - such as freedom from danger and ill-health from working in unsafe workplaces?

&gt;reducing the size of the state sector

The right always promises this, but it usually manages to expand it anyway.  What it usually translates to is reducing the activities of the State with regards to providing basic living standards and protections for ordinary people, whilst increasing them enormously when it comes to protecting the interests of corporations and the wealthy (larger police force, bigger military etc.) - and it's no surprise that the UKIP seems to fall in to this category.

&gt;free trade instead of protectionism

Most so-called free trade treaties are nothing of the sort, they're often highly protectionist and slanted to favour wealthy nations against less developed ones.

It was inevitable this would happen two years ago or more, questions really do need to be asked why it was allowed to happen.

Personally, I blame two things:

1.  The government.  They want positive house prices across the UK to show their five years in power ""fixed the economy"" (home owners are the core Tory vote after all).

2.  The various policy making economists.  They're detached from reality, they see it as their goal to make certain narrowly defined metrics hit certain arbitrary targets; quite often this is at the expense of the wider economy.  One manifestation of this over the past ten years or more is their bias towards lower rates.

I don't disagree with the main point you're trying to make in your comments, but I felt I had to reply to that statement - the officers only shoot when innocent life is in danger otherwise. Most of the time, the officers would very quickly move in, armed and ready, and stun the person carrying a gun then arrest them. They are only allowed to shoot if the person is wielding the gun and is putting the public in danger, and even then they are discouraged from killing.

Our language is fairly popular but not without it's difficulties, can everyone learn it? Hell can we do it when we go abroad. Most try but it's not without hardships.

If you're that bothered about the grammar and syntax quality of people coming over then please do something about it, but I'm not really fussed about our cultural uniformity, I'm more interested in how badly it affects the people who need to learn it.

This would be ridiculously hard to enforce as the officers wouldn't individually drive off immediately after a shooting. They will attempt to administer life support, establish a cordon, ensure there aren't any other immediate threats, etc... All plenty of opportunity for officers to informally discuss what happened.

The answer here is the current plan to introduce cameras on every armed officer. This will give a far more accurate picture than any officer statement (be it with or without conferring).

Inequality does not equate to freedom. If you made money in your lifetime you should be free to dispose of that money upon your death as you wish, whether to give it to your children, set up scholarships for orphans, donate it to a cat sanctuary or burn it on a bonfire.

&gt; Does this include the massive corporate subsidies which dwarf all other forms?

Inevitably, yes. First they came for the wind turbines...

&gt; Including how much which will reduce ordinary people's freedoms - such as freedom from danger and ill-health from working in unsafe workplaces?

There is always a balance to be struck between freedom and security. Those who would sacrifice freedom to ensure security deserve neither.

&gt; The right always promises this [reducing the size of the state sector], but it usually manages to expand it anyway. What it usually translates to is reducing the activities of the State with regards to providing basic living standards and protections for ordinary people, whilst increasing them enormously when it comes to protecting the interests of corporations and the wealthy (larger police force, bigger military etc.) - and it's no surprise that the UKIP seems to fall in to this category.

The primary duty of the state is to provide security for it's citizenry. This requires appropriate internal (police, courts, justice system) and external (military, diplomatic, intelligence) security. A lot of other state spending will be heavily cut, no doubt. 

&gt; Most so-called free trade treaties are nothing of the sort, they're often highly protectionist and slanted to favour wealthy nations against less developed ones. The expansion and enforcement of intellectual property is always snuck into them somewhere, for example, and that is merely the 21st century version of tariffs.

The EU is a case in point, a limited free trade zone that prevents us trading with other partners. Think of how much better the world would be if we were able to trade freely with everyone.

&gt; Hmm. Many of their spokespeople haven't been particularly good at this [promoting free speech]...

I assume you are referring to the police visiting Michael Abberton because of his tweet about UKIP. I agree that if it was indeed UKIP councillors that asked police to investigate this was against their principles, however the one UKIP representative I've seen quoted said:

&gt; Peter Burkinshaw, secretary of Ukip’s Cambridge branch, said: ‘I don’t understand why the police would go round.’

All of the above have libertarian principles (anti-state involvement and interference in peoples everyday lives) at heart.

3. IIRC, ~~an Earthly Child is between the main range stories and the EDA stories~~ I was wrong. It's in Series 4 of the EDA after 4.1, at some point [after](#s ""Lucie leaves"") The Four Doctors was a bottle story, and can be listened to at any time. I haven't listened to all of the Short Trips line, but judging by what I have listened to those are bottle stories too.

He could get injured, cause a road traffic accident, eat something that will make him ill, or destroy someone else's property. He might even get attacked (especially around Townhill).

Since you've already confronted the owner, doing so a second time is optional (but advisiable). The RSPCA are arsing slow, but [please call them](http://www.rspca-llysnini.org.uk/) about this dog, preferably the moment you next see him loose. They'll come over, offer an official warning to the owner, then do nothing. *Every time* you see the dog loose, tell the owner. If he refuses to recall his dog, or does so and then lets him out again a few minutes later, ring the RSPCA again. Either the owner will get the message, and keep the dog in his own sodding garden, or the RSPCA will seize him and have him rehomed - and if the RSPCA actually decide to sieze a dog, then you know that dog needs a new home.

Please, from the tone of your comment you sound sick of this, but think of the dog. If he's being left to roam the streets unsupervised, then his owner probably doesn't care much for him. He deserves a better home. At least make that first phone call, even if you don't plan to follow-up. It might be all the help he needs.

EDIT: Also, please call RSPCA *only* for the dog you know is being neglected. If you see a random dog wandering the streets without a collar and with no human claiming responsibility nearby, call Dog's Trust, *not* the RSPCA. The distinction is important.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"For me, he is and he isn't.

Firstly, the positives: He knows the championship well, and did a sterling job with both Watford and Cardiff. He's good at getting players to play for him (anyone who can keep Craig Bellamy on the straight and narrow must be a miracle worker...), and his playing career with us means that he'll have plenty of credit in the bank if his start isn't the best. The way he's set teams up in the past will probably lend itself well to the squad we currently have too.

However...the way he's played football in the past has been pretty defensive, some might say Hughton-esque. I fear that if the season starts and we're struggling to score, and end up losing games we should win due to defensive slips and an inability to score, the memories of this season will mean that people will give him far less time before turning on him. I'm not sure I rate his transfer dealings when he's had money to spend, and I don't think (should we get promoted), he's the type of manager who can transform us into a comfortable mid-table Prem side. But I guess right now the priority is promotion, and once we've managed that we can perhaps look again at the way we're playing.


Of all the managers who may have been available, I think Lennon would have done a good job, as he's got something of Lambert about it. He'd have dragged us up by whatever means, and probably played attacking football along the way. He doesn't have championship experience though. Steve Clarke is also someone I would have been interested in. Unfairly sacked at WBA by a chairman who seems to be losing the plot, he played decent football on a modest budget, made good use of young prospects, and I could see him being capable of establishing us as a mid-table Prem side.",0,1400448747,null,0,false,0,chl9k3w,t3_25vlgn,t1_chl9k3w,t1_chl8zz2,null,1433853438,5,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,5

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"The voting on Reddit generally is not compliant with Reddit etiquette, in that in one example, people downvote things they disagree with rather than downvoting things that don't contribute to the discussion.  In other words a lot of people come with a fixed idea about something and are not looking for contrary arguments no matter how interesting or inciteful they may be, all they want is for their existing ideas and beliefs to be confirmed.

Many people are only interested in winning an argument, and showing you how clever they are.  These are the ones who often veer off the point and start picking on small, inconsequential details.

Many people here will vote on just the title of an entry without reading the article linked, or just read the first couple of lines in a long comment and vote on that.

Some people will have multiple accounts, and use them to make it look like a lot of people are voting their way.

This is all unavoidable really, most of us are guilty of at least one of these (maybe not the last one) at one time or another, so try to not let it get you down too much, I believe there are still enough reasonable people here to have a proper debate at least some of the time, although at certain times it can feel a bit exasperating.

Then there are the trolls.  People who will try to get you upset and keep you off balance just to get a reaction, when done well this is an art in itself, but good old fashioned trolls are a very rare thing these days.

Hey, went to a recording a couple of weeks ago. 

&gt;Is the queuing set up in a way where he can just rejoin me and my family in the queue, or would he have to go to the back by himself? 

Yes. There are no barriers in the queue so he can join at any point. And people do join others and there is no tutting (nothing audible anyway). Just make sure you join the right queue because they film a few other shows at the same studios (Graham Norton, Alan Carr etc) and it would probably be difficult to join the right queue and guarantee entry. 

&gt;Bonus question: How early should me and family arrive to guarentee us entry? Is an hour before doors opening overkill?

We got there for ours about an hour before entry and we were about halfway in the queue. It does fill up pretty quickly and it is quite long. So another 15-20 mins later and we would have been pushing it. So aim for an hour or more to guarantee entry and good seats (they fill the middle seats first I think.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Here are some that have just popped into my head, in no particular order:

* Isambard Kingdom Brunel - engineer, he's the guy who built the SS Great Britain, the largest ship of her time and the first to use a screw propeller. He also built the Great Western Railway, perhaps the greatest pre-war railway network of the UK, and maybe the world.
*  George Stephenson - the ""father of railways"", he was the designer of the first railway in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool to Manchester railway. His railway gauge of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches is also the standard gauge of the world. 
* Robert Stephenson (not to be confused with Robert Louis Stevenson) - the son of George Stephenson, he was another railway pioneer, designing and building *The Rocket*, one of the best early locomotives that provided the blueprint for all following steam locomotives. 
* Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, first duke of Wellington - He fought in India and the Netherlands, and was a renowned Irish politician, before the events that most people know him for - his command of the land armies of Britain against Napoleon in the late 1790s, making him renowned as one of the best defensive commanders in history - his extensive pre-battle planning allowed him to fight the enemy on fields that he chose most of the time, meaning in many of his battles he defeated numerically superior forces with far fewer losses on his side than the enemy took. Later he became prime minister of Britain and was banned from Almack's club (which at the time was THE high society venue in London) for daring to wear a pair of trousers into the club - at the time knee britches were the norm. He is also known for inventing the Wellington boot but not the beef Wellington, although the etymology of this dish remains unknown.
* Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson - extraordinary naval officer renowned the world over for his defeat of the combined French and Spanish navies in the Cape of Trafalgar in 1805. His abandonment of the traditional tactics of the ""Line Astern"" formation, where ships of opposing sides would form up into lines and sail past the opposing fleet, giving them maximum broadside exposure, made his job harder in the beginning as the enemy could pound away at his ships whilst he was still sailing towards them, but by the time he reached the enemy line, he split it into three, and thus scuppered their battle plan completely. Another major part of his victory was that he trained his gunners, whereas the French and Spanish didn't have the ammunition to do so, meaning our gunners could fire a shot once every 90 to 100 seconds, whereas the enemy could only manage one shot every three to five minutes.
* Charles Darwin - known the world round for his book ""On the origin of Species, by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life"" which postulated the theory that all creatures and plants had evolved over time. Darwin made a lot of his discoveries on the HMS Beagle, a Royal Naval scientific expedition.
* Sir Isaac Newton - reputedly hit on the head by an apple, he invented Gravity, a wonderful British invention that prevents people and objects from floating away. How we survived before this invention I'll never know. ;-)
* King Henry VIII - an oafish brute of a man, known for his passion for hunting, food and women, in that order. He had six wives, who were ""disposed"" of in this order: divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived. Henry was also known for increasing the size of the Navy (not royal at this point) and for a disastrous conflict with France, during which his flagship, the Mary Rose, was sunk. The Mary Rose was recovered in the 1980s and now sits in a museum in Portsmouth, where it has taught historians much about the Tudor navy. 
* Elizabeth I - daughter of Henry VIII, she was Queen during the Spanish Armada ""incident"" where Spain, alarmed at the protestantism of England, marched a force of men to Flanders, there to be transported on a massive fleet across the channel, to invade England and install a Catholic monarch. England at the time had a very much smaller number of available men to fight an invasion, and had almost no navy. A navy was hastily formed, and when the Armada arrived they were engaged by the English. The English ships were faster and more manoeuvrable, but were not as well armed. The English managed to sink or capture a few ships, but after a few days of fighting the Armada anchored off of Calais awaiting word from the army they were to collect. Whilst waiting, the English, desperate at this point, pointed a few of their ships at the Spanish, locked their wheels, evacuated the crews, and set fire to them. The fire ships sailed into the Spanish anchorage, forcing the Spaniards to flee or risk being set afire themselves. This scattered the Spanish fleet. The English managed to pick of a few more ships in the coming days, however the Spanish basically decided to give up and go home. Being harried by the English, they decided to sail north around Scotland, thence through the Irish sea, and home down the coast of France. However, they got caught in terribly bad weather, and many more of the ships were sunk or otherwise destroyed by the bad weather.
* Sir Francis Drake - often credited with commanding the counter-Armada force, he was actually second in command and on one occasion, whilst leading the English fleet using the navigation lamps of his ship at night on an attack against the Spanish, he extinguished his light, leading to the breakup of the English fleet, in order to loot some Spanish ships that had run aground on a sand bar. He was also a slave dealer and went on a war of revenge against the Spanish, who had attacked, tortured and killed his nephew for dealing slaves in a Spanish colony in the Jamaica region without Spanish permission. Drake made a fortune out of all these raids and looting, so it's doubtful whether revenge was his first priority.
* Samuel Peyps - most famous for saving his cheese during the great fire of London in 1666, Peyps was a naval administrator who was responsible for ending much of the corruption and waste present in the Royal Navy, eventually (well after his death) turning it into the most effective, modern (for the time) and overwhelming force on the high seas. Peyps is also famous for his *really, really* descriptive diaries. Besides writing about life in London at the time (this was an interesting time, what with the plagues and the fires and all) he also wrote enormously detailed and intimate details of his personal life, including his dalliances with wives and daughters of his colleagues, other women, and his love of food, and alcohol, and music, and plays, and high society etc. One of his diary entries describes an orgy he was involved in: ""So home, vexed, and going to my Lady Batten’s, there found a great many women with her, in her chamber merry, my Lady Pen and her daughter, among others; where my Lady Pen flung me down upon the bed, and herself and others, one after another, upon me, and very merry we were""
* Winston Churchill - Half-American and Prime Minister of Britain during the major part of WWII, he has been described by sources as either the saviour of the country or a drunk in the right place at the right time. Before WWII he fought in The Sudan, India and in the Second Boer War as an Army officer, and he made a name as a war reporter. By WWI Churchill had entered the government, and had been President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary. He rose to be the First Lord of the Admiralty before the start of WWI, a position which he held until the disastrous Gallipoli campaign, which was mainly his idea. He left the government and returned to active military service, commanding a front-line infantry battalion. He then retuned to government, becoming the minister for munitions, then secretary of state for war, then secretary of state for air. He was then promoted after the war to Chancellor of the Exchequer, the second-highest job in the government (not counting the Civil Service). In this capacity he made a controversial decision to re-link the pound to the gold standard. He also advocated for Indian home rule, another inflammatory topic, and he oppose the abdication of Edward VIII, who did abdicate to marry the American Wallis Simpson. During the 1930s, after his party was out of office, Churchill made many speeches during this time, mostly on the dangers of Nazi Germany and about rearmament to counter the Nazis. After the outbreak of War, whilst Neville Chamberlain was still Prime Minister, Churchill found his way back to being First Lord of the Admiralty. When Chamberlain resigned Churchill was made Prime Minister, and worked hard to make sure the British people retained the will to fight, even after early defeats such as Dunkirk and the blitz on British cities. After the war, Churchill spent a lot of time in America lecturing on the dangers of Communism, and was the first person to use the phrase ""Iron Curtain"". Churchill remained in politics and when his party returned to power in 1951 he again became Prime Minister. It was during this period that he made one of his oft-quoted remarks. One morning, Churchill was awoken by his Personal Private Secretary, who had brought the Prime Minister a newspaper whose headline story was on a minister who had been caught having sexual relations with a member of one of the Foot Guards regiments in St James' Park. The PPS relayed the story to Churchill, who said ""Last Night? It was very cold last night."" And the PPS responded: ""Yes, Prime Minister, I believe it was one of the coldest nights on record"". Churchill considered this fact for a minute before responding ""Makes you proud to be British"".

He was our mad dog for a while though. He was put in power with the covert help of the UK and US.  And if we really didn't like him after he invaded Kuwait, we could have allowed the Iraqis to get rid of him in 1991. But then they would have installed a government of their own choosing, which clearly wasn't acceptable.

&gt;The deaths were mostly caused in a civil war.

Which funnily enough wasn't happening to any great extent till the invasion.

&gt;The deaths caused by the west would have been unnecessary if not for the attempts to put iraq under radical islamist control.

I'm not sure what you're referring to here. Saddam Hussein ran a secular government. The radical Muslims didn't turn up till after the invasion.

They don't have the big leaky database behind them which everyone and his dog would have a right to access, And in the main it's not compulsory for their citizens to carry.

Nah! This election may not be as important as the elections for our MLA's and MP's, but our local councillors and European representatives are still responsible for a lot of things which affect our daily lives. 

This is what our local councillors have responsibility over: 

* waste collection and disposal
* recycling and waste management
* civic amenity provision
* grounds maintenance
* street cleaning
* cemeteries
* public conveniences
* food safety
* health and safety
* environmental protection
* environmental improvement
* estates management - building design and maintenance
* building control-inspection and regulation of new buildings
* dog control
* enforcement byelaws such as those around litter
* sports and leisure services
* sports and recreational facilities
* parks, open spaces and playgrounds
* community centres
* arts, heritage and cultural facilities
* registration of births, deaths and marriages

Councils also have a role in the following areas:
* economic development

* community development

* community safety

* sports development

* summer schemes

* tourism

None of those are issues which will stir up big debate (unless it's anything related to flags), but they still affect us every single day so I would argue that it's important to vote in people with good common sense and a genuine care for *all* of the people of their cities and towns. 

Our European representatives are able to vote on issues affecting the entirety of Europe and beyond, and are able to represent our region where the issue affects us. 
In a nutshell, so long as we follow the rules set by Europe, we can also benefit from funding. And indeed Northern Ireland has received a lot of money for various projects over the years, many say that Northern Ireland has got a pretty good deal out of it.

If everyone who sits around moaning about only having wankers, terrorists and bigots to vote for went out and voted for the few candidates that aren't, there'd be a good chance of said candidates getting in and their parties growing enough to start displacing the old guard. Or at the very least shock the bigger parties into taking a more moderate line.

I mean, lets say less than 50% of the population vote. What if the other 50% would have voted for NI21 or Alliance or SDLP, but didn't because they thought their vote wouldn't make a dent against SF or DUP?

Change can happen - Alliance unseated the DUP in the DUP stronghold of east Belfast in the Westminster elections. The potential is there. The only way for it to be unrealised for sure is for that 50% to continue to not bother voting.

Also: This being northern ireland - if you don't vote you can find that someone voted on your behalf - and you may not like who that vote went to. I'm sure they've cut down on it via the electoral reforms in recent years, but certain parties do still take a keen interest in who from their community hasn't shown up at the polling station.

And from a nationalist point of view, how much struggle and pain did the likes of John Hume go through trying to make sure a catholic tenant's vote was counted the same number of times as a protestant landlords? To not vote disrespects them and what they went through on our behalf.

That wasn't the point, the point was that these quota systems will only ever target positions of power and high income, not positions of low income, danger and no power. There will never be quotas for female dustmen, or front line soldiers, or factory workers, or minimum wage workers. That's not equality. 

Ethnic minorities do worse on the whole because they have lower levels of education and come from poorer backgrounds.

true,ctp95,lfc55,,"You make a lot of good points here and I understand the temptation to be pessimistic based on the last couple of transfer windows. January was a disaster and last summer wasn't great overall. 

We've got a few things going for us though. First is that we've been linked strongly and early with some very good players who we definitely couldn't have secured last summer. I know it's early days and we've not signed anyone officially, but being in for the likes of Lallana, Alberto Moreno and Shaqiri is really encouraging. I think those types of players will want to come to Liverpool because they know they'll get more playing time, direction and attention than they might at other clubs. 

My one nagging feeling though, and I've said this before, is that I think this needs to be the window in which we get Gerrard's long term replacement. The BT money kicks in over the summer, back in the CL, nearly won the league, Suarez to attract players, etc. There might not be a better time to get a major, team-defining signing in. I don't think it will happen this window though, and that's concerning. In particular, if Toni Kroos leaves Bayern and goes to an English club that isn't Liverpool I'm going to lose my fucking mind, especially if it's United. There is *nobody* currently playing who could be a better replacement for Gerrard's traditional role as a creative, attacking midfielder. Overall, I'm very encouraged but I agree with you, this is the most important window for at least 3 years.

When I look at the players we're being linked to, I must admit that I'm pretty sceptical to some of them. However there's also a couple of players that we're after that I think are exciting and that's encouraging. In my opinion we should be looking at at least one world-class player that can walk straight into the team and improve our first 11. But there's still all summer left, so I'm not that worried.

&gt;Derren Brown (born 27 February 1971)[3] is a British illusionist, mentalist, trickster, hypnotist, painter, writer, and sceptic.

&gt;Though his performances of mind-reading and other feats of mentalism may appear to be the result of psychic or paranormal practices, he claims no such abilities and frequently denounces those who do. Brown states at the beginning of his Trick of the Mind programmes that he achieves his results using a combination of ""magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship"".

The original comment was that Francis Wheen is the only person to have made such a claim - the insinuation being that if Farage genuinely did say such things (some time before 1999) then others should also have reported as such. So why haven't they? 

Firstly, Farage wouldn't have been known by many people in the media back in 1999. If he wasn't well known at the time, why would he make the news? 

Secondly, those that did know him (outside the media or however), may still confirm Francis Wheen's claim - or other similar claims for that matter. 

So in the end, it boils down to this: if Farage is racist, why hasn't he been exposed? Well maybe he already has and some people still aren't convinced. Maybe he still will be and even then, maybe some people still won't be convinced.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Agreed, this is the most important transfer window since Kenny's - which we don't need to go over again.

We've been optimising the wage bill ever since FSG came in - hence why they didn't give **Meireles** the new contract H&amp;G supposedly 'promised' him, hence why Kenny played an out-of-his-depth Henderson ahead of **Maxi** and **Kuyt**, hence why those two and **Bellamy** were all but out the door before Rodgers had even started, hence hence there being no chance **Carroll** could be a 'plan B', hence **Downing** leaving when Rodgers would have happily kept him for this season as depth. 

In the current squad, **Lucas**, **Agger** and **Johnson** are the 3 players whose wage exceeds their contribution. Liverpool Echo said **Johnson** will stay but not get a new contract, which seems a good compromise - we have other areas of the squad that are bigger priorities than strengthening RB, and hopefully Rodgers can coax last season's performances out of Johnson again - especially if a new LB is signed, so that Flanagan becomes a depth option at RB to allow us to rotate Johnson and not play him when injured.

We've been linked with new CB's - Lovren and Caulker. We already have 4 senior CB's; we can't have 5 (I count **Coates** as all but gone already). **Sakho** cost 17m; he's not leaving. **Skrtel**'s played himself out of a transfer, but isn't Rodgers' dream first-choice; hence the need for a new CB. **Kolo**'s 4th choice and has 1 year left; he might stay, but if he wants to go we'll let him, and could promote either **Ilori** or **Wisdom**. So if we get a new one, who leaves? **Agger**.

With **Lucas**, who knows? We've been linked with Emre Can, but whether Rodgers sees him as a DM, a LB, or a CM option, or some combination of the above, is unknown to us. But getting Can would make Lucas even less essential than now.",0,1400464818,null,0,false,0,chlfvwu,t3_25wj65,t1_chlfvwu,t3_25wj65,null,1433856695,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

**Can Özil provide some of those goals?**

I think he's going to enjoy it enormously. He's the man who has to make the difference in the final third. His last pass is brilliant, he'll get more space and with space he kills you. He's going to score more goals himself because of that space. There's no one better than him for that mediapunta role. In England opponents follow you, but if a player comes out to you it is easier to play a quick one-two and go beyond him into space. In a tactical-defensive sense, it is much more calculated in Spain; it's harder to score goals than in England.

**Yet the assumption is that the Premier League is harder than La Liga ...**

It's complicated, because the English league is more difficult to win but on an individual level it is much, much easier to shine in England. I always thought English football was the best to watch because there are more goals, more chances, more excitement. But now I understand why there are more goals and more chances: it's much more crazy, out of control, everyone attacking, pouring forward ...

**Why?**

The crowd plays a part. The crowd roar and the full-back bombs forward and then the other full-back goes forward and the crowd noise gets louder and louder. Sometimes in England it feels like you don't have time to think, but that's more a mental question; it's more about your own aggressive intuition, the atmosphere. It motivates you but it means you lose control. In Spain, teams work much more on shape; they're more tactical, more positional. If I see a game in England – I don't miss any of Arsenal's games – I enjoy it. As a spectacle there's nothing better.

There was an article a few days ago on here with a stat showing that out of the 20 league games he started this year, Liverpool won 17, good for best in the league for a player. Knock his lack of physicality all you want, but what he brings to the team as far as composure out of the back, organizing a defense, and aerial command he is still someone we need in our team. 


Sakho is a terrific player and I could see him being a world-class CB in a few years, but we ship a lot of goals with him and Skrtel because between the two of them the organization is lacking. For now I think we start Agger and Skrtel while rotating Sakho and Lovren/Caulker and getting rid of Kolo. As we saw with this year we were lucky to have signed two CBs as injuries hit our backline hard over the course of the season. 

People keep on talking about letting people go but with the addition of CL football, we need quality depth and Lucas certainly fits the bill. He loves Liverpool and even though he played poorly down the stretch, he was terrific up until his injury. Even after he came back, there was a game (I forget which one, I think Sunderland) where he came in at half time and completely controlled the midfield, essentially winning us the 3 points.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Fuck, forgot all about Martin Kelly. No idea what Rodgers wants to do there - CB? RB? Sell?

I couldn't care less about that 17/20 stat; Nacho Monreal won 19 of the 23 games he played. That stat doesn't take into account opposition strength, and it also counts games where Agger came on from the bench in the last 10 minutes as an appearance. It's immaterial.

I'm skeptical about the terrific organiser and vocal leader of the backline stuff - Carragher came into the team last year in January because Rodgers said it was too quiet and the defenders needed leadership; that damns Agger. Even this season, the only vocal leader and organisers, I'd say, have been Toure and Gerrard - but ideally you want it to be a CB, not Gerrard. 

I agree that Sakho-Skrtel lacks organisation as a pairing; hence why Rodgers is after Caulker or Lovren, guys who were the leader of their back fours. I see Skrtel being relegated to 3rd choice, and hope that with more time in England and at Liverpool, Sakho can show more leadership presence.

The point you're leaving out is - what if replacing Lucas/Agger with players of only slightly lower quality, but significantly lower wages, frees up money to spend elsewhere? Essentially, these guys are depth players. Yes CL means they'll play lots more than this season, but it means that striking a balance between quality and wages is also important. Hypothetically, replacing Lucas with Emre Can might be the difference between us affording Moreno and Lallana, vs Bertrand and Lallana.",0,1400468152,null,0,false,0,chlh8v2,t3_25wj65,t1_chlh8v2,t1_chlgo61,null,1433857337,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

If even a minority of voters abstain (the last Assembly election had a 54.5% turnout), then the process does not work becasue the opinion of the people has not been properly recorded. You don't have to vote for a candidate if you don't want to but at the very least, everyone of voting age should go and put something on their ballot, even if it's just to deny anyone worth voting for. It's okay for us to not like any of the candidates or to feel apathetic but we need to register these feelings or nobody will know. No assumptions are made about abstainers, they are just written off. In theory, it would be nice if a democratic election contained candidates that everyone felt represented them but in the absence of that, it's still important to invoke your right to grumble. I think *not* grumbling is much worse.

It is remarkable that we are even allowed to vote, let alone given more than two options. It's too late now to register if you haven't but consider it for next time, even if you just want to draw a penis on your ballot.

People have seen their neighbourhoods change, shops with foreign writing opening in their high streets, their GP waiting room full of 'foreigners' etc. And many people don't like it. They've also been more or less 'forbidden' from discussing their concerns because they get called racist and told that their concerns are not valid. So this sort of backlash is quite predictable IMO. 

Our demographic of young people, who have gone to university and made friends with many different nationalities have a very different perspective to a 40-80yr old homeowner who sees their local GP progressively filled with brown people wearing funny clothes. 

Racist can 'get away' with being xenophobic (or even flat out racist) for one very simple reason. A LOT of people ARE xenophobic and racist. And a lot of people would not want a Romanian family moving in next door. 

This is natural political backlash. What we should be really asking ourselves is how we can be better educated so that we may all appreciate and tolerate each other, while still encouraging immigrants to follow a compatible way of life.

Remember how when Gerrard went to DM, this sub was bemoaning that Gerrard was the weakest member of our midfield trio and that he should probably be benched? Or when Allen came back from Injury, how useless Allen was? Fast forward a month or two and suddenly the opinion is that Gerrard is close to the best mid in the EPL, and people are seeing Allen's worth as an alternative tactical option to Coutinho.

At the time those opinions weren't wrong per se, because at the time it was true those players weren't having their best games. But the opinions lacked any foresight, they were reactionary.

A player needs time to get better at a new role, and needs to adapt his play. If he can't adapt, then of course we might need to move him on.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not convinced yet that Lucas can adapt to be as good an attacker as a DM, and Rodgers might well sell him in favour of bringing in some better players, but don't write him off without giving him a fair go.

Anyway, I'm thinking two of Sterling, Coutinho and **new signing** will start any given game, with Ibe or Suso as 4th choice, and the other one on loan.

**ST's**: Suarez &amp; Sturridge as first choice, Borini as backup. Don't think we'll have another backup striker; we'll play a single striker system like 4-3-3 pretty often, I'm guessing.

This isn't necessarily my personal preference, but me trying to speculate as to Rodgers' logic.

***Where's Agger?*** I think he's leaving, sadly. I love him, but Rodgers doesn't seem to - Sakho seems to be a direct replacement, a ball-carrying left-footed CB who is younger and more physical than Agger. If we're buying a new CB, then we can't have both Skrtel *and* Agger for depth - CL or no CL, no other team has 4 senior top-quality CB's, the wages are just unjustifiable and you can't keep them happy. Skrtel's probably earnt himself another season, while Agger's pedigree means he'd command a healthy fee from elsewhere.

***Why's Enrique second choice?*** No idea what level he'll be at coming back from injury, and we should be looking at players to improve the first XI, not offer depth. Besides, why buy a depth left-back when Brad Smith looks like he'll be challenging for that spot within the next 2 seasons?

***Only one new attacking signing?*** Would love more than one, but it might not be necessary. Rodgers spoke about promoting from within the other day, which makes me think either Ibe or Suso will be integrated into the first team setup next season. I'm leaning more to Ibe, because after Sterling it's very clear to see how Rodgers will develop him. Rodgers also spoke about wanting a few quality signings rather than several depth ones.

***Why might Lucas leave?*** FSG's usual thing of wages not reflecting contribution, Lucas wanting to force his way back into reckoning for Brazil, and us looking for a player that's stylistically similar to Gerrard, if Rodgers wants that.

So, only 5 first-team signings, and that's assuming Lucas and (probably) Agger leave! ***This*** is what happens when you can promote quality players from your youth setup!",0,1400484038,null,0,false,0,chlm5gp,t3_25x9cw,t1_chlm5gp,t3_25x9cw,null,1433859648,29,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,29

That's right - which is why 'basic video work' won't really cut it. P.T. Barnum (onwards) pulled all those kind of stunts so long ago that it's no different from presenting Laurel and Hardy slapstick as cutting edge comedy, then questioning why some of the audience might not be that impressed.

Well, we're then down to what counts as being entertained - in this case, it stops people taking *the illusionist* seriously, as we've just seen from Eddie_Hitler's (and my) examples - it's not like we're alone. You only get one shot to impress people, and if it's by using a fifty+ year old trick, then the game is up.

And from that point on, I didn't really care how long he pretended to live in a block of ice/ perspex box/ etc. - I've got better ways to be entertained.

When house ownership hits 50%+ (of actual voters, keep in mind that turn out gets higher as you age) you'll see the country become concerned primarily about house prices and fuck the people struggling to even afford a place to live.

The problem is entirely artificial. There'll be no political solution because as you get higher home ownership you get more people ready to vote for broken measures.

true,Andures,null,null,"I think it would be a big mistake if Liverpool does not buy another striker/winger. While having Sturridge, Suarez and Borini is good enough for 4-3-3, it is a little lacking when playing 4-4-2 with 3 players for 2 positions. The 4-4-2 diamond saw increased play in the 2nd half of the season with teams starting to play more defensive against Liverpool, and it might jolly well be the default formation next season. 

Rodgers' talk of getting multi-dimensional players seems to point towards the idea of getting someone who could play both as a striker and as a penetrative winger, a position where Liverpool has been dearly lacking in recent years with Sterling the only representative. While Suarez and even Sturridge have at times performed well as a winger in a 4-3-3 formation, you could argue whether that is the best use of Liverpool's limited resources in a longer season next year. 

It's unlikely to be a top priority, however, because Coutinho, Lallana and even Borini have shown that they are serviceable on the flanks, with Suso and Ibe possible options in desperate times. Still, I think that for Liverpool to really consolidate their new position in the Top 4, an early reinforcement of the strike force is a great idea this year. If Real Madrid continues their pursuit of Suarez over the next few years, an offer too good to refuse might eventually turn up, and Liverpool would be wise to prepare for that eventuality before that. 

Assuming Vorm, Can, Caulker, Moreno, and Lallana, plus a winger/striker the likes of Griezmann/Firmino/Sanchez, it would be a very good window for Liverpool. Either one of the 3 would cost somewhere between 20 to 30 million pounds, so that would make it 50 million including Lallana. Moreno will probably cost £15 million, while Caulker and Vorm will cost 10 million total. Add 10 million for Can and that makes it a total outlay of £85 million. If Lucas and Agger leaves, they should command at least 10 million each, so Liverpool will end up with a net spend of £65 million, which really isnt too far fetched.

At Chapel Ash there's an empty building that's got planning permission to be developed into flats and would fit 43 apartments and ground floor retail units - and I know this because the Express and Star had a story about how this unit was going to be developed into that three years ago - but nothing has been done in that time. And yet just round the corner, a massive Sainsbury's is being built on another formerly empty plot of land. There's no shortage of places to build or renovate, and as with the Chapel Ash example, there was no difficulty with planning permission because they've already got it.

What's missing is either (a) capital to make it happen or (b) the will of developers to build or renovate when they risk losing money if the housing market crashes.

In the last few years we've had the likes of Fellaini, Rodwell, Pienaar, Arteta and Lescott agitate for moves, roughly one a year. I really don't think anyone will be forcing their way out this summer, though. This season was too good, and I think the players really responded to Bobby's positivity, which must have made a nice chance after years under Dour David.

Also, those big moves away from Everton have a tendency to not work out the way the players hope they will. Lescott's obviously been successful with City but it eventually cost him his place in the England side, Arteta had to wait until two days ago to finally win something with Arsenal, Pienaar only lasted a year at Spurs before coming back with his tail between his legs, Rodwell has disappeared off the face of the earth, and Fellaini was hilariously bad for United this year.

Wayne Ronney - Team has just finished 17th and the club was financially crippled. It's commonly known that without the Rooney money we would have been in dire straights with the banks in regards to our outstanding debts. We needed to sell.

Joleon Lescott - Forced his way out of the club. Everton sell high though and we got a great price for him.

The bottom line is that if a footballer really wants leave, 9/10 he will get his wish. I can't see any players wanting to leave Everton this summer due to the Martinez factor, the football we play and the overwhelming feel of potential this squad has. We also do not need to sell.

Every summer we have to deal with rumours of our top players leaving but this is something all teams bar Real Madrid have to deal with. Come the end of the summer our squad will be strengthened, not weakened. You should be excited, not pessimistic.

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"One of the key factors is regional weighting - London is very centric to pretty much everything and so places surrounding it in good commuter positions are expensive. 

There's Birmingham and Manchester which get a bit more expensive than locally due to being a city but by no means is it on the same scale, mostly because there's less important placed there (changing in Manchester maybe) - I'm not sure for these reasons but as much as M+B are great cities you can't really compare them to London. Might be due to a lack of government decentralisation which then feeds into industries.

Compare this to Germany where you have several major players in terms of industry and who all act on similar levels of 'success' - Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin, Dusseldorf/Cologne, Hamburg, Leipzig etc - obviously not all exactly the same size/power but still there's many more major players so it's not like everyone is crowding around Berlin to get a job. 

So I think it's two pronged - there's a shorting of housing, but just building more houses around London won't necessarily help. More investment in the North (Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield 'belt') would help balance the country out a bit more (hence HS2 being potentially a good thing and bringing us more inline with Germany) and spread demand a bit. 

I'd guess there's more room to build up North too so the issues like green belt might not be such an issue. The issue is that the South East is running out of space to build new houses and that all the demand is there.

To take a region as an example, between 2007 and 2014 house prices in the North West England area (according to the Nationwide's figures) have gone down by 8.5%. Assuming a 4% interest rate mortgage with a 25 year term, after 7 years you would be at 19% paid back, 81% left to go. So even though the value of your house has dropped, you're still in ""positive equity"" to the tune of 11.5% of the original price.

For this region, the math holds all the way up to a 40 year term mortgage, and is more lenient if you had a lower average rate of interest over that period. I think the only region where this logic isn't ironclad is Northern Ireland, which has seen a larger drop.

The only reasons that someone subject to the maths described above would be in negative equity would be if they were on an interest only mortgage without a repayment plan, or if they've not kept up with repayments. Both of which are possible, but less likely to be in vast overwhelming numbers.

Edit: To answer your last point. I am not arguing that nobody is in negative equity. Negative equity can occur even in boom times, and this is far from boom times. I'm arguing that by the numbers posted above it should not be a structural issue any more. A far bigger structural issue from where I'm sitting is repayment affordability. That is, where people have borrowed such that they can currently just about afford their repayments, but will struggle if they go up- as they will when the BoE increase rates.

I've no idea if it makes sense statistically, but I do think that were it harder to drive while distracted by phones or whatever in a car, fewer drivers would be distracted. On the other hand, those that do still drive while distracted would be more dangerous while they do so, but my gut leans towards the former for some reason.

Perhaps it's envy; I ride a motorbike.

Sterling is really the only product out of the academy who looks like he might be a world class player, it would be folly to expect others like Ibe to turn out the same. 

I think that after years of being out of the Champions League, expectations have become lowered drastically for Liverpool fans. While there have been some outliers in the past, you really need to have multiple top players in every position in order to win the Champions League and Premier League. With United, Arsenal and Chelsea all expected to improve greatly over the summer, Liverpool can ill afford to expect a repeat of last season while only making minimal improvements. Currently only Lallana and Moreno are expected really improve the first eleven, it is still arguable whether the different qualities of Caulker or Lovren are enough to improve on Agger's qualities as a ball playing defender. 

I believe that when Rodgers spoke of adding good depth, he is talking about getting players good enough to improve on the existing first team. Sterling was suitably exciting last season, but I believe it would be hard for anyone to argue that Griezmann, Firmino or Sanchez is not a direct improvement on Sterling. With the Champions League and a stronger squad, Sterling can still look forward to playing plenty of matches.

 Suarez might be indestructible, and Sturridge is not. Manchester City won the league because even without Aguero, there was Negredo and Dzeko to pick up the slack. For too long, Liverpool has had to deal with the potential of the 'Maybe's, but now is the time to move forward and enter the realm of the 'Surely's.

Labour had to pick a new leader for two simple reasons:

1. To reverse the Blairification/Brownification of Labour. Somebody had to reverse the trend of political inbreeding that had taken over Labour where candidates who supported one or the other NL camp were promoted over all others. Particularly because crucially the camps were so close to each other in actual policy.

2. To have somebody who could be genuinely seen as putting to bed the Labour legacy of authoritarianism. If Labour are to position themselves for the future they need to put that stuff to bed. The generation that loved the government spying on us are increasingly no longer with us. The generation that put up with a decade of security panic madness will be coming into majority. Labour have to position themselves for that.

None of this could have been done with any other candidate but Miliband precisely because he was the further candidate from previous power available. David Miliband pretty much campaigned on being the son of Blair. That was never going to work.

The reason they are not there is because its against the interest of those who would need to pass the laws (Politicians). Politicians own on average 2-3 houses and 25% of them are landlords. The salary for that level of professionalism is not that high (60 grand) and so most of their interests are within property as an asset (you only need to consider how all have a second home in London to see why they want and appreciate high prices).

Currently we have many more rooms then we do people (Census 2011) and at the moment a lot of older people are keeping on to their larger properties instead of moving into something more suitable in size. What I mean by this is there are lots of 50+ couples / singles whose kids have left and are in / or approaching retirement and living in 4-5 bedroom houses. In the past it would be typical downsize to a bungalow or a cottage / small townhouse. They have benefited from years or prices rises, and they can now see there is a higher return on their money within their property then there is in a savings account.

There is also the fact that a lot of the former council housing that was available for families (2-3 bed maisonettes) have been sold off and are now rented or purchased by young professionals.

I actually posted a video of a professor from oxford university who communicated these points well and is more credible then me (a bloke off the internet), but it never made the front page and got downvoted, so I expect others did not agree:

true,BadHaders,,Year 11,"Hexadecimal is really simple, I'll write it out for you.  
  
*What is hexadecimal?*
Hexadecimal is a visual simple representation of a 4-bit binary number, e.g 0101 or 1101. Hexadecimal is represented as a number or letter, so you only have to read a single letter, for instance C, to read the 4-bit binary number.  
  
*How does it work?*  
The numbers and letters go from 0 to f, 0-9 being 0-9, and a-f being 10-15. In total there are 16 different hexadecimal characters to represent all the numbers that can be shown with a 4-bit string!  
To turn the hexadecimal into the binary number, just work out what it represents, e.g B represents 11, and then make the binary number:  
11 = 1011.  
The hexadecimal character is essentially shorthand for a binary string. I'll write them all out for you:  
0 = 0000  
1 = 0001  
2 = 0010  
3 = 0011  
4 = 0100  
5 = 0101  
6 = 0110  
7 = 0111  
8 = 1000  
9 = 1001  
A (10) = 1010  
B (11) = 1011  
C (12) = 1100  
D (13) = 1101  
E (14) = 1110  
F (15) = 1111  
You don't have to remember them all, because to get the binary you just take the hecadecimal number (e.g 7 or A, which is 10) and convert it to binary. The exception is A-F, but those are used because hexadecimal is a single character, so having 10 / 11 etc would confuse the entire system. So for those just count up from 9, 10 being A, 11 being B etc.  
  
*Converting Hexadecimal &amp; Multi Character Hexadecimal*  
Hexadecimal can represent any binary number with a bit length that's a multiple of 4, e.g 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit.  
8-bit is the most commonly used length for hexadecimal, and will be two characters.  
If we have an 8-bit binary number, say 10110111 and want to convert it to hexadecimal it's rather easy:  
1) Split it into two parts, 1011 and 0111  
2) Convert them to denary (normal whole number i.e integer), giving us 11 and 7.  
3) Make those into the hexadecimal characters, 11 being B and 7 being 7  
4) Stick them together: B7. So 10110111 is B7.  
It works backwards exactly the same way. B7 -&gt; B 7 -&gt; 11 7 -&gt; 1011 0111 -&gt; 10110111  
  
*Why use Hexadecimal?*  
The computer doesn't read in hexadecimal, it reads in binary, which means the hexadecimal is converted into binary before the computer reads it. It's not for the computer's benefit, it's for our benefit. B7 is much easier to remember than 10110111, and much shorter to write down. Hexadecimal makes it much easier to communicate with the computer on a binary level, and makes managing hexadecimal numbers much easier.  
  
That should cover it all! I'm not a teacher so I doubt it was perfect, but I didn't even know if there was a resource available online, thus writing it here :)  If you'd like any clarification on it just reply back and I'll do my best!

true,GeekySweetie,null,null,"I have felt how you feel and honestly thought my children would be better off somewhere else. Thankfully I have a good doctor who has helped me find a good medication for me, and I've been having therapy which has helped. I'm also lucky enough to have a supportive Mum who helps out with stuff that I find difficult like cooking and cleaning when I'm low. Even though I have a long way to go, I'm doing much better now.

You don't need to give your child away, you just need help. If you are really struggling, I think that the authorities would more likely put your child with another relative (or temporary foster carers if there were no relatives able to care for them) to give you a chance to heal. The first step is to go to a GP and talk to them about how you have been feeling, and what things you are finding difficult. They will most likely get you to fill out a questionnaire that will help them assess what mental health issues you're facing, and then they will probably start you on some medication. It might take a few tries to find a medication that really suits you, and the first week or two of starting a medication can be rough, but don't give up. Once you've got a medicine that works for you in your system, it will help so much.

Hopefully your doctor will also be able to refer you for some sort of therapy. I'm currently doing CBT to combat my low self-esteem and so far it's really helping. You may find there is a long waiting list for therapy, unfortunately, unless you can afford to see somebody privately. There may also be a way to self-refer, without waiting on your GP, but this varies depending on where you are.

While you are getting better, don't be afraid to ask for help from anybody close to you. Having somebody to help you tidy up once a week, or take care of your child for a couple of hours, can make a world of difference. Does your child go to a nursery or child minder? At age three I think they should be entitled to 15 hours of free child care. My daughter goes to a child minder three days a week and it really helps to have a bit of time to myself, even if I don't do anything except chill out for a bit.

I hope this helps you, and do feel free to PM me. I'm happy to help you find out what help services there are in your area, or just chat. Whatever you like. I'll also PM you my email address in case you'd prefer.

That's 833,000 more people seeking their own addresses alone without getting into widow(er)s or 20 somethings.  Of course it should be offset by building smaller houses and 1 bed flats and converting existing stock.  But I don't think that has actually happened, partly because we have a free market rather than a planned one and partly because no one wants a 1 bed flat, they want a 2/3 bed house even if they never use 1/2 of those rooms.

Don't get me wrong:  We are a classless society and I am not telling people they should stay/get married or have their weekend child custody in a shitty 1 bed flat.  I certainly don't intend to despite being single.  I am just pointing out, there is more than immigration and greenfield restrictions to the housing shortage.

The original text that Forer used for his experiment is pretty stilted. Yet, for a laugh one evening, I found a phone chat line and recorded a message saying I was a psychic, and asking people to tell me three words about themselves, and I'd tell them about themselves. 

Then I'd read off the Forer text verbatim. 

A couple got that I wasn't actually giving them more than vague generalities, but most people got back and sounded astounded, and started pouring out more stuff and asking questions, to the point where I quickly decided I couldn't justify to keep going (and told the ones who had replied exactly what I'd done). Of course, I'd let people ""self-select"" by saying I was psychic (and this self-selection effect is of course part of the benefit for people cold-reading an audience too - most of the time the gullible people self-selects themselves), which can massively strengthen the effect.

But this was also while totally ignoring any cue I might've gotten from accents, or voices, or the three words they'd given me.

Robert Firmino, 18m, had an amazing season at hoffenheim and is very versatile being able to play in any of the 4 attacking roles. I suspect this'll be our only attacking signing if Suarez stays.

Alberto Moreno, 12m, young left back who's good going forward and looks to have a bright future ahead of him.

Serge Aurier, 12m, another young but established player, Aurier has just had a fantastic season at Toulouse and may look to further his career by moving to a larger club. Personally this is a signing I'd be extremely delighted for us to go for

Andrea Ranocchia, 16m, always linked with a move away from inter despite both club and player denying such stories. Alongside Sakho this duo could form a world class partnership that'll last years. I don't fully expect us to land him in truth but he'd be exactly what we need

David Ospina, 7m, a top quality keeper who can easily contend or displace mignolet, surprising that larger clubs haven't snapped him up earlier.

Finally, I think a defensive midfielder might be required, finding one with the passing range to compare to Gerrard is almost impossible, it's normally a rare talent and one that is more common in older players. I don't know of any such player, but I'm sure someone else might?

That leaves the outgoings:

Johnson, 7m, he's been on poor form, high wages and doesn't want to leave. 7m would be an amazing price for us but a price the teams that can afford him win pay

Pepe Reina, 6m, cheap I know but goalkeepers rarely command large fees and it's pretty clear he's being shown the door.

Lucas, 15m, sounds like a lot more than what's being reported but I wouldn't value him at any less. I'd love to keep him but he just won't be able to force his way into the team and he doesn't have a role in the team anymore. Any less than 15m and I'd keep him but the money could be better spent elsewhere.

Martin Skrtel, 10m, despite the record own goals Skrtel has been a rock at the back and I believe will end up at Roma, Napoli or Inter. Shame to let him go but we need something else in defence that would suit our play style.

Those are the only main outgoings I see but I also expect players like Assaidi, Robinson, Jones, Yesil and Coates to be shipped out. 

So 65m spent, 38+m sold. Net spend of around 27m which is reasonable, we may strengthen more depending on how much trust fsg have in Rodgers and whether we expect to be challenging again next season",0,1400496035,null,0,false,0,chlo3x6,t3_25x9cw,t1_chlo3x6,t3_25x9cw,null,1433860637,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Also I don't think we should sell Agger unless we can find a proper replacement. I think it's better to work w the system and CBs you have than bring in a new one and have to reorganize everything.

Seeing that most of his point is about Romanians being more likely to be criminals, and that has the most 'evidence' from him, that strikes me as his main line of argument, and seems very much like racial profiling.

It's a tough nut to crack. I dread the day Stevie makes the decision and I hope it is a long long way off.

Players we are linked with are all quality up-and-comers. Except for Lallana, who's been there and done that, even if it was in the lower leagues. That is actually the greatest reason he appeals to me so very much. He's been in tough leagues, ones that don't get much attention, which are incredibly competitive. He was part of his teams push from League One to the Premier League. That is an amazing achievement and his experience and knowledge is nearly unique among Premier League players. What of the others though? 

All young, lots of ability and skill. Mentally they are still forming and while such signings are always exciting, they carry an inherent risk of them not being able to cut it in their new environment.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Personally, I suspect it's a bit more complex. I don't really think hoarding is a big thing (it is overplayed by the media and probably relates more to commercial land than residential land - e.g. google search Tesco Land Holdings). The fabled magical mythical *""Green Belt""* is really a non-starter. If you travel to the South-east to try and find this ethereal land known as the green belt, it won't be easy. People have actually been building on it for years and there isn't much ""green"" about it. London in particular is now curtailed more by the M25 than any true green belt. Personally, I think it's more to do with...

* 1) Our geography. The UK is a small and densely populated country. Secondly, most of the population is clustered in the southern  half of the nation (geographically, not politically). That intrinsically creates a higher **land premium** than many other nations, particularly those that have ample room for expansion like Australia and the USA. 

* 2) Our background. If you look at most British housing, it falls into 3 categories; [pre-war properties](http://www.narratives.co.uk/ImageThumbs/RS037_25/3/RS037_25_Brick_London_townhouse_UK.jpg) mostly built between 1900 and 1935. [Post-war properties](http://richardwillisuk.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/council-houses.jpg) built very quickly between 1945 and 1960 to house the huge numbers of people displaced by the war, or returning from fighting overseas. Then finally [more modern housing](http://www.thames-path.org.uk/images/20090314_014.jpg) built between the late 1960s and now. The problem largely relates to the middle group - it was built quickly and cheaply to fulfil a simple purpose and the architects responsible for it never planned for it to last this long. It was meant to be a ~30 year stopgap while the nation recovered from a devastating war. Unfortunately, now a lot of it is privately owned and as poor as it is in quality, people don't want to part with it. The SE in particular is dominated by this stuff. It covers huge swathes of land, often on what used to be the peripheries of cities.

* 3) Our Economy. Because our economy is based on financial services (like it or lump it) we were particularly badly affected by the global downturn, which manifested here as a prolonged shallow recession. It has meant there is very little liquidity for companies, particularly the small and medium construction firms that tend to build housing - because the banks have not been able to lend capital large enough to ""safe enough"" firms to get construction moving. 

* 4) Our Pensions. Or lack there of. Property in the UK have come to be seen as a ""solid investment for later years"" since the boom of the 1980s. Unfortunately this has meant that there are significant numbers of property owners, usually in their middle ages and upwards whose interests are in seeing prices rise (because that means a bigger pension pot = a bigger annuity and a better retirement)... and seeing prices rise partly means curtailing supply. I'm not trying to apportion blame, but just pointing out that the situation has created a set of competing interests.

* 5) Our Population. Or basically, immigration. Few nations have expanded like the UK has in the last 10 years. Aside from the social tensions it's created, it has been *""the straw that breaks the camels back""* in terms of the property market.

* 6) Our Demographics. Similar to the above, in the 1960s divorce was pretty uncommon. It's now very common, and often the result of it is 2 adults that used to live together, end up selling up and moving into two slightly smaller homes. Along the same lines, our aging population has also meant that people who would (in previous generations) have died in their early 70s and bequeathed their property back to the rest of us, are actually still alive and living in it. 

**tl:dr;** The countries small, has a lack of available space, the quality of housing here already is very poor, builders don't have the cash to build, there are lots of people (both because they aren't dieing, and lots are arriving) and because of competing interests in increasing the supply.

true,retrominge,lfc68,,"Neither can Gerrard. He's only being asked to do those things because Gerrard has forced himself into that position on the pitch. 

My point here isn't that Lucas should be playing instead of Gerrard - or even alongside him. It's that he's a perfectly good substitute/replacement for the future. 

Those stats I said I'd look into. Since Lucas' injury and Gerrard playing in that position, Liverpool have conceded 0.25 more goals per game than the games Lucas started prior to that injury. Across a 38 game season (assuming Gerrard stays in that position next year), that's 9.5 more goals conceded per season. 

Looking at goals scored, with Lucas out of the team/out of position, the team score 0.66 goals per game more than when he starts at CDM. Across a season, that's 25 more goals. 

I think that pretty much concludes that Gerrard should be in the position over Lucas (which I agreed with before I even started looking into this), but it also shows that Lucas is a fantastic addition to the team defensively. Defending is something we've struggled with this year and will continue to do so, unless something big changes. I honestly believe Lucas does a job that not many players in the world can do.

As I've said a hundred times on this subreddit (and at least twice in this comment thread alone), I agree that Gerrard is the right starting option in that position. 

Saying ""if Lucas can't adapt to being played out of position"" is bullshit. Name another player in the squad who's been asked to play out of position? If Gerrard is playing CDM, Rodgers should know enough about his players to keep Lucas on the bench. 

When Henderson was out, every Liverpool fan going knew that playing Lucas on the right side of a diamond was not going to give the same results as having Hendo in there. So why all the hate for Lucas?

&gt;**FLIGHT**

&gt;How can we fly without damaging the environment?

&gt;If aircraft carbon emissions continue to rise they could contribute up to 15 per cent of global warming from human activities within 50 years. This needs to be addressed in order to slow down climate change and its detrimental effects on the planet. The challenge is to design and build an aeroplane that is as close to zero-carbon as possible and capable of flying from London to Edinburgh, at comparable speed to today’s aircraft.


&gt;**DEMENTIA**

&gt;How can we help people with dementia live independently for longer?

&gt;It is estimated that 135 million people worldwide will have dementia by 2050, which will mean a greater personal and financial cost to society. With no existing cure, there is a need to find ways to support a person’s dignity, physical and emotional wellbeing. The challenge is to develop intelligent, affordable integrated technologies that revolutionise care for people with dementia, enabling them to live independent lives.

&gt;**FOOD**

&gt;How can we ensure everyone has nutritious, sustainable food?

&gt;One in eight people worldwide do not get enough food to live a healthy and fulfilled life. With a growing population and limited resources, providing everybody with nutritious, sustainable food is one of the biggest global problems ever faced. The challenge is to invent the next big food innovation, helping to ensure a future where everyone has enough nutritious, affordable and environmentally sustainable food.

&gt;**WATER**

&gt;How can we ensure everyone can have access to safe and clean water?

&gt;Water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. 44 per cent of the world’s population and 28 per cent of the world’s agriculture are in regions of the world where water is scarce. The challenge is to alleviate the growing pressure on the planet’s fresh water by creating a cheap, environmentally sustainable desalination technology.

&gt;**ANTIBIOTICS**

&gt;How can we prevent the rise of resistance to antibiotics?

&gt;The development of antibiotics has added an average of 20 years to our life. Yet the rise of antimicrobial resistance is threatening to make them ineffective. This poses a significant future risk as common infections become untreatable. The challenge is to create a cost-effective, accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections that will allow health professionals worldwide to administer the right antibiotics at the right time.

&gt;**PARALYSIS**

&gt;How can we restore movement to those with paralysis?

&gt;In the UK, a person is paralysed every eight hours. Paralysis can emerge from a number of different injuries, conditions and disorders and the effects can be devastating. Every day can be demanding when mobility, bowel control, sexual function and respiration are lost or impaired. The challenge is to invent a solution that gives paralysed people close to the same freedom of movement that most of us enjoy.",0,1400498315,null,0,1400498687,0,chlohqb,t3_25xjr9,t1_chlohqb,t3_25xjr9,null,1433860818,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

My friend, recognizing that a player may be sold for a better replacement is not hate. Trust me I am a fan of Lucas too. But football is about bringing in your strongest team and bench and winning. Now that we are in the CL and looking to fight for the league against Chelsea, City, Arsenal, and a revitalized United, we need quality in every position and more. 

And I personally believe from what he has shown, Lucas does not offer what we need when he is not played as a defensive midfielder. He does not have the attacking quality we would look for nor does he offer much in terms of shape and pressing. We already have a static defensive mid in Gerrard--if Lucas wants to stand out and offer something new, he needs to work on his mobility in the game. 

I agree he is defensively fantastic, but he needs to step up his game in other areas too IMO. But we shouldn't sell him without securing a replacement either.

1) There are so many unused sites within London itself former Brownfield, undeveloped land that can and should be used for development but, BUT, instead people are sitting on the land and not doing anything with it. Some of it could be down to purely that the people who own that land don't have the money to do anything with it. Some of it could also be the factors you relate in points 2 and 3. Point 3 that you raise is also related to this and this will affect the profitability. 

http://www.pas.gov.uk/3-community-infrastructure-levy-cil/-/journal_content/56/332612/4090701/ARTICLE

Whereby this gives a set number of units that must be given over to affordable housing units or a sum of money can be paid to the council on (a) specified date(s) if you can show how a feasibility on having affordable housing in your own development, or not.

2) This is kind of true too, but kind of not. A lot of the more forward thinking about developing on green belt land now is also focused not on utterly destroying the green belt, but more in the line of developing on it in a chequerboard manner. So we don't completely just add an urbanised ring around London, I do agree that relying planning laws originally set up in 1935, so almost 80 years ago, to define our planning and development now seems a little archaic and insane to me. Especially considering how insanely rigid those laws are. 

See here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14916238

The CPRE really are the ultimate definition of NIMBY imo

3) Planning regulation. A lot of this is down to the councils and I'm sorry but it's flat out insane. As I mentioned the S106 requirements earlier. I would also mention that in the UK, this is a joke. The demands laid out by S106 are pretty hefty I agree, but they can be so easily bypassed or now are basically non existent so all the developer has to do is throw some money at the local council and they're done with it and don't need to provide affordable housing as part of the development.

http://www.out-law.com/articles/2012/september/government-allows-developers-to-appeal-commercially-unviable-section-106-agreements/

Actually with the way the law is now, all they need to do is provide a very flimsy feasibility study on why they don't need to do it. That they've commissioned, themselves. 

But otoh we also have the NIMBY idiots as many people have already mentioned who would reject all planning and so on just because ""oh I don't like the sound of that."" etc etc... 

You're also very right with the whole planning and development scheme. For example the former Heygate estate is being demolished and in place a lower density development is taking its place. But it's using blocks of flats still and it is pushing towards a higher density system. So hey it may work! As other posters have also said. London Clay. It's a complete bugger to build on and only has recently been financially viable enough for them to start considering building skyscrapers on.

What I'm saying is OK. It sucks but Gerrard being static is forcing Lucas out of his favored position of DM into other positions. He is now having to play CM at times instead. So we have a player (Lucas) who is being played at CM but is not offering much there; a player who's real strength is at DM, but who can't play there anymore bc of Gerrard. So what do we do? 

The way I see it, either Lucas improves his game as a CM and stays on as an option for rotation and for covering for Gerrard, OR Brendan feels he isn't good enough at CM, the club finds a player they feel can cover both DM and CM, and Lucas is sold.

 Which then asks the question is Lucas equipped with the attributes to be as good as Hendo, Coutinho or Allen as part of a 2 infront of Stevie. And sadly he isn't if we're being entirely honest. 

Then you look at his wages and ask do they represent value for money given the contribution made on the pitch? Again they probably don't.

In the US they got lucky that the US government locked in a strike price that made assumptions about well viability that turned out not to be true. The test cases turned out to hit outliers that lasted a lot longer than the average case. So the US locked in a contract that proved very lucrative for the American people and disastrous for the energy companies who'll never agree to deal on those terms again.

The expectation today in the US is that a well will last only a third of the time that was originally believed. That shorter life time means that the fixed cost of drilling will have a higher impact on the strike price. The UK wells are all expected to be worse than the US norm as well.

Meanwhile, I've been trying to find out the statistics that back up his 90% claim and can find nothing. 

https://fullfact.org/factchecks/romanians_cash_machine_crime-29254 suggests that it is a made up statistic by one bloke:

&gt; The claim that 90% of crime at ATMs (or cash machines) is the work of Romanian gangs has often been repeated in the press as far back as early 2012.

&gt;It can be traced back to DCI Paul Barnard, then head of the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU) – a police unit run in partnership with banks and financial services companies. DCI Barnard told ITV1’s ‘Fraud Squad’ programme that:

&gt;“The fact is 92 per cent of all ATM fraud we see in this country is committed by Romanian nationals.”



&gt;We spoke to the DCPCU hoping to find out more, but were told that DCI Barnard was no longer head of the unit, and that no further details were held on this particular claim.

&gt;Although a spokesperson did tell us that the figure was based on “police intelligence at the time”, he also said that no statistics were available on the issue.

England only play maybe a dozen non-friendly internationals a year (and friendlies don't really do much because most people only play 45 mins anyway). I really don't think it adds a huge amount to how well they play together compared to training with each other every day at Liverpool and having one or two club games every week. Loads of English players together at Liverpool helps England, but I don't think it really makes much difference to the club.

Frankly, I don't see the green options as capable of powering the whole country yet and nuclear takes a huge effort and a long time to get off the ground. Since we're probably going to be likely to need to replace stations before nuclear is built up and before the amount of green needed to be built that could prevent black outs, we will need other sources of power.

If we replace each station with a combination of gas and green (with pushing more towards green as time goes on and tech improves) we'll be covered for now and have a great start for the future. If we pushed for 100% renewable from now on and the capacity simply wasn't there (we'll either have not enough or the cost would put huge weight on the people) , we'd have to rush to build infrastructure which would mean we either pay far more or have to go for the cheapest dirtier options.

If you tell the people at the border that a) you need to work and b) you can't afford to be here without working they aren't going to let you in even as a tourist. Nobody will give you a job with a tourist visa. Besides it's not worth the risk, being banned from the UK for 10 years, potentially going to prison etc.

&gt; So, am I a dime-a-dozen type or do you think I could find work while visiting the UK? 

Yes, you are. No, you won't find work while visiting. You'll also struggle to get a legitimate work visa without maybe a company transfer.

&gt; Although- if anyone knows ways that foreigners can get financial support for study of medicine or anything, really (like, for example with the promise of practicing {or, rather 'practiSing'} in a needy area in the UK for a set number of years) I'd love to know about it.

Highly doubtful. Especially since you're 30. UCL charges £29,900 per year for international students doing medicine. Six years of £30k plus six years living costs in London is fucking expensive (NHS usually pays for the fees for the last year though but not sure about international students). Earliest you could start, assuming you have the correct qualifications and get acceptable scores in the UKCAT or BMAT, would be September 2015, so you'd likely be 37 when you get to your first foundation year as a doctor, then there are two of those, before training to specialise. I'm not convinced there's much potential funding for an international student, who already has a degree, who will work a lot less in the long run than someone who started studying medicine at the age of 18. Doesn't sound like a good investment. 

Promising to work in 'poor' areas isn't exactly how medicine works in the UK.

1) Maersk Cure reported seeing a ""capsized hull"". Was the keel attached? it seems very unlikely that a Beneteau 40.7 with a fixed, heavy keel would remain inverted with the keel attached, particularly in the conditions reported. It also seems very unlikely that water ingress, by itself, would lead to a capsize.

2) The Coast Guard reported that two beacons were detected, providing some ""general GPS co-ordinates"". There is, of course, no such thing. Co-ordinates from onboard GPS receivers are always precise, not general, and they would have allowed a search to proceed to the exact location of the transmission. This is almost certainly how Maersk Cure was able to arrive at the scene. The article implies that the yacht had two GPIRBS. Did they continue to transmit during the search? Did their locations diverge? How did the signals evolve over time?

3) What is the exact relationship between the captain, the crew, and Stormforce Coaching? Were the older crew members paying to be aboard? How much was Stormforce Coaching paying the very young captain? Was he selected because of his offshore experience and qualifications, or was he selected because of financial motivations?

4) How is it possible that a forty foot sailboat can take on water slowly enough to allow the situation to be reported as ""stable"" by radio and slowly enough to allow the crew to make plans to divert to an alternate destination, and yet the source of the water ingress remained obscure? The logic here being that high speed of ingress and a large amount of water may preclude discovery of the source, but that situation would certainly constitute an emergency requiring a mayday call. Conversely, if there was little enough water coming in to allow plans for a diversion to be made, how, on such a small boat, does one fail to find the source? Obviously, the rate of water ingress may have increased at some point, but the question, pertaining to the original situation, remains.

5) What kind of life raft was aboard and how, having apparently activated two GPIRBS, does a professional crew manage to get into it and disconnect from the hull without taking at least one of them?",0,1400507203,null,0,false,0,chlqo6f,t3_25uzh7,t1_chlqo6f,t3_25uzh7,null,1433861844,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

**Trustworthy Sources**

*[Official LFC Website](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/welcome-to-liverpool-fc)*

*[Liverpool Echo](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool%20fc)/[Neil Jones](https://twitter.com/neiljonesecho)/[James Pearce](https://twitter.com/JamesPearceEcho)*

*[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/football/transfer-window)/[Andy Hunter](https://twitter.com/AHunterGuardian)*

*[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/)*

*[Sky Sports](http://www.skysports.com/)*

*[The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/)/[Tony Barrett](https://twitter.com/TonyBarretTimes)*

**Untrustworthy Sources**

*Goal.com*

*Squawka*

*GiveMeSport*

*CaughtOffside*

*HITC Sport*

*The S-n/Daily Star/The Mirror/Other Gossip Papers*

*Bleacher Report*


--------------------

***Is this always the case?*** Of course not; any information you get from any source shy of the official LFC website has a chance of being wrong, and even reputable sources such as the BBC report deals that have not occurred. Just use common sense, we aren't in the running for Messi's signature any time soon. 

***What if a transfer is being reported by more than one untrustworthy source? Is it more likely?*** No, not at all. Untrustworthy sources tend to quote each other for their ""breaking transfer news"" articles, so even if both Bleacher Report *and* HITC are reporting it, it's more than likely false if it sounds too good to be true. 

***What is the criteria that you base the ""trustworthy"" sources on?*** Mostly reliability, but also much more well-known brands. The BBC does not need to ""click-bait"" with ludicrous speculation like Goal.com does because they're an established company and don't rely solely on the income generated from each page view. Plus, because they're established, they have more to lose from constantly reporting fake stories. Also, as a general rule-of-thumb, any source that states ""[source name here] understands..."" is generally not worth your time -- it means that the editors can simply blame miscommunication or misrepresentation if the deal they're reporting turns out to be nonsense.

***Are all untrustworthy sources wrong all of the time?*** Of course not, they very occasionally do report something that isn't a complete fabrication and has some truth in it. However, usually when an unreliable source such as Goal.com reports a deal, reliable sources such as Sky Sports have already reported it, so checking reliable sources is the best way to find out the latest concrete news fast. However, just because a gossip newspaper may get it right 1 time out of 1000, that doesn't mean they're reliable, it's simply down the probability of them getting it right *at some point*. 

***I think you've missed out some sources. Can you add them?*** Yes, of course. This list is in no way the acme of transfer source lists, so if there's someone you trust or don't trust, please drop me a PM and I'll include it...unless it's your mate Gary from down the pub, because he likely won't be included on the list at all, regardless of whether he predicted we'd put £35m down on Carroll six months before or not.

***So...are you telling me there's no chance we'll sign Messi?*** I didn't think so but then I saw that both Goal.com and Bleacher Report were reporting it, so there might be some truth in it after all.../s

Your oh so intelligible reply

&gt;That's simply not true in London. Just look at the people with money buying up everything going in previously undesirable areas like Hackney, Peckham or Bermondsey regardless of council estates across the road. The luxury of looking for nice little villages within a city are long gone.

1) He's talking about developments in London, new builds with the requirements.

2) You're saying look at what's happening in London, where people are buying up houses even though council estates are nearby. Ever since the right to buy and the rules put in place most of what you call council housing is actually privately owned. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_buy#Thatcher_policies

&gt;Half the proceeds of the sales were paid to the local authorities, but they were restricted to spending the money to reduce their debt until it was cleared, rather than being able to spend it on building more homes. The effect was to reduce the council housing stock, especially in areas where property prices were high such as London and the south-east of England.

&gt;Since 1981, the Borough has grown by around 27,000 extra homes - an annual rate of 1,000 which almost matches our current statutory targets for housing growth.

&gt;Most of the additional housing is in the private sector, led by growth in owner-occupation up to 2003, but shifting to private renting since then.

So my point is, that developments which have to worry about dealing with Section 106 requirements don't. Also the location in and of itself next to ""council estates"" aren't really council estates as most of the stock has been sold off anyway in the 80's due to Thatcher. Most of the current social housing is private landlords letting to the councils.

Around 400,000 is the total number of council owned housing in the Greater London area. That is pretty much a drop in the bucket compared to the actual housing available in London. The odds of living near a council home nowadays, admittedly does vary from area to area, but realistically speaking is pretty much nil in most of central London and other areas which experience gentrification/urban renewal/whatever the fuck you want to call it.

So your claims that the existent council estates obviously show that people don't mind living in new developments also ignores one important fact. The security on those new flats won't let those tenants into the building. So I get to live in the shiny new posh building next to the council home with the smart developer who used the S106 appeal to have no affordable housing in the building. Why would I even care that the council house estate across the road is there? Even if it was full of salt of the earth people paying less than a £100 a month but it isn't. It's mostly full of people renting from people who took advantage of the right to buy in the 80's.

1. You can't work on a tourist visa. Not even a little bit.
2. If you want to work here you need a work visa. In order to get a work visa your potential employer must prove that they have advertised across the whole EU (not just the UK) and found no one to hire. This is extremely unlikely so unless you have really really extra special talents (read: top scientist in your field, world-class athlete etc) then there is someone in the EU who can do the job you are applying for and you won't get your visa.
1. Again, with the medical thing you are on the same visa requirements as (I assume) a post-graduate. If you are an undergraduate that's different (for the visa) but unless you've lived in England for three years before starting your course you won't get a penny from the government.

true,Andures,null,null,"&gt;I really haven't seen someone achieve so much over the course of a single season through coaching as Rodgers. That's why I have faith that players like Ibe, and down the line guys like Brad Smith and Rossiter, could make the grade at first-team level for Liverpool.

I think that's your optimism talking. I'll give you that Sterling looks like he has the potential to become a world-class player, but you expect Rodgers to follow that up with Ibe, Smith and Rossiter? In one season? The grade for a 7th place Liverpool first team place is very different from the grade for a title-challenging and Champions League playing Liverpool first team. Like I said, as good as Flanagan has been, he is far from world-class, and I doubt he would make the first team of any of the other top 4 teams. He would definitely not be good enough for the likes of Bayern, Barca, Real, Dortmund, Juve etc. That's the kind of level Liverpool needs to be at now.

&gt;I wouldn't compare Caulker/Lovren/whoever with Agger; Agger's spot is occupied by Sakho. Compare them with Skrtel, and I'd say Lovren's definitely an improvement, and Caulker may well be too. That's 3 players improving the first 11 - for a team that came 2nd in the league, that's pretty substantial.

I would disagree on Lovren being an improvement over Skrtel, so that's that, but I seriously think that there is no way Southampton is going to sell both Lallana and Lovren to Liverpool. According to rumours right now, Southampton is rumoured to be losing Lovren, Lallana, Shaw and Pochettino. There's even been rumours of Arsenal wanting Jay Rodriguez. You'd think Southampton are holding a fire sale there, but I honestly think they'll only lose one of Lallana or Shaw, and definitely not Lovren. It's similar to the Milner rumours from today, there's no point in speculating about a transfer that is 100% not going to happen.

I made that statement as part of a chatty discussion of ""what Reddit is"", not to attack you. 

I never said you were wrong, but by replying ""I have no idea why you told me that"" (and asking /u/MilitantNegroReturns ""did you even read my post?"" and ""WTF are you talking about?"") you made me feel like you don't respect what I'm saying or you're being confrontational.

In the opening sentence of [your original comment in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/25vt2l/is_it_me_or_is_there_a_lot_of_politically/chl9pkx)) you mentioned the ""Reddit etiquette"".

If that ""rediquette"" has any importance or meaning, why is the downvote button displayed so that it's opposite and equal to the button which means ""I liked this"", ""this is quality"" or ""I agree""?

There are millions of people on this site, and 20 or 100 people might upvote a submission for every person that comments on it (guesstimate based on [this source](http://www.philippsinger.info/?p=161)).

The only people to whom rediquette has any importance are those who talk about it - not only a minority of those who comment, but a *tiny* minority of those who use the site.

Not even the site owners care about the rediquette (however much they might say they do) because the ""equal and opposite"" user interface persists.

The site owners could change the user interface so that the downvote button is no longer opposite and equal to the liked / quality / agree button, but they don't, because it doesn't suit their purposes.

I originally wrote a lot more than this, but have cut it down and revised it, and even posting now, I wince to imagine how you'll receive it. Will I again get no more than a snooty dismissive one-liner from you? This proves much of what you said on your top comment, IMO, and stuff I've said elsewhere.

I think we should keep all of our current CBs and not sign a new CB. Skrtel had a great season overall, and Sakho looked promising in his first year with the club. Agger has proven himself obviously. We can't sign a new CB and keep all 3 of those guys, because of the wages. I don't think there will be an issue of playing time due to more games because of CL, and the fact that Agger and Sakho are somewhat injury prone anyway. We also have Kelly, Ilori, and Toure if there are more extensive injury problems. 

That being said, let's look at our fullbacks. 

Here is where we need to add some players. I love Flanagan and Johnson, but I fear Johnson will be gone after one more year at most. Flanagan is a great backup for either side, and is still very young. Enrique is going to have to prove himself again for me, because even before his injury, he was never world class in my opinion. I would love to see us bring in Ashley Cole or Rodriguez from Wolfsburg to challenge for the starting IX.

We saw what Rodgers did with Flanagan and Sterling, let's see what he does with Ibe. Lallana's more than serviceable on the flanks.

This is true, but at the same time I don't think it's great to rest hopes and potentially the future of the club on promising youngsters. Ibe could turn out to be another Sterling, or he could end up not quite making it at the top level (Spearing), or needing another two or three years to hit his stride (Kelly if he gets fit, arguably Shelvey too). I'd rather we spent £8-10m on an attacking player who we didn't need because Ibe turned out to be amazing than skimp on the money and risk lacking options up front.

Ultimately the whole point of having a squad is to provide redundancy for bad situations. If a couple of key players get injured then we need to be able to replace quality with quality rather than pulling up players from the academy and hoping they can be good enough. I don't think we can rely on Suarez playing every single game next season just because he never got injured this season.

Now that we're in the Champions League we have to fight to stay there and exploit the extra income to bring in quality players. You only have to look at how close Arsenal came to falling outside of the top four this season to see that a few key injuries can really jeopardise your league position if you've not spent properly to strengthen.

Most of these people already have a long list of connections in the area's organisations and a strong knowledge of the local situation, processes etc. The local Uni's and colleges seem to be churning out social workers et cetera at an insane rate, most of my social circle, both local and people who've settled here after Uni seem to be involved in the business in some form or another.

That said we desperately need new, forward thinking people in what has long been a substandard field in the NHS and supporting organisations. Good luck to OP, it won't be easy.

Is that really necessary?

I feel that Farage's insistence that the only way around this is to deny the entire population of a country the freedom to move to Britain to work for a better quality of life is racial discrimination, yes. He's pulled out some 'statistics' to make a point which has little validity. Crime happens all over the UK in various different forms and by various people of different nationalities. Like doing this is going to change that.

And then to suggest leaving the EU as the only way to stop it?! Sorry Farage, did I miss something there? I thought you were talking about beef with Romania, when did the rest of the EU come into the picture?

He's not just 'talking about nationality in a negative context' he's proposing that we cut ourselves off from a number of nationalities because he thinks that that is why these kinds of crime happen. I call bullshit, and feel that would be a huge backwards step for the UK.

I don't think the message is that *all* Romanians are criminals. The stats say that out of 100,000 of a set of people there have been 28,000 arrest from that set in a single area of the country. Now there will be some people arrested more than once and the majority of the people will live in the single area.

That is still a high percentage of the subset of people arrested. Now knowing these stats I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with a group of these people moving in next to me, whether they be from Romania, Newcastle or from the next street or whether they're male of female.

Am I a racist for feeling that way, or just wanting to reduce the risk of me being a victim of crime ?

For the record I've employed and managed hundreds of immigrants from around the world over the past 15 years. I've fought racism and discrimination in the workplace against genuine racists from the ""indigenous"" population. I've sacked white British people for discrimination.

I didn't and don't.

Apparently that's how you interpreted them, but if you read my words, you'll see you're mistaken.

""Any of us doing this"" is semantically the same as ""if any of us do this"" - it wasn't directed at you, it was a general remark in relation to this subject.

If you weren't doing it, then the statement doesn't apply to you.

Nevertheless it's something that's worth remembering when people talk about this stuff, because it's so easy to conflate what people do and what they ""should"" do.

Frankly, rediquette seems to me to be a guideline for what people ""should"" do, and if you didn't mean people to consider how one ""should"" vote, I'm uncertain why you mentioned it, but I'm happy to take you at your word.

&gt; That's why I maybe came across as being a bit testy, Perhaps if you didn't have the word troll in your username?

My username here is short for Stroller, someone who walks.

That line is not terribly originally and, having used this nick for over a decade, it gets a little tiresome. Surely every native English speaker is familiar with the verb *to stroll*?

I don't really think being confused about someone's username is a good reason for ignoring the substance of their words.

&gt; Also you come across as being a bit pompous,

I'm so glad we have so much in common, then. 😀

&gt; you have the wrong end of the stick

No, you.

I never disagreed with you - people are allowed to reply to your comments with supporting or tangental remarks (the words ""it's worth mentioning that"" opened my original reply to you).

The way the site's voting software works is relevant to discussion of users' voting patterns (""why do users vote this way?"") - that's why I mentioned it.

It will be tough next season, there's no doubting that. But I'll be incredibly surprised if our first team squad isn't at least half a dozen players larger than this year.

I expect to see minimal departures (2 first-team players max, plus several reserves or youngsters who wouldn't have made it anyway), five or six new signings and then players like Suso, Borini, Ibe etc to come back and fight for chances in the first team. If this happens, we'll have the numbers to cope.

Last time we were in Europe was the season before this last one and we were okay but not great. We also finished 7th that year, which is the reason people think we will struggle again next year. However, look at the players we had then compared to now. We had Downing, Shelvey (good season at Swansea but I never have and never will consider him Liverpool standard), Coates. We **didn't** have Coutinho, Sturridge, a *strong* Sterling, etc. Our squad is several times better now than it was in 2012, and our squad next season will be even better than our current one.

We'll be fine. We might not go on an extended European adventure, I'll be pleasantly surprised if we make it to the last 8, but as long as we finish in the top 4 again next year I'll be more than happy.

One thing as a cyclist that often amazes me is how many don't think they should need insurance.

It's not at all expensive, and it means that if I fuck up, I will not have to worry about being liable for a big bill.  I have before now had an accident which was ultimately my fault.  I ended up breaking the rear offside lens, not a big cost at all, and I paid it out of pocket.  I still get an xmas card from that couple.   But what if that damage had been worse?  In my case I'd been going a bit too fast for the weather conditions and a car scared me slightly, so I over reacted, lost control and smashed into a parked car.  What if that had been an OAP I'd left with serious injuries or similar.

I think that if motorists also thought that more cyclists were responsible, they might treat us better.   Well that's my theory anyway, lead by example eh!",0,1400516420,null,0,false,0,chluee9,t3_25xi8p,t1_chluee9,t1_chlpq9v,null,1433863603,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As you you see, Dortmund went up 30 points for getting the the grand final. This means Pot 1 will probably be Bayern, Barca, Chelsea, Real, Atleti, Arsenal, Benfica and ~~United~~ Porto in no particular order. 
Pot 2 will likely be Ajax/Gala, Shakhtar, City,Schalke, PSG, Zenit,CSKA,Dortmund 
*(Note: this is speculation based on numbers and movements of teams in previous years)*
  
So possible pot 1 opponents: Bayern, Barca, Real, Atleti, Benfica, Porto.  
Possible pot 2 opponents: Ajax/Gala, Shakhtar, Schalke, PSG, Zenit, CSKA, Dortmund  
  
Not too bad, I mean Bayern and PSG would make the group **very** difficult, but Porto and Zenit as the top 2 seeded teams would be the sort of group I'd expect us to top, let alone make it through.

It's the whole ""common sense"" brand that UKIP have going - it's like an umbrella allows great latitude and wide alignment. 

The average voter who labels their views ""common sense"" believes in obvious solutions, and doesn't care about nuance.

It doesn't matter that the world's a complicated place or that unintended consequences are inevitable, and we don't need facts or statistics or studies by scientists - the world will ""obviously"" be better if it conforms to my prejudices and expectations, and anyone who disputes that is just trying to be difficult.

UKIP currently only have one policy in their manifesto - getting out of Europe - and all this allows their supporters to project all their own expectations on the party.

In a recent thread about [an irish immigrant who](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/23vlrk/turns_out_the_builder_on_the_ukip_posters_is_an/) found brief limelight with UKIP, I saw two of their supporters advocating opposite and incompatible policies. One addressed objections by saying there should be a points system, another said that the Irish would be allowed to come here following an EU exit because they were ""culturally British"".

&gt; They're not racist, and they rightly get very angry indeed when dishonest and not especially bright journalists and politicians start directly or indirectly smearing them as such.

They aren't BNP racist, they are nice chap next door who's got some iffy views racist. We've all known *that* guy, he seems perfectly normal, he isn't a nuisance, he has a decent job, he keeps his garden tidy but one Sunday afternoon during your typical conversation over the fence he does that head nod thing and says *""You know what I mean""*. 

UKIP appears to be a party full of people like that, people who think everyone has a wee problem with the foreign fella but is just too nice to say it. It's like they think they are breaking down some PC walls to fix problems we all know we have. *""Somebody has to say it!""*.

*Maybe* though (just maybe) the general population and the press aren't on some smear campaign, maybe we just genuinely don't '*know what you mean*' and are kind of uncomfortable that you keep bloody bringing up.

Don't think it'd be a United player, Mata was agreed about a week before the deadline, so any deal would have happened. Zaha is one of the few players it could have been, but I don't think he plays centrally enough, and Cardiff wouldn't have got him if our deal was already in place.

Chelsea made signings, and the only suitable player would have been van Ginkel, but he's been injured all season.

Man City? Rodwell may have been an option, particularly if they were waiting on a deal for Fernando, but Pellegrini had said that he didn't expect any departures in January.

Liverpool have several young attacking midfielders - Alberto, Aspas and Teixeira. Alberto is a possible there I guess.

Spurs let Holtby go out on loan, but not until the very last minute. I can't really see them having wanted to let someone like Sigurdsson go out on loan as well, although perhaps Hughton's Spurs connections may have counted for something.

Arsenal were desperate to bring in midfield reinforcements in January, and only brought in Kallstrom very, very late. So potentially they may have been the supplier. Serge Gnabry got some infrequent game time for them, and I could imagine both Arsenal wanting to get him more game time (but being unable to loan him out in case of more injuries), and him having enough Premier League experience for us to be interested.

5/6/7: I spend most of my time in dictionaries (and grew up with dictionaries) to see how the world has becomen more rotten; English has been dead for 1000 years after the Norman Conquest and is not productive in other than compound words and slang; professionals in Commonwealth steal words from other languages, mistranslated, and misapply them amids English talk.  E.g. *dog* does not mean *doghouse* yet *psycho* is expected to mean *psychopath* and *pedo* *pedophile*.  These lackwits cannot respect word boundaries nor the roots' meanings.  Pædo- doesn't mean child-; it means kid-.  Literally it refers to someone who is fed and shares a root with father and food.  A child is someone born, to a parent, a son or dauhter.  A grownup is a child.  A teen is a child but not a kid.  Child in Hellènic is tecno.  A filo is a friend and filia means friendship; it has nothing to do with sex.  Contrast with erastia which means lovership, eros for love, erastès for lover, and eromenos for beloved.  The substantive in a compound goes first.  Therefore a pædofilo is a kidfriend, a kid who is a friend (after boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.); someone who loves kids is a erastopædia.  Like in English, Hellènic doesn't distinguish between love of mind and body and context is important to determine a word's meaning.

""We have confused the real issue of parliamentary democracy, for already there has been a fundamental change. The power of electors over their law-makers has gone, the power of MPs over Ministers has gone, the role of Ministers has changed. The real case for entry has never been spelled out, which is that there should be a fully federal Europe in which we become a province. It hasn't been spelled out because people would never accept it. We are at the moment on a federal escalator, moving as we talk, going towards a federal objective we do not wish to reach. In practice, Britain will be governed by a European coalition government that we cannot change, dedicated to a capitalist or market economy theology. This policy is to be sold to us by projecting an unjustified optimism about the Community, and an unjustified pessimism about the United Kingdom, designed to frighten us in. Jim quoted Benjamin Franklin, so let me do the same: ""He who would give up essential liberty for a little temporary security deserves neither safety nor liberty.""
