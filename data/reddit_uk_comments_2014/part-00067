1. No he's not.
2. Messi came off a two month injury in January and he had another one at the end of last season.  

&gt; Dzeko and Negrado are not good enough to take us to a champions league final

But Lescott, Demichellis, and Nastasic are? Between our shambly backline and our incredible quartet of strikers, you think, from a footballing perspective, that the best thing to do is waste an entire transfer season on Lionel Messi? 

Since you brought it up, Chelsea and Bayern were the last two teams to win the CL. Neither team had an Aguero or a Messi to get them through it. They had (and have) solid backlines and superb midfielders. Between those two categories, we've got one plus an Aguero.

I know he was signed by psv managed by bobby robson there.  He played next to a young eider gudjohnsen, bobby moved to barca took ronaldo with him, who left after like a season to go to inter. I think he had his first big knee injury while at inter, he continued to move to real, then ac then he went to some brazilian club, I think it was corinthians.  Both of his knees were a state by this stage, they were a state by the time he was at real he was overweight even then in comparison to his early career, he still had skill, he cld still beat a player but by the time he went back to brazil his knees were gone but he still was able to score 25 yard screamers.  

In this time I think he went to 4 world cups he was at 94 and didn't play.  98 he had seizures apparently before the final, hes the highest scorer in world cups to date.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; England could quite easily be divided into separate states

I think you missed my point that you can divide it any way you want. But the problem is if they vote as a bloc then it doesn't matter how they are divided. And in general elections they tend to vote similarly, so the effect of federating the UK (which really is a non-starter) would be totally mitigated by the way people here vote.

&gt; I also don't see how a federation would mean that English views would be diminished

Right now English voters make up about 80-85% of the electorate. You can't see how being diminished to a federated share of the vote would be irksome? The point is it gives smaller holdings a greater share of power (even if it isn't a true 1:4 in this case), and that is pretty unpalatable. I'd sooner see the Scots go it alone than let them have a disproportionate voice in politics... especially since I'm fairly confident they'll still be under a fair deal of Westminster control regardless of what they choose in September. The bottom line is, I think at least - and the Westminster gamble, is that they need the UK more than they necessarily accepted.

I really think the Scots have boned themselves on this;

* Choose independence and face getting practically asset stripped by a well and truly irritated UK electorate who will probably push for a zero-tolerance ""not an inch"" negotiating stance. 

* Choose to stay and face a punitive round of cuts, considering that the referendum has done one thing for the Scots -- it has protected them from the full extent of the current governments Austerity Pogrom. It now seems inevitable that whoever wins the 2015 General Election, Labour or Tory, will probably be dishing out a well overdue round of cuts for the Scots... safe in the knowledge they have the authority of the recent referendum.

BNP: 46%

UKIP: 39%

**Ok a few things...**

1. What The Fuck!? Conservative = BNP? I have a very low opinion of Conservative's but not *that* low.

2. I took the test on http://voteforpolicies.org.uk/ a few months ago and scored most highly with Greens and Libdems, Larbor a very distent third and eveyone else in the dust (was a little surprised about the Greens, not so much anything else, that test seemed about right for me)

3. BNP 46, Conservative 46; I can tell that came down to one single very badly weighted question because I'm generally liberal/center on immigration, but I answered the questions on deporting ""foreigners who are considered to be promoting terrorism"" as ""Yes, but only if their human rights will be respected by the country they are deported to"" and I weighted it as ""least important."" Also, was using the word ""foreigners"" as opposed to ""immigrants"" a weighted trap? because I have to admit I didn't notice the first time around.

4. There are just a few questions I answered there as ""most important"" that I know from manifesto or stated policy would near completely disqualify me from voting for... ahem.. *certain* parties.

So I retook the test, and within the margin of error of my own answers I got:

Labor: 95%

Green: 92%

Libdem: 88%

Conservative: 53%

BNP: 21%

UKIP: 21%

Which is still quite off from my actual thinking. (also how are Labor and Conservative *that* different?)

When I got to what you english people call high school, I started playing for the schools team and become a box-to-box midfielder. Went on to play for Brøndby and have played alongside Nicolaj Agger (Dagger's cousin) when he was in the reserves team.

Joined the army and put football aside, and started playing a bit after I got back from mission in the local club at Skive. Got back to my winger role, but played both sides of the wing and also full back from time to time.

Quit the army summer 2013 to study at the university in Odense. Didn't know any people in the town, so I joined up with a series 5 (level 10) side football club and got promoted with them this winter. Got picked up by the 2nd best team in our club and now plays for the series 2 (level 7) side as a left back.

I've been working on my left foot since summer, so I can now comfortably drible and pass with both feet.

I usually ride an MTB, even in the city, and because it is front-sprung with wide wheels it sails over most surface defects without much trouble. However, last week I was riding someone else's road bike through central London when I hit a fairly bad pothole around a sunken drain cover. I was only doing around 8 or 9mph but the front wheel hit the far edge of the hole, stopping the bike dead and sending me tarmac-bound with some force. A week later I still need a crutch to walk more than a couple of dozen metres after narrowly escaping a broken kneecap and I am in a half-arm cast for another couple of weeks with two factures in my wrist. Had it happened in flowing traffic I dread to think what the outcome would have been, but I was lucky enough to have got into the junction that the pothole was in the middle of on the last of a green light, so the traffic behind was held on the red, and I had threee friends with me who helped me get out of the road. 
The bike itself was fine.

While we're on the subject, did you know that if a transport authority (borough or TfL) can prove a pothole wasn't reported to them, any claim made against them for damages or injury caused by that pothole will most likely fail? So, even though it could be busy work if you did every one you found, at least report the most serious potholes, vbecause more successful claimds means there's more chance these dangers will be addressed. One website you can do this on, and check previous reports is http://www.fillthathole.org.uk/

Embarrassingly so. Than I got cancer later that year and stopped playing. But it's not like that stopped me later in life. I simply wasn't good enough.

One of the best moments in high school was during a PE Lesson. I hadn't played football in five years. From age 11 onwards, I'd gotten more into music, literature, drugs, films, and other stuff like that. I was one of the kids that snuck out of school for a smoke during break time. I wore black nail varnish and dyed my hair black, and had two earrings at the top of my left ear. You know...*that* kid.

So. Age 16. During PE we were having a seven a side tournament, and the look on the faces of all the ""jocks"" watching from the sidelines as I completely bossed everyone is something I'll fucking cherish forever. I got a lot of ""I didn't know you could play."" Then the head of PE asked me if I wanted to turn out for the school. Which I declined because ""that's not cool, man."" I wish I had now. High School is all about fitting yourself into one box. And playing football for the school was not a box I was supposed to fit into. 

I know this sounds like a fucking made up after school special, but I swear it's true. One of those rare fucking moments in life where shit just comes perfectly together.

Before that you face the hurdles of getting a deposit, possibly pass a credit check, finding someone who will rent to someone claiming housing benefit, let alone someone unemployed, and being able to afford rent until housing benefit is paid. If you have no income other than JSA that is simply impossible. You get dodgy landlords, but they still want some kind of proof of income, and there are very few nowadays who will tolerate tenants ALREADY on housing benefit, let alone those who will need to make a new claim.

For vulnerable groups there is an obligation of a council to source accommodation, and all the housing provision for homeless people is generally taken up by them.

For single adult men, such as the speaker, there is basically no such provision. They are entirely reliant on charities and hostels, which makes for a very precarious life, and doesn't really afford much of the way of opportunity to build up the things necessary to be able to get into long term accommodation. You can claim housing benefit to cover hostel accommodation *sometimes* but these do not offer long term accommodation, and the inhabitants are definitely homeless even if off the street.

If you are not classed as vulnerable in some fashion, you basically have to find a voluntary sector provider who can look after you while you rebuild your life.

Basically housing benefit is relatively inaccessible to those who are not already in a home.

I am also leaving out other problems, such as benefit delays, sanctions, outright cock ups, and, perhaps most importantly, the fact that housing benefit only covers the whole rent in a small minority of cases.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Very simple. If you are a single white male with no children you are the lowest category of need for social housing, meaning if you fall on hard times, the council wont give you anywhere to live for at least 6 months. By law they are supposed to house everyone, but in reality they put pregnant girls and young families in a B&amp;B for a few days before finding them a house as a 'Grade A' priority, women have to B&amp;B for a few weeks, and men get told to bugger off and get Grade D and have to wait for 6 months living either in tents or staying in a homeless shelter, which requires you to leave every morning with all your stuff and come back next morning, and are first come first served, with in my experience often 10 sleeping places for 200 people in each town.

Now without a place to live the next hassle you have is that the bank freezes your bank account. They get one ""return to sender"" letter and then they instantly freeze your account, any access to it, any funds you may have, and basically lock you out. You might be able to get some money out of it if you have your passport and drivers license (unlikely), but there's no way you can get a job without a bank account, and it's now incredibly hard to get benefits too, because there's huge pressure to get any benefits such as job seekers allowance direct to your bank account nowadays, they don't like giving out postal orders anymore, although it is possible, but time consuming. So now you can't get a job and benefits are a hassle to get, and any benefits you may get are basically worthless, £74 a week, might buy you a little food.

I used to help out at a homeless shelter outside Chichester, this is how I know most of this. Most of the homeless people (99%) where white single males, usually following a divorce. Most were university educated (60%), had children etc, most didn't take drugs or drink alcohol (80%), you get tested twice a day when you use local homeless charities anyway, such as support groups, food  charities or shelters, and most have a zero tolerance policy, especially the shelters for obvious reasons. Once you're in this situation it's incredibly hard to get any kind of work, even manual labour, because most people didn't do manual work before they fell on hard times, or are too old for physical labour. It's been like this for decades, so don't think the most recent government has anything to do with it. I've seen doctors, architects, lecturers, all kinds of people homeless, you're far closer than you realise.

My mother was made redundant about 10 years ago, that meant we were no longer able to pay rent. The government even at that time would not pay the entirety of the rent, which was pretty cheap for the size of house we needed and the area in which we lived due to the fact we had lived there for a while and the rent was never increased.
My Dad doesn't work due to a myriad of health issues.

This left us with 2 months to find somewhere else to live. We were on the council house list but the waiting times are obscene in the area I grew up in.
My mother tried her hardest to find somewhere to live, while trying her hardest to find a job.
Neither of which were happening. 

We came within 1 day of being homeless, the local government could offer us a few weeks in a bed and breakfast but that was it. Luckily, literally on the final day we were contacted by a housing association who put us in a house. 

It was a drastic situation due to the area in which we lived. High unemployment, few jobs and even less affordable housing. 

But my point is this:
If a family of 3 came within 1 day of being officially homeless, and a few weeks away from not having a roof over their head - how easy could it be for someone who's living alone, pay check to pay check to end up homeless?

And once you've not got a roof over your head, it's bloody hard to get into a position where you can have one again.

Clothing: I'd recommend a waterproof jacket for any part of the UK. The south of England/London is the warmest part of the country, so you're not going to need excessive amounts of warm clothing, but it's colder than the Philippines. 

Food: it depends on what you're used to. Most supermarkets sell a pretty broad range of vegetables, meat, grains etc. I wouldn't rely on instant/ready meals, because they're generally pretty unhealthy (too much salt/sugar/saturated fat). Ready meals also tend to be pretty expensive per unit weight compared to freshly-cooked meals.

Lotions: I have no idea.

Medicines: you should register with your local GP and dentist on arrival. Most serious medicines (antibiotics, treatments for serious illnesses) are prescription only.

How much money: London is the most expensive part of the country by a large margin, mainly due to housing costs. How much is your rent per month?

I sincerely was hoping someone would tell me why the claims made in this film are erroneous, but instead I'm left feeling even more disheartened than before.

Assuming Spurs finish their last 10 games of the season in the form they've had for their most recent 10 games (7W 1D 2L), they finish on 75 points. Which means we need 16 points from our last 10 games to finish above them - 5 wins and a draw from ten matches. 

I'd note that expecting Spurs to actually get 7W 1D 2L from a run of fixtures that includes Chelsea (A), Arsenal (H), Liverpool (A) and Southampton (H) is pretty generous, especially given how inconsistent their performances have been against sides near the bottom of the table.

&gt;[""Our proposals, in fact, are a camouflaged transfer of sovereignty, and the Argentine foreign minister knows this, but the junta will not accept it.""](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577313852502105454)

Only after the Argentines pissed them off did they reluctantly stay neutral but the reason they wanted to back the Argentinians was because of a solid trade relationship. Trade &gt; National Sovereignty apparently. 

The US never became a economic superpower by being nice. We only paid them back for the money they lent us in the World Wars in 2006, loans signed on pretty unfavourable terms at a time when the UK was basically bankrupt - because apparently 'saving you guys from the Nazi's' is only OK if your getting paid to do it. They enact protectionist economic policies all the time ensuring that US companies receive contracts instead of European ones - [SNCF is proposing a desperately needed new high-speed rail link in the US](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/7/5480714/the-holocausts-legacy-threatens-sncf-france-us-rail-projects) and but plan is being blocked because some politicians in Maryland just remembered that SNCF ferried Jews to concentration camps and thus should pay reparations to American Jews. In the meantime a US company can bid and get the contract and jobs can stay in the US rather than go to France. [/u/SavannaJeff explains this pretty well in /r/europe](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z). Of course they ignore that IBM made the admin system for the camps and help manage the camps - that apprently will go unpunished. 

Over French opposition to Iraq the US government stoked anti-French sentiment and the House introduced bills aimed at hurting the French economy which luckily never passed. See also Freedom Fries - that clever name-changing idea was not by some opinionated salesman but by the Chief Administrator of the House of Representatives and aimed at punishing a supposed ally for not shutting up and doing what they were told. 

The fact is the US has never once genuinely taken the moral high-ground or valued friendship over money or US interests if they were at hand - now we haven't exactly done so either but I would suggest neither side get up on their high horse. Yet somehow when ever another country, ally or not, follows the US example it's a betrayal. Such hypocritical criticism would be utterly hilarious if it wasn't being seriously suggested by a mainstream paper. You can look at all this any way you like - good, tough economic policy: certainly. A reason to ask for loyalty or friendship: not so much.

&gt;[Great Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) was officially neutral throughout the [American Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War), 1861–65. Elite opinion tended to favour [the Confederacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America), while public opinion tended to favour the United States. Large scale trade continued in both directions with the United States, with the Americans shipping grain to Britain while Britain sent manufactured items and munitions. Immigration continued into the United States. British trade with the Confederacy was limited, with a little cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small [blockade runners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_runners_of_the_American_Civil_War). The Confederate strategy for securing independence was largely based on the hope of military intervention by Britain and France, which didn't happen; intervention would have meant war with the United States. A serious diplomatic dispute with the United States erupted over the ""[Trent Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Affair)"" in 1861; it was resolved peacefully in a few months.

&gt;

&gt;**John Scot Barrowman** (born 11 March 1967) is a Scottish-American actor, singer, dancer, presenter and writer who holds both British and American citizenship. Born in [Glasgow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow), Scotland, he emigrated to the United States with his family in 1975. Encouraged by his high school teachers, Barrowman studied performing arts at the [United States International University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_International_University) in [San Diego](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego) before landing the role of [Billy Crocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crocker) in [Cole Porter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter)'s Anything Goes at London's [West End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre).

&gt;Since his debut in professional theatre, Barrowman has played lead roles in various musicals both in the West End and on Broadway, including Miss Saigon, The Phantom of the Opera, Sunset Boulevard and Matador. After appearing in [Sam Mendes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mendes)' production of The Fix, he was nominated for the 1998 [Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Musical) and, in the early 2000s, returned to the role of Billy Crocker in the revival of Anything Goes. His most recent West End credit was in the 2009 production of La Cage aux Folles.

&gt;Aside his theatrical career, Barrowman has appeared in various films including the musical biopic De-Lovely (2004) and musical comedy The Producers (2005). Before venturing into British television, he featured in the American television dramas Titans and Central Park West but he is better known for his acting and presenting work for the [BBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) that includes his work for [CBBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBC) in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme Tonight's the Night, and his [BAFTA Cymru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Cymru)-nominated role of [Captain Jack Harkness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harkness) in the science fiction series Doctor Who and Torchwood.

In small print the letter clarified this was only the case if you watched live TV on your laptop, which very few people did. Most UK students knew this was scam, but I saw so many scared international students handing over their information and paying fines because they didn't know they hadn't actually broken any local laws.

Worst part was, the enforcement officers KNEW these students didn't have to pay. When I confronted one of them after he had extorted the floor above me, his response was: ""If they feel they should have to pay, they should.""

""The BBC are too political (liberal-left)"" - Thomas Pride

and it's right leaning bias...

""Except that in reality the bias at the BBC is in favour of right wing politics."" - meemoe


In my mind, if it can be accused of both at the same time, it's doing something very right indeed. Quite frankly, the BBC produces a wide range of well produced quality programming which at some point or other will cover pretty much the entire market. The only problem is that this market is very selfish and doesn't want money wasted on other peoples requirements.


Lets put cost into focus...


* BBC = ~£12pm (no non-optional extras, no install fees, no contract, mandatory for live TV)
* Virgin Media = ~£32pm (cheapest option I can find inc. discounts, internet + phone, not including installation, 18 month contact)
* Sky = ~£21 (Basic TV, offering little/no more than BBC/Freeview)


^Not ^going ^to ^quote ^sources, ^simply ^grabbed ^prices ^off ^relevant ^Virgin/Sky ^websites ^&amp; ^simple ^maths... ^may ^be ^cheaper ^options ^&amp; ^wrong)

So, if you choose to have Virgin or Sky, stop wining about having to pay the license fee and suck it up. If you can't find even one offering from the BBC that is watchable, then it's unlikely there'll be anything on any other service.

The article discussed Gerrard in the destroyer role, which is true in some points, but Gerrard shouldn't be regarded as a destroyer. I would consider Gerrard as a mix between a regista and a carrier, in which he has the ability to spot a pass from long range or move the ball forward allowing the break up of the opposition's formation to exploit gaps and runs.

The way we need to look at it is this: we need to utilize Gerrard and Lucas given the opposition's tactics and not on the pair's forms. Gerrard could have a great game one day and be rubbish the next, because he wasn't utilized correctly.

To those who say it would exclude those who can't afford the subscription, I'd point out that the current system supposedly excludes those who can't afford the licence fee. To those who say we all enjoy at least some BBC output, presumably we'd all continue to subscribe. If it's as great as you say it is, the public ought to be lining up to hand over their cash. It'd also put an end to any and all accusations of bias. If you think the Guardian is too left wing or the Telegraph too right wing, instead of whining, you can just not buy the paper.

I also find it strange that many of the same people who support piracy also support the TV licence. Surely the same arguments being used in favour of piracy can be used against the TV licence?

I personally think the idea of having such people is an anachronism - there are far better ways of enforcing the licence - for example by going back to encrypting content and only having your viewing card turned on once you've paid, and turned off when the licence has expired. It's a shame that the BBC never required Freeview/Freesat to have the ability to add encryption hardware, but I feel that this is the route that should be pursued.

I feel uncomfortable with the idea of having a special class of ""enforcement officers"" with any significant power, whose job is simply to act as the BBC's special police force.

&gt; Whilst the license is a tax with criminal penalties there are good grounds for oversight and regulation - making this a civil matter is just like a shrug of the shoulders and saying ""let's leave it to the magistrates"".

I can't say I agree with keeping the status quo. Failing to pay the BBC shouldn't carry any of the risks involved with it being a criminal matter.

So, over a thousand years of tradition, unity and burning desire to be known as ""not part of England"" See the declaration of Arbroath, where we asked God Himself (or at least as close as we could get to Him) to tell everyone that Scotland was different and separate from England. 

To think that this cast iron tradition could be destroyed by the Act of Union (which was wildly unpopular at the time) is simply ludicrous, it can certainly destroy the animosity between the two, but never the notion of distinction. 

And, frankly, I would feel very uneasy if any Westminster government that attempted to do this. Irrationally, perhaps, but uneasy all the same.

Edit: in short, the view that ""Scots"" are an arbitrary group is a very revisionist view. The concept of being ""British"" is far more arbitrary and artificial than either being Scottish or English. This explains why the the Union of Crowns was such a hard sell, for both Edinburgh *and* London, James VI/I was only able to get Westminster to agree to it with promises that England would be the ""husband"" and Scotland the ""wife"" (wives back then being somewhere between slaves and housemaids).

This point of English dominance in the very earliest roots of the Union it also explains how ""Britishness"" and ""Englishness"" appears largely synonymous to most non-English, all around the world. Because, to make the Union more palatable to the most powerful component (England) it had to be sold as an English annexation of Scotland in all but name.

* There is a vicious and unsubstantiated rumour here that all Canadians insist on apologising for something once every 5 seconds ;-). If this is true, (and I don't know if it is or not) then increase the interval to once a minute and you should fit right in.
* The UK is in general warmer than Canada, although that might not hold true for the summers if you live in southern Canada. I would advise bringing some sort of warm coat just in case we have a bad winter or for when you get used to the temperature.
* Definitely bring a few raincoats - there is nothing worse than having to put on a soaked raincoat to go back out the day after it got soaked.

**History:**

Evidence of seasonal human habitation around the area that is now Birmingham dates back 500,000 years, but the area was first intensively settled in the bronze age. 

Birmingham proper dates from the anglo-saxon era and the name derives from the old English word *Beormingahām*, meaning the home of an Anglian tribe of that name. However, by the time of the Domesday book, Birmingham was one of the poorest settlements in the area, being valued at a total cost of 20 shillings.

Birmingham began it's growth in 1166, when the Lord of the Manor of Birmingham was granted a charter to hold a market at his castle, and he followed this by creating a market town on his estate. This prospered due to the massive population growth of England, which led to marginally useful land like the Birmingham Plateau becoming economically viable to farm. This in turn led to Birmingham becoming home to a large number of skilled workers and craftspeople.

During the 16th Century Birmingham's access to coal and iron ore led to the establishment of metalworking industries and by the time of the English Civil war in 1642 Birmingham was known for it's small arms manufacturing industries. 

Birmingham entered the industrial revolution earlier than other cities in the UK due to the large numbers of skilled workers and high-tech industries that were based there. This also meant that Birmingham's revolution was not driven by increased production like so many other areas, but was driven by high levels of inventiveness, helping to fuel the revolution elsewhere. For instance, in 1709 the first blast furnace to use coke instead of coal was developed in Birmingham, and in 1732 the roller spinning system was invented in Birmingham, leading to the mechanised cotton industry.

Perhaps the most important invention to come from Birmingham though is the industrial steam engine, first developed by James Watt and Matthew Boulton in 1776, eclipsing the petty little event that happened in a minor colony that sits somewhere to your south. ;-)  
But in all seriousness, the steam engine has done wonders for the world.

Birmingham became politically prominent in the UK in the early 1800s due to the political reforms which brought the country to the brink of another civil war. This led in 1867 for voting rights to be extended to the working class.

Birmingham is also the location for the invention of the postage stamp and the post office in 1839, plastic in , and was the terminus of the first two long-distance railway lines, in 1837 and 1838.

Birmingham also benefited from an extensive canal network, enabling raw materials to come in and goods to leave at a low price before the invention of the railways. In 1889 Birmingham was granted City Status, having by this point become the second-largest population centre in the UK. 

During WWII Birmingham was heavily bombed, due to it's industrial power. As a result it has a large amount of post-war development, some of it in the form of council estates (project housing) and these were constructed in the 1950s/60s/70s in the form of tower blocks. These were anticipated to be the end to social problems by providing people with easy access to local resources but the resources never came, and the areas quickly descended into poorly maintained, high-crime areas that people try and avoid.

More recently, the bull ring shopping centre, destroyed by bombing in the war, has been rebuilt, and many other urban redevelopments have taken place.",0,1394278033,null,0,false,0,cfxfsut,t3_1ztnev,t1_cfxfsut,t3_1ztnev,null,1432710711,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

Understand that War Doc's last memory was when he was ABOUT to use ""The Moment"" to destroy Gallifrey. 
Everything from the 9th Doctor's first appearance to the beginning of ""Day of The Doctor"" was done with the assumed memory that The Doctor (War Doctor) used ""The Moment"" and destroyed Gallifrey, and then set a Time Lock, blocking the parts of the Time Vortex that would allow someone to travel through time to (or from) the planets affected by the Time War, before or during the war.
""Kill everything, and then prevent any survival through time travel.""

In *""The End Of Time""* we find out that they learn of The Doctor's plan to destroy them and time lock them, so they devise a plan to travel BACK in time and plant the ""drums"" message in The Master, so that he could aid them in Traveling FORWARD to him, (and bringing Gallifrey with them) through the time lock, in an attempt to break the time lock, and destroy the time vortex itself, ending time and evolving the Time Lords to ascended beings.  The difference of NOT using ""The Moment"" is that this effort was moot.  No Destruction + No Time Lock = No paradox = The time Vortex would probably have survived and The Time War would have continued in our star system.

This all happens AFTER The Doctor steals The Moment, but before much of what we see in *""Day of The Doctor.""*  The Time Lords are acting proactively.  They believe that The Doctor is about to destroy them all with The Moment.  The Story of *""Day of The Doctor""* is The Doctor making a different choice.

Keep in mind that The Doctor's timeline, Gallifrey's timeline, and Earth's timeline aren't the same, so while The War Doctor is making his way through the desert with The Moment, The Council Of Time Lords are teleporting to Earth and dealing with The Master/10th Doctor. 

When High Command make that quote, they are indeed referring to the Council's plan to escape before ""The Moment"" is deployed.

What confuses me about the episode, is this ""assumed memory"" of a Destruction/Time Lock.  Since Doctors 9, 10, and 11 traveled TO Gallifrey at the end of the Time War, when they believed it to be time locked. (I'm guessing that 10 and 11 knew from seeing ""Granddad"" that travel to and from Gallifrey was now possible?)

Crossing his own time stream means that only the freshest Doctor retains a memory of the events.

Would this really happen? I haven't seen any solid predictions of potential outcomes, but I feel like outside of my bubble of political thought on Reddit and at university, a significant majority of UK people I talk to do detest the EU because they just associate it with ridiculous headlines. I consider my parents centre-left and they both indicated they'd vote to leave. They aren't rabid UKIP obsessives - they're smart, well-balanced, reasonable individuals, and they still want to cast a vote to walk away. Can the UK political establishment really just ignore that sentiment indefinitely and hope it goes away?

Think about the average taxi driver, or the average builder, talking about the EU (that sounds incredibly elitist of me, but I'm not trying to be - just to acknowledge a widespread popular position) - heck, even I was pretty anti-EU as a teenager because I believed the media stories on its 'meddling' and saw no benefits to membership.  
It's only with the Internet's influence, as I've got older, that I've recognised that as propaganda and realised how much we quietly benefit (free movement is a brilliant thing at the end of the day - just ask my fully-integrated German aunt, any UK professional who's on the Continent for work, or anybody who's retired to the sun; really easy travel for business and pleasure; guaranteed free trade, a HUGE one; better international relations; the EU commission, parliament and ECHR providing an additional check and balance outside some of Westminster's dafter moments, protecting us by reining in ridiculous government ideas like abandoning any attempt to reduce air pollution in cities, yeah lung disease!...; the list goes on)

I think it's more likely that Cameron will not win the next election and his manifesto promise is hot air, but I also think the referendum is an idea that won't go away. Voting to leave is an increasingly popular notion that nobody's really fighting against. If there is a referendum I fear for the outcome - but how is refusing to hold one good democracy?

That's fair enough, but it's not quite the point I'm making.  I think a lot of people as they get older (and especially when they leave the comfort zone of full time education) end up sacrificing some of their values in order to get by in the modern world.  

Simple example: I wish we could cut the number of cars, and the pollution they cause (green issue) but recently in order to find work I had to move to a company that is in a location that isn't near a public transport route and therefore need to drive (practical reality).

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"* &gt;it's a myth that people move to the right as they get older

* &gt;the older generations in many countries are strongly right wing

* &gt; and always have been.

Those three things can't all be possible, unless there's some highly unlikely mortality or migration patterns.

The older generations were once the younger generations. So the strongly right wing older generations, must once have been strongly right wing younger generations.

Here's what I think is happening:

Society has been moving leftwards over at least a hundred years. An individuals ethics and beliefs are less prone to change than the society they live in, after all ""progress is made one funeral at a time"".

This means young left wingers campaigning for change leftwards, can end up being left behind by society. First they stop campaigning for change, then they may begin feeling like things have gone to far, now they're a reactionary who is right wing, all while still retaining pretty much the same ethics and beliefs they once did.

So depending on how you survey, study, and analyse people's political views, you could come to two very different conclusions about whether they're growing right wing or not.

This would also work the other way, particularly since Thatcher's reforms, in the UK we've been moving rightwards economically. This will be leaving an increasing number of those young right wingers feeling like we've gone to far, and they will begin showing left wing tendencies.",0,1394283169,null,0,false,0,cfxgjzb,t3_1ztrit,t1_cfxgjzb,t1_cfxf8yu,null,1432711065,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

More than the current nothing? A UK version of the Magnitsky act would be a start - freeze Russian MPs (who voted for military action and annexation of Ukraine) assets in UK, and take away their visas. At the EU level, push for economic sanctions and for personal sanctions against MPs. The UK is a signatory to the Brussels memorandum - so far, it's showing that its word is worth less than the paper on which it's written. England's contribution to the conflict so far has been to have some gov't functionary expose secret documents stating that UK won't consider sanctions yet.

In the long run, the UK needs to free itself of Russian oligarchs' corrupt loot. If it doesn't do so, its political decisions will increasingly be controlled by Putin.

A European country has been partitioned under a false pretext, with more partitions to come. Things are not working out well at all.

&gt; What do you mean by that?

""Ukraine"" have requested Russia's assistance. Regardless of potential corruption, this did happen. If we provide military assistance to Ukraine how is this any less questionable than the Russian assistance? If we act more aggressively we'll just give the Russians what they want, in the form of more propaganda. Russian news is already playing ""Nazi Europe invades Ukraine. Brave Russian soldiers come to its aid."", if we actually do move in what would it look like?

&gt; How? He has annexed Crimea, and has now moved into mainland Ukraine.

He has troops in Crimea, but what does that mean when there are no shots being fired? I mean what has Russia done besides inconveniencing some people getting from A to B? The only footage I've seen of anybody being forcefully denied movement within Ukraine was at the hands of Pro-Russian Crimean citizens, trying to stop Ukrainian wives taking food to their husbands at military bases. Which incidentally the Russian troops later helped pass through a window.

Currently our coefficient stands at 58.328 points. 

Here's the league route seeded teams from this year's CL and their coefficient points:

* Arsenal - 111.578
* Lyon - 94.03
* Schalke - 95.07
* Milan - 97.987
* Zenit St Petersburg - 71.79  

So yeah, almost without a shadow of a doubt we would be in the unseeded pot, and what's more, I wouldn't fancy playing any of those teams (not that Arsenal would be an option of course). 

EDIT: However, we could also be drawn against one of the seeded teams that qualified for the playoff round through one of the earlier rounds, so for shits and giggles let's look at them. Last year these were:

* Basel - 69.4
* Celtic - 36.8
* Steaua Bucarest - 39.45
* Viktoria Pfizen - 38.7
* Dinamo Zagreb - 23.9

If we drew any of those or similar I think we'd be fine, with the possible exception of Basel, and Celtic on a very good day.

Anyway, hopefully this will all be academic :)

All types of sanctions have been discussed and discussed again. Nobody is asking anyone to throw out the rulebook. The request is to move quickly. How can it take the EU longer to impose sanctions than it takes Putin to annex an area the size of a country? There is intentional stalling by various Western European parties in the process of punishing Russia.

&gt; ""Ukraine"" have requested Russia's assistance.

I have no idea why ""Ukraine"" is in parentheses or what assistance you are referring to. What happened in Crimea was that Russia sent in military forces, and took over parliament at gunpoint. A politician/gangster known as ""goblin"" who got 5% of the vote last time he ran for office appointed himself Crimean PM and started making moves on behalf of Russia to annex Crimea to Russia. The Russian Duma passed a bunch of laws that defy the Budapest Memorandum and international law, permitting them to annex Crimea. That is what has happened.

&gt; If we provide military assistance to Ukraine how is this any less questionable than the Russian assistance?

Again, I am not talking about military assistance. I'm talking about sanctions, which should have already been implemented.

&gt; Russian news is already playing ""Nazi Europe invades Ukraine. Brave Russian soldiers come to its aid."", if we actually do move in what would it look like?

They are telling one lie after another, and have thoroughly discredited themselves. The only world leader that has supported Russia is Syria's Assad.

&gt; He has troops in Crimea, but what does that mean when there are no shots being fired? I mean what has Russia done besides inconveniencing some people getting from A to B?

It means Russia has stolen the territory from another country. They are currently setting up checkpoints at the border, and have placed landmines. Russian troops have also been seen placing checkpoints in mainland Ukraine.

&gt; The only footage I've seen of anybody being forcefully denied movement within Ukraine was at the hands of Pro-Russian Crimean citizens

Reporters and OSCE observers have been blocked (and beaten in the case of the former). The Russian ""self-defense"" forces have been identified by the Russian press as Russian soldiers or Russian tourists/provocateurs. The Ukrainian military and naval units have been blocked. Bases have been stormed. Critical infrastructure has been disabled.

&gt; ""Annexed"" is tending towards the same propaganda that Russia is handing out.

A military takeover was executed, an illegal Crimean PM has forced an illegal vote to join Russia, Russia has created a legal framework for incorporating neighboring territories, and in a week, Crimea will formally be a part of Russia. ""Annexed"" is exactly what has happened.

By far the most frustrating game I've ever seen, 12-13 years later and I still get annoyed about it, if you have seen the game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!

Faryd Mondragón, their keeper had one of those 'best games ever' things that keepers tend to do when playing us

when I say he was the only think that kept them in the game he was the ONLY thing, we had close attempt after close attempt denied by him alone, if anybody else had been in goal we would have won it maybe 7-nil. to add insult to injury they had a ball cleared off the line and Gerrard got carried off injured

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; I was just wondering why you thought this had to be some sort of loss of support for the BBC from the Conservatives, instead of a potentially sensible decision.

Mostly ""mah feels"" to be honest, although I doubt you'll ever find me declaring wallpaper politics as ""sensible"", and that is practically everything the ~~government does~~ *two-party system stands for*. It's practically the definition of toryism, in fact - let's throw the proletariat a bone, so we can carry on enjoying steak.

(was decor vs culinary an unintelligible mixing of metaphors?)

Anyway… I guess I feel like this is a withdrawal of support because it reduces the seriousness of license dodging, and it loosens how tightly license enforcement is tied to the state.

It feels like the tories (small-t and large, if you insist) are hanging the Beeb out to dry and saying ""nothing to do with us"".

I agree that this *seems* very sensible and reasonable (except for… TV licensing legislation based on over-the-air reception over two decades after the invention of the internet browser), but it just feels very mundane and (as I said before) not really fixing any real problems and just not very radical in general.

I feel (that word again) that there are going to be unintended consequences of this - it wouldn't at all surprise me if ([as described by someone else here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1zvj2n/dodging_tv_licence_will_not_be_a_crime/cfxf9g1)) license enforcement escalates as a result of this and then there's a crisis in a few years that ""BBC's debt collectors hound to death blind man with no telly"" and then this will be used as an opportunity to somehow hang the Beeb further out to dry.

&gt; I don't agree at all with any attempt to force the licence on people who simply have internet connections but have no desire to consume BBC content.

Meh, all taxes are inherently about making people pay for things that they might never use.

You pay for the fire-brigade, even though your house has never burned down, and they rescue people who are careless with matches and who ""don't deserve it"". If you're in foster care or have a child who is disabled then you will consume a disproportionate amount of the state's resources.

Things that we pay for by tax are the things that are for the public good, but which would not be profitable on their own.

In the past, we declared that the BBC offered services that were so worthy of supporting that everyone with a TV should pay for them, even if they only watched ITV.

You can argue against this, all you like, but I don't really see that it's much of a stretch to say that the should BBC produce services so worthy of supporting that everyone with an internet connection should pay for them, even if you only watch YouTube and read wikipedia.

If you're subscribing to Sky now and object to paying the TV license because you don't watch the BBC then your arguments are wholly consistent, but it's not a niche of political debate that interests me.",0,1394288569,null,0,1394312680,0,cfxhmxg,t3_1zvj2n,t1_cfxhmxg,t1_cfxg1ba,null,1432711577,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Okay, I'm not sure what you expect here. Do you think they're consciously delaying placing sanctions? Or do you think that they shouldn't ensure the legality of their actions before enforcing them? The latter can be paraphrased as throwing out the rulebook, the former while possible doesn't appear to be supported by evidence.

&gt; I have no idea why ""Ukraine"" is in parentheses

Because the Ukraine that that requested Russian assistance was the same administration that caused tens of thousands to take to the streets in protest. [Then shortly after requesting Russian intervention, he left the country](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26427848).  So, yes, I used quotes since the Ukraine did make that request, but it was also the same Ukraine that had caused those riots.

As for them instating a new prime minister, that has the power to secede Crimea to Russia. I can walk in to your house, say I'm the Prime Minister of your house, and give it away. That doesn't mean anybody except myself actually recognises that transaction. Time will tell if anybody does recognise that, but I imagine there's a potential for civil unrest if any of those actions are not reversed.

&gt; A military takeover was executed

Yes, but to maintain that they will have to occupy the country indefinitely since the second they leave there's a good chance that there will be further riots. Again, I could go to your house and make believe that it's mine, but once I leave who owns the house? The only way what Russia has done will be of any consequence is if Ukraine's people take it as fact.

&gt; He was known to defend the sovereignty of nations against foreign aggressors.

As for the Budapest Memorandum, do you think military action in the Ukraine will solve anything? The country will turn in to a crater, many people will lose their lives and there's a good chance it would be a catalyst for a world war. If we let it play out politically instead there's a strong chance that it could turn out favourably for Ukraine. And if it doesn't that sucks, but Russia's word will be meaningless and going back to your impatience about the sanctions.

But what the UK has agreed to is besides the point. You said Churchill was rolling over in his grave, yet Churchill sat at a table with the Russians and agreed they could administer the countries that they liberated.

Welcome to uni mate, most of the faculty are there cause they're good at their subject not cause they're good at teaching it. Again, you got a problem with that take it up with UoE for prioritising research over teaching.

HOw are they actually buttfucking you? Show me how this adversely affects you're life. As my partner pointed out, it actually affects her less than picketing. 

If the faculty is picketing the library and she feels to pressured to go in to the library, she still has to do the work but has to do it without using the library.

As long as you do the work and get it in on time who the fuck cares if you get the marks back a late?

my point was (directed at /u/bonfireheart ) anyone who uses the 'I'm paying a lot of money to have my degree from this university' argument should probably be checking their fucking privileges when telling others how they ought to be going about getting the pay they deserve.

It went downhill after the First World War, as London expanded, the wealthy moved further out, and the large houses tended to be sub-divided into flats.  In World War II, Brockley had the misfortune of lying directly beneath the main flight path of German bombers trying to bomb the London docks.  Brockley was heavily bombed.

After the war, some of these bomb sites were re-developed in the particularly cheap and nasty style of post war council housing, which was all that an impoverished Britain could afford to build at the time.

Today, Brockley seems to be up and coming again.  The re-vitalization of the whole East End and Docklands area of London has helped Brockley, as has the extension of the East London line, in 2010, giving Brockley better transport connections.

true,Robbo124,null,null,"&gt; Do you think they're consciously delaying placing sanctions? Or do you think that they shouldn't ensure the legality of their actions before enforcing them?

Yes, they are consciously delaying sanctions (as the leaked memo shows - they do not want to apply sanctions ""yet""), and the sanctions would be within the legal framework - as I said, personal sanctions have already been imposed by the US through the Magnitsky act. The EU has more or less put in a framework for the sanctions, but is holding off on actually applying it. Economic sanctions are more than justified as well, when one country invades another.

The article I referenced beautifully lays out why the UK is delaying sanctions, and may not want to impose them at all due to excess influence of largely stolen Russian money.

&gt; Because the Ukraine that that requested Russian assistance was the same administration that caused tens of thousands to take to the streets in protest. Then shortly after requesting Russian intervention, he left the country. So, yes, I used quotes since the Ukraine did make that request, but it was also the same Ukraine that had caused those riots.

You're not referring to Ukraine, but to Yanukovich, a deposed president, who only Putin currently recognizes (and yet somehow, Putin has said that Yanukovich has no political future - kind of having it both ways). The government of Ukraine is the parliament (same as it was during Yanukovich, but the worst Party of Regions MPs have fled/deserted their posts), along with a provisional administration. Russia seems to be the only country that upholds Yanukovich while denying the provisional govt's legitimacy.

&gt; Time will tell if anybody does recognise that, but I imagine there's a potential for civil unrest if any of those actions are not reversed.

From a legal point of view, you've got a point, and that's a part of the point that Ukraine's provisional govt is arguing. However, from a practical point of view, Russia now owns Crimea, and the window to prevent it seems to have passed. There is still a chance to take action before they take over mainland Ukraine territory.

&gt; Again, I could go to your house and make believe that it's mine, but once I leave who owns the house?

If you went into my house and did such a thing, there is a legal framework in place to punish you. If you do not leave, you will be forcibly moved and punished. There's an international legal framework to address what Russia is doing - we seem to agree that it should be used, but disagree on the time frame. The international community doesn't need force, but sanctions to accomplish the eviction of Russia from Crimea, and time is of the essence.

&gt; As for the Budapest Memorandum, do you think military action in the Ukraine will solve anything?

For the third time, I am not talking about military action. The BM only talks about protecting Ukraine's territorial integrity, not necessarily through military action.

&gt; If we let it play out politically instead there's a strong chance that it could turn out favourably for Ukraine.And if it doesn't that sucks, but Russia's word will be meaningless and going back to your impatience about the sanctions.

""Impatience"" implies that I'm being irrational. I am advocating quick action due to the practical fact that Russia may militarily occupy more areas, or possibly all of Ukraine, and will be almost impossible to dislodge. Take a look at Chechnya. The public does not want to be a part of Russia, but they have been brutalized into accepting the situation.

Crimea is dependent on the rest of Ukraine for water, electricity, communications, etc. There's almost no way that Russia can take over Crimea and stop there.

The EU is basically saying, let's ""see what happens"" while watching someone get enveloped in quicksand. Putin's entire strategy hinges on the world not reacting, or reacting too slowly.

&gt; Churchill sat at a table with the Russians and agreed they could administer the countries that they liberated.

In today's case, the Russians would be analogous to the Germans, rather than being liberators of anything.

BTW - this is what Russia is doing to Crimea's border right now - https://twitter.com/EvgenyFeldman/status/442277835302916097/photo/1

It's certainly worth trying.

True enough about it being several years of employment and experience.

Re: The qualified teacher route.


I'm considering teacher training myself for Primary. I currently teach abroad. I'm having a difficult time deciding though due to various downsides about the job - a big one is the initial investment though. £9,000 minus whatever grants are given for the course, plus not being able to work or receive benefits throughout that year while paying for living expenses and travel costs. There may be some good grants though, as maths.

Some people flunk out during training. Some quit after one year. Some after three. Some after five. Some continue for the rest of their life. If there's enough time put into it, then there's a definite return on the original investment of money and time. If not, then it's a lot of money down the drain.

I looked at a few quickly and they all required 2:1 degrees anyway. Not sure if all do, but it seems like a good number do.

What to bring; you'll be able to find just about everything in London, so anything you'd take on holiday (couldn't do without for the few days it takes you to find it) mostly.  
What clothes; a few pairs of jeans, some t-shirts and warm-ish sweaters, a waterproof coat if you have one. April time mostly feels about 10-15^o Celsius and wet so bring for that.  
Food; you'll be able to get pretty much everything very easily, for the first few days while you get your feet, look for supermarkets (Tesco/Morrisons/Co-Operative/Sainsburys/Lidl/Aldi are the big ones), which will offer large ranges of produce/tinned foods, including 'world foods' (imported products from various countries) and corner stores, which will offer basics. London also has a lot of specialist stores (Korean / Japanese / etc), which import from home countries of overseas people living in London and sell food from those countries at a good (cheap) price. You'll be fine to get through the first week without bringing instant meals, every supermarket has some form of microwave / quick oven meals, and basic ingredients (pasta/potatoes, vegetables, some sort of meat, canned beans, eggs, milk; at minimum).  
For lotions and chapstick, look online for your nearest Boots or Superdrug (superdrug is cheaper, boots have more selection). If you're more picky, look for your nearest Body Shop, they're more specialist for lotions/bath stuff but more expensive.  
Boots and superdrug are both pharmacies so anything that you can get over the counter (cold/flu medicines, condoms, aspirin) can be bought there. You can also get prescriptions filled there. Anywhere calling itself a pharmacy or chemist can fill your prescription and will have most over the counter medication available.  
Generally for food you, it will depend on what you're buying, if you can buy when things are on sale and in larger amounts, you can live on £50 a month by yourself (just for food) without a problem, but it increases the more you buy in small amounts or if you buy less common things (specialty fruits/spices).  
I don't know much of Filipino food, but look for Asian grocery stores which often have 10kg bags of rice, and sometimes have cheap vegetables. Seafood is generally expensive, chicken and pork are much cheaper meats. For vegetables in general, look for small greengrocers which specialize in fruits/vegetables and will often sell in bundles or by weight, so you only buy what you need. London also has lots of markets, where you may be able to get specialty foods or larger quantities of food for better prices. There are a few stores in London, listed[ in here](http://www.filipinouk.co.uk/forum/showthread.php/4271-Asian-Filipino-Food-amp-Supplies) that may have things you want food wise.  
You can get cheap clothes at Primark (t-shirts £4 - £10, jeans £10) (but often not the best quality) and slightly less cheap but a bit better quality at H&amp;M / New Look (t-shirts £6 - £15, jeans £15 - £25). Sports clothes are usually cheap at JD Sports / Sports Direct.  
Be prepared, at least mentally, that you could get to London and it could be overcast with light rain, almost constantly for two weeks, but that it could be brilliantly sunny (for the UK) with sudden rain. You might want to buy a small extendable umbrella, it can rain very suddenly.  
And rent will be pretty expensive, like £500 per month for a room with shared kitchen/bathroom sort of expensive. Hope this helps.",0,1394293872,null,0,false,0,cfxj2ka,t3_1zujxj,t1_cfxj2ka,t3_1zujxj,null,1432712305,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

 Once you earn a decent salary, after say 8-10 years, you will be pushed out in favour of a new recruit who will get half your salary and so save the school budget money.

But, in OP's case, if the choice is unemployment, near minimum wage work or teaching, then teaching is the least worst option.  If OP can't get in because of the need for a 2:1 then it's a moot point, anyway.

true,DJ_Beardsquirt,null,null,"A frustrating game. I only caught the second half but from what I saw we could have won the game.

Hoolahan looked great. Both his work rate and passing were superb and he was our only player who looked like creating anything for us. Every time he got the ball space seemed to open up all around him in the final third and we actually looked dangerous. I couldn't believe it when Houghton took him off, completely destroyed any chance of us getting a second goal and finishing the game off.

Redmond put in a fairly typical performance. Some very nice touches and he showed he's got great pace, but despite running rings around the opposing full back he never managed to do anything productive with the ball. Credit to Stoke though, they were very organised at the back and made it difficult for him to find any players in the box even when he did get away from his man.

I thought Bassong looked good at the back despite giving away the penalty (it was soft, but probably a justified decision by the ref).

Ricky van Wolfswinkel, again, was a complete non-entity up front. He should've been taken off much earlier. I personally would rather have seen Hooper start.

A fairly comfortable game for Ruddy between the sticks. He looked confident and capable of handling anything Stoke produced. Not much he could do about the penalty unfortunately. It was rocketed into the top corner.

Looked like a painful injury for Tettey. Walters went in studs up on him and caught his knee-cap. Let's hope it's not too bad.

Kinda feel like Hughton lost us a couple of points here by taking Hoolahan off as soon as we scored.

TV Licensing isn't really comparable to credit card debt for example, they don't fuck about. If a person goes into arrears they immediately chase them up over the phone, if they don't pay the arrears then its doorstep enforcers, if that doesn't work then its legal action of some sort. This will all happen in a comparatively short time.

The big change that I can see is that the ""threats"", either over the phone or doorstep will be less intimidating, and people will be less likely to pay up.

I like when we line up this way, it gives us a little more steel (by having both matic and ramires) and maintaining the passing and leadership of lampard while still having pace on the counter, and 2 players who can operate as a second striker. when we won the CL remember for all the focus now on chelseas creative attacking midfielders, ryan bertrand started to help nullify the wingplay of bayern. i think thats the way forward if we play a team like real, barca, or bayern in the CL with so much attacking threat. We can't play this system/lineup all the time simply because we don't have enough central midfielders - mikel doesnt offer enough mobility and van ginkel still out. the problem obviously is that this system isnt inclusive of oscar, who mourinho will probably want on the pitch in a big UCL game. but hes really tired right now so i like it for the moment, let's see if it can get us a big result.

I'm not saying we would definitely have won the match if Hoolahan had stayed on, but Christ, I would have had more belief at least. Stoke had control of the aerial game today, as you would expect from them. Our best chance would have been through smart and tricky ground balls--that leaves Redmond and Hoolahan as our two most promising options, and Redmond doesn't yet have that final ball in his locker.

Sports relief top dog

Eastenders  
Festivals, sex and suspicious parents (do I need to go on?)

I think your parking question has been answered, but if in doubt, ask at the reception desk where you're staying and they'll have either a car park or some ""local"" knowledge of where to park without getting a ticket.

If you're going from London, I'd recommend either Cambridge or Oxford to see the really old university buildings - I'd say Oxford's probably better as it's more central in the UK - if you head north from Cambridge (which you'll be doing), that bit of the country gets very flat, and therefore boring. And there' aren't many cities out east. 

Bristol in the west is worth a visit for it's historic buildings, but might be a bit out of your way if you're heading north. (Liverpool has a similar shipping/slaving history so will likely suffice for that bit of British history), so after Oxford, you'd want to head to Birmingham, stop at Stoke to see the Wedgwood china factory, then up to Manchester and Liverpool. I'm from Liverpool originally so say hi to my Mum on the way past :)

Once you get north of here, there aren't many cities so it'll be looking at the landscape - you'd want a look around ""The Lake District"" in Cumbria, maybe over to Leeds/Newcastle if you have the time, and up into Scotland.

NO it should remain illegal to send the message that life is precious and that one should never take his or her own life because of convenience or other factors, but it should be effectively legal that nobody is prosecuted or faces any problems as a result of it.

That is truley the optimum stance, as after all if you are so ill that you are willing to take your own life the legal ramifications should have no impact on you what so ever, and provided there are channels and capabilities to do a humane end while still technically remaining illegal i think that is the best option.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Because there are always ways to circumvent or crack encryption, especially if you have physical access to the device doing the decryption. The exceptions are where there are alternatives that are less restrictive and thus kill the market for the more restricted devices.

Many of the current pay-TV conditional access systems haven't been cracked - although card sharing is a semi-popular way to circumvent it.

No system is perfect, the current one clearly isn't either. Instead of spending the money sending out nasty letters and henchmen to the doors of millions of people, a system like this would probably reduce evasion (not many people will be trying to card share) and allow those who do want access to the BBC, to pay for it.

The current system also fails miserably at preventing international viewing. The satellites used, while claiming to have UK/Ireland spotbeams, still spill considerably into the surrounding countries. Nothing to stop someone in Northern France watching BBC content. Encryption would make that harder.

&gt; DRM is just an encumbrance, one that depending on its restrictions can either push people to find alternatives or kill the market. For an example of how overly restricted drm can kill a device see the Sony Minidisk. 

Steady on, RMS. Have you looked at how it actually works in other countries? The stream may be encrypted, but it is no trouble at all to use it with the equipment you want - DVB conditional access is very well engineered to allow it. There are a lot of open Linux satellite/terrestrial receivers and MythTV should be able to handle it no problem.

The BBC would not have the problem of losing the market by virtue of the licence fee being mandatory.",0,1394304204,null,0,false,0,cfxmnab,t3_1zvj2n,t1_cfxmnab,t1_cfxmj9d,null,1432713991,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hmm... I would strongly advise you against trying do the whole trip on our back roads – certainly not in the densely populated areas of England. Although you may see plenty of pretty little villages, you would also see literally thousands of boringly dull towns and villages, and it will make the journey interminably slow. Trust me, it won't be an enjoyable experience.

No, in my opinion you would do far better to plan a round trip staying in beautiful and historic places where there are lots of things to do and see, and get to to those places as quickly as possible on the motorways and fast A-roads. By all means do the windy back-roads thing as you get further north – at least past the M62 I'd say – where the towns and villages are more widely dispersed and progress will be better.

My Dad passed away in August, after suffering from dementia for the best part of seven years.  In common with many people with dementia, he eventually lost interest in food, then finally flat out refused it.  What followed was the most horrific twelve weeks you can imagine - multiple hospital admissions with aspirational pneumonia from inhaling the food he didn't want to eat, hours spent trying to stop him ripping out another IV line.  What was left of his arms were ruined from that - he eventually ended up with the IV just above his ankle, where he took to trying to kick it out with his other foot.  During this very invasive treatment, his aggression would get considerably worse (surprised?) and there were a couple of occasions where the nursing staff were trying to place a line and he near enough took my head off while I tried to hold his hands.  We would go to visit him every day not being sure where he'd be - he could be sent back to his care home and be back in hospital again within 12 hours. 

By the time he began refusing food, he was already so frail that he would have passed away in days, instead of spending 12 utterly miserable weeks inhaling food.  The only comfort I can take from the experience is that he was so impaired at the end he could go from homicidal rage to Elvis impersonations in about 5 minutes flat.  I can only hope that his suffering was actually minimised by his illness.

I thought my mum's experience was quite bad, but your account sounds much worse. 

She had vascular dementia for six or seven years, and ended up in  a care home. She got a bad  chest infection which was treated with antibiotics. She became more and more distressed and in pain from the chest infection, and the GP asked us whether we thought it was really in her best interest to keep treating it. After a lot of heart searching we decided it probably wasn't. 

So treatment was withdrawn, district nurses administered pain medication, and food and fluids had to be withdrawn to avoid aspirating them. The GP explained that at end of life, fluids can actually cause a lot of pain once your kidneys have started to pack in.  We took turns to doss down on the floor of the care home. It took her about three weeks to die, and it was no fun at all. But at least she was pain free the whole time. 

I agree: there has to be a replacement for the LCP. It can score over euthanasia because people on the LCP could and did get better and be removed from the LCP.

true,the_leander,null,null,"&gt;No system is perfect, the current one clearly isn't either. Instead of spending the money sending out nasty letters and henchmen to the doors of millions of people, a system like this would probably reduce evasion (not many people will be trying to card share) and allow those who do want access to the BBC, to pay for it.

They already are paying for it, they have paid repeatedly for it in many cases. From the consumer perspective they're being told that they are going to have to pay yet again for the same service for no good reason and many bad ones.

&gt;The current system also fails miserably at preventing international viewing. The satellites used, while claiming to have UK/Ireland spotbeams, still spill considerably into the surrounding countries. Nothing to stop someone in Northern France watching BBC content. Encryption would make that harder.

Based on your reply below, nothing here would change.

&gt;Steady on, RMS. Have you looked at how it actually works in other countries? The stream may be encrypted, but it is no trouble at all to use it with the equipment you want - DVB conditional access is very well engineered to allow it. There are a lot of open Linux satellite/terrestrial receivers and MythTV should be able to handle it no problem.

Haven't you just defeated your own argument here? Building a new encrypted system, which based on everything else done tech wise for TV over here would be custom and not as good as other options (hello dab), the cost of replacing all those freeview/freesat boxes again to get the same service...


&gt;The BBC would not have the problem of losing the market by virtue of the licence fee being mandatory.

They're going to lose the market because of IPTV. Netflix, love film and other online services are now mature enough that devices such as smart TVs and boxes like ruku mean that as time goes on, the relevance of terrestrial is going to be reduced anyway. Throwing more restrictions and costs will only serve to make that transition quicker. Just as with the minidisk example, it had to compete against the first generation of flash and hard disk based mp3 players. Devices that required no additional software and were often cheaper. Minidisk, despite being very secure and advanced was a pain to copy files over to and had so many ludicrous restrictions that it just wasn't worth the hassle in comparison.

Also, Sherwood needs to get off Bentaleb's dick; he's been fucking abysmal the last few games. I don't care if you're pass completion rate is 100% if you're passing it backwards to a CB every time. It's blatantly obvious to me how much we're missing Eriksen right now. We completely lack creativity and every pass the majority of our players make is either sideways or backwards.

These guys need to have some respect for their club and teammates. Example: WHY IN THE FCK is Walker blaming Lloris for that 4th goal? Walker made a horrible mistake and should be taking accountability. Passing off blame like that does not bode well for our team chemistry.

I'm a frustrated Tottenham supporter today, but this is why we love the game. The agony of defeat. I'm hoping these players bounce back strongly. We have an important month ahead and we need to learn from this and put it behind us ASAP.

You have a grossly inaccurate understanding of what the Liverpool Care Pathway is and what it is intended for. The LCP is to ease the suffering of dying patients. It doesn't hasten their death or treat them inhumanely. It gets to a point when futile treatment causes more suffering and is more distressing than palliative treatment.

People on the LCP are not people who will inevitably die. No one has a crystal ball to guarantee someone is going to die. I've seen lots of people go on the LCP (or rather they tend to go onto an individualized targeted version of the LCP) and then improve clinically and come off the LCP. In cases like that doctors love it when they're wrong, a patient surprises us and gets better......brilliant.

I'm lucky to have graduated from my first degree before the last big rise in tuition fees (to 9k) but I was a postgrad at the time that rise was implemented. 

I was amazed that under the new rules a spruced-up former polytechnic with terrible NSS ratings and Mickey Mouse courses could theoretically charge the same amount as a first class research-led institution employing the leaders in their fields. More or less, this seems to have happened.

Fees of 9k for a degree in, say, [aeronautics and fluid dynamics](http://search.ucas.com/course/feesandfinances/37268/general-engineering?Vac=1&amp;AvailableIn=2014&amp;Query=aeronautics&amp;page=1&amp;providerids=781&amp;ret=results#coursedetailsmenu) can be justified in terms of contact hours and lab time needed.

It is time to recognise that some institutions are charging far too much money for irrelevant bullshit.

true,Silixus,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,"Personally I think with public opinion of the current ""Big Three"" parties being what it is, the next election may be the best time to vote for one of the smaller parties as I can see them performing the best they have for a very long time (if not ever).

Of course they aren't going to win (at least in the short term) however they may be able to make some gains (and have a significant % share of the vote) which can cause a couple of effects I can think of - 

The smaller party you vote for may in fact start to become a significant party if they can gain more than 1 or 2 seats, not game-breaking by any means but it gives them a better platform to build on and maybe become a serious challenger in the long run.

The major 3 parties may see the support of the smaller parties and may try to court these votes by shifting their policies towards that of the fringe party (think what some Conservatives policies have shifted to after UKIP started to appear more on the radar recently) which means that new policy making of the big 3 might tend more towards your personal leanings.

If small parties start getting larger shares of the vote but are screwed over by FPTP then it might once again spark a review of the electoral system, which, if changed to something more proportional, can help the smaller parties out in the future. Obviously after the recent failure of the AV campaign this sadly may not occur for another while

That being said, tactical voting isn't a totally bad idea, especially if you are in a marginal constituency your vote can make a real difference if you have a preference of one major party over an other. Imo in an ideal system tactical voting wouldn't be a thing and people could truly vote for who they want but it is something worth considering if you feel your party of choice really doesn't have a shot.

It can be difficult, but at the end of the day its your vote and you decide what to do with it. Personally I will be voting for the greens despite them not having a look in where I live, maybe it will have an impact, maybe not, still I will be doing what I want to do and that is what matters to me.

Lib Dem obtained 50% of the votes cast, Conservative 37% with Labour following in at 9%.

If I'm a Green Party voter I've got to consider if it's even worth playing the game at the national election and if I'm better off holding my views until a local election. In this case you'd have to have around 25K people switching to voting Green for it to have any result which is not likely.

So as a Green voter you're better off deciding our of the two front runners who is most closely aligned with Green policies and tactically vote for them. 

In this case 57K votes were cast out of a possible 81K (~70% turnout) so your Green vote is negligible. However, as 5% of the total votes cast are needed for the candidate to keep the deposit you may wish to vote Green to help them keep their money.

In this case they would have needed around ~3K votes which is about 6 times more than they received. So even then you'd have to have a significant change in voting patterns for that to have any effect.

Most of this you should be able to get from whatever supermarket is near you, so I wouldn't worry about bringing every little thing with you. Bring it if you have space, but it doesn't matter massively if you don't. Most supermarkets carry their own generic brand of stuff like aspirin/paracetamol/ibuprofen/allergy tablets, so they're not massively expensive here. Someone said Boots/Superdrug - most of the time supermarkets are cheaper, so would only go there if you can't find what you need. 

If you want to see what stuff is in our supermarkets, you can simply visit the websites of most of them and see what they all stock. If you contact your employer, they might be able to tell you what supermarkets you'll be near. 

Money... well, me and my husband go through about £50 of food a week, so I'd budget £30/week for food, if you're buying it at a supermarket. 

As for Filipino food, there isn't so many places that specialise in that. Google reveal a couple of online sellers, and one supermarket in London. I think most of the stuff listed on the Wikipedia page is available here, but you'd be making your own stuff, lol. Again, you can look at the supermarket websites if there's anything specific you want to know. Main things I noticed that aren't readily available were purple yams, goat meat and some types of fish. 

Money well... I'd say bring as much as you're comfortable with bringing. If you have significant savings in the Philippines, you may want to consider making your account joint with someone you trust... can't say I have any kind of familiarity with banking outside of the UK, but when my brother moved abroad, he made his account joint with Mum, so that she could transfer his money over when needed (and do some other bank housekeeping stuff).

Paying repeatedly? Paying again? What?

&gt; Haven't you just defeated your own argument here? Building a new encrypted system, which based on everything else done tech wise for TV over here would be custom and not as good as other options (hello dab), the cost of replacing all those freeview/freesat boxes again to get the same service...

This is my point - there is nothing custom or special about it, all of the technology is tried and tested by multiple operators across the world. The BBC itself used to do this, by piggybacking on Sky's encryption system.

It is unfortunate that the BBC deliberately left the relevant hardware (a CI slot for the addition of an encryption module/card if needed, not a huge cost and one that is already added to every other satellite receiver) out of Freesat, but that is ideological more than anything else. 

As for DAB, what other possible technology would you use if you wanted digital radio? Internet radio is not a replacement. DAB+ is sensible.

If the BBC is unwilling to go down the encryption route (they should have left the option open IMO), I hope they don't instead choose to get everyone to pay for them e.g. by having an ""internet licence"".

&gt; They're going to lose the market because of IPTV. Netflix, love film and other online services are now mature enough that devices such as smart TVs and boxes like ruku mean that as time goes on, the relevance of terrestrial is going to be reduced anyway. 

You're assuming that the BBC has to rely on competition and a willing public to survive. Unless the law is changed, we're forced to pay for it (if you want to watch other broadcast television). I don't think that many people will stop paying the licence and move to Netflix (which, since you are so against DRM, you shouldn't use as they use plenty of that).",0,1394308619,null,0,false,0,cfxocfg,t3_1zvj2n,t1_cfxocfg,t1_cfxne4e,null,1432714792,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; It places too much restriction on the equipment that you can use. It will no longer be just plug and play.

This didn't really happen when the BBC encrypted on satellite - in this case, via Sky. You had Sky hardware, you phoned up the BBC, asked for a card, put it in the box and it worked. 

It doesn't really restrict choice of equipment. There is a lot of DVB compliant equipment which can use any of the available conditional access systems. Even higher-end UK TVs have the necessary slot for the conditional access module. I have a shitty cheap Asda TV that does too.

Using it with something like even MythTV is pretty straightforward. 

&gt;  And if you make it too simple, it will be too easy to circumvent the encryption.

This has never been a real problem with Sky/Virgin - at least now that both companies are using the latest versions of their chosen conditional access systems. Card sharing is an issue, but that's typically for high value content like premier league sports where the risk/reward is worth it, not public service broadcasting, and certainly better than the current system of letting anyone in the UK, Ireland and Northern Europe watch as much BBC as they want.

&gt; I can be more specific if you give a proposal on how the encryption would be implemented.

DVB conditional access. Like how every other operator does it in the world, including Sky and Virgin in the UK.

&gt;  Should I just vote for the main party I hate the least?

No.

Under FPTP only the votes for the winning candidate count as far as who wins the election - all others are meaningless. However, there is more to an election than just the winner. Every vote is counted and written down somewhere, and after the election people will look over them to try to work out why people voted the way they did and how their candidates can get more votes in the next election.

For example, if the main parties see that a smaller party with a unique policy in one area (say a strongly anti-immigration message) is doing well, they may look into covering that issue themselves or, at least, polling on it.

Secondly, a single vote can mean a lot more to a smaller party than to a main one. The main parties may be getting thousands of votes (or tens of thousands in the Westminster elections, hundreds of thousands in Euro-elections), whereas the smaller parties may only be getting hundreds or dozens. For a smaller party one or two extra votes can mean recovering their deposit or beating another of the smaller parties (or, in some places at the moment, the Lib Dems). And these can have a far greater impact than a difference of one or two votes in the majority of the winner.

Obviously it is for you to decide who to vote for - if the election is likely to be very close, you may want to vote for the main party you hate the least.

But if everyone votes for the party the main party they hate the least, those smaller parties will never get anywhere, and we will be stuck with choosing which option we hate the least...

It's true that FPTP is so heavily-biased towards the two main parties that a vote for a small party is pretty meaningless on its own, but part of the rigidity of the two-and-a-half party system is due to people being afraid to 'waste their vote' on smaller parties.

A party who has zero hope of winning an election outright is never going to attract a lot of votes nationally.  Winning the odd seat here or there changes that, because they get their foot in the door and people in other constituencies begin to think that a vote for that party might actually matter.  The only way that a smaller party is going to make the transition from a wasted vote to a worthwhile one (in the mind of the average voter) is by going through this process.  For that to happen, people need to vote according to their beliefs and principles instead of trying to keep out Labour/ the Conservatives.

It's actually quite common for teams to play cup goalies instead of their starting ones, even in the big matches. Arsenal did it today too. Problem is, our cup goalie is not good enough.

What pissed me off the most about the way he plays is that he **never** catches the ball. That lead the defenders to think they had to do absolutely everything - normally a cross coming in with no one in the box would result in Howard catching the ball and defusing the situation, but today Coleman/Stones/Distin/Baines etc put every single cross out for a corner just to be safe. There was even one time when Joel and someone else both went for the ball, and neither got it properly so they gave control back to Arsenal. Joel should be calling out to catch it in that situation, not going into an air duel with his own team mates.

Now, why did Martinez play him? Basically I think it's because Joel won it with Wigan last year, so he wanted to give him a chance to prove that that he is capable of beating the big teams and that he's good enough to play in goal for Everton. He wanted to stick with the goalie that got us that far. The thing is, and McCarthy's said it himself, Everton is a big step up from Wigan, even playing in the same league. IMO he has to improve hugely before he plays in goal for Everton again. ",0,1394309767,null,0,false,0,cfxorn3,t3_1zws8p,t1_cfxorn3,t3_1zws8p,null,1432714990,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

For a start, the word 'debt' really gives a wrong image of how the student loan system works in the UK. If you stop working, you stop paying tuition fees. You also don't pay any tuition fees until you earn over a certain amount. The current system is essentially a tax on earnings for graduates (until their 'debt' is repayed). It's not as if you're going to have debt collectors coming to your door if your financial situation means you are unable to pay the fees. 

Whatever way you look at it, university education is not free. If they scrap tuition fees, everyone will be paying tuition fees through their taxes. University education should be seen as an investment and I see no reason as to why people who choose to get a degree shouldn't pay out a bit at the end.

All this said, I can't say whether I agree with the increase in tuition fees as I don't know how much these new graduates will be paying out of their pay check. However, I do fundamentally support some form of  tuition fee system.

&gt;This is my point - there is nothing custom or special about it,

I would in turn point you to dab and nearly every single advance in this sphere done in this country in the last ten years. That there is and in many cases has been for years off the shelf tech that could have provided cheaper, better services, the BBC and others have repeatedly chosen home grown custom, incompatible solutions. It is a trend that shows no sign in stopping.

&gt;As for DAB, what other possible technology would you use if you wanted digital radio? Internet radio is not a replacement. DAB+ is sensible.

DAB+ is the standard just about everywhere except the UK. It was available even during the planning stages of adding digital radio to the UK. Once again showing that UK broadcasters actively avoid using off the shelf standards that offer interoperability in favour of less advanced, less capable, more expensive ones. The very opposite of what you've argued for.

&gt;If the BBC is unwilling to go down the encryption route (they should have left the option open IMO), I hope they don't instead choose to get everyone to pay for them e.g. by having an ""internet licence"".

Given that other countries such as Denmark already require licences in line with the UK TV licence for any device that can stream, its likely that it will happen in a similar manner over here at some point. Given the growth of IPTV I think its almost inevitable at this stage.
Actually I can see the day that due to the increasingly important nature of the internet, people will be required to do something like the ECDL and that their computers, like cars will be required to be serviced on a regular basis if they want internet access. 

&gt;You're assuming that the BBC has to rely on competition and a willing public to survive. Unless the law is changed, we're forced to pay for it (if you want to watch other broadcast television).

That's what I'm getting at though, broadcast TV is in competition with IPTV. Right now simply due to momentum it is standing firm, but with more and more new TVs coming with the ability to access things like lovefilm, netflix etc that is going to change rapidly. 

&gt;I don't think that many people will stop paying the licence and move to Netflix (which, since you are so against DRM, you shouldn't use as they use plenty of that).

I think with the advent of the smart TV, such services are going to get increasingly important as time goes on. And yes, whilst I am against drm on principle, I have to acknowledge that for the most part Netflix's willingness to add seamless access for as many devices as they can in many cases makes the complaints I have about it moot. The same could not be said of lovefilm however. Virtually identical technologically, lovefilm is far more restrictive in terms of how and on what you can watch it from.

There genuinely was a problem which had to be solved- from the mid 80s to the mid 90s, both funding per student, and staff to student ratios, halved, which was guaranteed to cause enormous damage to the quality of education provided. The first set of tuition fees did actually go a long way towards solving that issue- they took money from students, and put it straight into improving their education. 

The 2010 tuition fees also took money from students, but by contrast used it to cut government funding (by as much as 60%), so they were little more than a transfer of costs from the government to the individual student.

IMO, the problem isn't that you pay for university, especially if you don't have to pay it back unless you earn a decent wage. The problem is that university does not directly lead to a well-payed, skilled job, and I think there are three primary reasons for that:

* Obviously, the state of the jobs market, principally as a result of the recession. 

But, there is still a lot of unmet demand for workers in some industries, and that leads to the second and third points:

* University education often has little direct interest in teaching vocational skills. A lot of courses do no more than train you to become an academic, when only a miniscule number of those jobs exist. We need to teach more skills which make you actually useful within the economy. And that doesn't mean doing a couple of shitty 'skills for life' sessions, it means the entire course being framed around training your mind, *and* simultaneously learning the skills and the knowledge which provide a basis for a highly skilled vocation.

* For quite a long time, university education was significantly devalued because of effective funding cuts. For instance, in a lot of courses there was almost no contact between teachers and students outside of lectures.

It's this latter point which means there is a clear need for more money going into the system, one way or another. That is why I would prefer the funding which was taken out of university education to be reinstated, and then also keep the extra funding which students have put in, to give the whole system the opportunity to be exceptional.

Three 90-minute episodes is essentially a movie trilogy. Regular movies usually only manage one film every 2 years, if that.

I'm so glad he's come out and said what he said. No other manager with more PR bullshit would've had the guts to say that. He's not the issue here whatsoever.

The players, however, have about as much fortitude as a broken condom. Time after time this season, under both managers, one thing goes against us and we fall apart. They (particularly) the defenders don't have the heart, will, or skill to be able to stop an onslaught and push the team on to turn the match around. Dnipro was a welcome exception to that rule, but even then it only happened once they went a man down.

I've no idea what Vertonghen was thinking for their first. Okay he slipped, fair enough, it happens. But for God's sakes don't play it back to the centre of the box without looking first when you're still on the ground. That's just asking for trouble.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Unless they're OAPs, they would have had to pay out for their boxes. Paying repeatedly.. Topup TV, another great idea that cost millions to implement and fell on its arse. 

Who said you had to do this stuff overnight? All of the existing Freeview equipment is heading toward obsolescence anyway, as DVB-T2 will eventually take the place of DVB-T. If encryption was a serious option, you'd make sure that the ability to add it is part of the Freeview HD spec so that its implementation is easier. 

Not sure what your gripe with Topup TV is all about. It lasted several years, but failed because no one can seriously compete with Sky (except Virgin). Not relevant here.

&gt; I would in turn point you to dab and nearly every single advance in this sphere done in this country in the last ten years. That there is and in many cases has been for years off the shelf tech that could have provided cheaper, better services, the BBC and others have repeatedly chosen home grown custom, incompatible solutions. It is a trend that shows no sign in stopping.

Could you list this ""off the shelf tech"" that could do it? Because your options are DAB, DAB+ or the highly proprietary and American HD Radio.

&gt; DAB+ is the standard just about everywhere except the UK.

Agreed, except the US and Canada and a couple of other countries. 

&gt;  It was available even during the planning stages of adding digital radio to the UK. 

Don't agree. DAB has been in commercial service since the mid 90's, and given a bit of a push in the early 2000s. DAB+ wasn't announced until 2006. The government is stupid in that they aren't trying to move toward it, and still allow manufacturers to sell DAB only equipment, but they/the BBC weren't stupid to adopt what was at the time the only technology.

As with railways and digital TV, the UK suffers because it was first. Other countries went straight to DAB+ as they didn't launch services until more recently.

&gt; Once again showing that UK broadcasters actively avoid using off the shelf standards that offer interoperability in favour of less advanced, less capable, more expensive ones. 

The UK broadcasters that actually follow international standards, for example our rigorous use of DVB for cable, terrestrial and satellite while other countries (like the US) go for their own proprietary mess? Hell, I believe the BBC is even a major contributor to these standards bodies.

&gt; Given that other countries such as Denmark already require licences in line with the UK TV licence for any device that can stream, its likely that it will happen in a similar manner over here at some point. 

Well then it's not ""in line with the UK licence at all"", it's totally different. And I very much hope we don't start taxing people with computers in order to fund the BBC. Should Facebook or Reddit get a share of the revenue?

&gt; Given the growth of IPTV I think its almost inevitable at this stage. 

Not likely. There will always be a need for some form of broadcast system which doesn't require an expensive internet connection to function. Same reason why internet radio won't take over FM or DAB. More viewing may be done over IP but I don't see it being the only option for a long time.

It's just as ridiculous for people who don't want to die in pain, and without control, to have to fly, ***on their own*** due to the current law, to another country to die there, away from family and friends.  

However there are issues, such as people being pushed towards euthanasia ""services"", especially if it's a privately-run thing. I highly doubt the government would be keen to finance the whole thing, and if it were a privately run operation there would be cost involved for the patient and where there's profit to be made, there is the possibility that greed and abuse of it might follow.

The hospital I worked at when I first started using it required it to be a consultant decision to start the LCP and the palliative care specialist team would come round the next morning and review everyone on the LCP to make sure it was being done right.

To scrap it completely was a cop-out. The problem is that the other side of the story doesn't make headlines as dramatic as the overblown headlines the daily mail likes to make of ""doctors killing patients"". No news paper is going to try to vilify a hospital for resuscitating a patient 3 times, ventilating them and treating their pneumonia aggressively, force feeding them and prolonging thier suffering when the patient had end stage heart failure and wasn't going to make it anyway. No one sees the harm that was done to patients before good palliative care was accepted (and I think the LCP was good).

Don't scrap it, improve it. I heard that podcast when it was first broadcast and the first thing I thought was ""if they're going to tie doctors' hands and not allow proper end of life care then I better get my living will in order"". No one is going to pull that bullshit on me. I don't want NG fluids/feeding or futile treatments forced on me, and I want my dying hours/days to be pain free and comfortable.

true,the_leander,null,null,"&gt;Who said you had to do this stuff overnight? All of the existing Freeview equipment is heading toward obsolescence anyway, as DVB-T2 will eventually take the place of DVB-T. If encryption was a serious option, you'd make sure that the ability to add it is part of the Freeview HD spec so that its implementation is easier. 

I never said or implied any such thing, but it is once again yet another box to pay out for, be it this year or a few years down the road.

&gt;Not sure what your gripe with Topup TV is all about. It lasted several years, but failed because no one can seriously compete with Sky (except Virgin). Not relevant here.

The point about it that every time there is some update to freeview, it inevitably means forking out for yet another box, on the low end that might not mean much but if you have a recorder for instance, that's a several hundred pound hit each and every time.

&gt;Could you list this ""off the shelf tech"" that could do it? Because your options are DAB, DAB+ or the highly proprietary and American HD Radio.

Given that I pointed to dab+ several times as a superior tech that has worldwide acceptance,  I w would have thought it obvious where my thoughts lay on this matter. But I concede your point about dab+ availability - I had never come across anyone selling a dab radio until the early 2000s.

&gt;The UK broadcasters that actually follow international standards, for example our rigorous use of DVB for cable, terrestrial and satellite while other countries (like the US) go for their own proprietary mess? Hell, I believe the BBC is even a major contributor to these standards bodies.

You're right that the BBC does have a very large hand in creating many of the standards in use, but that isn't the same as using pre existing standards (where applicable), it also by your own admission has a history of gimping them for ideological reasons (freesat card slots for instance). 

&gt;Well then it's not ""in line with the UK licence at all"", it's totally different. And I very much hope we don't start taxing people with computers in order to fund the BBC. Should Facebook or Reddit get a share of the revenue?

It is in line with the UK TV licence, it just recognises that other more recent technology offers the same and bills accordingly. The money raised is then handed over to the Danish state broadcaster who in turn are required to maintain access for the citizenry through those channels. As to that last point don't be absurd.

&gt;Not likely. There will always be a need for some form of broadcast system which doesn't require an expensive internet connection to function. Same reason why internet radio won't take over FM or DAB. More viewing may be done over IP but I don't see it being the only option for a long time.

The original topup TV was actually sold on the basis that it was completely compatible with the sea of ex-ITV digital equipment - they sent you a new card, you put it into the box, and all of their channels worked.

&gt; The point about it that every time there is some update to freeview, it inevitably means forking out for yet another box, on the low end that might not mean much but if you have a recorder for instance, that's a several hundred pound hit each and every time.

One that will inevitably occur anyway - as I said, DVB-T is on its way out, DVB-T2 requires new equipment. 

&gt;  it also by your own admission has a history of gimping them for ideological reasons (freesat card slots for instance). 

Freesat doesn't have card slots. I was saying that it could. It isn't ""gimping"" if they did, as DVB CI slots (which can take modules which in turn accept the cards) are a key part of the open DVB specification. If you buy any non-Sky, non-Freesat DVB-S box, it'll have a CI slot. 

The BBC are in fact gimping by not including the slot - especially as Freesat boxes are supposed to be able to be used on other services, which may be encrypted.

&gt; It is in line with the UK TV licence, it just recognises that other more recent technology offers the same and bills accordingly.

On the internet, the BBC is one of million websites. Why does it deserve a guaranteed income from internet users compared to any other website?

&gt; Internet radio is an unfair comparison as it has effectively been destroyed by groups lobbying on behalf of various media conglomerates, the costs involved for running an internet radio stream are significantly higher per song than traditional broadcast mediums. 

That'll explain why I can regularly listen to lots of tiny internet radio stations, then. They seem to have no trouble paying the licensing fees.

&gt; But you're right, streaming services will likely always have a place, even if only for things like news/weather in terms of television, 

And more. I can get a lot of stuff through a satellite dish on my house. Why would I want to clog up my internet connection if the stuff is being broadcast on the satellite?

&gt; for radio the market is different and the sole deciding point will be the ability to access it on the move, something that gsm, dab and to a lesser extent dab+ cannot beat analogue on.

What's that meant to mean? 

Due to the marketisation of schools, schools are graded on stats usually meaning that schools with low university placements are valued less - so the idea is you want as many people to go to uni because it makes your school look better and shiny and get more money. So the less information anyone hears about alternatives or ""notgoingtouni"" websites the better, and the more that the culture is that if you don't go to uni you were a worthless piece of shit, the better. 

Livelihoods or lifestyle choices really don't come into it very much, just how well the school looks in leadership tables.

I know at least at my sixth form not going to uni was simply not on the table at all, and even suggesting something like the Open University could get you a meeting with the head of year.

Ignore everything you see on TV, it's all complete bollocks.

Although in saying that, my mother was stood next to someone that got boiling water and sugar thrown in their face so the scum bag could get transferred, thanks ""austerity"".

But as someone that's doing educational things, you have little to worry about.  If you can take banter and all that, you should be fine.

Edit:  

I'll add this.

From what I've heard from both of them and my grandfather (he was old school, beating the shit out of cons etc).  Is that in most but the very worst places, most cons just want to get their head down and get through their stint as smooth as possible.

&gt;On the internet, the BBC is one of million websites. Why does it deserve a guaranteed income from internet users compared to any other website?

On the airwaves, even just the terrestrial ones, it is one of many as well, why should it deserve a guaranteed income? The argument works both ways. But given the beebs reluctance to lose the licence, it is likely it will follow the Danish route and extend the points at which it becomes a requirement. As you yourself stated, it doesn't require a willing public. 

&gt;That'll explain why I can regularly listen to lots of tiny internet radio stations, then. They seem to have no trouble paying the licensing fees.

The market beyond niche stations and ones that were merely tied to existing traditional stations was hammered in the 90s and more than a few larger commercial online only services have folded since as a result of those fees. 

&gt;And more. I can get a lot of stuff through a satellite dish on my house. Why would I want to clog up my internet connection if the stuff is being broadcast on the satellite?

Different usage cases will obviously favour one thing or another. But having an on demand service verses having to wait until (after, in the case of recording) preset times will always be desirable to some. Also consider that younger generations access content and use the internet in ways very different to those of us who grew up before it was available outside of academia. 

&gt;DAB should be able to replace analogue in time, that's why the BBC and Digital One are on a transmitter building blitz, so that they can push the case for switching off FM.

Given the power of the BBC in this, I believe that you're right in that they'll get the go ahead to shut down analogue services. I just don't believe that it'll offer parity compared to them.

&gt;The final match of the [1988–89](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988%E2%80%9389_in_English_football) [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) [Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_League) season was contested on 26 May 1989, between [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Arsenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.), at Liverpool's [Anfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield) ground. By sheer coincidence, it was the match between the top two teams in the [First Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division) and the teams were close enough on points for the match to act as a decider for the First Division Championship. Arsenal needed to win the game by at least two goals to take the title, while Liverpool enjoyed home advantage and had won the [FA Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) the previous weekend.

Sherwood was not looking to play a 4-4-2. He wanted to pack the middle and LW and have a more flexible formation, hence the 4-2-3-1.

&gt; Yes we played well up to the red card, but who's to say we couldn't have played better with players playing in their actual positions?

You can only judge Sherwood on what *did* happen, not what might have happened. Maybe if he'd played Lennon in goal Spurs would have won but that's irrelevant because the fact of the matter is that his tactics and lineup were working.

&gt; And no, Sherwood doesn't have every right to blame the players. Today was not a day for experimenting, which is exactly what he did (Walker and Lennon).

You're only calling it 'experimenting' because you don't like it. If he'd stuck with a 4-4-2 and got battered, many people would be calling him 'tactically inflexible.'

much more likely to be victims of sexual assault in the last year

assault, with 20% of women and 3% of men having experienced sexual assault (including attempts)

The gender pay gap can be debated, but the statistics in the Independent article at least say women earn less than men. 

Even if there were no figures for men included, why does that make it meaningless on International Women's Day? If the statistics for men were included, and for example they were higher in some things, what would that change? Surely the female victims could still be addressed on International Women's Day, in the same way that male rape is addressed on International Men's Day despite being lower in prevalence even with lenient estimates to adjust for under reporting.

Your first choice to play behind adebayor is Lennon, really? Okay on paper, thats one thing but the reality was none of the front 5 had any clue on how to generate offense , siggy had low confidence, it was infuriating to see dawson play excellent crossballs to verts or whoever was out on the flank (because chelsea were playing inverted wingers) and not have any plan on how to move forward 

Lets talk about the defense, against the league leaders you play an unfamiliar lineup, and not expect defensive fk-ups? that would be naive and we conceded goals based exactly on that premise.  

As a manager you are responsible for motivating your players, tactics and player selection, we didnt do well in either category.

His highly unusual tactics allowed us to be competitive with the top team in the EPL while resting some key players for two very difficult, and important fixtures in the next 6 days. We haven't won AT Chelsea since 1990, and were never going to win 3 points at Stamford Bridge today, but no tactics in the world can account for the errors and capitulation we saw today.  All four goals are directly attributable to a shocking mistake made by Tottenham players. 

I think everyone needs to adopt the mentality I have accepted since the loss at Norwich, which has alleviated me of significant stress. We won't get top four this year, but that's ok. We had SEVEN new players to try to settle into the squad, we have suffered terribly on the injury front, and we are on our second coach of the season. Our three largest acquisitions of ALL-TIME have struggled to adjust, but will come back integrated and stronger next year. Remember who was largely regarded as the biggest bust in all of Europe was last year? Luka Modric, and he has been key to Real Madrid this season.  All of this combined with a resurgent Liverpool makes CL a very tough challenge this year.

The top 4 are in a different league (no pun intended), I think our success under Sherwood has been more down to luck than anything (specifically Ade hitting the ground running when he came back in). We have a squad brimming with talent, we just need someone to kick them all into some sort of team that goes out there and dominates. Look at Norwich, we fucking lost to them and then the next week they got pounded 4-1 by Villa. I can accept losing to big teams (although not in the manner in whcih we have this season) but getting thumped 3-0 by West fucking Ham (and then losing again to them in the Cup), losing to Norwich, drawing with Hull... it's just not good enough on any level.

true,ripitupandstartagain,lancashire,Republic of Scouse,"Many forms of euthanasia are already legal in the UK:

Terminally ill patients often turn down life extending treatments because of the impact it would have on the quality of their life (theory being that it is better to live for for 12 months having 6 good months than have evasive treatment and live for 18 months and only have 3 or 4 good months).

Doctors are allowed to administer pain killers which will have the side effect of shortening the patient's life span but making the pain bearable. 

Both of the above examples are forms of voluntary (and in the case of administrating drugs possibly non-voluntary) passive euthanasia.

The act of suicide is in it self an active form of euthanasia and has been decriminalised since 1961.

It is active euthanasia which is illegal in the UK (where actions are taken to actively end life). Although it does happen in the UK often under the guise of passive euthanasia (most famous example being George V who was given a mixture pain killers (morphine and cocaine) to end his suffering)

Personally I do not see any issue with legalising active voluntary euthanasia. Non-voluntary euthanasia should also be legalised under medical review board. Involuntary euthanasia is another matter (the difference between involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia is that in non-voluntary, consent can not be given, for example the person is in a coma whereas involuntary euthanasia is euthanasia occurring against the will of the patient.). Whether someone acting as power of attorney over a patient  can express their will changing what would be a non-voluntary case in to a voluntary or involuntary case is were the debate should be. If someone with the power of attorney has the ability to over-rule medical opinion in a case it may also be necessary to legalise involuntary euthanasia for use in some extreme cases.

The sceptical argument is that there's no evidence that this would be a large problem, we shouldn't ban things because of irrational fears.

We run two cars - mine gets through about 200 quid of fuel per month. She drives a lot and gets through a similar amount. We eat out about once a week, usual cost is about 50 quid. We go away fairly regularly - family lives far away - so we visit them, or go for a weekend away together about every 6-8 weeks, and have short breaks abroad three/four times a year or so. Food bills are around 60-70 quid a week. I don't drink, nor smoke - it's not something that's ever appealed to me. Missus doesn't smoke, but goes out with friends once a month or so and gets through 40-50 quid in a night. Big thing for me/us is gigs - we go to about 6/7 gigs a year.

However the moment you bring up the UVF there's usually two different lines from the sensible PUP members:

1. They deny the influence that the UVF holds over the PUP which we all know is garbage.

2. They play down the actions of the UVF (especially the East Belfast UVF) that they aren't dealers etc. and that their main purpose is protecting the community from the PSNI/IRA/whoever else is a threat.

What is required is a huge social revolution in areas like East Belfast where people aren't scared to speak out against the UVF. I'm 100% certain fear is the main reason people won't speak out. I've nearly found myself in situations that one would want to avoid for speaking out against them and lost friends through it. However even to this day I'm aware of UVF members that I know (with my friends group it's hard to avoid) who know my position yet will not treat me differently for it. In fact I've had sit down conversations with them to understand why they're in the UVF. You get some amazing responses I'll tell you.

It meant that for about a month, at the age of 26, I was right on the edge of what you could call 'Locked In Syndrome'. I could blink, turn my head a little, move one arm a very small amount, and make a non-specific 'gahhhh' sound. That was it, physically. Mentally, I was totally capable.

The condition is rare, and it's very rare to happen in someone who is otherwise quite healthy. My Consultant was pretty pessimistic that I would make a recovery at all. I truly, honestly believed that for the remainder of my life, I would watch my condition bankrupt my parents as they tried to accommodate a severely disabled son, ruin the life of my then-fiancee, and live in extreme discomfort in a world which I could not interact with at all.

I wanted to die; I don't think it was an overreaction, I don't think, based on the evidence that was in front of me, that it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I saw twenty or so years of life ahead of me that would have offered me nothing but misery.

This is just a personal view, and it's worth saying that clearly I made a great recovery. But I know that if I was in that position again with a *guarantee* that it was permanent, I would feel the same. It's not enough to simply be alive; quality of life is crucial. Modern medical science can keep people who alive who are incredibly sick, but it cannot cure them. These people should be able to make a decision about their own fates.

Of course, any law that was actually written would need safeguards, but that is true of any law at all. But the cowardice of politicians, to dodge this issue, infuriates me hugely. We have a mismatch between medical science and our laws, and people like Tony Nicklinson and Debbie Purdy call them to our attention. They are mentally capable people who made a reasonable decision that living in this world was too painful for them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I would imagine fluid dynamics is a very theoretical (paper based) subject, whereas film is a highly technical (equipment based subject). So funding is not as straightforward as you claim. There is also a whiff of snobbery about your post-so much so that your arguments come across more for higher tuition fees than against. I was confused after reading what you wrote: left wondering what your stance actually is. The education system in England, riddled with inequality- and ruthlessly divided by class- is happy to let the few get on at the peril of the masses. 


I think what you might have been trying to say was that not all people should go to university and that it’s clear that some courses are designed for nothing more than to draw suckers in and make a hefty profit on the back of it. I would agree with that. Education has become out of control in this respect. We have become so ashamed of our rich industrial heritage that it is inevitable that this be the case. Trades are sneered at, blue collar work seen as a shameful waste of a brain- like brains are only there to ponder work. So long as this type of crap is pumped into kids’ minds in secondary school, so long the Universities can rob the public purse in the way that they are doing. You only have to look to Germany to see how things can be so different- kids have to decide at the age of 12 if they will go to University- no result day shame, no plastering of grades all over the newspapers- futures decided and on they go. 


I am actually in favour of tuition fees. More of the money should come from private investment though, like in the USA and the rest of the burden carried by the benefactor with means tested bursaries in extreme cases paid out from cash pooled from inheritance taxes. You can make the claim that a more educated society benefits overall from the tax driven, public funding of education. I would endorse it myself if it meant everyone had access to the same standards de-facto. Use the taxes to fund apprenticeships to balance all this bollocks back up. The less public money spent on education the better. That sounds whacko I know but right now the model just fuels the beast of inequality and provides a convenient smokescreen for it. 
‘More people at university than ever before’ gets more press than, ‘half of the front bench from the same school’, to put it another way.


The UK GOV isn’t adept enough to care about spotting talent and encouraging it by allowing equal access to top schools. Scholarships are the way forward. More emphasis put on enterprise level businesses to encourage them to partake. Business cares a lot less about background than government does. Very sad but true. The very idea that underprivileged kids could access the highest levels of education is enough to blow the pants of most of the Conservative front bench. Britain just isn’t ready for fairness and the education system proves it.
Oh by the way, last time I checked, films were quite popular- capital investment provided and jobs created because of them. Ironic then that you chose Mickey Mouse as a term to categorise a film institute as poor. I would have been impressed if that was by design, but I doubt it was.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt; Joel has played in the top tier in Spain

He was a backup, backup keeper with 3 games in 4 years.

&gt; well as won a FA Cup

With a team with the worst goals conceded to chances given ratio in the league, largely the fault of Robles. 

&gt;He needs to show (himself, his teammates and his manager) that he can be the number one against top opposition

The fact is that he cannot. He is a lost little man on crosses, and whilst his shot stopping is decent, he is not going to be able to turn around a complete lack of technical and mental ability whenever balls are delivered from the flanks. We play a style that leaves the flanks open, and we need a keeper who is confident in dealing with situations that arise from those positions. 

Whilst I see that you are just playing Devils Advocate, Joel is a backup keeper at the very, very best- and Martinez shouldn't have put him in the first 11 in a game that means a hell of a lot to supporters. It shows a certain level of out-of-touch-ness which he hasn't really displayed thus far... But it is a concern if it continues.

As impassioned as Sherwood is, he is not that great of a manager and honestly I can't wait for the summer to come so Spurs can hire a proven(hopefully) manager. I'm praying for Frank de Boer.

Lloris is already looking for an apartment in anywhere but London. He's not coming back next year. A huge blow as he is easily our best player. Anyone who disagrees with me, go look at some of the games he's had for us this campaign and notice how many we would have lost or lost by more if it weren't for his miraculous play. Vertonghen is most likely going to follow. 

We have no leader. Neither in form of a manager or player. Last year the team could rally behind Bale as they figured he could turn the game around for them(which he did...all the time). He was our savior game after game. Sure Dawson has the captain's band, but he doesn't have the presence on the pitch that we need.

This summer, Levy/Baldini/AVB brought in 3 pieces of trash, 2 decent players, and 1 who has been injured for half the year. Eriksen has really been the only form of bright light this season and thank the fucking lord that he's committed himself to Tottenham for the forseeable future. But who's to say that he doesn't change his mind when all this bullshit happens again next year.

Chances are we repeat this shite next year because Chelsea will only get better. Liverpool is either going to keep Suarez or cash in and buy 3+ big players with the price tag he goes for. Man City is going to spend 100 million again because fuck man city and their whole fucking purchase the world attitude and god fucking forbid they develop youth talents. Manchester United already promised a spending spree so fuck them right along with City. And Arsenal only lives to piss on our hopes and dreams so that's going to be our season. Unless we get bought by some billionaire. 

Anyone, fellow Spurs fans. I respect your realism and I wanted to express mine. We must continue with our support no matter how painful the rest of this month might be. ",1,1394323548,null,0,false,0,cfxtxy4,t3_1zwza4,t1_cfxtxy4,t3_1zwza4,null,1432717451,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The further upstream it went....it got very lost....and seemingly comfortable in the river, but also very fed.

true,ThatChap,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"While I agree with some of your points, I didn't have time to expand. I'll thank you not to put words into my mouth so: my own thoughts in summary:

 * Some people do not belong at university.
 * Some subjects do not belong at university.
* This presupposes a certain view of university.  
 * Some subjects and people would be better served by specialist technical and art colleges rather than the lecture/lab/seminar/independent study model of today. They are few and far between. I would much rather see specialised arts / drama / film / music colleges where the focus is on creativity. Let every discipline flourish in its own space.

* The same goes for trades and other hands on stuff. We used to have polytechnics and as far as I know they were quite good at what they did. But suddenly everyone had to have a degree. One bit of paper was suddenly worth a lot more kudos and pay than another, based purely on societal snobbery and political will to have more grads.

As for your point on Germans choosing at 12 - at 12 I wanted to be a diplomat firefighter astronaut dinosaur hunter. If it doesn't work out for the kid, then you get a miserable kid and a waste of educational resources. I don't think it's in a child at that age to make a permanent decision, and I've done a good bit of tutoring.

Agreed on taxes to fund apprenticeships, and as for film? I should have said film studies. Every single film studies grad that I know (about 6) is either doing service sector work or is unemployed.

Everyone I know actually working in film did sociology or languages and was never without a camera. They turned a hobby into a skill and made it pay and didn't need a degree to do it. As for the technical side, there are colleges for that. See my point on other learning institutions.

Before entering hospital for any treatment, patients should be given the option to allow it if, heaven forbid, the treatment goes wrong and leaves them physically and/or mentally damaged that any ordinary and comfortable life would not be possible. I haven't been to hospital for ages but presumably consent forms exist, to limit liability and to show you accept any treatment, like with any contract?

I can't see it being possible that the law would change and people who definitely cannot communicate that they want to die being allowed to do so. Expressing consent is important and just because the opinion of family may want it doesn't mean it's right. The Court should probably get involved in this area to play Devil's advocate, along with medical opinion, to determine if someone who cannot communicate their intentions should be allowed to have their suffering come to an end.

&gt;""the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as [Maxwell’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) discovery of the [laws of electrodynamics""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)

&gt;**Scottish inventions and discoveries** are objects, processes or techniques either partially or entirely invented or discovered by a person born in or descended from [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). In some cases, an invention's Scottishness is determined by the fact that it came into existence in Scotland (e.g., [animal cloning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning#Dolly_the_Sheep)), by non-Scots working in the country. Often, things that are [discovered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation\)) for the first time are also called ""[inventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventions)"" and in many cases there is no clear line between the two.

&gt;The Scots take enormous pride in the history of Scottish invention and discovery. There are many books devoted solely to the subject, as well as scores of websites listing Scottish inventions and discoveries with varying degrees of science.

&gt;Even before the [Industrial Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution), Scots have been at the forefront of innovation and discovery across a wide range of spheres. Some of the most significant products of Scottish ingenuity include [James Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt)'s [steam engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine), improving on that of [Thomas Newcomen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen),  the [bicycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle),  [macadamisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadamised) (not to be confused with [tarmac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmac) or tarmacadam ), the [telephone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) invented by [Alexander Graham Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell),  [John Logie Baird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird)'s invention of [television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television),   [Alexander Fleming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming)'s discovery of [penicillin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin),  and the discoveries of [electromagnetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetics), [radar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar),  and [insulin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin). 

&gt;The following is a list of inventions or discoveries that are in some way Scottish.

true,grodecki,,Accountant,"Buying a new car is inherently bad value in almost all situations. If you're looking to make the best of your money, it is not wise. Putting that much capital into a heavily depreciating asset under the guise of 'running it into the ground' is unwise, and if you use car finance it's likely a worse deal. (hint, personal loans generally offer a better rate if you need credit for a car, and be very wary of 0% APR deals; you will be paying for them in increased car cost.

Lets look at this with actual numbers. OP wants to do 150miles a week, plus short town trips. Lets round that to 250miles a week. That's 13000miles a year. Take the Ford Fiesta. Say you get a Ford Fiesta Style as you don’t want a base spec car. The cheapest diesel is £13695, whereas the cheapest petrol is £11695. There’s a £2k saving.

Real mpg quotes from honestjohn show the 1.25 Petrol Fiesta as getting 42mpg, and the diesel as getting 55mpg. Using average petrol prices for the UK at present, the cost difference to do 13k miles in a year is £385. Add in the factor it costs £30 a year to tax the petrol vs zero for the diesel, and that added cost goes to £415.

Ignoring the fact that the car will be financed, and thus a higher price will be costing more in finance, on mpg alone, it will take 5 years before buying the diesel becomes remotely good value. My very rough estimates say that the extra cost of financing £2k for that period of time would be £400, adding another year till your break even point.

I would never, ever in a million years dream of buying a new car. If I wanted the benefits of a warrenty and the like, I’d buy approved used, a year old. You will save thousands of pounds, and get all the benefits you want…. Buying a new car is really a fools game in 90%+ of circumstances.

However, if I was OP, I would buy a 2005-2007 Ford Focus for about £4000. Yes, you won’t have a warranty, but it is not hugely likely to go wrong, and if it does, you will still be massively under the cost of buying something new. I’d get a 1.6 Zetec Petrol or a 1.8TDCI after doing calculations on which is likely to be the cheapest to run. It will be much nicer to drive on those long journeys than a little hatchback. 

People get caught up in the running costs of a car and buy into the fact that new cars may cost less day to day, but look at the overall cost and it’s literally throwing money away for no reason. OP is 17. He can’t even get finance in his name yet, will get shafted with a bad deal when he can, and as such should not even consider being shackled into a huge loan at a young age. Do the maths on overall cost. Do not get sucked into spending thousands to save £30 a month on running costs.

Not correct. The person *can* have the sentence reduced or even removed, but by using the defence of coersion, you are still admitting some degree of culpability by admitting you carried out the act.  A defence of *necessity* (also known as *coersion of circumstance*) is more solid, but even then is not a legal get-out-of-jail-free card.

In *civil* law, a defence of coersion will usually render a contract void, but there is no such certainty in criminal law.

&gt;**The Thick of It** is a [British comedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_comedy) television series that [satirises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) the inner workings of modern [British government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government). It was first broadcast for two short series on [BBC Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Four) in 2005, initially with a small cast focusing on a government minister, his advisers and their party's spin-doctor. The cast was significantly expanded for two hour-long specials to coincide with Christmas and [Gordon Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown)'s appointment as [prime minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) in 2007, which saw a number of new characters forming the opposition party added to the cast. These characters continued when the show switched channels to [BBC Two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) for its third series in 2009. A fourth series about a coalition government was broadcast in autumn 2012, with the last episode transmitted on 27 October 2012. In a 2012 interview, series creator [Armando Iannucci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Iannucci) said the fourth series of the programme would probably be its last.

true,randomgerbil,null,null,"As a fairly new driver, my advice is to get something older to start with - you will probably have some sort of small bump or other accident in your first year. This is just from personal experience, but bear in mind there is a reason insurance is so expensive for young drivers.

Insurance will be a large cost. You may be able to haggle it down but it will be expensive. Monthly installments are generally more expensive, so pay lump if you can. Adding named, experienced drivers such as your parents can help keep the premium down.

I would recomend picking up a ~10 year old hatchback for around £1k. Something like a peugot 206 1.4 HDi will serve you well. You can go private or via dealer. Look for one with service history etc. Before you buy take the car for an inspection at an independant mechanic to make sure there's nothing majorly wrong with the car. With the rest of your £3k you can pay for your insurance as a lump sum (probably) and then your running costs will just be fuel and tax, which with a diesel can be quite reasonable. There are plenty of guides to buying used cars on the internet as well as user reviews so do your reasarch before hand.

Although you may be tempted by larger cars be mindful that larger displacment engines can really drive costs up and in general won't be  as efficient.

Maintainance wise, you can do the basics yourself. This includes stuff like checking tires reguarly (low pressure tires are bad for economy) and changing the oil yourself. This will save you some cost and the knowledge is useful in itself. 

With regards to the relliabilty issue that older cars can have - if you manage to run a car for a year spending less than £1k excluding your fuel, insurance and tax, then you're still saving money if otherwise you'd have bought new on finance.

Run that for a few years and then get something nice with all the money you've saved.

true,elapid,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Vote for who you believe in. Part of the reason we have a lack of choice is people worrying about wasted votes. I'd much rather my vote is wasted than use it on someone I didn't really support.

Look at it as helping to support the party you believe in.

Many small parties are wary of fielding candidates in areas where support is low as it would cost a fortune to pay the deposit in every constituency if they knew they were going to lose nearly all of them.

If everyone voted for who they believed in there might not be more parties in parliament but there would be more candidates if there was less chance of them losing 650 odd deposits of £500. £325,000 is a huge amount of money for a smaller party. Of course in areas like Brighton the Greens are unlikely to get less than 5% but they aren't going to get that support immediately in other areas.",0,1394330886,null,0,false,0,cfxwlbn,t3_1zwple,t1_cfxwlbn,t3_1zwple,null,1432718690,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
