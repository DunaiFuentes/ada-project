For example, there's a woman I've known for about a decade who fits what he's talking about pretty much perfectly. She's from a ridiculously large family - counting direct and half siblings, 8 altogether, and was raised by a single mother on a pretty shitty estate. She hasn't seen her father since she was a toddler, didn't do terrifically well in school, and spent the latter part of her teenage years being very much the stereotypical chav.

But as she grew older, she changed a lot. She temped for a fairly large business, worked extremely hard, and got kept on. She then worked extremely hard to elevate herself from the ground level, and get into a very good position within the company. From there, she's married a really good man, with whom now owns a house, and now has a baby. 

Bless her, but she's done all this not through being especially bright, but through determination, and hard work. There's nothing special about her, other than that she wanted a better life, and strived to get it. The idea that born to shit = doomed from the get-go is nonsense. If she can do it, anyone can.

It's a dreadful system, true, but ""other"" designated parties aren't the only casualty - anyone who isn't SF or DUP loses out. Both of those parties have something close to a veto on legisliation (DUP's absolute, SF's if they can scrounge up 1 extra vote at the petition of concern stage). The other unionist and nationalist parties, meanwhile, are as poorly off as Alliance and the Greens - they don't have enough MLAs to muster a petition on either side individually, and even if they got one off the ground with cross-community votes SF and the DUP can carry their respective communities by themselves. 

So ""cross-community"", at the moment, effectively means ""Do Sinn Fein and the DUP consent?"". There have been a handful of edge cases (e.g. the SPAD legislation where the PoC was sufficiently toxic that nobody would give SF the extra PoC signature), but none I can recall where the ""other"" designated parties lost out because of their designation.

true,Batmankoff92,,Lurgan,"I've seen this shared on Facebook by a number of people, it is a bit of an over simplification of complex electoral issues. It also presents the Alliance Greens and NI21 as perfect bastions of virtue, an infographic which every parties flaws free from loaded language would be more helpful. I agree with some of the ideas expressed here, although I don't find this helpful for a number of reasons.

'Neutral' parties support the status quo in NI are therefore by their very nature tacit unionists. They are built on neutrality and comprimise and that means maintaining the current Assembly and therefore the Union. Whether they like to admit it or not generally this is the position they take. As someone who falls down on the other side of the argument it is very hard to disregard the status of NI in UK and Ireland as a serious formative part of the decision making process. To me, telling people to vote for a third party and ignore the constitutional issue is akin to saying that a SF voter ought to vote for the DUP because some of their policies are sensible, it's very hard to go against what you believe about the constitutional question, if you do so you are voting against your own self-interest. This may make me a pawn who perpetuates the system, and possibly a monstrous hypocrite, but that's a burden I'm willing to take on- I believe in a United Ireland and I don't believe that the Neutral parties of NI can ever deliver it to me so I will never vote for them.

Following on from that, the constitutional question, like it or not is at the very heart of the agreement which created, we cannot, for the timebeing move beyond it. The Assembly is cross-community and you have to engage with the constitutional question on some level, saying it doesn't matter is a great turn off for me as a voter. Now, you can argue that the whole labelling ""Nationalist/unionist/other"" is a flawed method but it was a necessary evil as part of the GFA, hopefully we can move beyond this and labels *will* be irrelevant in the future but dismissing them out of hand is unhelpful and feels like sweeping our baggage under the carpet.

Finally, this was just a general stream of consciousness thought on the whole thing, I may in fact be wrong, I may have expressed some of my opinions inelegantly, I'm perfectly willing to discuss the merits and demerits of my position, it's just how I feel- I just think this post while meaning well, is unhelpful and simplistic with a clear agenda.

It's entirely possible to take criticism and use it to better yourself for the sake of bettering yourself, rather than for the sake of competition.

true,Turtle_Blues,null,null,"&gt; Being disabled doesn't and shouldn't mean that you are poor.

Going to chip in on this. I agree absolutely - it *shouldn't* - but in practicality it almost certainly does, chiefly because of the way the current rules on disability benefits [for those who can't work and are reliant on them] are targeting people. 

Admittedly, ""disability"" means a lot of different things and is a completely relative term. For me, I have a chronic health condition (CFS) that means I can't go out to work. I've demonstrated that I could work from home or do limited freelance, but the Job Centre made me stop because I wasn't earning enough to support myself within 12 months. They also say that freelancing isn't ""work""... but still take any money I earn plus (in practice) about 30% on currency conversions, so I was effectively paying the DWP for the privilege of trying to work. 

Additionally, the Job Centre refuse point blank to help me find any work I could do, or liaise with anyone who might go into partnership with me or something (I have tons of expertise and knowledge, but no physical wherewithal), so I've been basically told to shut up and sit down, because I'm too crocked to be useful. 

And yet, I'm not ""disabled enough"" to claim Disability Living Allowance (which I was receiving until a couple of years ago, when the rules - rather than my condition - changed), which entitles claimants to other helpful things such as your carer getting Carer's Allowance. They also see fit to put me in the Work-Related, rather than Support-Related, group of Employment &amp; Support Allowance, despite rubber-stamping me as ""not fit for work"". 

Bottom line: the ""reforms"" on disability and sickness benefits are full of loopholes and lies, designed to save money by moving goalposts - and don't even get me started on Atos Healthcare. It's unsurprising poverty is being rebranded as personal failure, because if the government/media demonises the poor as scrounging wastrels, people *might* just fail to notice the disgusting measures that have come in, many of which specifically exploit the fact sick people are too damn tired and afraid of losing what they do have to battle through years of legal appeals.

He has provided an excellent shield for our defense when being countered and under pressure. Dzeko has improved his game all over the pitch, but I would still like to see his ability to win aerial duels and technical ability improve. Zabaleta has been immense this season, he plays the most demanding position for city serving as a winger as well as a full back. His contribution going forward and on defense this season has been immense. Toure has really stepped his game up going forward which I credit to Fernandinho giving him the confidence to go forward knowing that he has excellent cover in case he loses the ball. Hart started the season poorly, but he has been a wall since being dropped from the squad. Navas has not been nearly as impressive as I had hoped. He helps to provide us with width and incredible pace on the counter, but his lack of defensive effort and ability has cost us some crucial goals. Still waiting for Jovetic to show us everything he has in his arsenal. I feel like he drifts around too much instead of making breaking runs in behind back lines. Nasty has been injured too much of this season to make an adequate evaluation of his season. Aguero has been excellent as always, but his constant injury problems have been detrimental to our title hopes and European campaign. Clichy has had his good games, but I am not confident enough in him to have him as our starting LB.

It reduces the space between defence and goal keeper for throughballs and deep crosses to be played into, and means that defenders can defend facing the play rather than on the turn or facing their own goal. Carragher, especially later in his career dropped very deep, regularly deeper than our centre backs dropped yesterday. As I said, if the norwich defender was a yard deeper he would have cut out the cross from sterling for our second goal.

And of course you have to drop at least as deep as the ball, for obvious reasons.

There are downsides to dropping deep too, but managers have to weigh these up. And it is a a managerial decision, we held similar defensive lines in almost every game this season. If there was a correct line to hold we wouldn't see such variation between teams.

So I may be wrong in my assertion we didn't drop too deep on sunday, that's fine. But you are wholly incorrect to say it's not a matter of opinion.",0,1398181574,null,0,false,0,cgz1vpj,t3_23mb2b,t1_cgz1vpj,t1_cgyz08h,null,1433469442,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Immigration is great for the middle and upper classes, and it's great that skilled people are coming into the country and being a real asset to our society and economy. However, immigration *does* have a negative effect at the lower, unskilled end of the jobs market, where we have record numbers of unemployed unskilled young people not able to access training or employment, simply because there is an oversupply of workers. I think Nigel has said in the past that he is not against immigration, but he is against large volumes of unskilled immigrants flooding this end of the jobs market.

The problem with the EU is that there is no difference between an immigrant doctor and an immigrant shelf stacker. Quite simply, we should be able to pick and choose the skills that we want to import. First and foremost, immigration should go to serve the people of the UK (included people who have emigrated here themselves). If it is putting people out of work, then it should be scaled back to a volume where demand can keep up with supply.

Immigration will be the hot topic in the next election, and it's a shame that the major 3 parties have done nothing to differentiate themselves on the topic.

They had written off the season for the most part at that very moment, they would have fully known that Sherwood may get the team to a CL slot or he may not but given the talent on the squad it would be unlikely that any catastrophic failures would happen.

My experience at the hands of police was one of holistility and violence, despite the protesters being peaceful. I'd never experienced such antagonism before.

You might think that being attacked at a peaceful demonstration would put one off protesting, but it had the opposite effect for me. At this point I still extolled the virtues of non-violence as the proper way to dissent.

This changed over the coming years. Kingsnorth 2008, G20 2009 etc. completely radicalised me.

Many, perhaps even most countries have issues in case you didn't notice. UK &amp; IRA, Spain &amp; ETA,  France &amp; Basque and of course the USA and it's notable civil war. 

Are you really of the mind that all problems in Muslim countries are cause by their religion while none of the issues in Christian nations are?

I believe you are fundamentally wrong here. We achieved peace *in spite of Christianity*. It was our secular enlightenment periods that sidelined Christianity which then led to the world we live in. Women's suffrage was not fought by the church. Talking child abuse was actively fought against by the church. All of the common complains people have about Muslim societies are for things that our own church played no role in us ridding ourselves of them. 

Islam isn't the problem, religion is. As this thread demonstrates even something as non-violent as Buddhism can be corrupted by those seeking power. The current Dali Lama spent the 1950s and 1960s working for the CIA, directing a campaign of insurgency violence that largely failed. Even the atheists do it. Power corrupts as the cliché says.

What history books are you reading? Ones entirely based on Western European nations from 1945 though to today, but skipping over the terrorist groups I mentioned a moment ago? Most of the world is not at peace nor has it ever been.

true,cubs314,num14,,"I feel that I'm torn between how you feel and being optimistic. What you say about him understanding the price over the value of something is true to some extent, but I think that we need to remember that we are a club that sits literally in that grey area outside of the top 4 but better than the rest of the teams. This makes it very easy for us to slip one way or the other and either look really good (Bale/'Arry era) or really poor (Ramos/AVB/Sherwood Era).

I believe we are in this position because of out inability to lock in a long term manager (obviously) that gets results and plays good footy. We are also in this position, because we sell off our talent as soon as they break out. I believe this is because we fail to maintain a winning ethos which ultimately falls back on the lack of stability in the management department.

Was AVB an all eggs in the basket option? Perhaps, but we got lucky that we were able to get so much $$ for Bale and have somewhat of a financial cushion to fall back on (which is a rarity for a club in the grey area like us). What I am trying to say, is that we are in the better position than United in the sense that we have been trying to find a manager that we can keep for more than 2 seasons.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"Japan is a mixture of Shinto and Buddhism and has been for a good thousand years, with many people doing both. 

Now lets deal with Shinto.  The ""magical henge fairies"" you call them are known as Kami and they are more than 'fairies' as we would see them. Kami can be gods like Ryūjin, spirits of mountains/air/lakes/rivers/roads/shops, revered ancestors etc and there are a lot of them.  In some respects Germanic pagan beliefs and Shinto cross paths with what a spirit can inhabit or represent, although with Germanic paganism the gods where set apart from spirits.

Another thing to take into account is Kami change, their scope can alter depending on the need of the people. A Kami that dealt with smallpox now might deal with cancer for instance.  This means that Shinto can incorporate other religious deities as Kami, including Buddha and even Jesus.

That explains why going by the CIA fact sheet of Japan Shintoism is at 83.9% and Buddhism is at 71.4%.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Oh that European Imperialism that is only at work and in play in Muslim areas? Gotcha. 

Well these were often the hardest hit.... but its not like that's what I'm expressly stating. The Muslim/Christian war has a long and bloody history so that specific turmoil existed in Africa long before the Europeans took over. However in taking over the borders they drew up often mashed together tribes that typically didn't get along or Christians and Muslims that didn't like each other. We see that throughout Africa and almost always have. Its a product of the spread of Islam assisted by Mansa Musa, his adoption and spread of Islam in more southern regions of Africa and the benefits it once brought (Muslims were both excellent scholars and Administrators), the ""Lost Christian Empire"" of Ethiopia and the product of the success of European Christian missionaries. There is also a third strong religion: ""animaism"" (aka, ""natural beliefs"") which is more at play in central Africa but you don't hear much of that even though it does often have its contribution to the clashes.  

I think your line of questioning is somewhat unfair. Given the figures for religeous spread given our 7 billion population we have these figures from 2012:

~30% Christian  
~25% Muslim  
~15% Hindu  
~07% Buddhist   

So given that most Christian countries are relatively stable its not really suprising that Islam pops up a lot in the news, especially since it lacks stable and fair regiemes (would the ""best"" be Malaysia? Or Turkey? Pakistan by the fact they have a nuke and haven't launched it yet?).  
So what about the Hindus? Well they do clash! With Muslims of course! Kashmir is a big deal and obviously the break up of India itself is a fascinating topic that is worth a good read too!  
However I kid, they have also had their own occasional Hindu vs Christian battles but their biggest beef is often with Pakistan/Bangladesh.
As we can see Buddhism is a far, far fourth in our list, however they're not completely out of aggressive acts. Myanmar is mostly a Buddhist nation and there have been records of both Buddhist and Sikh terrorism in the past. As I've been trying to point out the religion is just the trousers but you seem unable or unwilling to grasp this premise....
I mean, the Japanese slaughtered 300,000 Christians in Kyoto in ~1630 and they were either agnostic, ""shinto"" or Buddhist. Religion doesn't stop a person from being a git nor does a specific religion make someone more gittish or less gittish.  
If you want to continue playing here might I ask if you have a passing knowledge of Islam? Do you at least know of the schism within the religion itself? The names of the two major groups? The ""soft"", more spiritual version of Islam and the name of it?  It just sounds to me like you don't know anything of the religion or its history except for these link-bait headlines of massacres. If it is then its totally understandable how you've made the simple connection that Islam == bad but if you read a little more you'll appreciate that there are all kinds of Islam, the same way that there are lots of different sorts of Christians from Westbro Bapist Church to Anglicans.

&gt; It's not like that happened in many Christian places, is it? 

Most Christian places are European, but we still have our own examples like McVeigh, ETA, Breivik, the IRA, etc. Europe has a very rich history of Christian on Christian bloodshed (if we go back to the start of Lutherism) however if you study these enough you'll find the reasoning often is political, not religeous. Lutherism was born from a disatisfaction with how the Catholic church behaved and treated its subjects, often Kings and Queens converted to and from Catholicism for political gain, specifically to gain allies. If your point is that Islam is a more aggressive religion then history doesn't really prove you correct as all religions have been capable of incredible bloodshed, however most of the bloodshed is politically inspired, not religeous.

&gt; And Hindu. And Buddhist. Where are the bodies from these religions?

I don't really see your point. I mean there is all sorts of unrest and problems everywhere. In China most people aren't really that religeous but its still fucked up, has a history of invading other countries, killing people, slavery, gulags etc.  
The basic ""issue"" is that most undeveloped countries (one could argue here that their lack of internal development is caused partly by Imperialism and proxy wars) have a large proportion of Muslim followers. But the question you have to ask yourself is whether that is correlation or causation. You're obviously in the causation bandwagon but I personally think its just a correlation.  

I'm not at all condoning these attacks nor am I happy that some people in these countries are so fucking backwards that they think its a good idea, I just think if you understood religion and history a bit better you'd have the perspective to understand that the religion is not the important part. Nationalism and the desire to be self-represented is almost _always_ the bigger deal. All these people just want self-representation and while for some that means an Islamic state and Sharia law, for others its more secular (e.g. Turkey) and others just want their own vote and own representatives. 
Remember if you will that Somalia's lost years (when it had no government) was ruled through might. However people eventually flocked to Islamic groups because they offered fairer terms than the warlords. For non-westerners religion still offers people a security that people appreciate, especially when faced with an authoratarian dictator or any other type of brutal regieme.

I hope you appreciate that the camps that the 9/11 bombers were recruited from mostly served Saudis looking to create unrest in Saudi Arabia itself as political expression is incredibly limited there. Nationalism and self-representation still trumps any religion and remains the principle reason why people fight.",0,1398185225,null,0,false,0,cgz3nvx,t3_23o5uk,t1_cgz3nvx,t1_cgz1sgc,null,1433470348,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

During our time period where millions of Poles came through the door we had record lows of unemployment and youth unemployment was at all time low then as well.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"He's not right at all. The idea that there is a somewhat fixed number of jobs in the country that doesn't shift depending on supply and demand for goods and that immigrants are preferred reducing the jobs for native people is ridiculous. The more people that are in this country the more people are buying goods from UK businesses and the more people are paying tax. The more demand there is the more supply is needed and so more people are employed. You say that we have record unemployment '**simply** because there is an over supply of workers'. By that logic the huge leap in population we've seen in the last 200 or so year since the invention of medicine and vaccination should have left us with a chronic unemployment problem. In reality unemployment seems to rise and fall with the economy just like our current level has. 

You say we have record unemployment, which is true...if you only consider the last 15 or so years. [Go back any further](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/uk-unemployment-18701999.html) and you realise [our current 6.9%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27046681) is pretty average and unremarkable as unemployment rates go. So no, we don't have record unemployment, our highest rate during the economic crisis was about 8% whereas [it was nearly 11% in 1992 (see the graph)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2310394/Unemployment-increases-70-000-2-56million-rise-young-people-work.html) and higher during the 80s. Further, looking at longer term statistics it seems clear to me that economic crises tend to be he main cause unemployment and indeed despite reasonably constant immigration we have had periods of high and low unemployment. Take 2004/5 for example a period of very low unemployment and economic prosperity before the crash. It was also a period of huge immigration from Poland and other places and yet the economy did not dip in 2004 or 2005 or 2006 or 2007. And what was the cause of the 2008 crisis? Not immigration, it was a mortgage crisis in the US and a sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In fact our unemployment rate seems unaffected by polish immigration and very effected by a recession. The idea that we can blame unemployment on immigration seems wrong but the idea that immigration is the major or only cause of unemployment which you imply is laughable. 

It boggles my mind when I go from reading a historian who says in a nonchalant way that one particular country, the US, for example had high levels of immigration in it's early history and this led to economic prosperity with the evidence to prove this relationship and an entire catalogue of evidence from other places. And then I read spurious accusations on here and in the newspaper that in fact, in the 21st century, immigration somehow makes us bankrupt and we should shut the borders. You are forced to conclude that these people have never read any arguments against their position but if you correct them people say your too PC - the perfect defence. And then Nigel Farage does this on the national stage and people say how wonderful his is spouting his rubbish and any criticism gets put down to the Lib/Lab/Con plutocracy which will be somehow miraculously solved by yet another manipulative ideological shitbag. Well I don't associate with any party because like most young people I don't trust any of the main parties. But that doesn't mean I'm going to sell my soul and believe crap with no justification and this immigration = British jobs lost nonsense is the epitome of that whirlpool of stupidity.

Atos is just terrible. I had my original appeal thrown out (in my favour) by the judge, who called out their bullshit and demanded I be awarded ESA with full backpay... but they're still filing lies when I try to get DLA reinstated. Mine was taken away because my consultant retired - nothing to do with my condition changing. 

I'd suggest - in your and your SO's situation - that he definitely claims again, and appeals again. If you let them beat you down, they win. Maybe contact your local Citizens' Advice Bureau. Mine was dreadful and did nothing with Atos appeals, but your mileage may (hopefully) vary. Also, if he doesn't currently have a therapist or consultant, try getting his GP to send him for a mental health review. What you want is the name of a hospital-based care professional who has seen him about his condition and can be asked to write a letter in his support. Explaining how the stress and impact of the appeal process hasn't helped the depression wouldn't hurt. 

Every single health professional I've spoken to in the past (nearly) three years - and I see people a lot, what with CFS and recent surgery - has said they're sick of the Atos assessment system and its effect on patients. If you're lucky, you'll find someone to stand in your corner, and that's what you need... because the DWP doesn't put much weight in GP's assessments, despite the fact that they say they do (and legally should). 

But, yes, the most appalling thing about all of it is the ""we're not saying you're not sick, but you're not sick *enough*"" crap they pull, especially when they're so guarded about what ""enough"" actually is. Try to find  a copy of the assessment descriptors and quote the language used in those when describing symptoms, too. A lot of it is how the paperwork gets filled in - the CAB may be able to help there.

They're anti-UKIP and will sink to any depths they have to to smear their name.

Never mind the fact that Farage has said numerous times that he is pro-immigration (50,000 skilled workers a year), but he is anti-mass immigration.

They don't care about that extremely important distinction.

This is how liberals argue. They act as if Farage and UKIP hate foreigners and are racists. To them, it is ironic that he hired his wife to be his secretary. They see that as hypocrisy, because they think that Farage is saying ""let's not let in ANY immigrants who want to work"".

In reality all he is saying is ""let's let in skilled workers"" at a rate of 50,000 a year, in stead of 250,000 unskilled workers.

 A secretary for a big name politician IS a skilled job. You have to be intelligent, have good organisation, good communication skills, both verbal and written, and be willing to work long hours. It is hardly comparable to stacking a shelf. But this doesn't matter to anti-UKIP types, because this allows them to grandstand for their favorite purpose; implying that Farage hates foreigners and is a hypocrite.

Yes, my local MP is George Eustice, and I spoke to him a while back about this issue. He dug out the relevant legislation, looked into it, and was very confused because it is blatantly unfair.

I need to chase it up and get back in the saddle if I'm actually going to get it dealt with (much less the law actually changed - that's a long process!). It truly does need to be tackled, though, because this affects everyone trying to earn an income from any creative-based work (art, crafts, design, writing) that isn't paid-per-hour employment and, obviously, for people with health issues, something that they can do as and when they're able is far more practical than trying to make shifts. I often call writing ""the career that doesn't care if I'm in my pjs"", because it's something I can do even if I can't get more than halfway out of bed.

He has made some bold changes that I am not sure another coach would have done that have both helped and hurt us. Eriksen on the left instead of in the hole has led to more space and better crossing. Chadli in the CM spot instead of on the left wing has given us proper midfield movement and a much better bridge between the defense and strikers/wingers. Benteleb was another. the guy in 19... another ballsy move with the midfield personnel we have. This one didn't work out as well, but we did find we have a really hard working defensive midfielder who is ice cold under pressure.

It is true that I could go to Bulgaria and use their health care system, but I wouldn't, because it is massively worse than the NHS. It makes sense for people from poorer countries to come to Britain, not the other way round.

Look, there is just no arguing the fact that we are an island with finite space and finite resources. Obviously there is a limit as to how many people we can have living here. I, and most other UKIP supporters believe that the country is already too overcrowded.

Most of the people who vote UKIP do so because they feel that way.

true,beejiu,eng-essex,Essex,"Well, I guess it comes down to what you define as 'success'. What purpose does the 'free market' or economy serve? I argue it should be there, first and foremost, to serve the citizens of the country. Now the real issue is how we measure 'success' of the economy (the 'utility'). Most people would argue that our aim should be to maximise the utility for the average person, so that the average person lives a comfortable life. But the problem with averages is that 50% of people will have really comfortable lives, but the other 50% could have very sub-standard lives. We really should be structuring our society and economy that works not for the 'average person', but for the people at the 90th or 95th percentiles. In other words, we should be closing the gap between the rich and the poor.

I propose that immigration is great for the Mr Average. Companies get cheaper labour and stay profitable. Mr Average gets lower prices and is better off, because his skills are in high demand regardless of immigration.

However, if we should instead be concerned with the person 'at 95th percentile', we might find that this person is actually worse off as a result of immigration. With unemployment at 7%, this person would almost certainly be unemployed and unskilled. If immigration of unskilled workers was decreased, the pressure on jobs at this end of the scale is reduced. Unemployment reduces and Mr 95% is more likely to be in work, and bringing in a wage.

But there is a downside. With current immigration: Mr Average does very well, but Mr 95% does poorly. But with restricted immigration in unskilled workers: Mr Average does worse, but still lives a very comfortable life, and Mr 95% does well.

So the real question is, how do we strike the right balance so that all citizens of the country live comfortable lives? 

I don't think raising the minimum wage makes it less likely for people to be undercut. If businesses are tending to employ immigrants over British workers at the moment, I don't see how raising the minimum wage could change that.",0,1398190956,null,0,1398191136,0,cgz6k62,t3_23okc8,t1_cgz6k62,t1_cgz5vk9,null,1433471712,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The difference is that hundreds of thousands of foreigners aren't going to Bulgaria.

But you *could* - you have that right thanks to the EU. You could even go to France, Italy, Germany or any other member state if you so chose.

&gt; Look, there is just no arguing the fact that we are an island with finite space and finite resources.

If you ignore the fact that we can import those needed resources from our trading partners in the global economy, sure.

&gt; Obviously there is a limit as to how many people we can have living here

Ok, let's assume that there is for a moment. How do you define and measure that and what counts as ""too much""?

You could make an argument that London is overcrowded and has too many people but Devon, Yorkshire, Scotland - lots of space there.

How do you balance the fact that some places may be overcrowded and some may actually need to import labour and skills that aren't available locally?

&gt; Most of the people who vote UKIP do so because they feel that way. Not because they hate immigrants or whatever the left wing smear campaign of the day says, but because they recognize that we can't just keep importing hundreds of thousands of people every year without that having knock on consequences.

You are absolutely entitled to hold that viewpoint, and I do appreciate that many UKIP supporters have genuine concerns and don't all hate immigrants for whatever reason the left wing press wants to make up.

I would put it to you however that the answer is in making it more difficult for the malingerers and the unskilled migrants to claim benefits here without having first paid in, yet still allowing those who *actually want to work* to come here and do so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But you could - you have that right thanks to the EU. You could even go to France, Italy, Germany or any other member state if you so chose.

Hypotheticals are irrelevant to the reality of the situation. Countries like France, Germany and the UK attract people from poorer countries with less infrastructure like Poland, Bulgaria, Romania etc, BECAUSE of our infrastructure.

That is why it is FACT that we have increasing NET migration every year. The amount of people coming in is greater than the amount of people leaving by a good 250,000.

&gt;If you ignore the fact that we can import those needed resources from our trading partners in the global economy, sure.

How are we going to import more schools? More hospitals? More public housing? We're a country with finite space. 

&gt;You could make an argument that London is overcrowded and has too many people but Devon, Yorkshire, Scotland - lots of space there.

How is that logical? ""This one area is overcrowded and is causing great problems. I know, let's overcrowd the rest of the country to make it equitable!"". Where does this end? When the entire country is as crowded as central London?  This is madness.

&gt;yet still allowing those who actually want to work to come here and do so.

That is why UKIP supports an immigration policy that would let in 30/50,000 people a year, and would allow us to choose who we want based on quality etc. 

I don't know any UKIP politician who says that we should have NO immigration. Now that would be an extreme position. To me, the idea of 30/50,000 a year is very reasonable. We get to pick doctors, surgeons, electricians, pilots, etc. And if at any point we do need more people in the unskilled labour market, we can raise that cap as a country. 

The rate of 50,000 a year is what we had for decades until new labour came in and decided that we all of a sudden needed 500,000 new immigrants every year. Again, where does this end?

&gt;You can do that without having to leave the EU and and the trade and movement advantages (amongst others) that it gives us.

I don't consider free movement of people an advantage. I would rather have a situation where we allow 30/50,000 immigrants a year, even if that means that when I go to France or Germany I have to fill in paperwork. I've been to work in America before and was more than happy to apply for a green card and go through the proper channels. It isn't a very cumbersome process and can be done in a few hours and with a few phone calls.

&gt; trade advantages

There is absolutely no reason why we wouldn't have free trade agreements with the EU without being in political union with it. Numerous other countries are in that situation.

In many ways, the EU is a disadvantage in trade deals, as we are forbidden from making them with the rest of the world.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"Well, the short answer is yes.

The long answer is sort of. Most full time workers get a minimum of  28 days per year off, including bank holidays; people who work part time get the equivalent amount for their working hours. Maths fans will be able to work out that means an extra 12 and a bit percent of days you get paid for, but don't actually work.  I'm on a zero hour contract, which means I don't have a standard number of hours of work per week to work out annual leave from. Instead, I get paid an extra twelve and a bit percent on everything I earn, as a seperate line called WTD (Working Time Directive, the relevant bit of legislation) Pay so it's taken into account when working out the various deductions; I can then take as much or as little time off as I want (as long as I don't violate a different bit of legislation by working an average of more than 48 hours per week in any given 17 weeks), but don't get paid for any of it. So my pay over a whole year is the same as somebody else who worked the same number of hours for the same wage, but my pay over a month might be higher or lower.

He's not going to let Chelsea go easy on us just because he prefers Rodgers over Pellegrini/City. That's way too much of a small-time mentality.

It's like when we played Blackburn on the final day of the 94/95 season. If we beat them, it gave United a chance to win their 3rd title in a row. We beat them and fortunately United didn't capitalise anyway. Okay so Redknapp didn't exactly celebrate the goal but there was no way we were going to roll over to Blackburn and ensure United had no chance of winning the title.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Hypotheticals are irrelevant to the reality of the situation

No, it is not irrelevant and nor is it hypothetical. You have the freedom of movement and residence in the entire European Union and it is one of the most fundamental rights that you have.

Both me and you could pack up tomorrow and go and move to Paris, Rome of some tiny little town in the middle of nowhere in Romania just the same as anyone from those countries could come here.

Just look at how many British retirees there are in France, Spain and Cyprus to see just how important that right is to people from the United Kingdom and what they would be giving up if we left.

&gt; How are we going to import more schools? More hospitals? More public housing? We're a country with finite space

The exact same way we ""import"" them if we *don't* have all the extra millions - by funding them from general taxation.

This is not really a problem as the schools and hospitals will need built anyway due to population growth. If more taxpaying immigrants means that we need to build them sooner, then those immigrants are paying taxes to fund that infrastructure aren't they?

&gt; Where does this end? When the entire country is as crowded as central London? This is madness.

Like I said, so long as they are coming here to work and pay their taxes to fund the necessary infrastructure then I don't see how we don't all win.

That's obviously contingent on the infrastructure and houses being built but that's a problem we face even without immigration.

&gt; I would rather have a situation where we allow 30/50,000 immigrants a year, even if that means that when I go to France or Germany I have to fill in paperwork. 

I wouldn't.

I quite like having the right to move elsewhere within the EU for work and I quite like that my employer doesn't need to worry about visas and paperwork to send me there.

You want to reduce my value as an employee and to reduce my employer's competitiveness - both things which will be to the direct detriment of my family.

&gt; There is absolutely no reason why we wouldn't have free trade agreements with the EU without being in political union with it. Numerous other countries are in that situation.

You have larger negotiating clout as a bloc of 350 million compared to 60 million, plus it's far far more difficult to negotiate with the EU if you are not a member - you have to follow all the rules yet you have no say in how they are made.

That doesn't sound like an improvement to me.

&gt; I've been to work in America before and was more than happy to apply for a green card and go through the proper channels. It isn't a very cumbersome process and can be done in a few hours and with a few phone calls.

Unlike most people on this thread, I have actual direct experience of dealing with USCIS and the AOS process and I know that's a complete lie. 

You cannot just ""apply"" for US Permanent Residence unless your visa is a dual intent visa and even if it is, Adjustment of Status takes more than just a few hours and a few phone calls.

Thanks to Universal Suffrage this is virtually inevitable. It's more
interesting that some democracies (e.g. Switzerland) have not, or not
yet, followed this dismal course.

The electorate still has the final say but its opinion is a very blunt
instrument.  Any issue below the top one or two fades to obscurity; as
for such minority concerns as mass surveillance, torture, etc - forget
it, they will never be election issues.

Well organised interest groups have therefore plenty of scope for
seeking advantage in the details of laws and regulations, and they
are making full use of it.  Those groups will not worry themselves
about the overall effects of the privileges they acquire, which
usually work to the disadvantage of the public as a whole.

So our economic and political sclerosis slowly hardens, and decade by
decade we sink a little deeper into our stagnation.  This is not going
to end well.

If we weren't in one of the most developed nations on Earth then I'd call bullshit, but in this context I agree. Poverty isn't your fault if you've been born less fortunate, and there's a very good chance of that sucking, but in the UK there's a lot more opportunity, even for the poor. It might be much harder to get somewhere than it would for a typical middle class UK resident, but it's definitely possible.


However, if the person has been brought up that way, without having the outlook and the mindset required to succeed, then the cycle of poverty continues as there's no motivation in their life. There's certainly a lot of people that way, and it's not really their fault considering they haven't been taught, as much as I dislike chavs and other relevant demographic groups.

Whilst they go in great detail about certain organisations and their activities, the sections pertaining to drug dealing are one line clearly copied and pasted on to each section on each group.

Is this your argument? Let's ignore how much scrutiny IMC reports are held to. You will notice the most recent IMC report omits drug dealing from the CIRA's repertoire. Which strangely enough coincides with the CIRA split.. The same split from which the subject of this post was spun off to begin his own franchise.

&gt; The Sunday World and various southern papers are indistinguishable with regards their sensationalist reporting on crime in general, but in this case i think you are confusing actual crime gangs with paramilitary groups. There is a vested interest by both the media and political entities to paint them in the same light.

Oh. Never guessed you'd say that. [Southern trees often bear strange fruit](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/cira-vows-to-execute-top-criminals-265795.html). Pay particular attention to the publishing time.

For your information, I'm a socialist and an internationalist, and I think people are looking at immigration in completely the wrong way. One of the reasons (among many) that people come to the UK for jobs is because doing a job in the UK will pay much more than doing that same job in their home country. I'm not sure why I deserve the privilege of higher paid jobs, as well as better public and social services just for being born in a country. This isn't the medieval era, and I don't have a 'birthright' to anything. I support whatever group tries to level this inequality between peoples, but there aren't really any parties out there doing that. 

Plus I'm not really sure what my political beliefs have to do with it. Perhaps it makes me more inclined to criticise UKIP, but anyone can see the hypocrisy in Farages comments and actions.

true,beejiu,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt; What does a European unskilled worker have that a UK unskilled worker doesn't? Is it nothing? It's just that they are added to the jobs pool making British people less likely to be employed?

Yes, there's not necessarily a difference between a European and UK unskilled worker, other than citizenship. It's just the jobs market has too much supply.

&gt; Surely if that were the case then businesses would not be ""tending to employ immigrants over British workers at the moment"" as you suggest?

I'm not sure that they are. I'm creating a hypothetical. If we are arguing that immigrants are undercutting British workers, then that suggests that employers are tending to employ immigrants over British workers. And that would imply that British workers are worth less to employers, so increasing the 'price' of a British (and EU) worker wouldn't benefit them. If anything, it would attract more immigrants into the market. Again, it's purely hypothetical, and I don't believe that employers do prefer immigrants. I'm just constructing the argument that raising the minimum wage would not necessarily benefit British workers.

&gt; If we raised the minimum wage, surely that would help the 90-95th percentiles who work at the minimum wage?

It sure would, but we've got to make sure that enough people have employment in the first place. I would think it is better to have a low paying job, which allowed you to survive, than to have no job at all. If only for a person's sanity.

&gt; I would suggest that improving the prospects of the unskilled British person with better education/training schemes would lead to a reduction the number of unskilled British people, this would make them more competitive in the work market. This would also allow us to maintain the economic benefits of immigration. Thoughts?

I absolutely agree, and we are certainly moving in the right direction with record numbers of students going to university. (Although high tuition fees will probably have a negative impact on that!) But, education and training schemes aren't a magic wand and do not work overnight. There are many young people who have been let down by the current system. As I said in another post, I'm not against immigration, I just think it should be 'damped' so that supply of immigrant workers keeps up with demand in our employment market. Better education and training schemes would certainly allow more immigration in the long term, but I think we need to take a more pragmatic approach to immigration in the short-to-medium term.",0,1398195439,null,0,false,0,cgz8t7g,t3_23okc8,t1_cgz8t7g,t1_cgz803q,null,1433472775,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Most universities have deadlines on applying to their accommodation. Furthermore, most universities will only **guarantee** accommodation on site to students picking it as their ""*firm*"" offer. So for example, you'll probably find if you look into it that your firm offer has a deadline of around end-of-may-time for accommodation. After that they will consider it, but in reality that means going on a waiting list and not being accommodated on site for the start of the year (and if you aren't on site for the start of the year, I wouldn't bother - that's all it's good for really... meeting people at the start.. beyond that its expensive and loud).

If, for example, you don't meet your conditional offer for the firm choice, but DO meet it for the insurance offer, then what will usually happen is they will either offer you accommodation at that point (or put you on a reserve list) or provide you with a list of reputable lettings agents etc. Some universities also run schemes to match up insurance offer candidates together so they can go and get a house together.

true,Sosolidclaws,null,null,"&gt;I'm considering doing undergrad studies there, as a way to kind of.. travel to Europe as well as go to a good school. 

Its not a ""good school"", its one of the world's best 5 schools.

&gt;How likely do you think it is that I'd get in?

If you're asking people how likely it is that you'll get in without providing information about your grades etc... then you're probably not going to get in. 

Do you realise how competitive universities like Cambridge are? I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but Cambridge is on the exact same level as Harvard. If you do not have almost *perfect* grades, you have no chance. Your likelihood of getting accepted is low, regardless of your applicant profile. However, if you try your best, and put a lot of effort into the process, you can get in. I'm not saying its impossible.

I applied to Oxford, which is actually a bit *less* competitive than Cambridge, and I was rejected (after being interviewed) despite the fact that I had 44/45 points on my diploma (something that only 0.1% of students get).

By the way, this is only valid for Undergrad (which is MUCH more competitive than graduate). Getting into Cambridge for a Master's or PhD is generally easier, especially for Americans. Why is this? Because in the UK, undergraduate degrees are seen as sufficient for any job, unlike the US where graduate studies are usually required for high-paying jobs. Thus, the competition for undergrad applicants to Oxford and Cambridge is fierce.

true,rivermelodyidk,null,null,"&gt; Its not a ""good school"", its one of the world's best 5 schools.

Yes, I know, thank you, ""good"" happens to fit under the category of ""best"". 

&gt; If you're asking people how likely it is that you'll get in without providing information about your grades etc... then you're probably not going to get in. 

I meant more along the lines of ""is it more or less likely that I'll get in based on the fact I'm from America"", assuming that I meet all of the other requirements. As in the fact that I'm American is the only variable in the scenario I'm presenting.

&gt; Do you realise how insanely competitive universities like Cambridge are?

Again, yes, thank you, I'm not stupid. There's a reason I'm considering going to one of the best universities in the world. If I don't get into an overseas school, I'll be applying to a large portion of Ivy league schools (Stanford, Harvard, Yale, etc.) because I have a fair chance of getting in, considering I'm rather intelligent. I don't entertain any notion that I'll be accepted to all or any of them, but I have enough confidence in the fact that I may possibly have a chance based on my grades and the level of coursework I've done to apply to said competitive universities. 

And I don't appreciate being talked to like I'm a bimbo based on the fact that I use informal language on a forum and don't feel the need to immediately inform everyone of my scholastic achievements, thank you.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; No, it is not irrelevant and nor is it hypothetical. You have the freedom of movement and residence in the entire European Union and it is one of the most fundamental rights that you have.

The ""free movement"" of people isn't a ""fundamental right"" in any sense of the word. That's just newspeak. It's a current law under rules of the European union. Classifying it as a fundamental right degrades our actual fundamental rights. 

&gt;Just look at how many British retirees there are in France, Spain and Cyprus to see just how important that right is to people from the United Kingdom and what they would be giving up if we left.

And would this be impossible if we didn't have free movement? It would mean you would have to fill out paperwork, but it wouldn't mean you couldn't go there. Think about all the English who currently live in Australia or America.. They managed to get there, and we don't have free movement of people with those countries. 

Acting as if the only way we can immigrate and emigrate is through ""free movement"" is just dishonest.

&gt;The exact same way we ""import"" them if we don't have all the extra millions - by funding them from general taxation.
This is not really a problem as the schools and hospitals will need built anyway due to population growth. If more taxpaying immigrants means that we need to build them sooner, then those immigrants are paying taxes to fund that infrastructure aren't they?

You keep missing the point. We have FINITE SPACE. 

Also, your argument that ""well the population is growing anyway, so let's just let it grow INCREDIBLY QUICKLY"" doesn't seem to make very much sense. I agree that with advanced medicine and life prolonging techniques, people will only live longer. As long as birth rates don't decrease by too much, the population will therefore grow.

However is it really logical to say ""well we have a projected population growth so that in 2080 or 2100 we will have 80/90 million people, therefore, let's speed that process up and have open borders NOW, because it wont' matter in the end anyway"".

This isn't very intelligent. Building hospitals and schools takes time. The fact that our population will grow is a HUGE problem anyway, before we even factor in immigration. I don't share your faith that everything will just magically sort itself out. These things have to be planned well in advance.

Just look at China's/India's current situation to see the perils of over population. That is something we should AVOID at all costs.

&gt;Then those immigrants are paying taxes to fund that infrastructure aren't they?

You seem to have this idea that there are unlimited jobs. There aren't. There are already high levels of unemployment, and with the advancement of automation technology, there will be less and less jobs. This means we should focus on keeping our (growing) population contained. 

This is before we even factor in the idea of wage compression. If we import cheap foreign labour, and people that will work for less (not because the British are naturally lazy as people claim, but because 7 polish guys who all come over and share a house can live in a much lower wage than an English person who has a flat and a child to support), then we see employers and big multi-nationals push wages down because they are able to do so.

We have seen jobs that were previously paying £8/9 an hour in the 90s, come down to minimum wage because of this phenomenon. And that's before we even account for inflation.

 
&gt;You have larger negotiating clout as a bloc of 350 million compared to 60 million, plus it's far far more difficult to negotiate with the EU if you are not a member - you have to follow all the rules yet you have no say in how they are made.

This is just not true. The population of a country is less relevant than the amount of IMPORTS you take when discussing free trade deals. Remember, Britain's economy is mainly a financial services industry, we aren't really a huge goods producer or exporter. It is other countries who would be paying the import tariffs to us, not the other way round. It is in their interests, as well as ours, to have a free trade agreement.

And we don't have to follow all the rules. There are some rules that we would have to follow, concerning import and export regulation as well as other things.. But for example, to say that we would have to have free movement of people in order to have a free trade agreement is just a flat out lie. So I repeat again, we wouldn't have to follow all the rules. Norway choose to follow many of the rules of their own accord, but they don't have to, and we wouldn't have to either.

Countries that trade together have to follow rules regardless of whether there is a free trade agreement anyway. This is how the import/export market work. There have to be agreed upon levels of safety inspection/quarantine procedure etc. None of this equates to the idea that ""we have to follow ALL the rules of the EU to have a free trade agreement"". 

&gt;That doesn't sound like an improvement to me.

Containing the population of our country so that the school system, welfare system, public housing system, and NHS are not overcrowded, I consider to be a huge improvement.

&gt;Unlike most people on this thread, I have actual direct experience of dealing with USCIS and the AOS process and I know that's a complete lie.

I'm not lying. Admittedly when I went to the USA this was in the 90s so perhaps it was easier then. However I applied for a 6 month work visa and it didn't take me any more than a few hours on the phone to the consulate and a couple of hours researching how to go through the process online. 

Even if it is a cumbersome process, it is hardly something that is going to take you months and months of constant arduous work to do. It is a minor inconvenience at best.

By this logic, surely you should support a complete open door immigration policy to the ENTIRE world? After all, may as well make it easier to immigrate/emigrate..

Assumptions made: if exact date of birth is not known, manager is assumed to have celebrated his birthday before the end of the season, which is assumed to fall between May and June regardless of actual date. The list is down to year resolution only, with more recent managers listed ahead in case of a tie.

I couldn't find birth dates for some managers, and for others it's doubtful if they qualify for the term manager, since this was ill defined early on. Some of the pioneers were secretaries for their clubs and had no responsibility for team selection, say. Alex Mackie, current record holder, was playing manager.

Rodgers is 41 and is fairly young, but not extremely so. Curiously most of the winning Liverpool managers have been quite old, and if it hadn't been for Dalglish, Rodgers would be set to become the youngest winning Liverpool manager by a large margin.

But France offered support in countering the Exocet and French-built fighters.

The US offered to loan the RN the *USS Iwo Jima* if *HMS Hermes* or *Invincible* had been rendered inoperable. They also provided SIGINT satellite support using a brand new satellite, which involved re-tasking it from Central America. And fuel.

true,Sosolidclaws,null,null,"&gt;The condescending tone throughout your comment generally implies you think you're better than me. And generally, as a female, when I'm talked down to, it's equivalent to being treated like a bimbo.

I would HIGHLY recommend you to shy away from such assumptions and statements. It could really make people think you're an idiot when you say things like that, especially in the UK where the culture is a bit different than in the US. I'm not saying you're not intelligent, but I'm telling you how a statement like that could and would be received badly, regardless of your intentions.

Furthermore, how on bloody earth could I have known that you were a girl? And why would you use the term ""bimbo"" if we're two strangers talking on the internet? Utterly ridiculous. Don't be that kind of person who victimises themself at the slightest opportunity. No one respects that.

I was not being condescending at all, by the way. I was simply informing you of the situation in case you *truly* didn't know how competitive Cambridge was. Just trying to help. I know that many people are not aware of relative rankings overseas.

Anyways, moving on!

&gt;I'm a year ahead in both French and math (i.e. I'm taking junior level math and French), a Julliard sponsored music course, and last semester I had a GPA of 4.06, though my cumulative for HS is 3.80

This is a great start, but it doesn't mean anything yet. I was also a year ahead in math, french, and social studies as a sophomore. 

Your application to Cambridge will be determined by your AP + SAT scores, with a bit of influence from your GPA. If you do not have multiple 5s and an SAT of at least 2100+, you will most likely not be considered by the university.

Since you're just a sophomore, you should know that coursework is going to get much harder in junior and senior year, so don't assume that your grades will stay that high just because you're an intelligent person. Even the best of us can perform worse than expected!

&gt;Thank you, for that. From the little bit I've looked at, it looks way harder for a foregin student from America to get into an undergrad program than say India.

This is not true, equal consideration is given to all international students. You must have just heard of many more rejections from americans because you actually *live* there, and not in India. 

&gt;What was the hardest part of the application process?

The personal statement was the most challenging aspect of it. For all UK applications, you are required to write a 6000 character (not word) college essay which incorporates EVERYTHING that you want to communicate to the university about yourself and your qualifications. This document is the ONLY thing that is sent to universities, and there are no supplements or additional essays.

Thus, as you can imagine, the task of fitting everything you want to express into a small 3-4 paragraph text is very, very difficult. It took me 4 months to write and refine mine.

Other than that, the interview is extremely challenging as well. The tutors who interview you are often hostile, and some could try and put you under pressure in order to see how you react. However, this is only something to worry about if you actually *do* get called up for interview (only around 20% of applicants do, on average).

&gt;What did you think they were mostly looking for?

Students with very high grades, very high motivation, and a very good background of the subject that they want to study for 3 years. They do not care about your personality, your musical ability, your athletic ability, or your creativity. At all. This is very different from the US!

&gt;Any differences between Cambridge and Oxford?

Oxford looks nicer and is more popular, Cambridge is higher ranked and more competitive. Both are great, but both are also very conservative and elitist. 

&gt;From your experience with applying to both

By UK university policy, you are never allowed to apply to both Cambridge and Oxford. You have to pick one. I picked Oxford because I visited the town, really liked the atmosphere, and found the brand name to be more well known internationally.

In the end, I had a profile that you would call 99% perfect, and I still didn't get in. That goes to show how hard it can really be. However, I applied for Law, which is the *most* competitive course in the country along with Medicine, so this is not perfectly representative of how it might be for you with Science. 

In the end, things to focus most on:

* Getting near perfect grades
* Learning a lot about your subject's background
* Working on your oral communication skills for the interview

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt;  I really have made a total shitter of my entire UCAS application

Well, just wait and see. The first time I went to uni it was on an insurance offer. I got a house with 3 other students. Of the 8 years I spent at uni, that first year living with 3 randoms was one of the best. I'm glad I didn't do halls. As it was I later stayed in halls and realized its not all that - good for making friends on day 1, but after that its pretty lame. Very expensive, very loud and pretty basic. You could get a double room with an ensuite in a nice part of town for the price you pay for a lot of halls singles with shared bathrooms!

Different unis have different criteria for how they dish out halls. Also, remember, halls vary from place to place. If you study in a modern city university then you're likely to find most halls bare little resemblance to the name...
 they are in fact quite smart high rise housing developments with lots of self contained flats, usually of 2-6 rooms with ensuite bathrooms and a shared kitchen. If you study somewhere more traditional or countryside-campus based then you might find things are slightly more old school with actual ""college halls"" where 10+ rooms share communal bathrooms and kitchens. 

A lot of cities also have companies that let out student-style lets. Same smart high rise developments, only run by a private company instead of the university, usually at a similar sort of rate. Some even have their own kitchens etc. instead of shared.

At any rate, it really doesn't matter that much. If its bad, just find a few other students (which in most towns won't be hard because they'll be about 10,000 people studying at the university) and go get a private rental house. it'll be cheaper, and it's just what you'll be doing in your second and third years anyway!

&gt; How come you spent 8 years at uni?

When/if you discuss your desire to move with a Graduate Tutor in another College, that Graduate Tutor will need to confer with your existing Graduate Tutor before making any commitment.

A house is a reducible expense but only to a certain point.

2. I'm talking about making runs when we was in possession. The one that really stands out is during the first half. Luiz had the ball just inside the Atletico half and there was plenty of space in behind the Atletico back four. Instead of making a run in behind he went towards Luiz and stood behind an Atletico player. Luiz rightfully bollocked him but it didn't make any difference.

3. The team pass accuracy was poor but they are different situations. When the defence or midfield had possession they was being pressed by 3 or 4 players and had to get the ball out of danger quickly. Torres on quite a few occasions had a bit of space and time, not a great deal of time but enough time to make a pass. Instead of passing though he would put his head down and run into the nearest Atletico player.

Do you know exactly what is being sent back to you and what size envelope you were planning to send?  The cost of the postage varies by size and weight.  If you know exactly what's coming back, have a look at http://www.royalmail.com/price-finder and just do it as UK-&gt;USA to see how much it would cost to cover it.

If you're happy enough to give out your address for someone to post stamps to you, maybe it would be easier to ask to post the SAE from in the UK instead?  Obviously no use if you have a handwritten cover letter or similar to go in first but if it's literally just an SAE or a printed letter it would save a lot of mucking about! :)

The sum of the whole is greater than any individual can contribute. Just sitting on your sofa watching TV eating a packet of crisps amounts to thousands of man hours of work. You'll never be able to pay that back, not even spent an entire life working in miserable conditions down a coal mine.

I've certainly taken more from society than I could ever contribute back; I have a house without knowing the first think about building houses, electricity without knowing anything about high voltages, music despite being of dubious musical ability, security despite not knowing how to fight.

We divide labour and we make sure everyone is taken care of. You can never even hope to contribute more to the collective total of society than is given to you in your first minute of your life when you come out kicking, screaming and dependent on the support of thousands of people that prepare food, make cloths and ensure your water is safe to drink.

You've concocted this notion that there is a caste of people you are allowed to alienate because they don't do as much, but the reality is that they want to contribute and that it is simply a matter of organisation that there aren't enough jobs, despite the cracks is the pavements or the dirt on the walls of our neighbourhoods.

Also, on another note she seems to be a very genuine and nice person, met her once and she impressed me quite a bit.

Incidentally, I did find NI21's decision to put up posters and release party literature in Irish a very nice gesture and a sign of their intent to move away from old Unionism. They also openly take part in discussions on Irish Unity and present their position reasonably and intelligently (I still consider them very progressive Unionists rather than the neutral designation they've got) McCrea and McCallister are two class acts and hopefully they are going to change the face of NI politics for the better by dragging Unionism into the 21st Century.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The ""free movement"" of people isn't a ""fundamental right"" in any sense of the word. That's just newspeak. It's a current law under rules of the European union. Classifying it as a fundamental right degrades our actual fundamental rights.

But it IS a fundamental right for me - EU law guarantees it.

I am an EU Citizen, my passport says ""European Union"" and the relevant legislation guarantees my freedom of movement along with the other fundamental rights.

That's not newspeak - that's reality.

&gt; Think about all the English who currently live in Australia or America.. They managed to get there, and we don't have free movement of people with those countries.

Not without loads of paperwork, which is something that I just don't have to worry about in the EU.

&gt; But for example, to say that we would have to have free movement of people in order to have a free trade agreement is just a flat out lie. So I repeat again, we wouldn't have to follow all the rules. 

That's what Switzerland thought when they introduced migration caps like you are proposing.

Suspension from ERASMUS, suspension from universities funding deals and possible further actions to follow.

If you don't follow the rules, you don't get all the nice things and you still have to pay to play.

Why is that a good deal?

&gt; There are already high levels of unemployment

I think you missed the news recently about unemployment falling, wages rising faster than inflation and the United Kingdom seeing the strongest growth in the G7.

&gt; By this logic, surely you should support a complete open door immigration policy to the ENTIRE world? After all, may as well make it easier to immigrate/emigrate..

Oh come now, that's a poor argument and you know it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No need for the sarcasm, and I didn't begin to even claim I'm faultless, obviously. 

What I'm saying, is that the expectation of a keeper, at *any* level, including the level I play at, and the Premier League, is to be  **100% faultless**.  

This is just a fact, and I don't understand why anyone would take issue with it.  Have you *ever* seen a keeper let in a terrible goal, and the commentators say ""well, he hasn't done that yet today, or recently, so I guess that's alright!""  

No.  You don't.  It's a tough world for a keeper. Of course mistakes will happen.  You don't actually expect 0 faults by a keeper over a season, but at a game to game level, you expect perfection on the routine plays from your keeper.   The first goal Sunderland scored was a routine save that he made an absolute blunder on.  Horrific keeping on that.  A penalty shot is a routine play for a keeper as well, and Swarzer did basically the only thing you ask a keeper not to do on a penalty, that being choreographing exactly where he's diving. 

&gt; I dunno how you would have saved that penalty but I can't wait hear...

We are fans of the same team... why are you being so rude and facetious to me?  Just why?  I honestly don't understand.  Did you miss the part where I said:

**&gt;Of course it's completely unreasonable to ask a penalty save of any keeper**

With regard to the penalty though, Swarzer fucked it up.  He just did.  Watch it again if you don't believe me... there's really not much to argue about.  Hell the commentators that I was watching even said so at the time. 

I don't blame him.  For a backup who hasn't seen much game action, facing a penalty, in *extremely* stressful circumstances.  But still, he screwed up. 

Just watch it again.  Borini does his stutter step, nowhere near the ball, and Swarzer is already moving.  Borini has his head up more or less the whole time, and the whole world can **very easily** see that Swarzer is definitely going down to his right.  Its so obvious.   Rather than having a shot at a save, he's told Borini exactly where to shoot it for a simple goal. 

Don't be so stupid to suggest that because I can recognize poor goalkeeping on a penalty, I think I would have saved it.  It's objective, and its there for you to watch.  

**TL;DR::  First goal was definitely swarzers fault.  Penalty was a free goal provided to Borini by Swarzer.  No we don't expect or anticipate a save, but we also can't expect our keeper to just open up half the goal on a penalty**.

Schwarzer, or Hilario if they want to keep Schwarzer safe for the second leg.

Ivanovic, Cahill, Luiz and Cole at the back. They have a lack of strength in depth at the back at the moment so they can't really change much.

Lampard is suspended for the second leg while Matic and Salah are cup tied, so they'll almost definitely play. Oscar and Schurrle could also come into the starting line-up, then up front it's a toss up between Ba and Torres.

It's not the best line-up by far, but it's certainly one that shouldn't be underestimated, which is something that could be said for whatever line-up they actually go with on Sunday. I have full confidence that we'll get the result we need on Sunday but there's no point believing any of this weakened side stuff!

No, he didn't.  He did nothing today that wasn't routine and expected.  That's not to diminish the performance, that is simply the case for most keepers in most games.   He made all the the routine plays, *very* well, and he was rock solid today, but he certainly didn't do anything that is worth writing home about, or anything that will be included in Chelsea highlight reels in the future. 

Having said that, I'm on board with calling him fantastic today.  It's very difficult to come in mid-match.  Especially for him. After the weekend, he probably wasn't expecting to see the field at all for the rest of the year.  You still train hard, but you can't fight common sense, and common sense said he'd never get back into play.  

My hat goes off to him today.  However, I stand by my point that he just isn't good enough for Chelsea.   That blunder on the weekend is completely unforgivable. That's *exactly* the type of play you NEED your backup keeper to be able to make.   Beyond that, he really messed that penalty up, to a degree that Cech *never* would.

true,wobinidan,null,null,"I know this comment is too late and hardly anyone will see it. But I'm going to type it anyway.

My brother has mild cerebral palsy. Mild in the sense that he's able to live by himself, able to go to the shops by himself, even go to the pub and watch the football. Which brings me to the disability part. He has cerebral palsy. His reaction times to a question range from 5 seconds to 30 seconds. He never makes eye contact. He has cerebral palsy. He receives benefits from the government because he's disabled.

After the tory government got in, he was summoned to an ATOS test. I know ATOS has been ditched now, but I doubt the new system will be much better. ATOS  did their test and decided he was fit to work and didn't deserve any government money. 

Fit to work where? Outside of the few places that hire mentally disabled people, there are literally no companies that would hire him. 

So my mum took him to a tribunal regarding his benefits. They immediately decided that he should get benefits and they were reinstated. 

It's bullshit what happened to my brother. But he had two major factors that helped him. Firstly, my parents were there to dispute the situation. They dealt with the paperwork and tribunals and all that shit that he was made to go through. He would not have been able to do that himself. Secondly, he has a visible disability, which is apparent to anyone that tries to talk to him. 

So it is really horrific to think about the people who either have no family support, or no visible disability, or neither of those things.

Integrated sun visors are the dogs dangly bits. Not only do you not have to carry a spare visor, you can ride with the main (clear) one up and have the sun visor down if you want more air flow, but still want to protect your eyes.

I think the best advice on going integrated or not is to consider what type of riding you do. If you only ride for fun in summer, or have another means of transport you use more often, then swapping them is probably not a big deal.

If you ride every day though, or go touring, an integrated visor is indispensable. I know I won't get a lid without one now.

What I'm saying is not a contradiction, although I see how poor wording might lead to that conclusion. 

The expectation is 100% faultlessness.  In reality, you're never going to get 100%, but that doesn't change the expectation.  The expectation remains 100%, but the results likely fall short.   Same way I expect to not piss on the toilet seat 100% of the time, but in reality, its more like 95-99%.  Make sense?

&gt;I think you're being downvoted for saying that he ensued the goal and may as well have left the net, which is absolutely ludicrous. He picked a side and got it wrong, get over it. He might look like he's already planning to go one side but what is to stop him from jumping the other way when the ball is kicked,

I'm sorry, but watch it again, because I am unarguably right.  He choreographed it hard.  The way he leaned, *with his legs*.  I play keeper at a high level.  You can believe me or not, but this is something I spend and have spent a *long time* practicing, watching, and studying.   100% of my coaches and fellow keepers I've spoken with agree.  The commentators I was listening to called him out for it at the time.  It was a mistake.  

&gt; He's actually not that far away from the penalty anyway, as Borini nearly kicks it at him

It was a poor shot from Borini.  Minimally executed.  Had Hazard, for example, taken that penalty, it would have looked exactly the same with the ball a foot or two further to the right.  



&gt;Keeping eye contact on the keeper is exactly how Hazard takes his penalties and I hate it. The second a keeper second guesses him it'll end in disaster 

This shows a definitive lack of understand of penalty mechanics.  I don't know what else to say.  The keeper literally cannot second guess when this is done properly.  It isn't possible.  Keeping an on on the goalie is not committing to sliding a slower penalty.  If there's no read, Hazard would smash it.  Simple as that. 

I guess you and everyone else can downvote.  I know exactly what I'm talking about.  Professionals agree.  The commentators I was listening to agree.  The lads from TalkSport said the same thing.  

I'm sorry I said something negative about Chelsea in this sub.  I'll just stop.

Cleverley is an odd one, he has reached the point I would have expected any player to start showing their potential, but I feel his lack of first team games and a lack of a ""set"" role at Man Utd has done his career harm, if Bobby thinks he is worth the money I would gladly see how it plays out.

Schwarzer could have trouble holding onto them if they're good hits, and Sturridge or Sterling will be able to tuck in the rebound. If we get, say, a 2-0 lead within the first half, go for a third. Our problem seems to be killing off games, so if we get a third, we can begin to relax a bit and enjoy the rest of the game. Exploit Chelsea's missing players if Hazard/Terry/Cech/Ramires are out. Press them hard, pin them back in their own half. Force them to resort to hoofs, because Skrtel, Sakho and Agger are all more than capable of winning it against Torres, Ba or Eto'o.

true,pjz4302,null,null,"If you looked at anyone hard enough you could diagnose a few mental health issues ( I was told that by a doctor in work).

The key thing to remember with criminals or what have you is that they are all individual people so they are all different and have had different experiences. However certain aspects are very common.

Usually for the majority of my ""customers"" its a combination of all sorts of things, mental illnesses, bad parenting, addiction issues and not being very smart.

Its the least intelligent ones that tend to be poor at thinking of long term consequences, poor at coping with stress and problem solving. As a result they tend to lash out, start taking drugs, refuse to see other possibilities, lack compassion, feel a need to overcompensate by being aggressive and very vocal and so on.

I feel in many of the youths and young adults I deal with that at least part of it is genetic and part is bad nutrition from a young age, they tend to be less healthy, smaller and unhealthier looking as well as being less intelligent. 

Less intelligent people will tend to go with less intelligent people, have less intelligent kids. As they struggled at school they don't see the point in it so don't encourage the kids, who again fail to do well at school, leaving them less options so they resort to alcohol abuse, smoking, drug abuse, sex and inevitably crime. This behaviour can be made worse by mental health issues or cause them which doesn't help. Or they start these things due to parental or peer influence or a lack of other options.

Again the substance abuse isn't helped by the poor judgement many of my customers have.

Honestly, with good parenting (or even any parenting), more support at schools, more career opportunities and better mental health care I think crime rates would fall dramatically.

Its sad, these people tend to do life in prison short stretches at a time and they are to be pitied and helped rather than demonized, but the behaviour cycles they go through need to be stopped early on before it gets too late! Too often intervention is too lenient so it is inefficient and not backed up by support from all sorts of agencies that are very much needed.

Other people get caught up in the wrong thing, others do something stupidly and are never in trouble again, others are severely mentally ill. Then some people are just cunts.

If you're anything like me you're always super anxious whenever JT isn't playing in our defence; we just seem to lack solidity without him. Imagine the reassurance his presence gives to the younger and less experienced members of the squad. He's like an extension of Mourinho on the pitch, just watch him marshall people. We're a better team with him around despite his physical decline, which speaks volumes about the qualities i've talked about.

2) A solid era-long plot arc. This will probably have a lot to do with the possible return of the Time Lords. Smith's era created a rather good arc with the cracks in the universe, ""Doctor Who?"", the Silence, Trenzalore, and the impossible girl, but it was a little bit difficult to follow. Moffat (all criticism aside) will hopefully remain showrunner for all of Capaldi's tenure and be able to design a beautiful story line to bring back Gallifrey and the Time Lords.

I'm not saying every boy and girl can (or can't) escape poverty if they simply ""work hard enough"", I'm saying it shouldn't be *expected* to be anybody else's *responsibility* but your own, as to whether or not you achieve your aspirations such as; making a better life for yourself and your family, than the life you were born into.

It means stop peering over the fence and berating your neighbour who has a nicer garden than you and scapegoating them for the state of yours. It means start minding your own business and just concentrate on improving your own garden. Their garden didn't make itself (even if they inherited it, somebody began somewhere) and they haven't taken anything away from yours to make theirs the way it is. Their garden just makes yours look worse in comparison. *Disclaimer: I think we should be obligated to help those who legitimately can’t help themselves.*

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"I wanted to post how we are likely to see the same team take to the pitch as against Norwich but the more I think about it, the more I am unsure. The biggest reason why the same team will be fielded is Hendo's suspension and Sturridge's injury. We simply do not have any other players who have the kind of match experience/involvement as the eleven that started on Sunday, with the exception of Daniel Agger and possibly Kolo Toure.

Now the reason why that is a problem is simple, Mourinho is aware of these facts even more than you and me. Basically Rodgers is playing his cards face up because the circumstances are the way they are, nothing can be done about it. Sure Sturridge may be rushed back but I'm not too sure he'll be risked/chosen given the unfortunate time of his injury. May be used from the bench though. Mourinho has vastly more players available and he can (even with the recent injuries and suspensions) call on a lot more quality from the bench. Perhaps the biggest loss is Petr Cech, but Schwarzer is a very good performer and has been playing at this level for years. There simply aren't more experienced and tested keepers out there. Sure, Salah isn't Hazard and Mikel isn't Ramires, but the players coming in for those who will be missing at Chelsea poses a lot of quality and different types of skills, which Mourinho will be sure to try to take advantage of.

The next argument is Chelsea's poor form. This is a good argument, however, this will be a very special game. Everybody will do their best to perform to their highest standard (and beyond). Perhaps this is where we have our most noticeable edge. Our team is a lot more coherent, has spent many more minutes, in sequence, playing together and know each other that little bit better. However the relationship between Mourinho and Rodgers is the one with the least secrets, or if you want, the greatest mutual understanding, in the Premier League. 

That last part is what got me thinking, who will try to make a fancy play and come up with something outside of the box. If either Jose or Brendan will try it of course. It's very possible that BR will just stick with the players he trusts and attempt to condition them to be unleashed at Chelsea the very moment the ref starts the match clock. My opinion is that Rodgers may well see how little effort it would be for Mourinho to adapt/prepare against such a Liverpool squad. Therefore it stands to reason Brendan may be the one to try a fancy play.

Most likely the on pitch tactics and instructions will have changed for the eleven who started against Norwich. Either Lucas drops down next to Gerrard, Allen and Lucas drop deep and Gerrard moves a bit higher up. Another option is Liverpool starting in a 4-2-2-2, with Sterling and Suarez playing up top, behind them two teams made up with Allen, Coutinho, Gerrard and Lucas in midfield. I've also considered the 3-5-2 formation, this one seems the least likely, yet not impossible. All in all I'm again leaning toward 4-3-3 being the best starting setup for us on Sunday with a few tweaks. I'd even consider returning Agger into the squad in Sakho's stead. Neville and Carragher convinced me that Sakho/Škrtel just doesn't function as well yet.

I'm not a coach, journalist, pundit, ex pro player, whatever significant in the world of football. Just a fan, who's been watching this game for many years. I've missed/left out several other very important factors that will come into play, but one thing is certain. This will be a very tight game. Not least because of how well the two managers know and understand each other. It will be, if you will, another case of student versus teacher. Their philosophy may differ considerably but nobody understand either of them on the pitch as well as the other.

I don't think we'll figure this one out too well until the teams are presented and out on the pitch. After that prepare for a wild ride and I really really wish us all to enjoy that ride and come out of the match singing, shouting, grinning, celebrating ... absorbing... another very good result in this very remarkable season.",0,1398212104,null,0,false,0,cgzgxj6,t3_23py31,t1_cgzgxj6,t3_23py31,null,1433476668,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

The Tories are fundamentally a conglomeration of a mish mash of distinct and largely contradictory reactionary policies. For instance there is no real overlap between Thatcherism and One Nation conservatism but they are both reactions against some modern trend so both come under the conservative wing. It is hilarious seeing them try to handle the contradictions inherent in wild dog eat dog free market capitalism v the touchy feely ""all in this together"" one nation conservatism. Or see the ultra liberal Thatcherites stumble over their need to keep the cornerstone authoritarians on board. How does a libertarian reach a compromise with somebody who thinks morality should be enforced by the heavy hand of the state?

Ironically despite all this the left ends up infighting far more often over far more trivial divides. The Tories some how hold together despite their contradictions.

Even if Chelsea win at Anfield (which, obviously, BIG 'If'), and they win their last two league games after that, they still have to count on City (and us) dropping points. Going full-tilt on the league is a huge bet, even if they do everything right between now and the end of the season.

&gt;__Rosemary Nelson__ (4 September 1958 – 15 March 1999) was an Irish human rights solicitor who was killed by a [loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) paramilitary group in 1999. It has been suggested that British Security Forces were involved in her killing; an inquiry into her death found no evidence of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security or secret services, but could not rule out the possibility that individual members of the security forces were involved in her killing.

Pritchard doesn't really even have to start. Such an expectation would be unrealistic anyway considering he's had no time to work with this first team squad. What would be fair would be for him to come on late to replace Eriksen if he is played wide, or whoever else is playing LW at the time. 

Frankly, it's because Pritchard is a LW (and because he's done so well in his loan and deserves such a reward), that I think he should get a brief look in if nothing else. The position has been an absolute sore spot for us ever since Bale went inverted, and continued when we failed to address it in our summer spending spree. Chadli, Siggy, and Townsend all look uncomfortable in the position, and Eriksen uses the spot to roam while also not quite providing the pace necessary for a Prem winger.

When I was growing up, there was definitely a big ""thing"" about cartoons of any variety other than the Simpsons and South Park being ""for kids"" - and so as soon as you hit 12 or 13, secondary school age, you just stopped watching them. Not a parental thing, just something us early teenage types decided was the case, as you tend to do.  May have coincided with meeting girls and being very interested in practical biology and getting your hand on a fag lighter or your dads booze stash for the first time.

Nowadays there seems to be more awareness of things like anime and the more adult / mature themed stuff on Adult Swim, so people grow up and graduate from one to the other as they age. But for anyone born before the 90's in the UK there was always that mindset I think.

 Example of myself: I knew shit all about anime except Pokémon, which my generation missed in its first big wave by a couple of years.

Around 1/4 the population of countries like Slovakia and Romania speak English as a 2nd language well enough to be considered fluent, even more have knowledge enough to have a conversation in English. The number is far higher in Poland and Holland.

English is also considered a very hard language to grasp as we have words that sounds the same but mean different things, live in a house- live performance, there, their, they're, see and sea. We also have genderless nouns which also don't help. That coupled with the huge number of British and American accents makes the language tricky to understand for even a native speaker at times.

Also I think you'll find a lot of the bad degrees as you so 'aptly' called them are in medicine, law and science.

Anyone who led you to believe buddhism was non-violent and all peace and karma isn't being completely honest or isnt aware of its history in its homelands, that might be the story that has been sold to the west but in the Buddhist homelands its brutal as fuck. Western buddhism was created to explicitly appeal to western sensibilities. [DT Suzuki](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._T._Suzuki) was one of the main people to bring buddhism to the west.

After independence the Buddhist majority used exclusionary, nationalist,  racist identity politics equivalent to our neo-nazis to ban the tamil language them, exclude them from public office, prevent them from entering university, encouraged progroms against them, burnt a museums full of ancient irreplaceable artifacts of tamil history and then Black July happened.

As for the latter, he's no doubt quality but the question is whether we really need another CB, when we've got the budding pair of Sakho and Ilori (remember him?), who looks pretty solid in his games with Granada.

Chadli's been quite good, in fact I believe he'd be a fantastic striker for us. However, while in his cameos on the left wing he's been particularly solid in his defensive coverage, he has looked quite lost and lacking on confidence when over the ball. When played centrally, he's looked far more comfortable and willing to take on defenders or look for a forward pass. I think he's a damn quality player, and for that I hope he has a future with us.

Right now, Enrique is an unknown, and Johnson may be on his way out. Flanno can be good for a FB position, maybe Wisdom as well, but if Enrique and Johnson leave, we need at least two more fullbacks.

If Agger (I say Agger because it's most likely him, but it could be any centerback) leaves, he'll need replacing, unless Ilori can step up next season.

We could look into another midfielder, but I think in his new position, it would be unwise to stick a pure DM (Like M'vila) next to Stevie. We'd basically be looking for a deep-playmaker backup for him, and then for our other two CM spots, we have Hendo, Allen, Coutinho, and perhaps Suso.

I expect Agger, Reina, Johnson, Kelly, Assaidi, and Aspas to leave this summer. Borini replaces Aspas, and Kelly, Assaidi, and Reina don't need replacing, so I would expect our summer business to be a winger, two fullbacks, a center back, and perhaps a younger, deep CM. From there, I would expect to see more of Alberto, Suso, Ibe, Texeira, and perhaps Wisdom, Smith, and Ilori to fill out the team.

Dunno what you mean about Flanno and physical gifts. He has everything it takes to be a solid fullback. He's also not reached his full potential so its a bit early to make a judgement on that. 

Wisdom and Kelly are defenders. Currently both have been played at fullback. We saw Wisdom first hand as a fullback and he did very well. lacking in attack, but defensively he was better than current Glen Johnson. if either of them play, they will play as Fullbacks and IMO they will do just fine. Our strength is in our midfield players and counterattacks. As long as our fullbacks can defend and provide an outlet everyonce in a while, we'll be okay. We don't need a Luke Shaw type. 

It'd be nice, but I don't think its a desperate situation just yet. They way our midfield works, I think its more important to sign 2 CLASS players because our attackers are going to be exhausted with the constant pressing that Brendan demands.

I said its not a priority because the budget is 40 mil. If 40 mil can sign 1-2 good midfielders AND a fullback, then of course that would be best.

My mum's kind of old, she when going to uni, and doing her PGCE, was paid to do so.  At the time roughly 3% of the population went to university and had a degree.  My father never had a degree, yet had a more *professional* job, and earned a lot more money.

If you didn't have a degree, you were in the 97% of the population, the vast majority.

Now, Labours 50% goal kicks in.  You sure as shit know that isn't going to be 50% spread evenly across all socio-economic groups.  Plenty of the poorest will require their children to earn money asap, and consider any schooling a waste of time.

So now if you don't have a degree, the person next to you probably does.  The degree becomes an instant who's in the bottom 50% test.

If someone thinks it's not worth the costs, which only start to be paid back once you are at £21k per year, then frankly, they have so little confidence in themselves.

We also have a perverse situation, where lots of students have degrees which are frankly worthless, they haven't demonstrated skills of independent learning, research etc.  Some have been poorly trained at best, with no useful transferable skills (I say this wearing my hiring person hat for software development).  It's very hard for someone who's know experience of higher education to know which are the institutes and courses that are the best use of their time and money.

If someone is a drug addict we should offer them cheap (drugs are only expensive because of prohibition) and legal prescriptions through the NHS like we used to do with Heroin back in the dizzay (I thoroughly recommend a book called Flat Earth News by Nick Davies. It's been a couple of years since I read it but from what I can remember heroin only became a problem once it was made illegal. We went from less than 500 addicts to thousands and thousands in under 10 years because of prohibition). This combined with therapy/support seems like the logical thing to do. 


We also need to move away from abstinence only programs (because they are ridiculously ineffective). I would love to see some government funded research into Ibogaine.

**6th Doctor:** Brash, bold, arrogant. Still there was kinder side to him. Very complicated, which didn't get fully explored on TV but has been in Audio. He and the 8th have by far come across the best in this medium.  
**7th: Doctor:** Kind of zany and goofy at first, and the more calculated and almost ruthless towards the end. He was playing chess while everyone else was playing checkers and he had no problem using people for ""the greater good"".

It really isn't, actually it's considered to be one of the most easy to learn, possibly difficult to master but being fluent in English is not difficult compared to learning alot of other languages.

One of my lecturers was from Cyprus, great teacher but as she herself put it ""migrant labour both skilled and unskilled can be positive and negative"" she went on to explain that this was obviously because if the skills needed can already be fulfilled then it only serves to drive wages down and leads to unemployment unless the migrants start businesses or cause other jobs to be created through other means. Lets not even get into the obvious effect on house prices and the greater strain on the NHS (although to be fair the NHS one can be balanced out with migrant doctors).

There is no doubt that politically, SF outmanoeuvre practically everyone, to a degree that really shows up the extremely poor leadership of most other parties. Even Tony Blair mentions in his biography that he much respected their political skill. And they're certainly making all the right gestures.

But therein lies a problem. Do those gestures have real meaning behind them, or are they merely saying the right things at the right times as part of their brilliant political plays? 

Whenever they say they regret deaths, do they regret that they once supported the people planting the bomb, or do they regret that there was someone inconveniently standing next to it and adding another mark to the 'collateral damage' tally?

Thats one of the reasons they are brilliant. You just don't know. If you support them even on a superficial level, you'll probably read it in the positive way. If you are foreign media, especially the Irish loving US media, you'll take it at face value. The people who feel that the campaign of violence was directed at them? The people who lost loved ones, whether innocent or security forces? How can they not help but wonder if it's the more sinister reading? (And of course, the ex-PIRA 'hardcore' can read it this way and not feel like they've been sold out). How could anyone of a traditionally Unionist background vote for Sinn Fein with this level of ambiguity over the past? 

The DUP rightly get mocked for their pathetic attempts at 'outreach' to those traditionally in the other camp. But in reality, SF have just the same problem. Probably worse, in fact, because a) demographics are shifting in their favour and they don't even need to pretend to need converts to nationalism and b) At least the DUP can convincingly pretend they weren't linked to paramilitaries. The problems still there, they've just got it well papered over by doing all the right political plays.

so far i have just been playing around with it and trying to learn a bit about photography by experimentation. i have a book about it that i should put in some time with, but i find that i learn more by screwing around with things first, fucking up a lot, then trying to figure out why by reading after.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I can offer some information about your missed MRI appointment.

The scanners are contsantly powered on due to the way they work, and will probably scan dozens of patients each day.  Being very complicated machines they can also take a couple of days to fix when they go wrong.  

Also, I assume you were having a cardiac MRI?  There are relatively few radiologists who do these at the moment as it's a pretty new discipline.  Each study is complex and needs to be meticulously planned.  The planning also takes into account the results of other tests like echo cardiography and ECG so if those aren't available the appointment will be rescheduled.

I must agree that your local trust sounds a bit haphazard.  This won't be the fault of the doctors and nurses, rather that of a target driven culture increasing throughput too much.  Plenty of things don't ""need"" to be done within the target, but politicians and patients ""want"" them to be (OP you are not included in this as congenital heart disease is no joke).  Your trust will offer you appointments in different hospitals so you can be seen more quickly.  They should know when you are at a different appointment (my trust will ""block off"" a patient in a centralised system).

Just remember though, that it's a socialised system and whilst it can appear woefully inefficient, it's still better and cheaper than the other options.  It would be ruinous to suffer from a congenital disease in America.  Here, you only have to pay your own NI contributions.

My plan to make things better?  Increase funding, cut middle management waste, eliminate targets for some things, lawyer up, hit the gym

Could you name me one elected, serving politician in the UK or Ireland for whom this isn't an open question?

&gt; Whenever they say they regret deaths, do they regret that they once supported the people planting the bomb, or do they regret that there was someone inconveniently standing next to it and adding another mark to the 'collateral damage' tally?

They *don't* openly regret that they supported the person planting the bomb. Whether they do privately or not is another matter, but I would suggest that they probably don't. I'm sure they do regret innocent deaths though. This is the IRA you're talking about, not the UVF, who openly admit they were waging a sectarian campaign of terror.

&gt;  How could anyone of a traditionally Unionist background vote for Sinn Fein with this level of ambiguity over the past?

There needs to be an independent international truth commission and then there will be less ambiguity over the past. You can't expect Sinn Fein to start confessing to everything when the British justice system is ideologically opposed to Irish republicans. You can say otherwise and point out the OTR letters, but the fact there are no OTRs on the state side is because state actors got promoted and were never prosecuted, so didn't have to go OTR. It is of course the state and unionists who oppose such a process because then the extent of collusion would be revealed for all to see, and then the narrative about the IRA being primary agitator would be compromised. 

There's also a massive media bias against republicans when discussing the past. The *default* media position is to blame the IRA or bolster the state narrative mentioned above. There's all kinds of hypocrisy, for example the painting of Gerry Kelly as having psychopathic tendencies for shooting a prison warden, when the same language is not applied to state forces or the Army. In the absence of an even-handed media tone, and an independent international truth and reconciliation process, it makes absolutely no sense for Sinn Fein to come out regretting everything as you can be sure unionists won't make the same gesture. Sinn Fein are therefore right to respond that there were multiple combatant groups and that they regret all deaths.

As far as I know, the Haass talks created some common agreement on dealing with the past, but guess what? It wasn't implemented. Some parties or other refused to sign up to Haass, wasting the poor man's time and making NI look like a bunch of fools. Which parties did that? Oh yeah! Unionists.

true,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"It's a complicated area and depends on the framing of the question. If you were to ask which religion people identify with out of the major ones you would get a statistic that suggested a majority were Christian. 

Yet if you were to frame it a different way you would fine a majority either 'non-religious' or no religion.

[In a 2011 YouGov poll, 34% of UK citizens claimed they believed in a God or gods.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom)

The conclusion you might draw from that is that while a majority identify as culturally 'Christian', they do not subscribe to the actual faith and beliefs of Christianity.

This makes sense, as even Richard Dawkins himself as ['culturally Christian'.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7136682.stm). Given the right framing even he would be lumped into the 'Christian' category.

Meanwhile the same 2011 survey, when compared to earlier statistics seems to suggest a growing ['non-religious' number - up 10% points- and a shrinking Christian number - down 12% points.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/detailed-characteristics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/sty-religion.html). Muslim numbers were up 2%, although they are still in the minority by a large stretch. 

The majority I doubt would identify as specifically 'atheist', although I suspect this has more to do with the word being controversial to some, who might prefer 'agnostic', even though they can mean the same thing in context.

""Neither really need their patron saints to celebrate nationhood.""

&gt;But others draw a distinction between St George and other patron saints of the British Isles. ""St Andrew's and St Patrick's Day celebrations reflect the assertion of an identity distinct from the dominant English identity,"" says Robert Ford, a lecturer in politics at the University of Manchester.

&gt;Anyone who has ever taken anything to do with economics (doesn't have to be advanced) will tell you the exact same thing, 

Except they don't.  The old adage of two economists in a room giving three opinions springs to mind.  I don't know where you studied, but if they ever gave the mantra of *this is some irrefutable fact* then you should write to the Chancellor.

Crime doesn't always correlate to GINI either, I'm in a place right now (guess where time!) that every one in 6 house holds are true millionaires (in USD), by that, I mean disposable income, not just paper or tied up in assets such as housing or businesses.

However this isn't the point, I think that those people who are doing criminal acts, are doing so not out of some dickensian necessity, but because they feel no connection to society, no shame, no need to follow the rules.

Read into some mathematics that interests you, so you could talk about that if asked. Maths interviews will mostly be answering questions. Ask your teacher to do a mock interview - if you practise answering questions under pressure the real thing will be less daunting. However, it's not scary - the interviewer will be trying to help you.

**Exams**

STEP is important, but make sure you do sufficiently well on your A Levels too. If you work hard on STEP, the maths A Levels will mostly look after themselves, but don't disregard your Physics and Chemistry. For STEP, do as many questions as you can. Don't look up solutions until you've had a really good attempt. See the Student Room or try Ask NRICH for help if you get stuck.

**College**

Choose a college based on whether you'd like to spend 3 years in it. You might want to think about location, number of people doing your subject, accommodation, relevant fellows, etc. The Student Room has further advice on picking a college.

**Generally**

Yes you can opt out of it, but is there any point?

The average period is 17 weeks or whatever you agree with your company. 

My working week is 50hrs. Minus an hour each day for breaks that leaves me at 45 hours. Each day I do an hours overtime. That brings me back up to 50 hours each week. Now heaven forbid that I average 50 hours each week for the 17 week period. I'm breaking the law.

But I have a weeks holiday (in 17weeks or 4 months) I'm pretty much guaranteed to have a holiday. So my basic hours are 45.

So we have 17 x 50 = 850 
850 - 45 = 805
805 \ 45 = 47.35

Prince Bandar, who allegedly blackmailed Putin over the Sochi olympics by saying he'd hold back extremists in Dagestan from attacking during the games (that was always going to go down well with Vlad) has now resigned, which is why I think there was some progress made at the recent meeting about Ukraine. Which the US is now pissing all over. But they won't be able to count on UK support this time because Obama fucked over Cameron royally with the Syrian vote in parliament (Labour did the dirty work on his behalf). Have you noticed there's been no more chummy meetings between cameron and obama? Last I saw was a pic around the G7 table, and that was staged of course.

And there is plenty to blame Blair for, but radicalism funded by the west goes back a loooooooong long time. It's not A + B = jihadists. It's far more complicated, but ultimately is down to oil. Which is why the gov is handing over big £££ to more local energy suppliers.

That's why he's saying to put aside differences.

edit: oh yeah, and Van Rompuy had a sleepover with Cameron this week. I'm quite sure we'll see the EU suddenly deciding that it's a good idea to go with renegotiation after all, seeing as what Cameron wants is for Syria to be sorted, and he is going to keep our relationship with Russia more or less as it is to achieve this and not go whole-heartedly for full-on sanctions, plus it's a way to head off the really quite awful move to the extreme right wing in europe if the public knows that those in power are making a concession (which will be parceled up as placating the UK of course).

I felt a bit sick when I saw a pie chart with the wealth of the nation divided up. 

The bottom 50% of the households have just 10% of the nation's wealth. The top 10% had 44% of the nation's wealth. 

How do you qualify as the top 10% you ask? To qualify as the top 10%, you need an overall wealth of £967,000 or more. Half of this qualifying sum comes from pension pot size.

This should leave a bad taste in our mouths. There is a serious problem with wealth inequality in this country. 

This pamphlet really changed my view of things. Wealthy inequality should be regarded as a national crisis. Something needs to be done to rectify it!  

My view is that we should be actively redistributing the wealth. I am in favour of a robin-hood tax to attempt to balance the picture a bit more. If we redistribute 10% towards the poorest members of society, we'd probably all be richer anyway from the increase economic activity.

At the end of the day, there is a point with wealth where having _more_ doesn't really give you any improvement in living standard.

I was reading [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/23mh4t/serious_time_to_have_a_discussion_about/) on /r/islam yesterday in which the commenters seemed to agree that Islam is fundamentally against secularism.  This  worries me.  (And presumably, the commenters on /r/islam are not even considered extremists.  These are the liberal muslims!)

It seems to me that this is one of the defining issues of our times.  How to reconcile Islam and the West when it seems like Islam is diametrically opposed to so many Western values?

It's hard not to look at world news as and avoid the conclusion that Islam is involved in a good proportion of the wars and atrocities that we read about daily.  Even home news is becoming more and more about Islamic extremism. 

Imagine you were a cool-headed rational head of state who had to make a realistic risk assessment of the likely international threats to the UK.  Is it not the case that extremist Islam would currently rank pretty high in that list?

And to be honest, I don't think it's just 'extremist' Islam.  We all like to pretend that 'regular' Islam is peaceful and tolerant but what if that's just not true?  I've read a good amount of the Quran and it describes one of the least tolerant ideologies I've ever encountered.  I really wish I could say that it's a moderate philosophy which has been twisted by fanatics, but I can't.  But don't take my word for it - [read it for yourself](http://www.noblequran.com/translation/index.html).

As I've said before on reddit - I'm not advocating deporting anyone or limiting anyone's religious freedom.  But I would like to be able to talk about these issues without having to endure the currently powerful taboo against any criticism of Islam.  As an atheist I'm keenly aware that Islamists would have me executed.  (The same goes for execution of homosexuals.)  There are numerous Islamic states in which atheists actually *can* be killed for their apostasy.   I think that gives me more than enough right to criticize this ideology.

-------------

Finally - because this always come up.  Yes, the vast majority of muslims in and outside of the UK are peaceful, although I'm not sure I would describe them 'tolerant', especially when it comes to atheists, homosexuals and Jews.  But this is what's tragic to me.  Muslims are no different to you or I except that they are carrying with them an ideology that is at odds with many of our most 'sacred' Western values.

Also - 'Christianity is just as bad'.  Well, being an atheist I get that The Bible contains much that is unpleasant or even genocidal.  Millions have died in Christian religious wars and Christians have been responsible for enormous religious persecution (often of other Christian sects).  

But, the fact that Christianity is bad or has been bad does not excuse Islam, any more than a criminal is excused by another criminal living on the same street.

Most modern Christians in the West have managed to pick and choose their religion to the extent that, nowadays, perhaps the majority of Western Christians essentially no longer think that or act as if the Bible is true and modern Christians would be considered heretics by 15th century standards.  

What really worries me is that there are too many muslims who actually believe in this stuff.

The national grid is outdated anyway and needs a huge investment to get it up to date.

It will require small shifts in behaviour to address but people will probably adjust to these minor inconveniences.

A key issue is to improve education standards:

* Improved academics standards
* improved vocational training (apprenticeships)


So our youth have sufficient skills to out-compete immigrants. 


Like /u/Maverrix99 said, not everyone may be intelligent but almost everyone can be skilled.


By making the focus immigration, means our priorities are completely skewed (if low unemployment and a good economy is our genuine goal that is).

---
Additionally: (can ignore below if want/not relevant to answering the q)


There is also another issue that no one is choosing to confront:


I'm sorry but many UKIP supporters will use EU and youth unemployment as a cover for just not wanting immigrants, either because:

* a) they feel their country has changed and is somehow not how it used to be
* b) they're just racist and don't like non-white, non Anglo Saxon folk (racist but not overtly, not expressing themselves as such)


For group a I say, immigration is a natural process, cultures change and evolve.

We seem to be at a stage in our civilization where *more* people are *more* freely able to move about. We then see friction develop where these changes are most acute. I think most countries will have to face this in the next few decades. 
Over the next 50, 100, 200 years it will be the norm to have people moving about and the cultures of a country adapting and probably becoming more free. 
This stage we're living through right now I think will be a blip, a stepping stone in the history of the human race.


For b - improve your prospects and standard of living, interact with people who are not like you, communicate and tackle any genuine issues. Most of your fears will subside.

The number came from a leaflet that Farage had nothing to do with. He doesn't personally make the party leaflets. You can say that Ukip got it wrong, but it was just a leaflet. By comparison, labour got the figures massively wrong when it really mattered, they said only 13,000 people would come each year when they opened the boarders, it was more like 130,000. 


&gt;The percentage of laws made by the EU. Farage now admits that this is based on UKIPs 'best guess' rather than any kind of statistical survey

Its hard to really say definitively what the numbers are, depending on what you consider a law, but most people now put it at about 50%. Farage said about 75%, Clegg, a member of the govenment who should know better said 7%. 75 is closer to 50 than 7 is to 50.

There are still lingering issues like religious figures in the House of Lords who need to be removed, but more or less, religion has played little part in policy.

Suddenly, we have a PM who deliberately points out his religion as if it is a relevant factor and actually calls himself ""evangelical""? To most people out there, this is going to call up images of the vocal evangelicals in the US who keep trying to do shit like cutting evolution out of education and teaching creationism. That is not a good image and I'll be damned if I let our country slide into that lunacy.

Christianity may be the dominant religion, technically speaking. But does it dominate *all* the other religions and non-religious combined?

Depends what you mean by a good UK sub. I am honestly shocked by how little people seem to care about what has happened here. Perhaps you didn't see it as it was happening so you don't understand some peoples upset over it. 

I was of the opinion that this was a place that was moderated in a neutral way, that it was representative of the views of a cross section of society, as much as an online forum can be. 

Every day there are posts which create strong emotions across the community, whether it be about the EU, UKIP, religion, politics. These topics create really interesting and thought provoking discussions. There are things that make some people angry, sad, laugh and all sorts of other emotions. And that's how it should be, a community of people should be able to deal with any discussion, any topic. The results of the discussion might not be how you personally would like them to be, but you will always find someone who agrees with you, or wants to discuss the things you do, because this is supposed to be a neutral place where we respect everyone's right to have an opinion. 

But last week I discovered that this is not a neutral place. That there are some difficult and diversive subjects which the mods do like want to be discussed. That colours my whole perception of this place. It might be nice for you, but i personally would rather this place was less of an an echochamber, and we actually confronted the difficult issues of our society, rather than have them censored from discussion.

It's not just about increasing the plurality of opinions and arguing through dialectic more. As a former philosophy post grad, let me just say. That's achieved very little in 2000 years of application. 

It's about turning economics into a proper science with the use of Big data and statistics. Which arguably is a trend already existing and kicking it out of the soft sciences shallow end of the pool where it's less about the ideological palatability of your argument than it is about how the model fits to observed data. 

because a lot of the 'non neoclassical schools' have a lot in them that's about appealing to justice, not a scientific picture of how human beings in an economy interact. 

Either way though, accurate predictions before we have a much better picture of the human subject by way of cognitive science and social psychology is going to be elusive.

true,MrPete81,UnionFlag,Cambridge - Honda CBR600,"I spent just over £100 for tyres on my RBP125 (CBR125 clone), but definitely worth it. The way I figured was, although you only have two not four tyres, they're your mightiest ally when it comes to battling the road surface (ie. grip) and you only have two little footprints in contact with the ground. I'd much rather pay that little bit more for a better chance of keeping safe.

I got Continental Go's as replacements but can't remember the tyres sizes off my head as I changed the size on the front to something less peaky and more rounded due to the riding I was doing (looooong distance!). *I think the original was 70/90 17m/c and the new 80/100 17m/c.* This also made it more stable on tar snakes, cats eyes &amp; poor surfaces. The previous tyre would've been better for inner city useage where you need really fast steering response.

With regards to your sizes, if you find your current sizes - 100/90 17m/c 55p as an example - they refer to:

- 100 = width of the tyre in millimeters

- 90 = height of the sidewall as a percentage of the width

- 17 = diameter of the tyres inner rim in inches

- m/c = for motorcycles

- 55 = the load rating of the tyre

- p = the speed rating

If you are happy and confident with the current size on there, then no problem just go with the same size. If you find it's a little too peaky in the middle and the shoulders towards the edges of the tyre are quite steep making you feel like you need to learn early, then you need a slightly wider width which will give it a more curved appearance (see *italic* sentence above and [this image](http://image.sportrider.com/f/16595606+w750+st0/146_0906_02+michelin_power_one_race_tire+profile_comparison.jpg))

We've never had a breakout show to convince those who hold the purse strings that the industry is worth supporting and funding. If a young person in the UK is looking to get into tv animation, they'll most likely be looking overseas, because that's where their inspiration comes from and that's where the work is. 
Maybe if Aardman, instead of making Wallace &amp; Gromit, focused on a character based tv series it would've changed things. Though Rex the Runt never really took off. 

King of the Hill, Family Guy, and South Park, are all American so not exactly relevant, but the last two are still popular. People have been saying South Park fell off since season 3, yet it's still going strong and as funny as ever. 

From my limited experience, for a niche interest Anime is pretty popular in the UK with teens and young adults. Although in the last decade or two Anime has moved away from telling more adult orientated stories, with the vast majority of main protagonists being high school age. 
American animation is also still very popular, Adventure Time, Bobs Burgers, Rick &amp; Morty &amp; the various Adult Swim series all have strong, all be it small cult followings in the UK. The more mainstream shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy etc all do well enough in the ratings. 

The question of 'why is there no really good UK adult orientated animation' is always met with the 'cartoons are for kids' attitude being the obstacle, when that clearly isn't the case. There is a eager market in the UK for either a mainstream show or a cult hit. We've just never been able to produce one.

UK did get a thread on the topic that complied with the rules (however cherry picked they may be by the mods), so censorship claims ring a little weaker. And then a thread of Q&amp;A, in which any mod answering was down-voted - so what incentive is there to explain any action?

To aid Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5 percent, the hotel occupancy tax by 2 percent, and car rental tax by 5 percent. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding,[20][21] and Jones covered any cost overruns.

1. The UK would be better off out of the EU and in the EEA in the short term for our democracy and sovereignty with slight economic benefits too.
2. The EU has been and always will be a project to turn the supranational single regulatory organization (no demos) into a Federal Politicallly recognized international body and that means taking more powers from Nations in Europe. 
3. The above has been all been covered up by the elites across Europe from the people: The Big Deception.
4. Farage has been consistent on all the above where the other politicians have lied time and time again: He can't help being honest because it aligns with the facts.
5. Whether or not Farage has personally been a bit loose with a some of the accuracy of the figures and with helping himself to MEP allowances and employing his wife when he made a party policy not to... yes there's some truth in that he's far from perfect. But those are forgivable I believe in my current estimation of him especially as they are bending rules not breaking them and especially as he's doing this country a huge service swimming against the current of the Establishment and Media who have so successfully blinded people to the reality of the the EU Federal Project and corruption of Sovereignty and Democracy.

I can further dispute your claims above:

* Total Romanian/Bulgarians is about accurate +/- current emmigrated numbers.
* %-laws is **interpretative** you can do a count of acts/statutes which is accurate. He's quote Ms Reding of the EU Commission.
* Again gross vs net it's about accurate enough for most people at about 55m /day or 18.5 bn£/pa.
* Honestly that's quibbling: Some random actor or model posing in a leaflet would be the same.
* Yeah he should probably get someone else to do that but none have blushed until the EU Elections over it.
* He says it's too much and that MEP's don't have any influence anyway and that they're working to get the UK out of the EU: It's unreformable and waste of money = he's right.

true,lionmoose,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; It's about turning economics into a proper science with the use of Big data and statistics. Which arguably is a trend already existing



I actually disagree with you here.  The problem is not the use of statistics- most micro that I see is already heavily empirical (much more than a trend) and models require validation from real world data (even if they do tend to stop at OLS) - but rather less credulity about what model are actually doing. Most economists that I've spoken to seem to be of the opinion that the sort of statistical correction they include in their models (IV, Heckman *et al.*) will either fully correct for the kind of problems they are meant to address, or at least to the extent that they can confidently make causal statements from their empirical results. I'm rather less confident, and in my opinion, economics would benefit enormously from trying to use natural experiments more widely than currently, or if they are purely restricted to policy evaluation, trials.

&gt;Any concerns or claims to children's well-being and education should be addressed to the proper government departments, perhaps your MP.

And the more people who are aware of what is happening, and can do the same, the better.

&gt;Any other display of things ""that others may find interesting"", is not really for the benefit of those children, just redditors.

One poster told children to consult a local Islamic scholar before taking new medicine. I personally think the opinion of a doctor should superseded that of a religious leader in this county, no matter what your culture or religion says,especially when it concerns an impressionable child. Seeing something like that is shocking to me, and I think is a valid point of concern for anyone.

As I've said my hope is that the rise of 'big data' (yes its a horrible buzz word) based on how people interact with each other, not just on but off the web.

true,nasher168,eu,Hull,"&gt;Why, exactly, are we so concerned who people vote for?

Because these things *matter.* Voting isn't just some statement of belief. It has the potential to affect people.

&gt;As soon as a party like UKIP gets popular other politicians jump on it like a rabid dog, screaming things like ""racism"".

Say what you like about UKIP's policies, and even Nigel Farage's personal views. But UKIP has a tendency to attract almost precisely the kind of people you don't want anywhere near political power. The only party that attracts a worse crowd is the BNP.

&gt; It honestly reminds me of the playground mentality - ""you're wrong because you like what I don't like!""

Well, yeah! Honestly, what more is there to being wrong by someone else's point of view? You can back up your views with facts, but if there's some kind of trade-off going on, as with the EU question, then it all just comes down to one's personal opinion.

Personally, I think any loss of sovereignty that EU membership includes is a fair trade-off for the benefits being in the EU brings. Furthermore, I wouldn't mind the UK losing all its sovereignty and becoming just a state in a federal EU. Presumably, a UKIP voter would disagree with me, but that's all it comes down to.

The BNP, though, have policies including the deportation of all 'non-indigenous' (non-white) people. Fuck. That. I get mildly annoyed at UKIP, and think they have a disturbing number of closet racists in their ranks, but the BNP absolutely deserve to be shat upon whenever they open their mouths.",0,1398252315,null,0,false,0,cgztci8,t3_23r699,t1_cgztci8,t3_23r699,null,1433482590,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Fair enough, as you were. I've read very little macro, it has never really been relevant to my own work.

&gt;Hard to do though

Yeah, sure and also not appropriate for models which are explanatory (rather than just looking to quantify a treatment effect). That said, it has been done in certain settings (there was a lot done around the PROGRESA programme for instance). As I said, natural experiments might be another route. 

&gt; the inductive statstical model of science doesn't necessarily require that at least to construct models, just to test them

I remain to be convinced that the statistical methods which are currently in use are adequately testing the theoretical models they derive, hence the need for a wider methodological approach.

Guess what previous UKIP policy said about that on their page. That EU citizens would be allowed to apply for a permit if they've been in this country for at least 6 years or something. In Sky News recent discussion with Farage the presenter asked him what would happen with EU migrants already being here. Farage didn't respond to that question, he simply said something about some migrants are doing good, some are doing bad. Wtf?

Also, this shows again a hypocrisy. Farage had his wife here long enough so he isn't bothered about leaving the EU. What if he didn't? What if he was younger and just married her?

&gt;No you're ignoring the case for a democratic choice of the people of this country. Major in mid-90's said: ""No more than 55,000 pa.""

Democratic choice of people would make sense if public was PROPERLY informed. Can they can be when UKIP simply lies with their ""facts"". When major papers do exactly the same? I've won PCC case against the Daily Mail, when they have provided total immigration to the UK and said it was the immigration from the EU. How do you think public reacts to lies?

Also, since UK has been strongly getting out of the recession, polls indicate that more people would now vote for YES towards the membership of the EU. Coincidental? I don't think so. People think immigration and the EU is responsible for the world's financial crisis which obviously touched the UK.

&gt;But we can do that selectively not discriminantly against non-EU

But that fails the main point of the EU's equality. I'd rather see more internal limits, like deporting EU criminals and having tougher rules for benefit claimants. That makes sense. Total cut-off doesn't, especially that it will limit free movement BOTH ways. No wonder it's mostly old people voting UKIP. Those who were open minded already soak in the sun in Spain, while younger people want to have choice as they don't know what they would like to do in x years of life and possibly moving abroad in the EU is not a stupid option. It's old, grumpy, narrow minded, often not directly affected by any immigration aspects people who vote for UKIP.

&gt;I remain to be convinced that the statistical methods which are currently in use are adequately testing the theoretical models they derive, hence the need for a wider methodological approach.

Well when big data is not just an empty buzzword. Its more about really the size of the data set.

thing is as I understand it (philsophy and computer science are my fields no economics, so I could be wrong) you either have highly abstract 'ONS' style data on how an economy as a whole behaves, or you have relatively small 100-2000 sized data sets of how people are behaving.

so the level of abstraction in the first case makes statments about 'this is how people behave in the economy' hard. Conversely the size of the sample in the latter case makes any conclusions often far too strong on the same statement.

Thing about big data is, we can, without being too intrusive, get real hard quantifiable stuff about how millions of people are behaving moment to moment in how they interact with each other on an economic level.

Finally allowing for large enough data sets with abstraction thats fine grained enough to potentially say 'given x in an economy, people behave in manner y with z% of certainty'.
