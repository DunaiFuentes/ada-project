false,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt;What does piss me off though is when people think that the Argentinian people were the ones that went to war when it was a military dictatorship that decided it.

You might know better, but does anybody here think that? Our narrative, as I have always heard it, is that there was a dictator who wished to boost the popularity of his government by creating and vanquishing an Other and claiming (""reclaiming"") land which is widely believed in that country to be British-occupied rightfully-Argentine soil.

The problem we have with the Argentinian people is when they (not the Government) go on the offensive with a ridiculous narrative in support of the idea that the Falkland Islands are rightfully Argentine, have that feed into their hate of Britain and (this is the important bit) get needlessly aggressive about it when encountering the opposing view^(*). People like /u/ArchangelleDvvorkin. I'm not aware that anyone thinks the war was by some sort of citizens' initiative.

We do not, as far as I am aware, generalize them all to be like that, but we know that the sentiment is prevalent and we know that to most Argentinians, the Falklands *are* Argentine.

^(* But I do understand this to be natural behaviour - the opposing view isn't presented in Argentina. We get a similar phenomenon in this subreddit - and in most large subreddits - when a perfectly valid point is made which goes against the narrative of the board. People get needlessly aggressive and make bad arguments when that happens too.)

I can, anecdotes cancelled out, we are now at square one. Come on, everyone can go out and cherry pick positive and negative stories about the NHS, mainly because every person in the country interacts with it so in 64 million people you can find anything.

The NHS may not be perfect, but the Tory dogmatic obsession with privatisation as the solution is forcing the left into a dogmatic defence of it. Worst of both worlds.

&gt;And the point i'm making is that seeing as you are so fundamentally against anyone making money from treating the sick, I wondered if you thought it would extend to a doctor getting paid adequately?

No, it wouldn't. I never said I was against people making money from treating the sick, I said I was against people making profit - if you are defining wages of people as profit now, then you are defining a new economics. How much of their actual expended effort cancels out their pay? What is their profit and loss calculation? 

People who help the sick obviously need to be paid to do it as we live in a capitalistic society that requires people to have money. Treating the sick is an admirable profession, that also requires various skills and should be paid well.

Adidas didn't want to do 3 identical kits for 3 teams in the same league, or they thought it'd be confusing, so we ended up with the ones from last year that looked awfully template-y and not what the FO wanted.

When I got to college I found I had more time to actually follow what happened and watch games consistently. Randomly started being Spurs on FIFA, probably because I liked Dempsey and Bale. Found out I liked most of the players and when I started watching their games I felt more personally connected to the players. Got so excited by the prospect of Spurs cracking the top four and felt they were a genuine club, on the up and trying to achieve something. Not comfortably always in fourth but never really pushing for the title and not a club with bags of money. The summer after Bale left had me enthralled with expectations and hope for the next season and that really was when I became such a huge supporter like I am today. I've never supported something so wholeheartedly before (apart from the teams I played on) and I fucking love this club.

Yes, this is the nature of capitalism. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIgGOYKhs) explains why far better than I can, it isn't that long and Wolff is pretty entertaining.

&gt;I can dig up examples out of the tech industry where skilled individuals are paid inflated salaries to stop them going elsewhere.

Let's do a thought experiment. I'm a boss, my employee's labour creates £100 in value but I pay her £150. How long do you think this can last before I go bankrupt? 

&gt;I just don't think it really holds any meaning for people in Britain in particular. In Britain class = (your wealth+your job+your education+where you grew up)

Yes, I'm aware that this is the colloquial definition. I'm arguing that we should use another one.

&gt;Now with so much of a range of education, and such an enormous range of incomes, I think there are so many multiples out of that equation that it's almost impossible to define anymore.

I can only think of two, bourgeoisie and proletariat. One owns, one labors, one exploits and one is exploited. 

It's the most useful definition of class to use because using it we can understand how capitalism functions, and how we can create an economic system superior to capitalism. As you say, if we try and define class any other way it becomes so confusing and difficult as to render the whole venture meaningless.

false,Irmuhlay,,Sixth Form,"I'm a little bit rusty on the content of my GCSEs (currently in Year 13), but here's my two pennies' worth...

Maths-wise, the usual Bitesize/My Maths sort of stuff is pretty comprehensive. Make sure to do plenty of past papers - if you want, try doing a few papers from different exam boards to look at different ways of phrasing the same question, but it's not totally necessary. The Further Mathematics Support Program has some GCSE revision videos [here](http://www.furthermaths.org.uk/online_revision) - I can't comment on the quality of these particular videos, but their A-level ones are excellent.

For Literature, go to SparkNotes and find the pages for your texts. Memorise a few points to combine with what you've learnt in class. From what I remember, my Lit GCSE was mostly blagging in such a way that it sounded profound. I barely remember Language at all, other than I always struggled with timekeeping during the mocks, so more practice on writing essays under timed conditions would have helped me. Also, ask people who got better marks than you in mocks to see their essays - work out what they're doing to get the marks that you dropped. You could get hold of old mark schemes to find out if there are any points that examiners are always looking for, then regurgitate as necessary.

For French, [Languages Online](http://www.languagesonline.org.uk/Hotpotatoes/Index.htm) is good for revising grammar. Your exam board will have a list of all the vocab you need to know somewhere in their specification - as long as you know what all/most of the words in that list mean, you'll be as prepared as anyone. They can still ask you questions with unfamiliar vocabulary, but those words should be enough to work out the gist. Also, take time reading the question correctly - sometimes they phrase stuff weirdly to catch you out. If you get stuck on a multiple choice question, eliminate the stuff it can't be, before guessing as a last resort. If listening's your weak point, there are some videos on Bitesize, but they seem harder to follow than I remember GCSE French being (I did my French GCSE in 2011, so it might be forgetfulness). If you've got speaking/writing to do still, try starting out with lots of notes when you practice, then reduce the number of notes until you can do the whole thing from memory. They look for a variety in your answers, so check that you're not repeating the same vocabulary/structures/tenses.

For any subject, if you're still doing coursework/controlled assessments, aim for the highest marks you can get. Mark schemes change very little year-to-year on coursework, so think about what to do to get that one more mark. It takes some of the pressure off the final exams - I was very ill during my Year 11 exams, but maxing out my coursework grades brought my overall grades back up. Treating specifications as revision checklists makes sure that you know everything that could come up in an exam. When you do past papers, mark harshly and look at what you need to improve on.

As for general motivation, it depends on you. I'm very competitive and spend far too much time reading TSR's stalking pages. My end goal was to beat those imaginary, godlike TSR people. It would be nice to pretend that I'm some sort of 24/7 revision machine, but I'm not - every revision timetable I've ever made has been completely ignored and I rarely sit still for more than about 10 minutes. When I want something badly enough, I somehow muddle through and get results. To be honest, I'm a terrible example - the people from /r/getdisciplined will be much more helpful.

I'll admit that I never took a particular interest in this sport before this past year, but the wonder and passion with which I found myself watching this last World Cup made me want to commit to a club team. I knew that MLS wasn't the way to go, so I quickly set my eyes on the EPL as it is by far the greatest option. I did my research, a lot of fucking research. I didn't want to be one of those preppy bandwagon assholes who blindly support Barca, Chelsea, etc. without any real connection or reason besides those teams being obviously attractive for reasons of dominance and ease of support. This one team seemed to stand out with rich, unbought history and players of character and interest. Tottenham Hotspur seemed an ideal choice as they weren't relegation fodder and they weren't the dreaded bandwagoner's team. As I continues my research, I quickly realized that this team was exactly what I was looking for. With my fresh copy of FIFA 14, I played countless hours with my newly selected club. I loved every damn minute of it. Being a redditor, I subscribed to the COYS subreddit and quickly learned as much as possible about the club and other fans' thoughts on the current state of the team before the season got into full swing. I paid for the cable package in order to watch as many games as I am able and I always refer to posts and threads each day as become my most commonly frequented subreddit. I never thought I'd be so infatuated with a bunch of men living so very far away playing a sport that is widely disregarded in my region. I love this team, I love this subreddit, and I love being a Spurs fan and chanting, screaming, and singing to every damn game I can. Sure, it's been a bit of a rough season to start being a fan, but I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Also, FUCK ARSENAL. I can't even begin to explain my hatred for a team that meant less than nothing to be a few months ago.

By furrows do you mean wrinkles, but deeper than average like Gordon Ramsay say? If yes that is a job for Botox, realistically even (private) prescription topicals won't be enough. Gordon Ramsay is open about having tried Botox and it softened his lines, did not eliminate them or make him look like a waxwork. Google for photos.

The textural issues I suggest consulting your family doctor, once you know what the 'diagnosis' is you can look for a medical treatment or cosmetic product. I don't see the point in throwing money away on anti ageing treatments that may or may not be effective depending what the underlying issue is. It is possible you have some mild skin condition that will respond well to a prescription cream.

In the mean time use a broad spectrum sunscreen (based on zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) each morning, reapply if you are outside at lunch break and before your commute home. Subnscreen is not too important at this time of year but definitely get this in place by the spring, or use if you are exercising/ playing sports outdoors even when there is cloud cover. Stop smoking if you do!

Diet modification ... ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating. Most people don't know what they all are and just make up their own diet based on newspaper articles and personal taste. If you are/ have been losing weight it can be very easy for one or more nutrients to be too low, if you are exercising regularly you need much more, up to DOUBLE the recommended amount. 

Oily fish, oily fish, oily fish. Lose any sugar, processed carbohydrates, excessive caffeine, excessive alcohol. By processed I mean anything that does not look exactly like it came right off the plant or animal and/ or has more than one ingredient (yup breakfast cereal and bread are processed).

It depends, in this thought experiment do I have other employees or am I only employing one person?

Because not only could do that indefinitely if I have 3 employees earning £100 paid at £75, and 1 earning £100 paid at £150, I'd be turning a profit. This is definitely the case in tech companies, it can't be denied. People are kept on to prevent their expertise being used elsewhere, while actually producing very little any more.

It's unconventional, but let me explain 

The back four decades itself. In midfield, Capoue can drop back into the backline, or break up play with Stambo. Stambo is energetic, and will do a good job putting Fabregas/Oscar under pressure, while Capoue closes the angles. Dembele is a powerful player, and adds further steel to our midfield. He can out muscle Oscar and Fab, and is probably our only midfielder that can stand up to Matić. On the ball, he can work his way out of the Chelsea press, or look to start the counter. He'll have more time, especially when on the counter. 

Lennon has the pace, which will be important. He's faster than anyone Chelsea has, and has been the discipline that lamela lacks to get back to help Walker with Hazard, and then attack into the space Hazard always leaves behind him on the counter. Eriksen can drift in centrally to add some creativity/numbers in the middle of the park, and slip into the space Matić/other holding midfielder leaves. Chadli up front might seem strange. But he is strong, quick, has great endurance, skin like a dolphin, and good in the air. He is also an intelligent player, always finding space, and great at closing down the slightly clumsy pair of Cahill and Terry. 

We should sit back, and strike on the counter. Fazio should be able to go toe-to-toe with Costa, Walker and Lennon have the pace, stamina and discipline to deal with Hazard, and we hopefully are in with a shot

&gt;

&gt;__Fabricio Coloccini__ (locally: [faˈβɾisjo koloˈt͡ʃini]; Italian: [kolotˈt͡ʃini]; born 22 January 1982) is an Argentine [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) who plays for and captains [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) club [Newcastle United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.) as a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)). He plays for [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team) at international level.

&gt;Coloccini has represented numerous football clubs, however it was his successful spell at [Deportivo La Coruña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru%C3%B1a) where he earned his reputation as a top-level defender. After beginning his career at [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) in his native Argentina, Coloccini attracted the attention of [AC Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan). He failed to establish himself there, however, and subsequently went on loan to four different clubs. In July 2011, he was promoted to club captain of Newcastle United after proving himself as one of the Premier League's most reliable and strong central defenders. In April 2012 he was named in the PFA Team of the Year due to his influence in Newcastle's impressive season.

&gt;Coloccini also holds an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) passport due to his Italian ancestry.

false,HerpesCoatedSmegma,null,null,"Right, so basically quarantine was largely abandoned in the early part of the last century as an archaic tool to contain emerging pathogens with the rapid advancement of modern medicine. The most notable recently when time it was implemented on a large scale would be with SARS in 2003 - in Asia and Canada. In this modern example, in addition to the previous historic examples where quarantine was more easily violated, it is now believed that quarantine was counterproductive. This is a review of several papers post outbreak looking at weather quarantine actually works: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2094974/#!po=70.0000

Before I continue, also of note is that quarantine requires three specific criteria to be fulfilled before epedimiologists and virologists could even think about recommending it (mentioned in the review above). As well as the issue of compliance, Ebola virus does not fit the third criteria and so will never be scientifically backed, in addition to the social issues to consider.

Back to quarantine, the reasons for it being harmful we've discussed are largely for it being implemented to the general public - there are additional factors when you begin to consider doing it for healthcare workers. Again there are so many reasons and some are mentioned here: http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/bioethicist-7-reasons-ebola-quarantine-bad-bad-idea-n234346 but I'll pick up on the most important one as it's not explained well. 

If you are a doctor, nurse or biologist you can't just put you're hands up and volunteer to go to west Africa to fight Ebola virus with MSF etc. typically during any polemic disaster situation that gets a lot of worldwide coverage MSF and other NGO's get a big influx of would be volunteers, many not doing it for the right reasons, not fully understanding the gravity of working in disaster scenarios, not having relevant training working in squalid conditions, not being trained adequately in infectious disease etc.. So what happens if you are to volunteer is that you are taken to help in a completely different situation, usually in your own home country until you essentially are relevantly trained and prove commitment. This gives MSF and other NGOs a very small pool of professionals who have previous extensive experience in working in disaster scenarios to select from to send to West Africa. Now typically what many of these doctors and nurses do is they work for a period of weeks at a time - and not just normal working days. These people are working about 20 hours a day and doctors are doing 24 hour shifts every 3 days. It's utterly insane and they are true heroes. For those on short placements and working intensive hours, they fly back for a couple of weeks and then return. In this situation not only does quarantine not have any scientific backing, for the weeks they are back in their home country I'll informed people are suggested they are quarantined, isolated from friends and family and depending on state law often 'illegally' (Quotations because in the past laws have been amended in order to do this) - it's a complete disservice and understandably discourages those already in the small pool who are qualified in going to or returning to West Africa. There are already not enough doctors, everybody counts. All of these reason are intertwined with social reasons. Another paper on SARS highlighted the widespread panic quarantine caused and the stigma in Taiwan. Stigma which we have already witnessed happening in America towards nurses and doctors. Even in this thread I saw one comment by u/relax343: 'Funny how you gloss over the fact that she is putting lives at risk here'. It doesn't make any sense, completely moronic. Without people like her volunteering to contain the outbreak within West Africa there actually would be something to worry about in terms of increase incidence of Ebola virus in the UK and other western countries.

Because they're not the fucking Nazis, they'll try to hide it and sweep it under the rug if possible. 

&gt;Other parties don't (see Diane Abbott).

I believe I explained this in another comment to you but Diane could not have been racist as racism is a structural system of oppression, not isolated acts of racial prejudice. 

&gt;but it was not said with offensive intent 

You cannot strip racist language of racism. I don't care *why* he said it or what he meant by it, the words themselves were racist, nobody can deny that.

&gt;is more a product of him not being middle class than a deep seated hatred for homosexuals or people of chinese heritage.

&gt;Immigration is the driving force behind population growth in the UK.

Do you have a citation for that? I'm not denying it, I'm just wondering. 

The point is that Farage and the rest of UKIP seek to place every minor problem in the world upon the shoulders of immigration.

Designers, software developers, project managers etc, tech companies often retain people beyond their direct value.

In huge organisations there are definitely people retained purely due to their importance rather than their production.

If you are a doctor, nurse or biologist you can't just put you're hands up and volunteer to go to west Africa to fight Ebola virus with MSF etc. typically during any polemic disaster situation that gets a lot of worldwide coverage MSF and other NGO's get a big influx of would be volunteers, many not doing it for the right reasons, not fully understanding the gravity of working in disaster scenarios, not having relevant training working in squalid conditions, not being trained adequately in infectious disease etc.. So what happens if you are to volunteer is that you are taken to help in a completely different situation, usually in your own home country until you essentially are relevantly trained and prove commitment. This gives MSF and other NGOs a very small pool of professionals who have previous extensive experience in working in disaster scenarios to select from to send to West Africa. Now typically what many of these doctors and nurses do is they work for a period of weeks at a time - and not just normal working days. These people are working about 20 hours a day and doctors are doing 24 hour shifts every 3 days. It's utterly insane and they are true heroes.

Any who, with the current system, Can would be great upfront - with Sterling and Lallana on the wings. Can would be able to manhandle defenders and open up space for Lallana, Sterling, Coutinho and especially for himself. Sterling, as we have seen, has struggled with the few defenders he's been up against, his size is vulnerable in the box. He's got pace but he can't control the ball if he gets a slight nudge running towards the net. There is no chance of him winning an aerial duel either...Yes, Raheem scored the only goal against Burnley and two against Bournemouth but I think he is more of a threat along the wings.

Right, so basically quarantine was largely abandoned in the early part of the last century as an archaic tool to contain emerging pathogens with the rapid advancement of modern medicine. The most notable recently when time it was implemented on a large scale would be with SARS in 2003 - in Asia and Canada. In this modern example, in addition to the previous historic examples where quarantine was more easily violated, it is now believed that quarantine was counterproductive. This is a review of several papers post outbreak looking at weather quarantine actually works: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2094974/#!po=70.000

Before I continue, also of note is that quarantine requires three specific criteria to be fulfilled before epedimiologists and virologists could even think about recommending it (mentioned in the review above). As well as the issue of compliance, Ebola virus does not fit the third criteria and so will never be scientifically backed, in addition to the social issues to consider.

Back to quarantine, the reasons for it being harmful we've discussed are largely for it being implemented to the general public - there are additional factors when you begin to consider doing it for healthcare workers. Again there are so many reasons and some are mentioned here: http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/bioethicist-7-reasons-ebola-quarantine-bad-bad-idea-n234346 but I'll pick up on the most important one as it's not explained well.

&gt;

&gt;__Franz, Duke of Bavaria__ (Franz Bonaventura Adalbert Maria Herzog von Bayern; born 14 July 1933), is head of the [House of Wittelsbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wittelsbach), the former ruling family of the [Kingdom of Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria). His great-grandfather [King Ludwig III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_III_of_Bavaria) was the last ruling monarch of Bavaria and was deposed in 1918.

&gt;Franz was born in Munich. During the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War), the Wittelsbachs were anti-Nazi. The family initially left Germany for Hungary, but were eventually arrested when Franz was aged eleven. He spent time in several [Nazi concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps) including [Oranienburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranienburg_concentration_camp) and [Dachau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp). After the war, he was a student at the [University of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Munich) and became a collector of modern art.

&gt;Franz succeeded as head of the House of Wittelsbach, and as [pretender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretender) to the Bavarian throne, on the death of his father in 1996. He lives at the [Nymphenburg Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphenburg_Palace).

&gt;Franz is also the current [heir-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir-general) of [King Charles I of England and Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England), and thus as ""Francis II"" is considered by [Jacobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism) to be the legitimate heir of the [Stuart kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart) of England, France, Scotland and Ireland.  ""HRM  [*[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic)*] the Duke generally does not comment on issues concerning his familiar [*sic*] relationship to the Royal House of Stuart"", a spokesman told the media.

Ashley gave Pardew a 7 year contract and Pard usually met his targets, giving Newcastle a few impressive runs between unimpressive runs. Personally I think Pardew's done well and clearly Ashley has invested a lot in him (time/contract/some player cash).

false,blue_strat,null,null,"In a regular 30mph zone, is 31mph regarded as criminally dangerous? People will stretch a few mph to get through a yellow light, they might go a couple over if they aren't checking their speedo very regularly, it doesn't mean the police would clap them in irons if they could. The idea is that the accepted speed of a residential/commercial area of a town is around 30mph. Something that lets you into or out of the centre at a decent pace but doesn't threaten to kill a pedestrian who might be crossing the road around the next bend.

What does the 20mph limit say? That the areas of Bristol in which it is implemented - mainly the northern Victorian streets, not the southern 20th century suburbs - would be better served by a more cautious approach. Go through Montpellier, St Andrews, Bishopston, Southville, or Clifton, and look how many parked cars have two wheels on the pavement to allow movement down the street. Twist through a residential area and see how confidently you could stray up to maybe 32mph without worrying about a child walking out in front of you.

This isn't the 1970s when there were much fewer cars on the road and rarely two cars per household: now lots of families have two cars, and especially in Bristol where rent is expensive there are lots of professional shared houses with multiple cars. There are more cars parked up and more cars commuting each day, in the same relatively tight streets - again, this isn't really a problem in modern areas like Filton and Hartcliffe.

Apart from the potential dangers of speed - less time to react to hazards in tight areas - there are the environmental effects of that traffic to consider too; air pollution and noise pollution. The population of Bristol continues to grow, the student population will continue to grow (which brings more business to the centre), and it's a physical fact (and most cars are suitably geared for 20-24mph) that going faster requires more fuel, which produces more emissions. I don't have a source but anecdotally I would also suggest that a lower speed limit helps to relieve traffic congestion.

Not all streets are the same, not all districts are the same, and the 20mph limit should not apply to most of the outer suburbs of Bristol. However, I think it is sensible in the more central areas where is has been applied.

Edit: An addendum on the point of driving ""for the road conditions"": yes, of course if the limit is 30mph and you realize that your hazard perception would be inadequate at that speed you can always drive slower until the road opens out. However, you could say that about a 40mph or 50mph zone: why don't we just have the national speed limits of 30/60/70mph? Why the gradation up through 40mph and 50mph? You could answer the same question of the difference between 60mph and 70mph: it's about attitude - 95mph is not an uncommon sight on a motorway, but 85mph is rare on a 60mph A-road, even though the speed limit is only 10mph lower. It's about influencing the motorists' attitudes towards their speed in that area, due to nearby residential or other factors.

I've yet to see a 20mph speed camera, but it's worth having the number on the signs to make people think about their speed and not be tempted to go straight up to 30mph just because they can.",0,1419910385,null,0,1419912144,0,cn8zcng,t3_2p9php,t1_cn8zcng,t1_cn8xuha,null,1425155193,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1

These long standing fans attend fewer fixtures than they've ever done before due to cost, likewise longstanding season ticket holders are slowly being priced out due to cost. That means that a larger and larger proportion of our match going support is being made up of tourists, gloryhunters, and the older middleclasses who can afford the increasing expense. Our match going support is being gentrified.

Which, I might add, is a direct result of the club catering to the demand of new fans like yourself. Football tourists who don't care of the price of a ticket, as it's a one off expense. The club has courted the daytripper dollar ahead of the core support.

That is why the atmosphere is suffering.

It's because bandwagon tourists like yourself are increasingly making a bigger proportion of the match going fanbase.

That's the truth.

Who: Galahad The Gnome
When: 23/11/2014
Where: COYS

A parchment arrives containing a few snippets from the diminutive one. The information is not uniformly positive, so if you dislike reading negative information, please close this thread now.


There was a confrontation after the Stoke game between Adebayor and Kane. Most of the team sided with Kane, but Kaboul and a couple of others didn't. Kaboul then went to see the manager to voice ""the squads opinion"" on Kane and his supporters. It was clear to MP that Adebayor, Lennon and Kaboul do not speak for the rest of the squad. The younger players are not happy with the way the three most senior players have been behaving, training and playing.

MP bitterly disappointed with more than half a dozen of the squad who have decided the extra hard work they are being asked to do hasn't paid off, so they won't bother to do it. He wanted to give them time to buy into his plans, but they have chosen not to do so. Today's team selection is a reflection of this reality.

Adebayor and Lennon are refusing to accept a move. They've told MP that they don't care whether they play or not. They'll stay at home, train with the reserves or sit on the bench, as long as they collect their wages.

Lennon only made the bench today because of the injuries to Townsend and Chadli.

Unsurprisingly it's proving most challenging to move many of our players expect Vlad to go permanent, and Paulinho on loan. Both to Italy and both to top Italian sides. Inter showing the most interest in Paulinho as things stand.

Baldini suggested we hire Paul Mitchell. MP supported this idea. Mitchell is seen as someone with the potential to become a DOF in the long term. He wants to 'apprentice' for a few years with someone experienced in transfers, dealing with agents and players, etc.

Each member of the triumvirate will have control over their own area of the transfer process. MP will decide on the roles he needs for his tactical schemes. Mitchell will then identify players (both young players and established players) for those roles, and will recommend them to MP, who will either approve or reject each of those recommendations. For players that get MP's green light, Baldini will go out and try to sign them. MP trusts Mitchell explicitly.

Moreno and Rodriguez (subject to full recovery) are still the top two on the list for January, although Mitchell has already identified other possibilities for MP to look at.

Apart from the above, there's no news.



more....

prof (who posted the initial bit on galahads behalf):Okay. The following info came to Galahad on Friday evening (with a couple of extra snippets on Saturday morning), and is from a different source to the person quoted in post #1 of this thread. He initially sent it to me just for my information and didn't want it posted, however the appearance of this thread meant that he is okay with the following being shared. Take it or leave it.

Kaboul believed that the Ade 'faction' had the ascendency, if not in numbers then in influence, due to their seniority. He felt that the refusal to tow the seniority line by the younger players (led by Kane, Dier and Mason) came as a challenge to the established order in general, and to the authority of his captaincy in particular. That's why he made the decision (very much egged on by Ade) to go to Poch and complain, with the aim of presenting the 'Kane Mutiny' (sorry, couldn't resist. :smiley9: ) as being the root cause of the team's problems. Unexpectedly, for the Ade group, Poch supported the mutiny.

Lennon was caught up in supporting players (Ade and Kaboul) with whom he has built friendships over several years. Poch spoke to him on Friday, laying out what he expects from Lennon as a player and as a teammate, and (to his credit) Lennon seems to have responded very well. Poch does not see Lennon as a major issue, more as someone who did what they thought was the right thing (being loyal to a friend) but quickly realized it wasn't. As far as Poch is concerned, Lennon is not a man-management issue.

-prof on jan and eriksen: They both sided with the mutineers. Solidly. Would have been easier to keep their heads down and not take sides, like Lamela, Paulinho and Dembele.

-on rose siding with ade/kabs: I have heard that from one source, but it hasn't been corroborated.

-on lennon choosing the wrong side and seen his error : It does appear that way.

Our defense will remain solid, and can only improve with full back cover, which I expect us to address in the transfer window. We have four center backs capable of starting. Fabianski has been very solid, a huge upgrade from Vorm last year.

I'd like to see us make three signings: A big, strong holding mid and two full backs to at least challenge Taylor and Rangel for playing time. Thought Kingsley might be that man at the start of the year, but I haven't heard his name at all.

I'd also like to see us push for a FA Cup championship. I don't think we have the quality depth needed to make a serious run at the top six, but I do think we can maintain our rank in the top half of the table AND get into the latter stages of the Cup. 

All that said, I predict a semifinal exit in the FA Cup and I expect us to finish 10th in the League. ",0,1419911176,null,0,1419911672,0,cn8zret,t3_2qs370,t1_cn8zret,t3_2qs370,null,1425155001,3,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,3

Well yes I would. Largely because I used to be a microbiologist and have spent a fair amount of time reading and working in specifically virology - so I know the nature of the viral kinetics of Ebola virus. There's two phases of Ebola infection, a non specific and a specific phase. In the non specific phase there isn't sufficient viral load or progeny to cause secondary infection. In the specific phase there is, but it requires close contact with blood, feces, vomit. No one in the second phase of infection, when they are infectious will be able to get on a plane, it's incredibally debilitating - patients have to be carried around and are completely immobile when they are typically infectious. In that case I probably wouldn't sit next to an individual bleeding from various orifices and projectile vomiting, no. I advise you don't sit next to them either. 

A small sample size, but as noted with Duncan in USA and the nurses who were infected in the USA, they came in contact with several thousand people on commercial flights, a&amp;e wards and public transport between them and there were zero secondary cases while they were still mobile and in the primary non specific phase of Ebola virus infection.

false,SEMIweather,null,null,"I've just recently gotten into soccer, and this is my first season supporting Swansea (really fell in love with the amazing atmosphere at Liberty Stadium while watching EPL games at the end of last season), so this may not be the most educated post, but I'll try my best.


Pros:

- Sigurdsson has been an absolute joy to watch, and IMO the key player for the team thus far. Does an excellent job distributing the ball, has great chemistry with Bony, and has had a couple sublime goals on free kicks, along with several other near misses.

- After a so-so start, Bony has really come into form, and always seems to be a threat to score. He's had some games where he's been absolutely in the zone, and those occurrences are just plain fun to watch -- when you know it's inevitable that he'll get one in at some point. I obviously feel he's destined for a bigger club at some point, but hope we can at least hold onto him through the upcoming transfer window.

- Ki has been rock-solid; no spectacular plays that I can remember, but just consistently good form and you can tell the entire team functions better when he's on the pitch.

- Routledge, Dyer, and Montero have all run circles around other clubs at various points this season. Montero in particular was absolutely vital in our come-from-behind win over Arsenal, which was a key victory during a brutal stretch of matches.

- Defense has been solid.

- Fabianski has been a great signing, keeping us alive until the end in almost every match. The saves at the end of the Villa match were a particular highlight.

- The home crowds continue to be great, IMO. I'm watching Stateside so I obviously can't speak to what it's actually like inside the stadium, but over the TV Swansea's crowds seem noticeably more lively than most other clubs. Not a big deal, obviously, but it always makes home games fun to watch, and makes me look forward to possibly flying over to catch a match in the future.


Cons:

- Gomis, while not playing particularly poorly thus far, simply seems unable to score consistently.

- Losing Bony and Ki for an extended period due to international competition is going to be a tough blow.

- On a similar note, Montero being out for a month is rough. Clearly one of our bright spots in the first half of the season, and going to be difficult to replace his pace.

- Shelvey, while showing flashes of brilliance, has on the whole been pretty infuriating to watch. It seems that for every play which helps the club, he makes two dumb tackles.

- All in all, it seems like the refereeing decisions have gone against us more than for us over the first half of this season. 

- Although we've competed in nearly every match this season, we've blown far too many leads which will likely kill any chance of European competition next season unless we progress far enough in the FA Cup to qualify for Europa next year.

- There hasn't been much that's happened this year to convince me that the massive disparity between the Big Five clubs and the other 15 clubs is shrinking. Despite shaky starts, I expect Man U and Arsenal to once against qualify for the Champions League, with Liverpool ending up in 6th or 7th place. Thus, despite Swansea being a well-run club, it's hard to see our ceiling being any higher than Europa in the future.


All in all, I'm satisfied with my choice to support Swansea. For whatever reason, I didn't want to support one of the Big Five clubs, and  among the other 15 clubs, I feel Swansea plays one of the most attractive styles of football, and is well-positioned to continue finishing mid-table in the EPL for the next few years. Again, this is my first season supporting the club, but I've read up on the history, and considering where the club has been in the past, a consistent run of mid-table finishes seems great to me.

I'll try to respond to as many as your questions as possible, apologize for the mega post haha 

**Transfers**

- Siggy, Fabianski and Montero. This trio could be the core of our team for years to come, immediately addressed holes at the position. I also believe Montero can become a Champions League level player, the guy benched Nathan Dyer.

- Gomis. This is the question isn't it. He's performed very well, but just can't score. The spell he gets while Bony is away will define how we judge this one.

- Emnes and Barrow. Emnes is good cover and worth the money in my opinion. Barrow has incredible potential, Im excited to see his development.

- Players out. Other than Ben Davies and maybe JDG i'd say good riddance. Locker room was healed and we received good money for the Jonjo of defense(Chico) and an aging winger. Damn do I miss Davies though.

**Going Forward**

- Liverpool game was shit, but it wasn't anything systemic or strategic in my opinion. Just a ton of individual errors in a single game and a solid performance from 'Pool

- I have no time for Shelvey anymore. Bench at best, he needs to get his head together. Too much talent to waste, but god damn is he trying.

- Really frustrating we've only been linked to strikers when we have Championship quality fullbacks.

- I think Oliveira, Gomis and Emnes can fill in well for Bony. Gomis is a capable striker and this run of form will hopefully show us that. However without Ki we might be seeing more fucking Jonjo. Wouldn't mind a defensive mid this transfer window.

**Transfer Targets**

- Adam Matthews. Killing it at Celtic, Swansea native, cheap. Couldn't be better

- Kyle Naughton. Great young fullback that has found himself out of favour. Seems like a better Jazz with higher potential.

- A defensive midfielder. With Ki gone we need stability especially with Jonjo possibly playing a lot. 

- Alex Pritchard, Tom Carroll, Matty Grimes. All very talented UK youth prospects. Our youth set up is flourishing, lets allow it to continue.

- Ezequiel Muñoz. Palermo Right back, solid premier division quality fullback. Available fairly cheap.
**Conclusion**

We are overachieving and should be very happy so far. Unfortunately for Monk expectations are unreasonably high and Europa is going to be hard. However if we finish 8th or 9th and keep this team we could become a Europa league team with the right transfer. I think we finish 10th and suffer heavily from the loss of Bony and Ki, however Im a pessimist. Excited to see the other replies!! Who thought we'd be here preseason?

false,weluckyfew,null,null,"My two cents: I think you should start with the New series from 2005 (available on netflix and Amazon) - give it time, it takes several (5 or 6?) episodes to get really good.   (not a bad thing - hell, Star Trek TNG sucked for the first 2 or 3 years)   

Then follow through with all the seasons - it can be up and down a bit, but even the worst (and most frustrating) episodes still have gems of greatness in them (one of the most acclaimed Doctor Who speeches takes place in one of the most reviled episodes)

then go back and watch the old series - I think one would have more patience for the slow pacing and awful effects of the old series once you are already invested in the show via the new characters.  But the old show isn't just pure nostalgia - some of the episodes hold up amazingly well (the Tom Baker Key to Time episodes are - for my money - some of the best sci fi ever on TV)

The old series aren't as linear as the new ones - if all you can see at first are the scattered episodes available through streaming (IIRC it's maybe one or two from every season) it's not a bad thing, they don't build long arcs like the new series does, they are more stand-alone.

The Big Finish audio plays - I'd say maybe 40% are pure genius, 20% are enjoyable, 20% are decent, and 20% I turn off halfway through because they're just plain boring (again, not a bad ratio - beats most shows out there).  I would wait to get into these til after seeing some of the old Doctor Whos, that way the audio plays come to life in your mind that much more (since you can literally picture the main characters)  The one exception to this are the 8th Doctor adventures - since he had only a very limited run on TV (a universally loathed TV movie) his audio plays stand on their own (and stand very well - they are some of my favorites)

Hope it helps!

My father is Dutch and I have dual citizenship with the USA and The Netherlands so I am a huge fan of the Oranje. I live for the World cup every four years (these last two being very exciting and aggravating) but I had never followed the EPL too closely. I was familiar with the teams and the players from playing a lot of FIFA but did not support one team specifically, more so just rooted for the Dutch players to do well on their respective squads. 

Then this summer I discovered the Men in Blazers podcast after watching their world cup preview videos and quickly became a GFOP. That's when I realized that the EPL season can be almost as exciting as a World Cup, but drawn out over more months. I just needed a team to support and become emotionally attached to. 

It would be easy to go with Man U for RvP, Blind, van Der Sar, Ruuuuuud, and LvG, but there are already too many bandwagon Man U fans in my area. Plus I am not inclined to support historically successful teams (diehard New York Mets fan...). 

Spurs seemed like a good underdog choice because they were once home to one of my all-time favorite players Rafael van Der Vaart, and I also recognized Eriksen from Ajax. 

So it has been about a month now of watching as many games as I can and checking in here to learn more about the team and the history, and I have enjoyed it immensely.

It's good to have on me to record injuries and scenes of crime. Nasty ABH/GBH? I can film the victim and/or the suspect before they are cleaned up, i can capture all the blood on them in the setting where it happened.

It protects me against complaints and false allegations, they happen frequently to a lot of officers. They are almost always canned by the sgt because 99% of complaints about the police are from people that are unhappy because we've nicked them. Imagine that! But sometimes some complaints have the potential to actually be investigated more thoroughly in which case it's great to have camera footage of what happend.

I am however against having the camera on all the time, I need to speak freely and openly with my colleagues. I need to have a joke in the station or in the car after i've been to that shit job to blow off a little steam. Everyday I will say something unprofessional to a colleague or friend, chatting about someones family problems or taking the piss out of the boss. 

It's a working environment and we are all real people with real working relationships. I don't want everything I say or do filmed. Nobody wants to be filmed all the time when they are at work. I work pretty hard, it's not an easy job a lot of people hate us for doing it but it's a job that needs to be done. Having all police officers being recorded every working minute of their day would frankly be a bit of an insult to their integrity as upstanding members of society. It would imply they cannot be trusted not to fill someone in so they need to be watched all the time.

I'm confident enough to do that on the basis of what we know about Ebola virus, depending on the stage of infection but obviously I would say that to a hypothetical scenario - human nature may kick in. 

An interesting thing to note is that viral load and thus likelihood of infection increases with the peak when you are dead. Touching dead bodies' skin, then your own mucosal membranes will infect you. The village burial practices in west Africa, where the whole village bathe themselves in a pool with dead bodies and handles them wih no precautions (soap and clean water don't exist - that's all you need to inactivate the virus) are considered siginifact factors as to why it spread so rapidly. The actual likelihood of being infected by someone even in phase two is still quite low, I believe the risk of household transmition in Africa has been observed to be between 3 and 17% for previous outbreaks. I'll try find the link. You have to consider that that's in Africa, where many of the infected have been stuck at home with family right up until they die due to lack of beds/fear of contacting doctors (government endorsed mass killing of people)

We have an issue with how people perceive themselves.

I know quite a few people who, on earning 20-30k a year feel they are (approaching) middle class.  It's all about the coin.

Equally, I know people on the dole who feel decidedly middle-class, and may have gone to OxBridge or various other esteemed institutions which have been historically evident of 'class', but who are clearly in a financial puddle hitherto unknown to their family.  And even, perhaps not.

I think that Middle Class means an assured education of the highest sort, allowing one to serve the interests of the upper classes and maybe garner a few rewards on the way.  Should one preserve the interests of the ruling elite and, obviously, serve them, then one might be rewarded.  Have an OBE.  Keep a sharp look-out for the degenerates below.  And among you.

Below this - and below this, my darlings, are many, many professionals, - come hoi pollei. Think doctors, architects and so on. They are unruly, ungovernable and at worst, have ideas above their station.  They are ruthlessly destroyed wherever possible.

Below that, there are scum.  They are kept in check by the middle classes who will lose sympathy and favour should they ever allow the scum to become in any way annoying.

This, in essence, is British society.

if you don't earn +£100k I reckon, you are working class.  I don't care what you think or what newspapers you read.  if you wish to argue the point, it only illustrates how badly you misunderstand the distribution of wealth in the UK.  You're being fucking played.

We seem to be getting our confidence back and I think that's one of the biggest reasons we've been so poor. Some of the new players seem to be settling now.

Most importantly Rodgers seems to be finally finding a way to somewhat make up for 3 **massive** disadvantages we've had this season. The loss of SAS. And the decline of Steven Gerrard.

My (optimistic) prediction for the rest of the season:-

We have a relatively easy January in terms of fixtures. Our hardest game is West Ham at Anfield. So if we can get some momentum going with a run of good results. And we get Sturridge back for the rest of the season. And perhaps a decent signing. Then we can make a strong push for the 4th spot.

Nevermind a suitable mutation which would require such a dramatic shift in viral kinetics, that it's never ever been observed in biology (it's pretty much not possible due to the virulence factors of Ebola virus and what their target cells are) mutations also require suitable selection pressures. 

Also I don't think you know what mutation is. Ebola virus is a viral RNA species and it exists as a quasispecies. As such it is highly mutagenic, and is always rapidly mutating, however not in a manner to affect its virulence factors.

It's far far more likely that HIV, another highly mutagenic viral RNA species,  becomes airborne or more communicable. This is given the significantly higher number of transmission events and hosts through a much longer period of time too. With your logic it would follow that HIV sufferers shouldn't fly, or perhaps just be culled off the face of the earth right now. Fortunately this will never happen, as this type of thinking without evidence is considered 'insane' in the scientific world.

I always knew it was going to be a long shot to get to go, I just let my excitement blur my reality. I realize now (and I should of before) that this game is on par with like the Superbowl here in America (which I don't give a shit about), so I always knew it was going to be a challenge to go. 

But it's a bit frustrating because believe it or not City is my life. I fell in love with football on my own 6 years ago and with the premier league being the most exciting league in the world I decided to follow a team from there (MLS is fun but English footy is where it's at, can you blame me?). The only thing I knew when I started to get interested in football was that I didn't like Manchester United so I decided to choose to root for the team across town. I've become obsessed with them ever since and its been a dream of mine to see them play in a match that means something (not just friendlies here in the U.S.). 

And now I've learned that in order to see them play you have to have these points which are impossible for me to get (i've never even been out of the U.S. before). So how can I ever start building up these points? Well I can't at all really and that makes me sad ya know? It was a real shock to me to hear that not only can I not go this upcoming derby (not a total shock) but that I probably won't be able to go to any derby or big game in my life because I won't ever have enough points. Can you understand why thats frustrating? I've grown to really really love this club just like every other city fan in manchester it's just that i happen to be across the pond with a struggling bank account so going to games will always be a challenge but hey, it's something to work towards.

I hope you see where I'm coming from. You're right about the ""staggering disconnect with the realities"" thing but thanks to you I'm a bit less disconnected. I will 100% still be coming to Manchester for spring break though. I enjoy every derby, even the ones I have to wake up 7 in the morning for so I know watching the derby in Manchester is still going to be one of the best times of my life. Thanks for the response.

Just to allay your fears, it's not impossible that you could ever attend a derby. It's just close to impossible that you could attend a derby in the away end at Old Trafford where the ticket allocation is circa 3k and we have 40k+ regular match-going blues who'd like to go.

There's always the chance you could get lucky with a random ticket from a tout or such, but the chances are slim to none that you'll pay face value. You may have to pay a lot. There's also the hospitality option, a few hundred pounds but a match ticket.

Getting a ticket for a derby at the Etihad would be easier, simply since there's so many more tickets available. There's still a points criteria, so you probably wouldn't qualify via that. But there are more spare tickets knocking around with home games, plus again, there always hospitality.

Don't take this the wrong way, but why the fixation on the derby? There are many other competitive premier league games you could get a ticket to quite easily, I'm struggling not to see that as textbook glory type fan behaviour mate.

Very few long standing blues first game was a derby. We play West Ham and Villa at the Etihad in April, you should be able to get a ticket for those games, do they not interest you?",0,1419922446,null,0,false,0,cn94mv0,t3_2qh8r0,t1_cn94mv0,t1_cn94a3e,null,1425152717,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

Yes, many of the episodes from the 60's are missing, but all the audio exists and they've all been novelized. You can find reconstructions that use the audio and all surviving stills and clips. I prefer the novelization. 

&gt;I'm a bit of a completionist.

This series will definitely put you to the test with that. The universe is massive. It's a wonderful journey though. I'm about 3 years in. I've seen every surviving story, heard about half of the full cast audios and have read a few books.

You start on the new stuff, then go back to the classics later or go through the whole series in order. 

The new series tries not to alienate people who haven't seen the classics. 

I jumped all around the series for awhile. I recommend doing both classic and new Who each in order, jumping back and forth between them. 

Doesn't really matter which one you start on. Keep in mind that classic who stories are movie length (several episodes in a serial, usually 4 or 6). 

After all that, there are tons of full cast audios with all surviving classic Doctors and plenty of books.

I agree with your player assessments but would add Zamora to those performing with distinction, he deserves a fair chunk of the credit that Charlie is getting.

One aspect of the season that is pleasing is that we appear to be learning from past mistakes - something we've always been terrible at in the past. We ditched the 3-5-2 early on; we appear to have more modest ambitions and are capable of scrapping. In our relegation season, lest we forget, we were modelled as a boutique club playing flowing attacking football - it was all about style, and we got trounced by savvy, superior sides. We still need to figure out how to shut games down, particularly away from home and in the final 20 mins, when we've conceded a lot of goals. We do not set up well defensively and have conceded way too many goals. If we can bring that 'goals against' column down, we should be fine.

In the Burnley game, I think he was a good pick. Same thing with the derby games. It's just depth, the same as Lampard as City. Maybe he isn't part of our starting XI, but Rodgers changed more than just Gerrard yesterday; this was a whole new team. To put the win down entirely to not picking Gerrard is lazy and something like English media would do. If the game had gone the other way they'd give us shit for dropping him. 

My point with 'Rodgers needs to pick a position for him...' was if he's going to use Gerrard in certain games, he needs to find the most effective position to play him in.

false,arcisal,null,null,"**What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?**

Our strongest back four as of now would definitely be Walker, Vertonghen, Fazio and Davies, with Lloris in the goal. As for central midfield, I think that question is yet to be answered. Our players tend to go on good bouts of form before dropping of almost hilariously (such as Mason, Capoue, Bentaleb) or only show small glimpses of promise in an otherwise unimpressive 90 minutes (like Dembele). However, if I had to choose based purely on past form alone, it would probably have to be Capoue and Bentaleb.

Eriksen has to be on the field as well, no question. Same goes for Kane. Our wingers are a lot like our central midfielders. Shows glimpses of promise such as Lamela or goes on good rounds of form such as Lennon. The only consistent winger we have is Chadli. And I'd pick Lamela over Lennon if I were forced to.

**What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?**

**Mason**: I think none of us here would have expected him to suddenly emerge from relative obscurity to regular first-team starter. He's had his moments of shakiness but for someone who has been consistently loaned out over and over again, he's done well to win his place and is actually in contention to become our long-term solution to the central midfield problem we've been having.

**Kane**: We all love this guy. We all knew he had it in him, but 15 goals in 25 appearances is absolutely insane for someone who barely even had minutes last season. I'd be exciting to see what he can achieve by the end of the season.

**Eriksen**: Bar Hugo, he's been consistently in the running for best player on the pitch. He's proven to be able to recoup the form he has shown in his debut year with him, albeit this time more in goals that in assists. Again, the fact that he's only 23 (in 2015) is pretty crazy in a really really good way.

**What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?**

**Adebayor**: We all hoped he'd change his ways and show that he is capable, but like how he showed Sherwood in the second half of last season. Unfortunately, he hasn't and is proven to be one of the worst players of the season so far.

**Kaboul**: It's unnerving to see that our captain and vice-captain have both been ostracized from the squad entirely now. Just like Ade, we all thought that Kaboul could show his form again from before his terrible injury. However, that probably isn't the case. Bar one great game against Arsenal, he has shown to be mediocre and mistake-prone in every other game.

**What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?**

Definitely Hugo's department. And with safe hands on Vorm to back him up as well. I think our left-back problem has been pretty much solved, but its only Rose's erratic form (ranging from absolute beast to absolute ass) that's holding it back. Davies has consistently produced good quality work there, bar his first few games.

**What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?**

Striker. We only have 1 reliable goal scorer in the form of the young Harry Kane. Adebayor is a wash out and Soldado is a shadow of his former self, despite his hardwork.


**What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?**

Adebyor, Kaboul, Naughton. Basically all the dead weight. I'd say Dembele, Chiriches and Lennon should all also be monitored closely. If their form doesn't pick up or they don't show any signs of improving, then they should head out as well.

**What transfers IN need to happen next summer?**

A striker (Josip Drmic?) and a quality central midfielder. We have too many *okay* or *average* CMs. Cabaye is a good bet. We also need some good defensive depth. Currently our center-backs are lacking in real quality besides our starting two of Verts and Fazio. Hoping Dier could step up and prove a reliable back-up but until then another more experienced defender should come in.

**Do you believe Poch has been able to implement his system yet, why?**

At the start of the season, no. It seemed like the dressing room mood was down and the fruits of the players labors were all but evident. But now, we can see how much we improve in our game as the match drags on. We intensify in the later minutes when other teams tire and we've also seen more and more viewings of the fabled ""high-pressing"" system Poch developed at Southampton.

**Are you satisfied with Poch so far, why?**

Yes. He's shown he wants to stay and he's here for the long run. I just hope Levy doesn't suddenly decide to sack him over a few bad runs of eliminations from cups.


**Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season?**

Anywhere between 7th and 4th. Call me crazy but I think the elusive fourth place is not entirely out of reach. Arsenal aren't really as in form as they were last season, Southampton has shown it is unable to produce in big games and I doubt West Ham will keep up with their fantastic run so far.


**How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season?**

Hope to do well in Europa. With a bit of luck, we can snatch the FA Cup from Chelsea.


**How do you see Spurs progressing in the Europa League this season?**

Finals? No idea. But hopefully we don't bomb out.

On Boxing day the last 3 years, this was the points tally for teams which were 4th.

2013-14 : 36 points.

2012-13 : 33 points

2011 - 12 : 34

In 2011-12 and 12-13 the team which actually finished 4th had 33 and 32 point respectively on Boxing day.

This year 2014-15 the 4th team is on 32 points. 

While I am a optimist , i would not bet on either West Ham or Southampton finishing in top 4. This means the team most likely to finish 4th ( Arsenal , Spurs ) are right now on 30 points. The lowest ever in the last 3/4 seasons. 


Pasting a comment I put in another thread above..  

I believe the target for 4th this year will be lower...  It may be in the early 70s. 



I guess it would help if u could add a projected 4th points target for this year which Could be based on points we / arsenal and spurs have....

It took me a while to get on board. I'd been hurt by the 1996 movie and so was suspicious. I was a fairly casual fan back then, though, and hadn't got into Big Finish or the novels at all. Nor was I keeping up with fandom, so it really wasn't clear at first if the new series was actually a continuation or a reboot - and this remained true until *Timecrash*.  

I wasn't too keen on Eccleston's performance and took a while to come round to it (second viewing, some years later, really), and I didn't like the ide of the time war at first.  

I really started to get on board with Tennant, and ended up thoroughly enjoying the show again by then. I was ok with Smith's early shows but was losing interest by series 6 (in fact I only recently realised that I had completely missed most of 6B). Series 7 picked up again, a bit, but it wasn't until *Night*, *Day* &amp; *Time of the Doctor* that I came completely back on board - in a big way: I've been devouring the audios, novels, comics and early shows daily ever since.  

Overall, I now find the time war to be one of the more interesting additions, and enjoy quite a bit of the new style and lore.  

However, I really do miss the cliff-hangers from the old shows, and certainly feel that a good many of Smiths episodes (at least) would really have benefitted from being longer/two-parters. There are some great tales in among them, but compressed down *so much* that what could be great SF becomes just silly fantasy.  

As for the focus on character and companions rather than plot and world-building, I don't like that way that each compnion has become ""the most important girl in the universe"" in some way or another. Leave it. Let them just be normal people again. That they have character development we get more interaction etc, well that's fine: I'm quite happy with that.  

TBH, if I had to choose now between continuing with the TV show and with the other media only, it'd be hard, but I'd go with the other media, led by Big Finish.

Yes it does. See; Brendan Rodgers for most of this season. On paper Liverpools squad is fantastic and yet they have been consistently underperforming (maybe things are changing recently).

I understand the argument you're making. The problems are: subjective value is reality, labour theory of value is totally disconnected from reality. If you try forcing me to pay $8 for something that you spent x amount of time labouring to make, and I don't value it at all, I'll tell you to f right off. Secondly, without ownership, no one takes care of stuff. This applies to personal affects as well as a factory and the tooling therein.

These problems are more apparent in a digital and information economy, where the labour theory of value starts to really make zero sense at all. I'm a business owner, doing consulting in open-source technical automation systems. I can see a lot of wealth and benefit for both the capitalist risk-taker and the labourer in ancapistan. I can see abject poverty in any form of socialism or mutualism. If you don't have any experience in business, feel free to ask me for more details on why I think this.

One morning I chose Morelia vs Club America to watch. In the first minute Montero took the ball to the corner, did his dance, and beat two guys then crossed it for the foreword to head in and score. I instantly loved the guy because I love flair players. I started to watch Liga MX and follow Montero and Morelia.

Then, and this is the weirdest thing, as march rolls around the Portland Timbers announce a preseason friendly at home against Montero and Morelia. I was shocked. Out of all the teams in the world they choose the one that I'm sure barely any non Mexican Portland people had heard of and the team i was following. Crazy coincidence.

Even most prescription creams cannot penetrate that far because fundamentally the skin evolved to be a barrier.

Looking waxlike and immobile means having way too much Botox: yes it has to be repeated often and there is a substantial cost implication to that. You could consider DIY microneedling - [see OwnDoc here] (http://owndoc.com/) - but your whole diet and skincare regime needs to be in line for healing and collagen to be deposited. Also it is a long term, eye wateringly uncomfortable commitment. Alongside that you would want to use sunscreen, topical vitamin C and a topical retinoid (vitamin A) at the very least.

The official healthy eating guidelines are bare minimum not optimal nutrition. Sugary/ fatty/ processed junk should be maximum 10% of daily calories (TINY serving about 250 cals for the average man, and that includes most breakfast cereals). Sugar is hugely damaging to the body, both from fruit and processed sugar. It causes chronic inflammation and has been implicated in many common chronic diseases (cancer to heart disease) as well as skin ageing.

Honestly the diet is what I would recommend you sort out, that has got nothing but positive side effects. Reduce sugar cravings by balancing your blood glucose, eat little and often including breakfast, a mix of protein and healthy fats at every meal and snack. Go for small servings of the lowest glycaemic index carbs (beans, lentils, barley, sweet potatoes, vegetables).

Most countries advocate seven to nine servings of fruit and veg a day in line with the published research, our *at least* five a day is well behind. To get that many in start at breakfast. Go for low sugar fruits and non starchy vegetables in the FULL rainbow of bight and dark colours (blue/ purple, dark green, red, yellow/ orange) for skin friendly antioxidants.

If you are still trying to lose weight or maintain it the only commercial 'diet' I'd recommend is [The Smarter Science of Slim] (http://sanesolution.com/) - the author is a down to earth personal trainer not some crazy Hollywood dermatologist. It is reduced carb, nutrient dense, properly balanced, varied, skin friendly. There are free podcasts as well as recipes on the [Marmalade &amp; Mileposts blog] (http://marmaladeandmileposts.com/) if you want to get a feel for it.

We changed the laws on immigration at the beginning of the year for Romanians and Bulgarians.  Before the change Bulgarians and Romanians had a separate system for deciding if they were allowed to live here permanently (similar, but different to the points based system for outside the EU - the EU system was based on labour market based controls, not on immigration controlling controls, eg the requirement for funds was not in the EU controls).  After the change Bulgarians and Romanians have the same rights as anyone else from the EU.

Some politicians thought that this change in controls would drastically increase the number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming here (notably Nigel Farage who claimed that it would be 5k a week, every week and who had a poster campaign on the however many million who were coming here to take our jobs).  Official figures say it hasn't.  Of course that doesn't mean to say that it wouldn't have been less this year under the old system.

The absolute number (47k in a year) is probably what you are going to hear about in most of the press.

&gt;

&gt;""__Amy's Baking Company__"" is the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of *[Kitchen Nightmares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares)*, and the 82nd episode of the series overall. The episode first aired on May 10, 2013 and centered on [Gordon Ramsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay) attempting to help Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, owners of Amy's Baking Company in [Scottsdale, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona). 

&gt;The episode marked the first time in the series that conflict with the owners prevented Ramsay from completing the restaurant's transformation.  The owners' actions received negative attention in social media. Their online responses were then further spread in social media in a manner which *[Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes)* called an example of how a business should not react to comments posted on social media. 

&gt;A follow-up episode, titled ""[Return to Amy's Baking Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares#ep83)"", aired as the season 7 premiere on April 11, 2014.

Let's simplify things a little. Imagine a door that leads into a large conference hall or some such place. Every hour, ten people go through the door and enter the hall. This continues for some time. Then, someone parks up outside with a sandwich board, advertising the hall as a great place to visit. Some of the people inside the hall panic - ""We'll be overwhelmed! There's not enough space!"" But despite this, still only ten people enter the hall every hour.

Now, in an attempt to justify their earlier panic, the naysayers try to shift the goal-posts - ""But ten people an hour is *still quite a lot*, isn't it? We should think about limiting that!"". The other people in the hall call them out on their prior scaremongering, but they just ignore all criticism and keep on with their rhetoric.

So, think of it in terms of our conference hall.

A mate and I went to the Crystal Palace match on then 20th. We got Cityzen memberships and bought tickets through the City ticket office. We bought the tickets after they went on sale so we went through the official City resale site where you buy your tickets from season ticket holders that post their ticket for sale. But so you know in order to use the resale site you have to be a Cityzen. I believe we paid £40 for the membership and about the same per ticket. The price we paid was maybe £1 more than what we would had paid if we bought the tickets right when they went on sale. We noticed that purchasing the tickets from a 3rd party site was about the same price as getting a membership and buying through the MCFC site anyways. We were in section 119 in the South Stand in row P. They were awesome seats and pretty close the the away supporters, so you're in the loudest part of the stadium. You might be able to get a cheaper ticket from a 3rd party site but we're glad we went the route that we did. We received our tickets directly from the box office with our names printed on them so there was no worrying that we were getting scammed (not sure how common that is, but we wanted to be better safe than sorry).

Carroll's injury was a blessing in disguise, and Nolan's was a blessing, period. 

The injuries encouraged the new system with two ball playing STs. Zarate should have been handed more starts after the Everton game. 

But now Sam had bought Nolan and Carroll back into the team and our performances have well and truly dropped in quality. I like Sam, but his stubbornness always shines through. Nolan doesn't deserve a sub appearance, Carroll's been good as an individual, but the team has been so much worse since he's been handed a start. The crossing now that Andy is back is again just floated, not whipped in. How many goals did Enner and Sakho score when the ball was floated in? None 

Again, since their re-introduction, our impact subs have been ineffective. Valencia will come on - for Sakho - and will be forced out wide to facilitate Carroll. Fuck that pisses me off. Enner is clearly not a winger. He played there for years and when he finally was moved to ST, he was fucking amazing. He doesn't create chances, he gets on the end of them. I can see that Sam, what's wrong with you?? Same can be said for Downing, he gets moved to RW now Nolan is back in the team. Yeah that's right, the most underperforming player we have is replacing our rejuvenated player at CAM... and forcing Stewie out wide (where he was average last season).

Based on my personal experience, a Director of Engineering at a top tier UK engineering firm (as in the very top engineer, only one at that level at that site) earns ~2/5 of your estimate. The project Chief Engineers, as in the chaps who sign off the big decisions that affect people's lives, maybe five on the site, earn another 20k or so LESS than that.

So that's maybe six people out of a few thousand earning big-ish money and it's still a fraction of your number. So it's a bit disingenuous to act as if engineers in general are sitting on piles of cash. 

Sorry if I'm getting snippy but this is a bone of contention in the industry - a lot of us go into it for the passion and creativity, and as such we get screwed over on salary because they can get away with paying us much much less than if we applied the same skills in say the financial sector. And despite the fact that as I said a lot of our decisions do directly impact people's safety, and also despite the government harping on about bringing engineering and manufacturing back to the UK.

Gay marriage and homosexuality is an issue which evokes strong emotional responses but those responses should not justify the silencing of opposition to it, we stamp out the freedom to object at our peril. 

Let's take your example of ""two people in love"" for instance. Say  a man and woman appear who also want to marry but they happen to be brother and sister, what's the problem? You can forget about the deformed offspring issue as the man agrees to have the snip.

Now under the EXACT same reasons you give to validate gay marriage you MUST now permit and indeed promote sibling marriage. In fact if a group supporting the as yet illegal sibling marriage law where to ask for a cake and be refused you would have to attempt to prosecute the baker for refusing to bake it.  See what I mean.

Now you support brothers and sisters marrying and allow no opposition on grounds on conscience.

Let's take it further, what about marriage with multiple husbands or wives? They all live each other so what's the problem? Or the age of consent being lowered to 12 or 13? Who's to say a 13 year old girl can't be in love, are there not existing g today countries where children marry? And this is only about marriage, what about companies in conscience boycotting products from Israel, should this act of conscience be banned?

See, if you deny the freedom to object because it suits you on a particular issue you deny it to yourself later and worse you make the law your conscience.

Have to say it's completely irrelevant whether it's unfair or not, it's the facts. It's unfair that I am not a millionaire because I wasn't born in to it, but it's true!

&gt;I would have greater expectations of anyone moving country than I would on the local-born, otherwise we really do sanction benefit tourism. 

Now perhaps it's not the case with you, but the people who talk about benefit tourism as a real thing are the same sort of people who see the government as some entity that you should try and screw over through tax avoidance etc. IMO it says a lot more about them than it does about immigrants.

When I moved to the UK, the last thing I did was look at the benefits system. I came here because I knew I could have a better life than I had at home, and this is why the ""benefit tourist"" argument is such a crap one. If even 1% of immigrants come specifically as ""benefit tourists"" I would be surprised. It's bullshit.

I would have to say that your first argument contradicts your own second argument.

&gt;Consider those who travel to the UK will already have the facilities to do so. It's not completely free. They're not born here - they have to work enough to be able to make that transition.

Latest [ONS report](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/november-2014/index.html) on immigration.

Notable information from said report:

&gt;583,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending June 2014

So, that's over half a million people in a very short space of time. Note, this is not net migration.

See:

&gt;An estimated 323,000 people emigrated from the UK in the year ending June 2014


So this means net migration will be around:

&gt;Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 260,000 in the year ending June 2014


On Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants:

&gt;32,000 Romanian and Bulgarian (EU2) citizens immigrated to the UK in the year ending June 2014, a statistically significant increase from 18,000 in the previous 12 months.

[Graph/Chart](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/eu2inflow_tcm77-387105.png) on Romanian and Bulgarian immigration. You can see, overall it is drastically on the rise.

So, while there hasn't been a ""surge"", there has been a significant rise. We also have to remember, the figures for the next quarter could be drastically different since we have uncontrolled immigration. In 2011 it was about 300k net immigration, it could return to those levels, rise, or it could lower or stay the same.",0,1419942351,null,0,false,0,cn995x5,t3_2qst3g,t1_cn995x5,t3_2qst3g,null,1425150603,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

It's a fact you're not a millionaire but that doesn't make it a comparison with anything. 

If you're going to mention UK vs. Immigrant employment rates there are factors outside of 'number versus number employed' to consider. That's the kind of detail a GCSE C-grade science student would look into it. 

&gt; When I moved to the UK, the last thing I did was look at the benefits system. I came here because I knew I could have a better life than I had at home, and this is why the ""benefit tourist"" argument is such a crap one. If even 1% of immigrants come specifically as ""benefit tourists"" I would be surprised. It's bullshit.

Ok, fair enough benefit tourism may not be *the reason* but if I was relocating, I'd look at what healthcare / support etc. was available. You don't move country without doing some research, do you? You might factor in what help is available to you in one country vs. another. 

Calling every non-working immigrant a benefit tourist is completely unfair. I'll say it loud and clear here so I'm not mistaken...

...*However* that was never my original point. My original point is that if you're going to look at out-of-work % of immigrants vs. UK and draw comparisons then you had better look at all the factors involved and not just the basic numbers. 

&gt; If they've done that, they aren't going to move here specifically to live at the bottom. It doesn't even make sense.

I'd hope that's true, but it must be nice to know you have a safety net if you fail, right? 

That's not to imply everyone goes looking to fail. Immigrants (do not equal) benefits seekers. 

However if there are a sizeable larger number out of work now vs. 8 years ago then why is that? Economic circumstances? Poor planning? Reliance on the benefits system for support? Stiff competition due to increased numbers?

We are a membership based organisation and our members get access to amazing office space, meeting spaces as well as a range of inspiring events. We chose to launch the Kickstarter to offer the opportunity for people to get involved early in the community and in return get a reduction in the usual membership rate. Similar to how most Kickstarter projects work really. We've done a lot of research into what early stage entrepreneurs and micro enterprises need and we want to offer a range of support and guidance alongside renting a desk. We also believe by bringing together a diverse, talented community we can  start collaborating together and working on even more great ideas. So in answer to your first question we are appealing to those who want to get involved in making Birmingham better through whatever skill set they have.

I always get the feeling that a lot of the people that complain about this subreddit are assholes that get out-assholed here and they don't like it. Maybe not everyone, but that's what I'm trying to help with in general. The splice of that thread is fucking hilarious though, thank you. It literally consists of OP being sad that /r/UKDota has a lot of 4k players (?) and two people who haven't been particularly nice on the subreddit and overestimating their own skill in both cases.

They could always just join the IHL and see if their fears were correct or not if they really wanted to improve and get their big chance to play with players who aren't utterly in the gutter; but I guess it's above them or something, right?

Oh, I'm also not turning this subreddit into a fucking police state like people apparently want. We're pretty hard on people, yes, but a lot of them don't really help themselves. The majority of /r/DotA2 would get flamed off the map here and I'm pretty OK with that. Fuck them.

I was disappointed at the time about a few things. The single episode format worried me at the time but I changed my mind halfway through the series as they broke up the two parter episodes nicely. I also didn't like the Time War because killing off the Daleks and the Time Lords removed big staples of the show. At the time, I didn't realise they'd bring Daleks back every year and the Master occasionally. The new console was also a bit outlandish and I still don't like that style of interior compared to the old one but loved how more detailed and realistic it looked. The Sonic Screwdriver was good to have back and its redesign looked great. Christopher Ecclestone made a good Doctor for a new generation and his Doctor went well with Rose Tyler and Captain Jack.

Ultimately, I accepted that they'd just kept enough the same to keep the show recognisable without getting horribly mired in the past, which was a problem at the end of the Classic Series. It also tackled a lot of issues that the old series ignored that are actually interesting to discuss. What happens to the companion's families when they leave? Is everyone suitable to travel with the Doctor? Can't the Doctor fix someone's past for them? What are the consequences of the Doctor swanning off without helping to rebuild?

Berries, cherries, blackcurrants/ redcurrants and plums are loaded with skin friendly antioxidants. It is difficult to eat the full rainbow (blue/ purple) without these - your only widely available savoury options are purple cabbage, beetroot, aubergine and olives which is quite limiting.

Seeds like pumpkin, chia, hemp and also walnuts are loaded with antioxidants, healthy fats, minerals and fibre. If you reduce carbohydrate intake you have to increase fat and protein to get a balance of calories and nutrients, also fat/ protein/ fibre are high satiety - make you feel fuller quicker and for longer, slow or minimise blood sugar peaks and troughs (a factor in sugar cravings). Also protein actually 'wastes' a fair percentage of calories in the digestive process, and there is some evidence suggesting some of the fat in nuts and seeds is 'trapped' by the fibre so not absorbed.

The foods to particularly avoid/ minimise are fat added and sugar added processed stuff, these are in the maximum 10% daily calories category. Obviously do eat some animal fats (cheeses) but be aware that fats from land/ farm animals are similar in composition to our own fat. For that reason the body finds it easier to covert excess to body fat compared to those from, say, an olive or coconut. Again research suggests certain fats in coconut are preferentially burned off as energy and not stored.

Botox is hundreds of pounds a pop I think. Skincare ... alongside diet, alongside Botox or alongside microneedling  you can try it, but I think it highly unlikely you will be able to reverse the ageing process, merely slow it down. You may well get some initial results/ plumping if your skin is dehydrated.

* Very unpredictable General election, too many variables to make bets.

* Oil prices may continue to lower a bit and stay that way for at least 6 months.

* EuroZone will continue to stagnate, Greece may drop the Euro. Possibly heading for another EuroZone crisis.

* ISIS will still control some places but will be weakened significantly, to eliminate them entirely you'll need ground forces. 

* Russia will probably continue incursions into Ukraine. Putin will try to get Russians to rally around him.

* EU sanctions will probably not change unless Russia makes significant advances on Ukrainian forces. The Russian economy isn't in a good state and making it more unstable isn't good for Russia or Europe. An even more unstable Russia isn't needed.

* I think the Iran nuclear talks could possibly come to a positive, agreed conclusion. Not too.

* Russel Brand will continue his campaigning for true Democracy or whatever it is he does. He will very probably not stand in a constituency.

* William Hague was a very good politician in my opinion, shame to see him go. He may continue something political or may just leave it.

* Alex Salmond running for a Westminster seat. Now that is exciting. I very much disagree with his politics, but you cannot deny the man has renovated Scottish politics and has made a young generation, interested in politics. 

* UKIP, also very exciting to me. If their support can climb to the twenties, then they are predicted to make gains of around 30-50MP's. At their current support they could gain 5-10 seats, now I say this because their polling has been lower than the results on average. See - Heywood &amp; Middleton, they we're predicted to be around 10-20 points behind Labour and then, out of nowhere came within 600 votes of them, in a ""safe"" labour seat.

Initially, I got involved in Impact Hub because of the people involved much more than the project itself. They really are passionate about making positive change in the city.

For me, the difference is mainly one of infrastructure. Kind of similar to the difference between OpenOffice and Microsoft Word - the end products look similar, but what you're investing in is an infrastructure that's more flexible, more usable, and more community focussed. Same goes for the difference between Reddit and Facebook - both social media platforms, but with Reddit being much more democratic and responsive to its community. 

Impact Hub will look like an office space. A cool, funky, creative space, but still just a space. What's important is how that space gets to respond to the needs of Birmingham as a city. Because of the way we've chosen to fund it - with Birmingham as a whole not just organisations, and choosing to see people as members not clients, we get more breathing room when making decisions. It means Item #1 on the agenda gets to be ""what does Birmingham need?"" rather than ""How do we get more clients?"" Likewise, organisations that are doing great work in Birmingham get to have conversations with us about how we can support them rather than being kicked out as soon as rent's due.

As you can see, it's actually really hard to express what differences that change in infrastructure makes before the thing exists. I'd advise checking out some of the other Impact Hubs around the world and how they've worked differently in their communities - Impact Hub Oakland especially have been a big inspiration for Impact Hub Birmingham. 

We all know passionate, caring people working hard to add value to people's lives despite their environments. Whether it's in large corporations, or banks, or the city council - a lot of their energies end up being spent fighting the system they're in rather than helping people they want to help.

&gt;The __Horsehead Nebula__ (also known as __Barnard 33__ ) is a [dark nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_nebula) in the constellation [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation\)).  The nebula is located just to the south of the star [Alnitak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Orionis), which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger [Orion Molecular Cloud Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Molecular_Cloud_Complex). The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) astronomer [Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming) on photographic plate B2312 taken at the [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College) Observatory. The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 1500 [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year) from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of the shape of its swirling cloud of dark dust and gases, which bears some resemblance to a [horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse)'s head when viewed from Earth.

false,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;Because it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets, bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, when a sudden drop in prices appears. Such a drop is known as a crash or a bubble burst. Both the boom and the burst phases of the bubble are examples of a positive feedback mechanism, in contrast to the negative feedback mechanism that determines the equilibrium price under normal market circumstances. Prices in an economic bubble can fluctuate erratically, and become impossible to predict from supply and demand alone.

That's from the wiki entry on bubbles. You can hypothesise that it's a bubble, but no one will really know for sure without a sharp downwards correction. 

It could simply be the huge influx of people, and the lack of homes being built. Simple supply and demand. 

I don't actually think that, but it still could be the case. 

I very much doubt we'll see a burst. Prices will stagnate, most likely. For a burst to happen everyone would need to try and sell en mass, but at the end of the day the majority of homes are peoples, well, homes. Where are they going to go? 

Obviously the foreign investors could dump their portfolios onto the market, but there needs to be a trigger. Someone needs to start the flight, but how is that going to happen?",0,1419947743,null,0,false,0,cn9aiz0,t3_2qsta0,t1_cn9aiz0,t1_cn9ag7e,null,1425149968,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

false,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"Rising prices on a fixed commodity require finding a constant stream of new buyers (or greater fools) willing to pay those prices.

The tipping point comes when more people consider the prices too high (or there's simply not enough people who can afford the prices) and at that point the same instinct that caused the herds of people to rush to buy, will now cause the herds of people to rush to sell something they see as losing it's worth.

Those who ahead of the herd get out and at a profit or evens, those last to sell (usually the one's who were last to buy) lose a lot of money.

In the context of the UK housing market over the last 10+ years, the government and banking industry in collusion managed to delay the burst (causing the bubble to grow bigger) by:

* Breaking their own rules on mortgages (increasing the income x3 ceiling and not doing due diligence on self-declared income)
* Creating part-ownership schemes
* Allowing unfettered foreign investment in to London property - before it's even built, and often on whole apartment blocks that sit empty with no-one living in them.

And it was buoyed by general greed of home-owners who expected a rise in their property price - even listing above professional valuations, even when the market tells them their asking price was too high (e.g. not selling for 18 months).

Eventually, like all investment vehicles, even those foreign investors gambling on London property will struggle to find the greater fool....

I am originally from milan, and milan in many ways is similar to london but much smaller, the people tend to be similar as well so to speak honestly there was not much of a cultural difference. 

The main differences are we in Milan are more racist than the English, and we have a radically different expectation and relation with food. But you guys are at least not as bad as the Yanks with your culinary habits. In terms of being well dressed, London is actually just as fashionable as Milan, walking around in Kensington you see people wearing the exact same clothes you would see in the Galleria in milan. Also half my friends in london work in finance and half my friends in milan work in finance.

Scrapping the departments of environment and culture seems a weird move to say the least. Either you're a climate change denier and don't think the state should have any role over cultural institutions, or you're just folding these functions into other departments. Reshuffles like that cost lots of money and rarely make things better.

Scrapping Barnett formula spending is a great idea in theory but would be a catastrophe in practice. Scotland might do well out of it (or it might be fairer) but you'd be hanging other places that rely on it out to dry. Their inevitable troubles would have a big knock on effect to the rest of the economy.

Scrapping inheritance tax altogether would leave a massive hole in the budget, and would unfairly prioritise wealthy families. Inheritance tax is designed to encourage social mobility by limiting dynasty formation, and seems to be doing a pretty decent job to me.

Their EU policies are perhaps expected but seem wildly naive. Trawling through thousands of legal decisions to rehash them for ideological point scoring is an insane waste of money, and the idea we'll come out well from a bespoke trade agreement with the EU is laughable - they just have more leverage than we do.

The free school programme has been an unmitigated disaster - the overwhelming majority of these new schools have not filled places, and a big chunk have ended up with a huge number of spare places. When state schools are massively over subscribed it seems nonsensical to soldier on regardless and keep diverting funds in this way.

Though I so approve of many of the military changes (as to uphold the social contract IMO) offering guaranteed jobs in the prison service and the police force to veterans is a catastrophic idea. Law enforcement officers and military personnel have a distinct approach, remit and set of responsibilities and assuming they can crossover so easily is badly judged. There is a reason why these services are civilian.

The national service medal is just a pathetic waste of time and money.



I honestly don't have the energy to keep working through all these, and I could say a lot more. I will say that there is good stuff in here - their NHS policies, for example, are remarkably solid.

I think it's a combination of a few things — I think we get more people forward now than we did in the past, making it easier to have possession in the opponent's half, easier to pressure them into making poor decisions. We're the aggressors now, which I like.

I think another part of it is we have players that don't value possession as much — it's more of a risk/ reward. Montero, for example, is great with the ball, but he gives it up quite a bit trying to get around a defender or get to the touchline first. Shelvey is in the same boat — he goes for the cross-field pass more than anyone, and when it hits, it's a huge relief for our defense and can cause problems, but it can also result in the ball going to the other team.

I think it's a tradeoff, and I'm OK with where we are. I liked having 60% possession every game, but I also like the way we create chances. I think we're more exiting now as a team, albeit more careless with the ball.

Most of the old show was quirky, with some good writing, and it fell onto continuity when it ran dry of creativity, which gave the show after several doctors, a sort of grand purpose.  The new show seems more inclined to finish a storyline and leave it behind than the old show.

Everything in the new show moves very fast, including the Doctor.  In the old show, the Doctor was the calm voice of reason, he was the scientist, the knowledge and the wisdom.  In the new show, the doctor has almost given up explanation, and simply runs around knowing everything at the perfect time.  It fits with the old doctor (as he did the same thing, but more *time* was involved in the story telling), but it doesn't have the old school boring scenes to really make the exciting ones pop.  It's just a different beast, really.

The old doctor used a lot of 'common sense' and demystification of strange things, and i feel that the new doctors also do this, but not as succinctly.  

I like the new stuff, cause without it we would only have the old, and more is always better.  I like the shadow of the ""time war"", as in the old days we had Gallifrey and Rasillon, and all that lore, but it was usually dribbled out in reveals anyways, and if they want to touch on that later, they always can.  The Master has made an appearance, as well as familiar monsters, and they are just as silly now as then.

The special effects are interesting, and seem costly, but at other times silly again, and that makes it fun.  I definitely like the excitement of the show, the upbeat tempo, but at times it feels forced.  All the 'exact moment' type resolutions have a contrived feel, like we are watching a parody of what the doctor really is.  

I must say, i have seen just about every Doctor Who episode in existence (and even Shada, the one Tom Baker talks you through) and the sheer hours of reel footage of Pertwee engaging aliens with UNIT, or chasing someone (think James Bond Doctor, even had a bright yellow car).  Patrick Troughton was a very random doctor and at times was outright off script, and seemed almost crazy.  As for the first doc, wow what a strange and almost wizardly guy.  There was just soooo much more footage of these guys walking around and talking and being quirky, it is what the new series lacks.  Not that that is necessarily a bad thing.

I've been following the swans since the season we got promoted from League 2, 
the year we moved to the UK from the US. I know who we are, and where we're from, 
and the only thing I'm concerned with is that magic 40 points. Once we've hit that number, 
then I can think about looking higher without feeling like I'm kidding myself.

**My thoughts on signings;**


Gylfi; I would have his children quite honestly.
THAT'S Why mums go to Iceland.
 I loved Johnny De Guzman, (I even got his autograph the day after the League cup win, 
saw him in a service station on the M4 in a burger king) and it was interesting to see how
 important he was to the way we played, but Gylfi has come back a better player. Would I take JDG back?
 Yes. Would I take him over Gylfi? Nope.


Montero; the stuff of full back's nightmares. *Sometimes* runs himself in to blind alleys,
 but for the return rate, and scare factor, I'm happy to deal with that.

Fabianski; last night was a game of freak circumstances, so apart from that fiasco, 
he's pretty much the best goal keeper we've ever had.


Gomis; I'm sure most of you have seen me bashing him, 
but when he came on last night and actually tried, he made a good name for himself,
 we saw that fancy footwork that made him seem like a potentially awesome signing at first, 
and I felt bad when that severe curler didn't find the top right hand corner. 
So, still a little disappointed with him, but new life in my opinion of him yet. 
Maybe he's had a proverbial yank on his dreads with Nelson Oliveira coming in?


Barrow; Why aren't we playing him more !?!?!? 
Yes when he comes up against a full back thats had 50+ caps for
 their country he struggles a bit, but its only by playing against those sort
 of players that he will learn how to get round them. Fantastic potential.
 Makes Montero look like Mertesacker. 
(Surreal thought; he has legs like Spaghetti, and when they flail around, he looks
 like the Tasmanian devil from the looney toons.)

Could consider Ki coming back as a sort of signing, more a player coming in, 
and taking &lt;- that with a grain of salt I will; Arguably our best player,
 he's cool calm and collected in midfield, always picks a pass that is both safe, 
and forwards. Quietly skilful, and very level headed. I'm as worried, 
if not more worried about losing him to the Asian cup as I am Bony the African cup of nations. 

Carrol; I cant be the only person that's accidentally called him Joey Allen right? 
They even run the same... anyway. What a great piece of potential, actually better than 
Joe Allen now that I think about it, I reckon we're keeping him quiet until after January,
 so that Tottenham don't recall him or ask for 8 million, you know?


 
**This January:**

FullbacksFullbacksFullbacksFullbacksFullbacksFullbacks.
Possibly another CDM to account for the loss of Ki.
 

I like the look of Nelson, and Bafé has actually started giving a shit, 
so we're *hopefully* ok in the Forward camp.

And maybe another winger? Wayne and Nate seem to have lost some self confidence
 or something, and with Montero out for the whole of January, I see them getting fatigued. I mean Nate used to go around players for fun, but now just cant seem to manage it. 


(Surreal thought; We should give a Nobel prize in physics to Wayne Routledge for breaking 
them by putting in crosses at the bi-line with the outside of his foot, seriously, how the fuck?)



**Overall:** this season has been a combination of us looking our best, our worst,
 weird-ass circumstance, and horrific refereeing (That one goes for the whole prem honestly, us in particular however).

Actually despite the popular perception, due to a veritable shit ton of cold war propaganda, all of these countries were (and some still are) state capitalist. 

&gt;Help me out.

Well first of all, the entire planet and every human on it lived in primitive communist societies for hundreds of thousands of years. In the modern era we've had, The Paris Commune, Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution, the Ukrainian Free Territories, the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in Mexico and Rojava in Kurdistan. 

There are also plenty of successful worker owned co-operatives, that are the building blocks of socialism. Perhaps the single best example is Mondragon Corporation. It was founded in 1956 operating as a federation of worker owned cooperatives. It's now the 10th largest company in Spain in terms of asset turnover and it has over 74,000 employees/owners.

Now help me out, are there any successful capitalist economies?

 1% of the world's population now own 48% of the wealth, thousands starve to death every year despite the fact that we have more than enough food to feed the entire world's population. The West is continuing its program of capitalist imperialism that's destroying the third world, while the white power structure continues to murder hundreds of young black men. 

Socialism is by no means perfect, but it would be taking a very narrow view of history and human capability to decide that workers are utterly incapable of managing their own lives and workplaces.

 [**Drag hunting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag%20hunting): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Drag hunting__ (also spelled __draghunting__) is a form of hunting with hounds, and dates to the early 19th century. A pack of [hounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog) (usually [foxhounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxhound) or [beagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle)) hunt a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of [aniseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniseed) oils and possibly animal meats or urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or more miles.

&gt;Drag hunting emphasises the thrill of riding at speed in a natural environment, and tends to follow a relatively straightforward course, allowing for considerable speed, over well-marked obstacles designed or selected with the safety of horse and rider in mind.

&gt;A hunt is divided into ""legs"". Each leg is ""scented"" just prior to the huntsman casting the hounds, who find the scent and hunt it. At the end of a leg, the hounds are held in check whilst the next leg is scented. Some hunts have human runners carry the scent, some use a quad and drag a scented rag tied to a rope and some apply the scent to the hooves of a lead horse who will go on ahead.

It'll get easier soon when more of the tournaments and such start popping up but IHL is a great way to get involved anyway.

The coaching stuff is generally offered out whenever teams pop up and start being active in the UK scene, a lot of us are very busy and whilst we do want to help we want to make sure that the help we're giving is going to actually help the scene that's given us quite a lot. That doesn't meant to say the people we haven't directly offered it to aren't worth it or something like that, just it's very difficult to sort through the people who want coaching for limited time. Like I said, much easier when the new tournaments start popping up which will be sometime in the new year.

The thread the other day was a bit weird, if you look at the thread most of the drama is literally coming from a dynamic between a couple of people and Dai which stems from a personal relationship they have to the best of my knowledge, nothing to do with the overall scene.

The shitposting thing I agree with but I'm in a bind with what to do about it, I'm inclined to just hope it gets better with certain initiatives amongst the regulars but the banter is also something that makes us really fucking funny.

&gt; The first day of the week varies all over the world. In most cultures, Sunday is regarded as the first day of the week although many observe Monday as the first day of the week. According to the Bible, the Sabbath or Saturday is the last day of the week which marks Sunday as the first day of the week for many Jewish and Christian faiths, while many countries regard Monday as the first day of the week.

&gt;According to the international standard ISO 8601, Monday is the first day of the week ending with Sunday as the seventh day of the week. *Although this is the international standard, countries such as the United States still have their calendars refer to Sunday as the start of the seven-day week.*

The biggest problem Allen has had this season is that he has often been played with other CMs and not enough flair players so he has to do a role he isn't entirely comfortable with. 

Joe Allens strengths are- His passing is accurate and he often makes the right pass, he is calm in possession, he always makes himself available for the pass, his energy is fantastic and he works hard for the team, he is one of our best players under pressure with the ball, he is good at winning the ball back, he knows how to stop opposing runners from the other team, he can dictate the tempo of a game- which he does more for Wales than Liverpool, he helps both the attack and defence, and his biggest quality is his positioning and tactical awareness. He has world class positioning and it is by far his biggest asset, his football intelligence is magnificent.

However I would say he has a few weaknesses, which stop him becoming a top player. He is too injury prone, his finishing is terrible, and he lacks a final ball. 

Edit: Maybe it can be best summed up by saying, he isn't going to win us games, but him playing makes it easier for other players to win us games. ",0,1419953681,null,0,1419954740,0,cn9cr08,t3_2qtd07,t1_cn9cr08,t1_cn9cbyy,null,1425148859,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22

He had one of his best games yesterday, he set up Moreno and played in a wonderful pass to Sterling and he played a couple of Gerrard-esqe cross field balls. His corners were pretty well taken as well. I think once he works on his shooting, he will elevate his game even further.

I feel if we'd rested Gerrard against Burnley and started him last night in place of Lucas, although there'd have been slightly worse balance between the two, it's something that Gerrard still makes up for because his passing is still on another level to our other midfielders and everybody around him would have looked better as a result.

i think it has been a tough year for rodgers and as you said 3 major changes have started to become apparent. gerrard is a once a week type of player now, but in my opinion is still class. he needs a giggs/scholes role with the team built to maximise his strengths but limit his weaknesses. if we can go unbeaten against the current bottom 12 teams (swansea-burnely, i have accounted for 3 draws in this scenari) for the second half of the season, that will give us approximately 58 pts, and if we nick games against tottenham, mufc, southampton and westham, that'll put us on 70 pts which i think could be good enough to get us into top 4. really, for me, the best would be if we could go on a 19 match winning streak, but that's unrealistic. 

to sum all of my blithering ranting up:
- i think BR has proven he is the right man for the job
- i think gerrard has proven he is still a classy player, but needs his role diminished some
- i think our youth is starting to develop into legitimate senior players (sterling, marko, coutinho, spaniards, can, hendo even) have all started stepping up. 
- lallana is worth the 25m we paid for him, he has been fantastic lately
- mignolet is our 1st choice keeper until the summer. i'll admit, albeit im a fan of his, he has been shaky but he will get the rest of the season to prove his worth

So broad is the subject, that even the major has stepped into a private dispute and gotten involved in the process.

But yeah, one Russell Brand photo op in late December, and the whole thing folds... nothing to do with the lengthy legal dispute that pre-dates it.

Also, Sakho, Can, and Henderson all showed yesterday, at least, that they're capable of getting the ball forward, which again lessens the need for a deep lying play maker.

Additionally, playing Gerrard deep wastes both Lucas and Henderson. Lucas is pretty much only good at DM and with Gerrard being as static as he is, they both ended up playing the same position, which weakened our attack up front since we had two midfielders sitting back.

I have hope in Balo, I honestly think he's looked good almost every game he's played he just keeps narrowly missing his chances. 

I don't think Mignolet is that bad. This is probably my worst opinion haha (especially with how bad he started getting his past 5-8 games) but still i stand by the guy and I think as much as I love Jones he shouldn't be ahead of Mignolet.

Markovic had a great game against Bournemouth but till that point and even now I think hes still unproven. Who knows how good he could be, but I think his skills have been exaggerated so far. He makes a lot of good runs into open space but then doesn't know what to do with the ball when he finally reaches the defender. He's very young and the more he plays the more optimistic I've been.

Joe Allen and Ricki Lambert shouldn't be starting for us. Again this appears irrelevant now since both appear to have lost their spots but this was probably my biggest aggravation all season. I like them as everyone does as people but I really think they are both flat-out mediocre on a team striving to be great. Even if Joe Allen is above avg, theres no room for him with all the talent we have now in midfield. 

Henderson also came off a great game so it feels wrong saying this but I think he's been disappearing from games recently, definitely had fallen off for a time from last season. I really think this swansea game was a turning point though not only for our team but hopefully players like Hendo who had been underperforming a little. 

Again its weird to say this now cause he just had a great game but almost this whole season I've been wondering how people love Can so much. not that i dislike him, I've just felt like he's barely played (not his fault) and so I've had no idea how people had formed such strong opinions about his ability (people also would do things like include him in there mock starting XI and not Coutinho) 

Maybe not a controversial opinion but I pretty much consider Coutinho a god and found it so aggravating when he had 1-2 bad games and seemed like he was losing his spot on the starting XI.

Statistically teams finish largely according to how much their wage budget is (a good indicator of their squad quality). There's exceptions, last year being one of them, but regardless of the manager you're going to find us finishing 5th in the league as an average. That is all things considered where our status as a club at this moment in time is where we *should* finish. We'll have seasons like the last one where we exceed expectations, through the fruits of good acquisition and management, and through other teams underperforming (United), but it's incredibly difficult for us to consistently break past 4 teams who are better equipped than us.

To me these are facts that can only be undermined even through an incredibly lucky managerial appointment, essentially hiring an uber-Klopp who not only can get us up there but can keep us there for a period of time. Or we try to foster a stability that the teams above us won't have, because Van Gaal, Wenger and Pelligrini are all old, and Mourinho's future is always up in the air.

This was the argument in 2014 and it didn't happen (also known as the 'surge').

This kind of 'policy' is what is most terrifying about UKIP. It means nothing except slashing away at regulations that have ALWAYS been put in place for a reason. It isn't as simple as just 'slashing regulations'. WHICH regulations? What are the effects going to be?

Do we mean health and safety regulations so that employees are exposed to much greater risks at work?

Do we mean product quality regulations meaning that we can't export anything to the EU (assuming we've left it) and that more of our products become dangerous or faulty?

Do we mean regulations on salary and bonus limits so that bankers can pay enormous bonuses using your money while losing stacks of money? (Hint: yes UKIP do mean this). Or so that workers can be paid £2 an hour?

Do we mean regulations and taxes on offshore tax havens so that companies can avoid paying any tax at all in the UK? (Most likely).

It's not airborne but its still highly contagious spreading through bodily fluids which Ebola victims are releasing through sweat, sneezing and vomiting profusely.

Credit to her for seeking medical help ASAP when severely symptomatic but now many of her fellow passengers are going to be confined in quarantine for what may well be a common cold until they are tested. This is going to cost millions and is only a single case &amp; it could all be avoided if such transit was unavailable or special regulations were enforced.

I hope the airline gets to pick up the bill instead of Joe blogs tax payer in the UK. I mean I'd go through more checks flying from Columbia than Africa, coke is worse for the UK than rampant Ebola apparently.

&lt;edit&gt;

Apparently the airline was informed that she was feverish &amp; had been treating Ebola victims but did not even care. Seriously fine them a massive amount &amp; make them liable for any further infection of their passengers &amp; crew covering any loss of work because of confinement it's only way the industry is going to react.",0,1419960489,null,0,1420035095,0,cn9ga0c,t3_2qqes4,t1_cn9ga0c,t1_cn8iuc0,null,1425147213,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

* No clear overall majority. Labour and Tories both stuck on around 33%. Labour won't form a coalition with the SNP (Haha!) and the Lib Dems aren't large enough to give the Tories a majority. Incumbent Conservative-lib dem coalition is made caretaker government for the next 6 months and a second election is held (much like in 1974)

**UK Interest rate rise?**

* Probably only to 1%, in 0.25% increments starting AFTER the general election next year. Unfortunately. 

**London property prices**

* UK property prices continue to rise at an above inflation rate of 5-7%. The upward factors on prices (immigration/population increase, lack of supply and high demand) will not be addressed in the next 12 months. Perhaps the following year (2016) prices will start to line up with inflation as interest rates rise and new builds start to come on tap (which will constrain price growth). 

**Oil prices?**

* I expect to see a drawn out oil price war between the Middle East and Shale Gas producers. Russia will remain stuck in the middle. Prices to hover around $55-75 a barrel. I expect to see continued instability in Iraq and Syria which will push prices higher than OPECs intention. I doubt much of the wholesale saving will reach British consumers. 

**Eurozone deflation continues?**

* Probably. 

**Alex Salmond to run for seat in 2015 general election**

* Runs for seat and wins by clear majority. However the whole idea stalls when none of the Westminster parties will get into bed with the SNP to form a coalition. Labour, freshly humiliated by a near wipe-out in Scotland will not want to cuddle up to the SNP... especially having had the benefit of seeing what a coalition did to the Lib Dems. 

**UKIP**

* The dark horse at the next election. They return about 10% of the vote and actually do win about 7-9 seats, mostly in SE England (double what's predicted)... However, despite outperforming expectations it still isn't enough to make them a major power-broker in the ensuing talks. None the less, it will make for an interesting subsequent election.

**Apple watch**

* Loved and worn by few.

I also think that Lucas' passing game is underrated. He doesn't play Hollywood balls, but he keeps the ball moving and finds people between the lines with fast, accurate passes. Surprisingly, or not as the case may be, he also has more forward passes per 90 min than Stevie.

Also, as Lucas benefits from playing next to Hendo, so does our vice-captain benefit from not having to just do the running for another player. He was pretty great last night playing in his proper position and having the freedom to attack.

This is not to say that Stevie doesn't still have his part to play, but his game time must be managed better.

It's particularly a problem for Henderson. Henderson quite clearly has the ability to be an attacking threat (two nice assists from the right wing in his past 3 games) as well as a midfield workhorse but Gerrard occupying a position in midfield and the dynamics with him on the field restrict that.

Online banking isn't foolproof either, it's just that when someone gets access to your account, the bank can reverse the transactions or refund you. Votes have to be done once, and if someone gets your account there can't be a way of reversing it, unless you keep a list of names with their respective votes.

Learn frameworks and libraries of your chosen language(s). For example, if you use Java then make sure you know how to use Spring and Hibernate and can talk knowledgeably about them. Companies will love not having to train you on these fairly industry standard technologies.

I find it hard to even discuss football with people who don’t know the kind of things contained within this article. Do Spurs fans say “we’ll never win the league with this manager”? They could have Pep Guardiola and they still wouldn’t. Do Everton fans still think they stand a remote chance of what Howard Kendall gave them? They could have the ghost of Dixie Dean and they still wouldn’t. Do Aston Villa fans think it’s still 1981? I hate to keep beating this point into your skull, but it’s worth making it crystal clear. Until FFP really bites, and until Liverpool have a bigger stadium, then the money the club spends on transfers will never be enough. You cannot blame FSG for living within the club’s means, and even then, they are dangerously close to the 70% mark in terms of wages-to-turnover. Years of neglect, and falling behind rich oligarchs, has left the Reds stranded. When the Premier League began, Liverpool were the richest club. By 2005 they weren’t even half as rich as the richest club (based on squad costs). Now they have the 5th-most expensive squad.

About 10 years ago I built a bit a a [shoot lodge / summer house](http://i.imgur.com/R8G2E2b.jpg) at my uncle's place. He owns a sawmill so it was made mostly with offcuts &amp; scrap. The pool was donated by a friend of mine who couldn't fit it in her garden. Tent is mine and is about 100 years old.

We use the place for family BBQs, clay shoots, hosting parties &amp; stuff (it's got disco lights, pool table etc).

Last NYE we hosted a charity casino night with friends &amp; family. We made it free entry, free food, free booze. But we requested that everyone who comes kindly loses at least twenty quid at the tables. Any house takings that went beyond what we'd paid for booze, food, etc went to charity. Last year we raised just over £500. This year we're gonna try and do a bit more.

Works out far cheaper than any other option as two kegs of beer is ~£200. Fizz is from Aldi is ~£4.50 / bottle, food is ready-made party food from costco. Between 30-40 folks food &amp; booze costs are basically fuck all.

What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?

Kane - he did well last season and witht he continuing failures of Ade and Soldado he won the playing time out right. He just has a great eye for goal and is a very hard worker.

Eriksen - best outfield player we have, has saved us multiple times this season in Bale-esque fashion

Lloris - no keeper plays the way he does besides Neuer, has saved us multiple times

Davies - Davies has really impressed and moved ahead of Rose imo.

Mason - In a crowded midfield of internationals, Mason has really come into his own.

Bentaleb - showing the potential that Sherwood saw in him last season.

Dier - His form has dropped, but at the start of the season he came out of nowhere and played pretty well. Exciting future.

What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?

Soldado - no words can describe how bollocks Soldado is at this point. Yet sections of Spurs supporters keep sticking up for him for some reason. His time here is very reminiscent of Fernando Torres at Chelsea.

Adebayor - Usually I'm pro-Adebayor but this season he has been absent, from the apparent rift between Ade/Lennon/Kaboul and the young players, to the whole witchcraft incident, it seems like he's always going back to Africa for something, his head doesn't really seem in it.

Kaboul - Why the hell is he captain? He is well past it and is reportedly in a rift with the young players on the team. 

Chiriches - I rate Chiriches, but this season he was woeful in some matches. I still have faith in him though, maybe a move to rb will be good for him.

What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?

Keeper I guess

What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?

ST - besides Kane, Soldado is piss and Ade is absent most of the time.

What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
Soldado, Ade, and possibly one of the CMs

Where do you see Spurs finishing in the league this season? 5th or 6th IMO
How do you see Spurs progressing in the domestic cups this season? League Cup Final hopefully!

false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,"for me the only 3 names currently that absolutely, positively have to be on the team sheet are hendo, sterling and sahko. the rest will be rotated frequently and often like they should be. 

the reason these three should never be dropped is because they all have good stamina or play in positions (sahko) that don't wear you down as much. they all three add something in their respective third that no one else in the team can offer. sahko, physically the best defender we have, he is a proven leader and has shown since he came back into the side that we missed him sorely. he is showing why we paid 18m for him. hendo, well he's hendo. he runs his socks off and doesn't quit until the final whistle. but on top of that his defensive contribution is improving because he is getting smarter, and when you add that to his work rate, he becomes a force. he is absolutely, to me, the most vital cog in the team. there is not a single game throughout a season i think he should sit and that include cl, prem or later rounds of domestic cups. he's a freak physically, so he can handle that many matches. finally, sterling. i know he's young and we don't want to burn him out, but at the moment we can't afford to not play him. he has been our creator in chief, our best goal threat and has the work rate of hendo. i bet if you look at running stats, hendo would be #1, sterling #2 and lallana #3. sterling works his socks off and is durable, a la messi *knocks on wood*. once sturridge is healthy, he becomes more droppable simply because we'll have goals in the team and hopefully balo can feed off of that, but those are the 3 names this season that i think when healthy should never be dropped. 

coutinho is amazing and is our most creative player, but his only problem seems to be that he can't play too many matches in a row. quite frankly coutinho is probably gonna be our best european player because his style is suited to that of breaking down disciplined italian, german and french sides. his pressing side of his game has improved a lot and to say he's not a great prem option is short sighted, but right now he still has some deficiancies to his game. he's only 22, and he is showing his world class potential right now. scary to think that in 3 years time, he'll be 25, sterling 23 and sturridge 28, all hitting prime form.",0,1419967153,null,0,false,0,cn9k47a,t3_2qtriq,t1_cn9k47a,t3_2qtriq,null,1425145351,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Something wasn't done by central government (Stormont), let's blame council! Road lights dont work (Stormont), let's blame council! Town centre is a piece of crap during the day (Stormont), let's blame council! An historical item of the towns culture was sold (private owner), let's blame council!

That's Sterling, Sturridge, Lallana, Sakho, Hendo, and Lucas.

Sterling's young, so if we follow the conventional internet wisdom and the ceaselessly forwarded example of Owen, then he needs to be rested periodically, but never dropped. Sturridge may need to be rested to prevent injuries, but again, never dropped. Lallana has an incredible work rate in attack and recovery, is versatile, makes everyone around him better but also makes magic on his own, and is very consistent. I see no reason for him to ever be dropped from the side. Sakho, to me, is hands down our best CB. Kompany, Terry, and Fonte don't get dropped, we shouldn't be dropping our best defender unless there's a very, very good reason. Hendo is already treated as undroppable but I'd like to add that he should never be moved out of the middle of the pitch either to accommodate anyone currently in our squad. The DM-free experiment has failed, Lucas needs to be in the lineup for every important match.

Re: Coutinho. I don't trust Phil to be the same player regardless of formation or opponent because he's proven that he's not. Everyone's gone mental in their praise of him over the last few days - and fair enough, he's been exceptional - but before railing against the skeptics, please watch any of our earlier matches this season. He hasn't been great until recently and his form is heavily dependent upon who is played in front of him and behind him. Until he consistently offers [relatively] unwavering individual performances, he still seems to me to be an exceptionally talented, potentially devastating, yet not wholly reliable cog in this machine.

Lastly, I just wanted to note that this is the first time in 12 or 13 years that this question has been posed and Gerrard has been in 0% of answers (at least the ones that I've seen).

Your lack of university education might be an issue. One of the first questions you'll get asked is why you didn't attend university, so you need to have a better answer that the one in your OP. There are multiple reasons why having a degree (or working towards one, I hire placement students each year) is seen as attractive to people like me.

1. It shows that you can live independently, have moved away from home and are surviving in the world. You'd be surprised how many people I've come across who simply don't know how to cope with real life when things go wrong. It's astonishing.
2. Development, especially in larger teams, is about more than just cutting code. Be familiar with collaboration tools, repos, frameworks etc. These tend to be taught in university where I find people who haven't got a more formal qualification struggle with some of the ancillary aspects of the role.
3. I think the theory behind what you're doing is important. Anyone can go on SO and copy some code to get something working, but there are scenarios where that's not going to cut it. *Why* does that code work? What is reflection? What are the SOLID principles?
4. I've yet to meet someone who's not gone to university who's worked on a development project as part of a team. Everyone is doing some form of agile development these days (and if they're not, avoid like the plague) and agile is very focused on team work. You'd benefit from mentioning any experience you've got in these sorts of approaches. I've found that developers with solid technical skills are pretty common, but those who can work well in a team and speak to actual customers are few and far between. Just to underline that, we're a .net house but I don't look for .net experience in CVs at all as in junior roles it's not that important. Having a grasp of development fundamentals is far more important and our technical test (at interview) is geared to explore that aspect - it's pseudo code.

That's my personal take on it. You'll need to address those concerns in your CV somehow. 

Just something else to be aware of. When I've been recruiting junior developers I've done so through local universities and colleges, I've not advertised directly. I'm fortunate to have a good relationship with them (I sponsor events and provide some of my guys to give workshops) which means I can get access to the best developers coming through. You might be cutting yourself off from this market, and I know a number of other companies in the area do the same thing. If you're still in college, try contacting your student advice centre for advice in case there are opportunities.

Not as certain about more money being donated but isn't too fantastical to imagine happening. So they have more volunteers and money, does this mean they would 'win' the war? 

Your point about the British Army and Loyalists fighting the IRA to a stalemate doesn't hold much water. This is in the British Army's analysis of the conflict:

*""Martin van Creveld has said that the British Army is unique in Northern Ireland in its success against an irregular force. It should be recognised that the Army did not 'win' in any recognisable way; rather it achieved its desired end-state, which allowed a political process to be established without unacceptable levels of intimidation. Security force operations suppressed the level of violence to a level which the population could live with, and with which the RUC and later the PSNI could cope. The violence was reduced to an extent which made it clear to the PIRA that they would not win through violence.""*

The Army realised in the mid-70's a political solution had to be found and that they could never fully eradicate the IRA through force alone. They could have gone all out against the IRA, but decided not to. You can't critisise them for creating a stalemate when that's what they were trying to achieve the whole time. 

As for the Loyalists they never went all out either. IIRC the UVF said to an intermediary in 1994 they could do a Loughinisland everyday of the week if they wanted to. Loyalist atrocities during the Troubles were largely in response to republican actions. If they ever went on the offensive (as what would have happened during a civil war) that prerequisite would have been lifted. On top of that despite all the collusion the security forces still hampered Loyalist paramilitaries. Loyalist paramilitaries swelled with volunteers, many of whom in the UDR or RUC, going on an all out offensive without having to worry about checkpoints, arrests or their weapons being confiscated would have caused suffering on an unthinkable level. I don't think IRA could ever have been able to stop that completely.

Putting a ""punitive tax"" on rental income would have the effect of making rental properties much scarcer and rents much higher.

Even then I already ""knew"" that the islands are argentine and have been attacked by the British. But I am not entirely familiar with the history of the country and the military junta, especially since my parents have different views from other people. So here is what I think about the episode.

I've heard about the licence plates long before I saw the show and read the [producer's commentary](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/top-gear-argentina-bbc-refuses-to-apologise-for-jeremy-clarkson-number-plate-row-and-will-broadcast-episode-as-planned-9831274.html) At that point I was sure that the plates were an accident.

But I watched part two today and based on the commentary I am starting to believe that it was done on purpose; not for propaganda, but come on, it's Top Gear, they would do something like that. Perhaps it was similar to what happened with The Interview recently, many people say that it was cancelled just to increase demand. 

I am referring specifically to James saying ""I claim this land for Norfolk and name it Lotus Beach"" and Jeremy describing their arrival on the island as a ""beach assault"". Since it was all recorded while they were still in Argentina, they were definitely hinting at the Falkland wars.

But then his ""funniest"" bit is a lie - he did give the book away for free, retweeting torrent links, and giving out free links to Audible.com audiobooks of it. So that was bullshit.

Then the ""I don't have all the answers"" line. I've posted elsewhere in the thread, but if anyone can't understand how shit a criticism that is of someone, they need their head examined. It's absolute rubbish. Apparently none of us can complain about the economy, without getting economics degrees and proposing the solution.

Then he trots out the line that Brand should join the Greens. This is the point where I really started to get annoyed because they guy is purposely mis-interpreting Brands argument. He's repeatedly said he doesn't think any party represents people, or does anything for ordinary people - he wants to force political action through protest, like New Era Estate did. Calling up their MPs didn't work, they had to go out and protest and it eventually worked. It's a joke to ignore that whole side of his argument, but I guess it doesn't work in a song that is meant to be funny.

ORSON: Hello. 

DOCTOR: Ah, Clara! Well done, you found her. Now this is really a bit strange. 

CLARA: Danny? 

DOCTOR: What's gone wrong with your face? It's all eyes! Why are you all eyes? Get them under control. 

ORSON: Er, who's Danny? 

DOCTOR: This is Colonel Orson Pink, from about a hundred years in your future. 

CLARA: Orson Pink?
 
DOCTOR: Yeah, I laughed too. Sorry. Do you have any connection with him? 

CLARA: Connection? 

DOCTOR: Yes, maybe you're like a distant relative or something? 

CLARA: How, how would I know? 

DOCTOR: Right. Okay. (to Orson) Er, well, do you have any old family photographs of her? You know, probably quite old and really fat-looking?
 
ORSON: I don't. 

Note that Orson doesn't recognize Clara, and doesn't know who she's talking about when she says, ""Danny.""  He also does not have any old photographs of her or seem to feel any familial connection with her.  There is an exchange later where Orson asks Clara if he knows her, but it is clearly in response to the way Clara is looking at him as if she knows him, which is because he looks exactly like Danny.  It does seem like Clara is searching for a connection.

So, they were forced to walk instead of getting into helicopters. Problem was, it was awful weather and they were carrying 120lbs each. 50 miles, 120lbs and then you have to fight a multiple battles afterwards with little air support, in a mine field, while being outnumbered 2:1 and only rations for 2 days. Hell of a feet.


They were also supposed to get reinforced, but the reinforcement was delayed and by time the sun came up the argies destroyed the reinforcement ship, so no reinforcement. However only something like 27 died, the Argie general said 900 died, liar. 

Not only that, but 500 of them wen't East to Goose Green to recapture a settlement. When they arrived they realized there was way more Argies then they imagined (two times as many), so they had to hold out and try and pin them down.

Have Richard Stallmans books have managed to reach a massive audience through this method of distribution? Did it ever occur to you that Russell Brands goal was to get the message to as many people as possible?

I think it's worth bearing in mind 3 things in this discussion:

- He chose to publish it with a large publisher to reach a large audience, and use that publishers corporate machine to spread an anti-corporate message.

- He has put all of his fees received towards good causes, including New Era estate campaign and several drug recovery programs he is involved in.

- He told his followers on twitter to buy the book if they wanted some of it to go towards his causes, otherwise pick it up for free through legal or illegal means.

Now imagine if that same scientist took that criticism of big pharma, and said ""well clearly chemical science has failed us"" and so starts aggressively pushing for an immediate adoption of homeopathy. Or nanotechnology, or biotechnology.

And as he is shouting about how we should all be using homeopathy or nanobots, someone questioned on how these might work, he retreated behind ""I don't have all the answers"".

Well its fine to criticise, it is fine to even suggest an alternative, but if you are going to push that alternative as right, as something that should be adopted, you need all of the answers. Or at least, enough of the answers to not have to retreat behind ""I don't have all the answers. 


In academia, this occurs all the time. You can criticise someone's work and say that it is wrong, say that it is full of mistakes. Called being peer reviewed. In fact, that is a core principle of academia. That is perfectly fine. 

You can't however suggest something else without being subjected to the same scrutiny. And if you don't have the answers, you aren't going to win, so it's time to go back and do some more reading.

The points you have stated are all the typical barriers, barriers which I am attempting now to address. Things like agile would be addressed in a university or college situation, or things like teamwork would be solved within a working environment, which I would need to start from the bottom and accrue as much experience as possible. Teamwork is a skill that isn't taught well in an academic environment (as one of my careers advisors told me - its too early for me to truly say whether that is right or not). Obviously by not going to university, things like independence and the advanced level of education I would not have.

I undertook A-Level Computing/Computer Science for the last 2 years, which would require you to know the theory behind programming, the first year of work requiring you to know the theory and break down a pre-written software package and add addition features and bug fixing, and coursework in the second year which was basically a demonstration of the systems development life-cycle. Here I had to demonstrate that I know how to program by writing a whole software package from analysis and design (pseudo code for the main parts) right up to maintenance (written in the language chosen which was Visual Basic) and evaluating, commenting each line of code stating what it does, and picking out the more advanced parts breaking them down and discussing what each part does (I also covered Agile in the analysis). The much more advanced code (for me at the time) I taught myself, and I still use it in projects I am writing today. I achieved 73/75, and although this isn't a degree or a university education, I do have some programming knowledge.

I actually tend to avoid copying and pasting huge amounts of code because it feels 'dirty'. The theory and syntax is like the English language, and your code is your handwriting, the English (who speaks or writes it) generally applies to everyone, but everybody uses a different style of handwriting (a basic way my old IT teacher put it). Using other peoples code would make no sense to me when I come back to it, If I do have to copy and paste I find ways to alter the code and that way gives me a basic understanding while I am altering it, so it sort of becomes my own code in a way.

Unfortunately, I have now left college, which I felt under provided for the students who do not wish to go to university (but it is a bit rich to ask for when 90% of its students are going to university). Either way thanks for what you have had to say, it has provided a lot of food for thought! :)
