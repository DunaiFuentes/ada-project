Isn't there a presumption that if you sign a contract that you are deemed to have read the terms within? Although this is a presumption, I imagine it would be difficult to disprove. 

I don't think we can compare this to a situation where a contract is signed and the contract itself links to an external document containing the terms, which could not be read. If it was the same, I'd agree.

I don't feel Chadli fully does that... he starts slightly in front of the backs, and then makes runs forward into space when our other attackers (Eriksen, Lamela mostly) are on the ball and getting defenders' attention.

They're sort of similar, but Pedro has never been the prime goalscorer for Barca, whereas Chadli is dominating our scorers list from open play.

EDIT: I find Chadli to be more like Dempsey... moderately talented, not really a midfield creator, but has a knack for popping up and scoring goals regularly.

false,publique,present,,"I see what you're saying. At face value, that's seemingly true. But in marketing...it's very healthy to have yourself associated with big brands / partners.

Think of brands and partnerships as a word association game. When you think XYZ club / brand, you think of this. It's mind share. So whilst they pay us...there are also passive benefits that don't immediately result in a dollar value.

It's also why some companies, no matter how much money is offered...simply won't accept a partnership or sponsorship. They don't want to be associated with a certain sponsor. As for Turkish Airlines, this isn't the case. 

Chelsea is a club, sure, I support and love them like everyone else here. But from a business standpoint, it's a brand. Prestige is a very real and important thing. If you got an offer from a local coffee shop, for 40 million dollars (humour me), and Microsoft, for 35 million dollars. 9/10 Major businesses would go with Microsoft. One of the worlds biggest software and electronics companies.

This is just a basic generalisation. Naturally, if the coffee shop offers 3-4 times that of Microsoft, you'd take it. I imagine that's what happening here. My initial comment of ""what a shit sponsor"" was just a quick, off the cuff juvenile response that didn't go into detail as to why I felt that way. 

At the end of the day, I couldn't care less who the actual sponsors are, as there are brilliant minds working behind the scenes to evaluate and make these decisions. So the point is...sponsorships aren't a one way street, even if the money is only going one way.

false,transitiverelation,Altrincham,Altrincham,"For the many clubs in the conference now who weren't around, I'd like to share some history.

Several years ago Altrincham signed James Robinson from Accrington. It emerged at the end of the season, he hadn't obtained proper international clearance (he was English, but he'd had a spell abroad and so you need to fill in the appropriate forms).

Normally, Accrington, as his first club in England would have done this, but overlooked it. The FA decided that Altrincham were not going to be deducted points, as it would normally be within Accrington's remit.

Colin Peake, Forest Green Board member, said publicly he had no wish to see Altrincham deducted points. Simultaneously, he sent an email to all the chairmen of the Conference that said (amongst other things):

&gt; The [James Robinson] matter raises serious issues for the game as a whole.

and one to the Conference operations director saying:

&gt; As a member we trust that the strongest approach has been taken to ensure the rules are upheld.

This caused Altrincham to be deducted the 18 points for the games in which he played and subsequently be relegated (they were reprieved from this after other clubs went bankrupt and could no longer play).

If you want to say that Altrincham shouldn't overlook things like that and rules are rules then fair enough, but when Forest Green have said one thing publicly and done another behind closed doors, and now they're complaining when they don't manage some **much** more routine bureaucracy and get punished, this stinks of hypocrisy of the highest order.",0,1411957012,null,0,false,0,ckv8f42,t3_2hjv92,t1_ckv8f42,t1_ckty43p,null,1426775531,5,false,conferencefootball,t5_2xoai,5

The Eu. The Eu would just strong army our country like it always does into not offering a referendum and refusing to let Hong Kong join. The last thing Germany wants is us expanding and developing trade outside of Europe, that weakens an already collapsing union. Plus the Eu doesn't want us expanding our commonwealth, the commonwealth is already 5x has big in terms of population, 7x as big in terms of land mass and in 5 years it will be the worlds wealthiest union and currently 5 other countries are trying to join, Eu just doesn't want that, it's too large competition. Have you ever watched the European parliament? Lot's of countries want a referendum on their membership, but is this brought up in serious discussion in the parliament? Nope.

Plus, China can do anything and we won't intervene and neither would the USA, China has got the USA by the balls with trade and the Eu has no interest into getting into a confrontation with China while we're already getting a bit hot with the Russians.

Its an old style very drowsy antihistamine, available in either two-a-night 25mg or one a night 50mg, its often used by people trying to correct their body clock, HOWEVER. Tolerance builds quickly and it does produce some side effects due to its anti-cholinergic nature aka dry mouth, balance may be slightly off and an unusual heavyness to your body, really isnt too bad but might be odd to someone who's never experienced it before. Doses around or above 50mg may produce slight visual hallucinations in the dark and as with all hypnotics, dont drive for at least a good few hours after waking up, fatigue the day after is a problem with these drugs and it will affect your attention/ reaction time. Hope you find something that works for you!

This causes the oppositions midfield to not overly commit because they're conscious that Lambert a couple seconds of hold up play, and then a flick, and theres a strong counter attack on. If the oppositions midfield don't overly commit, our midfielders don't get dragged back, and our CBs don't get pushed back into the box, and we're not sitting too deep.

Clara and The Doctor have a complicated relationship. Clara ""fancied"" The Doctor's former incarnation and it would be a lie to say he didn't ""fancy"" her in return. Some of his feelings are probably retained, while hers have evolved to a more platonic relationship. She still loves The Doctor, but more in the way that she feels that she needs to play his conscience because she's afraid of how he'd behave without someone to keep him grounded (remember how inflated the 10th Doctor got at the end of Waters of Mars).

While it's somewhat frustrating, I'm enjoying the way that the main story arc is playing out this season.   Going to make for a very interesting finale.

false,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"""Racist""? How did you get ""racist""? Danny was mocking the Doctor because despite his openly disdainful attitude towards soldiers, he thought he was acting like one himself. Danny even says something to the effect of ""I've served under men like you."" The jibe about the name of his species being ""Time Lord"" was about him acting like a superior officer, ordering people around and putting them in harm's way. Danny knew the soldier comparison would push the Doctor's buttons because of his very vocal dislike of the profession.

&gt;He's just met a 2000 year old alien and 'he knows men like him'? could you be more arrogant and judgmental?

Did you miss the entire rest of the episode where the Doctor was putting him down for being a soldier? The first time we see them talking to each other, the Doctor says that there's no way he's smart enough to be a math teacher because of his military background. And to his credit, Danny was admirably professional about it while he thought the Doctor was just a loony groundskeeper.

&gt;Also, he's going to help Clara? Clara doesn't need anyone's help, let alone his. She's already put her life on the line for so many people so many times, has literally sacrificed her life for the doctor but if Dan-the-soldier-man will step in if the doctor asks too much of her?

He sees something we don't as the audience (who are trained to like the Doctor/Companion dynamic). From what we've seen of him it can be inferred that he left the military with emotional baggage, and from his diatribe against the Doctor in this episode it seems to have been because he was pushed too far under orders and did something he regretted later. He sees the Doctor order around Clara and it reminds him of that, and offered his support if it ever got to a point where she thought it was ""too far"".

To get what I mean lets get some context and look at the previous season. Season 5 was about Amy growing up and settling down and Rory standing up for himself and the girl he loved.

Amy had major abandonment issues because he parents were erased from time and then the Doctor left her for years. But in what may have been the most meaningful part of the finale, Amy suddenly had her parents come back. For humans this would be a big deal but did this change her life in anyway that we saw on screen? Nope. Did we ever even see her parents again? No. Did she even bloody mention them? Nope. She has lost an entire childhood with them and somehow she just ignores this? 

Next, in the mid season finale (before it went off for the summer) Amy discovered that she couldn't have another child, her child was stolen, her baby melted in her arms while she was screaming, and her kid would grow up to be a woman who alternates between loving and trying to kill her best friend who she used to have a crush on and had/has abandonment issues towards. For human being this would be a pretty major deal! 

When the show came back after months, we got the insulting BS of Amy and Rory having a secret childhood friend who they never mentioned who also turned out to be their child and then after all of this.... nothing changed. All of this was barely mentioned again. Amy and Rory lost their child and the ability to have a biological child together but in the next episode they are are off fighting aliens in some kids bedroom and they don't even mention it for the rest of the season. The Doctor failed, they lost their kid and it would never have happened if they hadn't been traveling with him. Do they ever talk about what they have gone through? Of course not! 

Heck, after Rory actually started standing up for himself the writers really ran out of ideas for what he was there for. He mostly just stands around looking confused, gets ""killed"" to mess with Amy or reverts back on his arc to being whiney.

To be frank it is bollocks that everyone who goes there is posh or monied.  I grew up with no car, no phone, no washing machine, no holidays - all my families money went on my schooling.  That in itself was a huge pressure as the school was a nightmare.  Regular summary beatings with no oversight, sport and lessons 6 days a week, 3 hours of home work every night and lots and lots of bullying!! It was fucking tough and anxiety ridden but it taught you to survive and to be stoical. A lot of my mates who went there weren't rich or posh either - of course a lot did have a load of cash but not everyone.

The difference that 30 odd years make is astounding.  Now it is all completely different.  No more banging heads together (literally) - it's all about producing a rounded person.  Education/exams are a major part but it is more about giving them life skills and my god the extra curricular activities!!  Drama, music, sport, DoE, volunteering, field trips...  Plus all the clubs and extra classes from C programming to a trebuchet club to a humanist society.  The kids at my school are not posh but 90% do have money - mostly new money.  Lots of musicians, media types etc.

However the inflation in fees has far outstripped the ability of the less well off to pay for a private education.  When I left (1981) fees were about 1200 a year, now they are over 16,000 a year.  There has been a rise in bursaries but not enough to compensate.  A mate of mine had a kid who goes to a top London boys school and they have no money (he is a social worker!) at all - just a very bright kid so they get a full bursary.

I have mixed feelings about them but I am glad I went despite all the nights of worry an tears.

**50th spoilers below** 

the war doctor was about to blow up Gallifrey, when the two future versions of himself showed up, to tell him that he wouldn't have to do it alone.

That's when Clara stopped them. She said that she couldn't imagine 11s face being willing to carry out such a task.

So 11 changed his mind. And all 3 Doctors were struck with the thought of using Zygon technology to seal Gallifrey in a pocket universe. the calculations would take centuries, so they enlisted all other versions of the doctor.

Just as the Daleks we're about to make their main assault on the planet, 13 Tardises circled Gallifrey and made it vanish, and the Daleks shot each other in the crossfire, creating a huge explosion.

At the very end of the episode, it is explained that 10 and War Doctor (so also 9) would have no memory of these events. They only remember the intent to destroy Gallifrey, and the fact that there is no Gallifrey, Time Lords, or Daleks left.

The Doctor has been operating in the meantime on the assumption that he was responsible for destroying Gallifrey, the Time Lords, and the Daleks, when he actually saved Gallifrey and the Daleks destroyed themselves.

Your name is not checked.

Call your bank and ask if the number you gave is a valid account number.

If it isn't then the EA won't have actually sent any money.

If it is, you will need to get the estate agents to chase this up, you won't be able to get anything from your bank as it'll require the person who sent the money to talk to their bank. Be prepared to pay admin fees for this, it might be a lot of hassle for them.

For the future:

* Check your bank details, it's extremely important. 
* Put end dates on your standing orders

Also:

* Check any common sources of info, stuff on the sidebar
* Google for answers, the links I gave where the top results when searching for ""money sent to wrong account""
* Talk to your bank

I can't stress that last one enough, your bank is generally one of the only few people that can actually do something when it comes to money issues, and they've usually got the knowledge to help or at least access to loads of information that we don't (all your confidential stuff).

How The Doctor and Clara travelled to the barn, if it's sealed in a pocket universe?  I have no fucking idea, we've never been immune to continuity problems.

The Tardis is pretty powerful though.  Perhaps Gallifrey is still mostly ""stuck"" but the ""crack"" allowed the Tardis to zone in on The young Doctor when Clara put her hands in the goo.

Perhaps timey wimey allows parts of Gallifrey History to exist outside of the Pocket Universe's ""lock"" while the present (and future?) to be sealed within.

Last season, the press, and other fans couldn't stop praising us for our performances as a team and individuals, to the point where it was a circlejerk. That was fair.

Now, the negative media attention (or lack of positive). You know what's more attractive to journalist than a medium sized club threatening the top 7? Watching it go into meltdown. Plain and simple, the papers are getting the most sensational stories to sell papers. It's not fair, but after Cortese left they were only going to report it one way. But you know what?

Unfortunately this doesn't apply to your partner or children.

If you want to move here with your family, you must prove that you are able to support them whilst you are looking for work. This is normally assessed by checking if you have £16,000 pounds or more in liquid assets (I.E. not tied up in a house or in bonds or shares etc), *and that you've had these savings for over six months*. This is what is required for a spousal visa, I'm not sure if/how it differs if you bring children into the equation.

As for your work, you absolutely could become a fire-fighter here, as long as you are willing to start from the bottom again and go through the academy (if you have to, I don't know if they will accept a transfer in), if/when places are available. It's very competitive to get into the academy, but as you have prior experience you might be a better candidate. Expect things to be different from the US though in terms of tactics and gear. Ask on /r/firefighting for more info - there are a few active UK firefighters there who can outline the differences better than me as a layperson.

In my opinion, if somebody needs 26k to get them back on their feet (or at least to prevent them from becoming a greater burden - hospital admission for a year costs a lot more than 26k), then they should get it.

The problem is twofold:

1 - It assumed 26k is sufficient for everybody. It might well be, if we're rounding up, but there will be the 0.01% that will need more for various reasons. I'm not suggesting it should be infinite, but at the same time it needs to be less an arbitrary number, because it happens to be the national average.

2 - The larger problem of government and council corruption, neglect, and ignorance that has let those that know the system abuse it for decades and not do a single thing about it. If we could claim to assess and grant 99% of all benefits claims and that they are justified, we wouldn't have such an uproar from the middle and upper classes.

That said, if you visit the States and decide to be pompous (I meet British people who act like this about tipping in the US all the time) about tipping you're a right cunt. As plain wrong as it is to pay servers $2.60 or whatever and ask them to make up the rest on tips, it means you're basically asking the service to pay for the right to wait on you if you don't tip. So just do it, and notice how every meal you pay for is much cheaper than in the UK. There's only been a handful of times I've stiffed a waiter on a tip, and it's been for truly rude service (if a waiter's taking forever to get you stuff, take a look around and see how many tables they're waiting on - I often find it's because the dining room is understaffed rather than them not giving an F).

This. Having worked in a restaurant, the shittiest job was to be stood at the back of the kitchen washing dishes. The waiting staff come in and dump mounds of dirty crockery on your workstation. You first have to remove as much food as you can manually, which means frantically scraping cheese out of lasagne dishes, rinsing and wiping gravy off everything etc. so you very quickly end up with leftovers all over your shirt and your hands are always covered in other people's half-eaten food. After that you need to load everything into the dishwasher, which is simple enough. Once its going though, you have 2-3 minutes to dry as many dishes as you can from the previous load, checking them all over for bits that have been missed. And when it comes to removing the load from the dishwasher, the plates have just been steamed, so it's between uncomfortable and painful unless you have asbestos fingers. Rinse and repeat (pun intended) for 5-6 hours.  It was ridiculously stressful and unenjoyable, a little extra at the end of the night brightened up your day a little.

They're quiet as the walk around Canterbury and are polite and respectful to other pedestrians. It's a breath of fresh air from the usual school kids that 'roam' the streets on school days.

Did you guess which thing was not like the others?
Did you guess which thing just doesn't belong?
If you guessed Rorey is not like the others,
Then you're absolutely...right!

Also, my Father teaches at a school thats about £30k a year to send your student to board there and i do have a lot of friends from various privates school just from other mutual friends. So whilst i didnt go to private i have a lot of experience with private schools and people who went to them. 

What you said about drugs and sex i suppose is true to a certain extent, a lot of my friends from private schools did start taking harder drugs (coke mainly) at a younger age but i suppose by the time we were all 17/18 my friends from state and my friends from private were all doing the same things. From what i can tell the bullying is worse, at the school i went to you may get the odd kicking for fucking someone off but at private schools its seems like a more of a sustained physiological war, almost in same way girls tended to bully each other. 

People say you're not ""paying for the education but the contacts"" i think is bull. You get a better education at private IMO because the kids who go to them tend to be better behaved. A kid from a wealthy background is going to be more likely to appreciate education as his parents are most likely somewhat intelligent as they have jobs that allow them to send their kid to a private school. Whilst at the school i went to whilst decent a lot of classes were disrupted by students who didnt give a fuck as their home lives were shit. You learn so much better or worse depending on the other students around you. 

I dont agree with the ""education shouldn't have a price tag"" argument. If i want to work fucking hard in my life like my parents did so i can give my child a better shot at being successful in life then i believe im entitled to do that.

So a street value of £7,500 indicates that there's 7500/12.5 grams of it, or about 600g of cannabis. There's 28g to the ounce, so that would be about 21 ounces. 

Good indoor grower can get 3 ounces per autoflowering plant, so the guy could have as few as 7 plants if all the information and maths is correct, as many as 12-15 if it's not so good a grow.

Main problems I'm seeing with the estimate is how did the police come to it? This isn't a jab at clueless police - how did they actually determine the weight of bud on those plants? The only way to know exactly how much bud you've gotten off a plant is to wait for the bud to grow to the maximum size, harvest all the bud off the plant, dry the bud over days or weeks (depending on your method) and *then* weigh it. There's far too much variation in plant size/leaf/stem amount and amount of bud produced to have any kind of reliable bud weight estimate from looking at the size of the plant alone.

I mean, I guess an experienced grower could eye it and get it roughly right, but the grower's hardly a reliable source there and I'm not sure how you'd gain the experience in guesstimating weight from plants that still have the bud on them if you never actually did the weighing, no matter how many plants you actually saw. Stretching my creduality to think of coppers poking around each plant individually - ""wow, look at the bud density on this one! Got to be at least 2 1/2 ounces, right?"" - to get an accurate estimate (and how would they know bud-on-plant to final-weight ratios in the first place?). Maybe that's fun for them? Seems like a torment. Anyway.

**tl;dr** like everyone else is saying, seems like around half a dozen to a dozen plants if that's the true street value, but I'm not seeing a mechanism for the police to be reliably estimating that.

source: smoke weed, try to keep my money out of the hands of paras/other gangs, so buy from people who grow like this/people who buy from people who grow like this etc. tbh, given the amount of information some home-growers will happily share with you because they find it such an interesting topic and figure yer grand to tell if you're actually buying/smoking it yourself (see above), I'm pretty surprised more of them don't get caught.

You've made the mistake many people have made that *guidelines* about visibility are not the same as *laws* and laws are the only thing that count.  That site you've linked to often comes up in discussions around speed cameras - unfortunately it makes the same mistake you have of confusing ""rules"" and ""laws"" and is a long way behind the current legislation (it uses info from 2001, well over a decade out of date!).

Have a read through the [Pepipoo forums](http://forums.pepipoo.com/index.php?showtopic=93405) for more info, but to summarise from a couple of recent posts there:

Back in the 1990s a percentage of the money generated from speed enforcement could be kept by the operators (i.e. Councils or Speed Camera Partnerships etc). The more detections that were made, the more money was generated, with no upper limit.

To add some perceived balance to this system of 'netting-off' (designed to placate the public), some rules were put in place that stipulated various things had to be conformed with, for example conspicuity distances. Put another way, cameras had to be plainly visible and warning signs had to be placed so as to leave no doubt what was looming.

[This was changed in 2007](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/2749315/Speed-camera-rules-change-as-quick-as-a-flash.html) and partnerships were stopped from creaming off a percentage of the fines collected. Instead only running costs were returned, but more operational flexibilty was allowed.

&gt; Speed, or ""safety"" cameras, as the Government calls them, **no longer have to be painted yellow, or be visible from 60m (200ft), and no longer have to be sited only where there is a history of road accidents. The regulations were relaxed in April after the Government had announced in December that camera partnerships would no longer be able to keep the money generated by speeding fines to pay for more cameras;** instead, they'll get grants from a yearly, central road-safety fund of £110million.

This meant there was no longer an incentive for the enforcement to be pro-active, so running costs pretty much balanced with 'income'. In many cases speed enforcement ran into the red, because constabularies put in an operating bill that was larger than what they generated in cash. So although some cameras were claimed by the media to 'rake in millions', which was quite true, when looked at nationally, enforcement was very expensive to run and those running costs effectively cancelled out what could be viewed as 'profit'.

It all changed *again* in 2011, when all government funding was stopped and every constabulary was forced to find a way to either fund speed enforcement themseves, cut back operations, or stop altogether (that's why there was a lot of [attention in the press](http://road.cc/content/news/34974-warwickshire-latest-council-cut-back-speed-camera-provision) for Councils switching off speed cameras).

This has meant that enforcement evolved into its current system of self-funding, mostly through a percentage of every speed awareness course fee being paid to the constabulary, whilst all fines (the vehicle was either too fast to qualify for a course, or the driver has already done one in the last three years), going direct to The Treasury/government.  That's why if you're only marginally over the enforcement speed (e.g. 36mph in a 30-zone) you'll be offered a SAC rather than a fixed-penalty).

If the plan isn't that at all and we just want him to play to his strengths alongside Sturridge, that's fine too, but we'll definitely need another striker ASAP, since we can't really play him by himself and get any sort of good team performance.

In terms of attitudes to sex, religion and science it might be true that Europe is closer to the UK, at least in metropolitan France, Germany and Scandinavia. Further east I doubt you'd find attitudes quite so pleasant, and southern Europe is in places furiously racist. Our view of Europe is probably skewed on that, given that English-speaking Europeans are better educated and more metropolitan than the average American, and those are the ones we hear from.

As I said above, I like America's aggressive liberalism, and find the soft liberalism that many of Europe's political classes peddle disappointing. There seems to me to be too many on the continent unwilling to defend free speech and free enterprise, while at the same time all too willing to excuse Muslim extremism. If that's what Europe's future looks like I don't wish to be a part of it.

The system is the way it is, because universities are research insitutions that have had school + tacked onto them.

And in those countries, outside of Germany, not  huge amount of write home about. Britian has had a serious lead in Europe for a while on this front. We run circles around France and Spain for example.

Problem is reserch is super expensive (essentially you pay people a fair bit in wages and other capital investment, for something that might net nothing - indeed rarely does it return any funds to the institution), and wild horses are pulling the system apart as churning out undergrads is also hugely expensive.

People like to run the narrative that the system is fine and the country is in moral error not throwing money at it, but its not. Fundamentally
 we can focus back on the reserch and maybe issue more than 3 funded M.sc's per course (god damn, is M.sc funding fucked atm). Or we can accept that undergrad classes of 400-700 or what we want and accept that we need to focus on university as school+ and scale back on research. 


Also don't expect it to be free in scotland much longer. The system was close to breaking point when I was in academia up there 3 years ago. Departments are so underfunded that huge amounts of front line teaching is being shuffled onto ph.d's, clerical is nearly non-existent etc.

Dismiss me if you want, i'd be surprised if many people with much experience behind the curtain say different things.

Almost all the focus on these debates is what it costs for an undergrad to spend 3 years largely getting drunk, get a degree and in most cases never look back. There is a lot more to university than this.

I am so glad we decided to send him there already, and he is so excited to go to go in each morning. His teacher spoke to me at the end of the first week as his motor skills are slightly delayed and they were concerned he was feeling embarrassed in front of his classmates. They have already put in place extra activities and exercises to help his motor skills and there has been a marked improvement. I have many friends who teach in state primary schools who all tell me it would be very likely that no one would notice he was struggling until a few years later when he would have fallen behind his peers because he still couldn't hold a pen or do up his buttons.My husband and I both went to state schools and felt they failed us as intelligent people because so much time is taken up with dealing with bad behaviour and kids who are struggling. Obviously, this isn't the fault of the teachers or school who just want to be able to do their job, but it is a reality in state schools today. We have chosen to live in a cheaper area and save wherever possible so we can send our boys to private school. The facilities far outstrip those in the local primary schools, there are a maximum of 18 in each class (instead of 40 like some of the schools around here), the level of discipline is great, and all the older children I have encountered so far have been amazingly polite and articulate. While we can afford to I see no reason not to invest in our children's education and give them the opportunities we missed out on.There is snobbery from some of the parents, and you can definitely split them into those who grew up with wealthy families and went to private school and those who are working hard to be able to afford a private education for their children. As it's a prep school I doubt there is much bullying or drug use, so we will have to wait and see if that's the case when they move up to the senior school. But I can say that there was an enormous amount of drug use and violence at my secondary school, so I think that all teenagers are the same in that regard. Like someone else mentioned, there are only a few ""elite"" boarding schools in the country where I think you would encounter the snobbery and posh twats that people associate with private schools. Most are trying to leave that old fashioned silliness behind by going co-ed and following a more holistic approach to teaching because they aren't bound by the national curriculum.

This proposal makes a lot of sense to me. It's not about letting the wealthy off, it's about tidying up the taxation of pension benefits following the sweeping pension reforms announced in his last budget.

Those reforms appear to make pension savings more attractive to all, not a particular economic group or subset of society.

Previously you were required to purchase an annuity with your pension savings*. Depending on the type of annuity purchased (i.e. with or without a pension payable to a spouse on death) any residual value upon death would go to the insurance company the annuity was purchased from and/or your spouse. The Government would only see tax in the form of marginal income rates from this arrangement. 

With the reforms, more and more are expected to draw income from their pension pots (known as draw-down) at the marginal rate of tax. Upon death under:
- the existing arrangement: the remaining funds are inherited as a lump sum subject to 55% tax
- the proposal: either tax free or at the marginal rate of income tax (dependent on age and whether the pot was 'untouched'.

The main point I'm trying to make is that there is expected to be fewer annuity purchases going forwards, and more people dying leaving substantial pension pots. Therefore under the existing arrangements more tax would be paid by all.

People with large income already pay a marginal tax rate at or close to 55% on a bracket of their income. If the pension amounts they inherit is over the threshold, the proposal no different to existing treatment. For those ""with the least"" they will be substantially better off because of the personal allowance and lower income tax amounts.

*simplified for brevity (ignoring previous draw-down rules with/without charges, tax free lump sums of up to 25% and defined benefit pension arrangements)

full disclosure: I work in pensions, albeit Defined Benefit not Defined Contribution.

I think our fullbacks and wingers situation is a bit comical really. Pulling out of the plan to use wingbacks has left us playing polo on a pogo stick. I thought we had finally settled the matter of Traoré's identity last season. Here we are six game in wheeling him out as a fullback again. Selling Simpson just looks idiotic - I can only imagine there was some kind of financial logic behind the move. Probably to free up funds for one of Redknapp's schemes to bring in another old boy (Diarra? Defoe? Crouch?). On the positive side, at least Traoré and Isla try, in spite of any technical weaknesses.

If we were still playing with the three in the middle I could live with Ferdinand, but all his wily experience and knowledge just isn't compensating his physical limitations in my eyes and this partnership with Caulker just doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.

Every poll which asked whether people would stay in the EU 'on renegotiated terms' had the majority supporting 'stay', most of the time over 50% supporting staying in the EU, with under 30% supporting leaving. However, because 'renegotiated terms' is very vague, and I think many would believe reducing immigration to count under that (which won't happen), I'm not sure what that question is worth. 

When asked whether they want to stay in the EU regardless, there is a slightly different picture. Before 2014, almost every single poll supported leaving. In 2014, the majority of polls support staying, but there are still a considerable few which still support leaving. Ironically, as anti-EU feelings have group in Parliament, they have decreased with the British public. 

When you consider most of this polling comes after years of anti-EU rhetoric from the majority of the papers, and parties like UKIP and the Conservatives, I'd imagine if a referendum was on the cards, the pro-EU side would step up their game, and the majority would support staying.

You can't really have free trade and movement to the extent that the EU does without a large degree of common regulation and decision-making.  Otherwise, say, Portugal could slash tariffs to ensure that trade from outside the EU was funnelled through Portugal, Luxembourg could loosen regulations to encourage manufacturers to set up shop there, and you would have lots of races to the bottom.  There would also be lots more duplication of effort, as individual countries would need to go back to developing their own regulations individually, and companies that do business throughout the EU would have to deal with all of them.

First thing first, I think service charges are bullshit. Part of the cost of order a plate of pasta for £12 is the service that comes with it. I much rather be delighted by the service and tip accordingly.

Second thing, if I am paying a service charge I would expect it to go into waiter/waitresses pockets. Nope. At this Steak restaurant in Sevenoaks, the tips go straight into the two owners pockets.

I havent done anything yet about this, this week I'm consulting with the student welfare services. The last time I spoke to them about this they told me that I should start looking for another place to live and that this was definitely not ok. It sounded like I could win, from their end. 

I have my tenancy agreement here, I will definitely give it another in depth read over. I feel like declining to do anything about my concerns and false advertising in itself should be a pretty serious offense, especially for the whopping 960 pounds per month I am paying. They told me that I deserve to be fully refunded and my contract torn up. Or can that be turned around on me?

I will also go to CAB, thanks for that one. I will go after I meet the student welfare people, unless they direct me to them to begin with, but they seem to have quite an influence to begin with. 

For the noise, the neighbors are not even loud. They are behaving totally reasonably, its just the design of the flats is so cheap and poorly done that everything is heard outside and inside all of them.  Its loud as hell because of the building, not the neighbors.

If we look at e.g. Glasgows' balance sheet: http://www.gla.ac.uk/about/facts/incomeandexpenditure/

noting that Funding Body grants is roughly 1/3 QR money, and 2/3 Teaching, then we can see that Teaching brings in as much money as Reasearch, to a first approximation.  

Therefore, within a department, it would be reasonable to expect that half the work done was teaching, and half was research.  Can be tricky to evaluate that (e.g. the lab tech for a teaching lab should be counted as teaching there; secretaries often sit both sides, but weighted to one, and so on).

Except: I've never been in a department where the number of research-only staff doesn't outnumber everyone else.  Once you take account of the fact that term time is 2/3 of the year; this starts to stand out as disproportionate to the net income of the university.

On foreign policy I prefer a leaning to the Franco-British method over, for example, the German method. A united European Union would be a major world player (with the largest single economy on the planet) and, as such, could take a far more important role in peacekeeping and counter-terrorism by harnessing the entire capabilities of Europe. 

As independent armed forces much of Europe's capabilities are wasted: only France and the UK put any muscle into international politics. A united Europe would have far greater resources available and, with the same attitude, could therefore have much greater effect.

I would hope, though, that the mixing of Franco-British and more neutral foreign policy outlooks of Europe would produce a power more interested in genuine peacekeeping and not on quasi-imperial 'world police' adventures that France and the UK often involve themselves in with the United States. For example, (in an ideal world here) using our forces to mediate peace talks in places like Libya, instead of just arming our favourite faction and bombing the dictator out of power: this has only resulted in a civil war that is still ongoing.

&gt;Most people choose to pay by instalments when the estate includes a house.

&gt;If you plan to sell the house, you only need to find 10 per cent of the Inheritance Tax due by the six-month deadline. You will then have a year before the next instalment is due to sell the house and pay the full balance.





http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/paying-iht/yearly-instalments/index.htm

According to HSBC: 
&gt;Inheritance tax is normally paid by the personal representative, using money from the estate. It may be possible for HSBC or another bank to pay this, using money held in the deceased person's accounts. If there is not enough money immediately available in the accounts to pay the inheritance tax, the personal representative may be able to apply for a loan.

They release National Planning Guidance statements that local councils are expected to adhere to, but there's plenty of scope for local councils to set their own planning agendas within that, unless its for infrastructure with strategic national importance such as major highways, railways, aviation, ports, etc. They also allocate targets for development essential to the public interest, e.g. new housing, energy generation, waste reduction etc.

But within a council's Local Plan they have a lot of control over the details of how those things are all put into practice.

If a planning application is refused, then the developer has right to appeal, but that needs to be done in reference to the Local Plan and any relevant national planning guidance. The problem with appeals is that there's not really any way of measuring the harmful environmental and social impact of development, so an application rejected because of those reasons can easily be overturned by sticking to an argument based purely on economics. Appeals carry quite a high financial risk (from the costs involved in paying for experts etc), so they generally only tend to be done by developers with solid financial resources (like supermarkets), and a lot of the time council planning committees will approve a plan from a big developer simply because they don't want to face the financial risk of losing an appeal against their decision.

But there is good reason to do so, money being one, centralisation of knowledge being another, and the export of british knowledge through british institutions only betters britain itself.

&gt; Germany is one of the world leaders in scientific research. British universities are good - but the university research system fails to provide decent career prospects for scientists and inflates the expense of undergraduate teaching.

Germany spends almost 70 billion dollars on research and development, the UK barely spends 40 billion, but the UK is still ranked third best country for [influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from.](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php)

&gt; As I said - if we continue on as we are then we are just training people to work in finance etc. (as there are woefully insufficient jobs in science) but the taxpayer is subsidising the education which is expensive, and it is a very roundabout approach which benefits neither the employer nor the employee.

The tax payer isnt subsidising anything, infact the UK government makes far more than it loses from the current university system thanks to high demand for British university places.

It's not just being able to replace an individual player, we can do that with minimal impact, but having to replace more from similar roles is likely to be really disruptive to the team dynamic e.g. replacing say half the back line one week rather than just fitting one newer player into it. 

Maybe I'm just being over cautious/pesimistic but I'm very much a fan of not fucking with things that are working, so while I realise we'd adapt I don't know if we'd do it flawlessly mid season, and I don't think the other options would be as effective as we have going now.

The maximum amount a single person under the age of **35** can claim is *significantly* less than £26,000 / £23,000. In fact, it's less than £10,000.

I can only provide you with figures for my neck of the woods, though you should be able to extrapolate this to your own part of the country.

**Total Welfare Claim for a person aged 25 - 35, living in the Black Country.**

Type of Benefit | Weekly Amount | Annual Total
---------|----------|----------
JSA - ""Adult Rate"" | £72.40 | £3,764.80
Local Housing Allowance - Single Room Rate | ~£60.00 | ~£3120
Council Tax Benefit¹ | ~£11.29 | £587.29
Free Prescriptions² | £2 | £104.00
Free Glasses³ | ~£0.37 | £19.15

**Total: £7,595.24** per annum  / **£146.06** per week.

UK minimum wage for that age category, from Wednesday, amounts to **£6.50** an hour. Over a 35 hour week - the amount of time job seekers are mandated to look for work, either of their own volition, or on mandatory attendance ""programmes"" - that amounts to £227.50

Or to put it simply?

The maximum amount a single person can claim - including monies that they don't actually see [You don't get handed the money for your prescriptions, nor council tax benefit, but I've included them in an attempt to placate the ""They also get... in addition to their jsa and housing"" crowd] is **£7,595.24** each year. 

After tax and stoppages, a person working 35 hours per week, on minimum wage, would take home as near enough matters, **£11,000**

**Notes:**

**¹:** Originally Council Tax benefit covered the full amount; following changes to funding for local councils this has been at their discretion - in Dudley, for example, the changes have required claimants to find £54.56 a year, to cover the deficit between the amount they're awarded, and the actual cost.

**²**: This is a difficult one to figure out; for convenience I've taken the cost of an NHS Pre-Payment certificate as the base model, as it's the avenue a working person would go down, if they had regular prescription needs.

**³**: I have taken the cost of an NHS optical voucher - currently £38.30, and divided it across two years, as currently people in receipt of working age benefits are entitled to eye tests - and if deemed necessary, free glasses, every two years.",0,1411993396,null,0,false,1,ckvhoqy,t3_2hrtlr,t1_ckvhoqy,t3_2hrtlr,null,1426771159,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

We don't need to have research staff teaching undergraduates in an age when almost everything can be learned from internet lectures and books (and tbh I learned more from the internet lectures than the brick and mortar ones).

The current structure of academia just flies in the face of the principles of the division of labour that have increased efficiency in almost every other human endeavour including Government and Industrial research like Los Alamos and Bell Labs etc.

Knowledge is still centralised in research institutes - if anything it is better as you can develop them around interdisciplinary goals like energy research and force cooperation between often isolated disciplines.

The 'impact factor' has long been criticised as a metric of success, but I'm not saying that UK universities are bad - just that the system isn't sustainable and we are missing out on a lot of potential - we might be good, but we could be _better_. Furthermore running science on a shoestring like that has led to a large number of people leaving science or moving to industry or other nations like Singapore which are more prepared to invest.

The taxpayer pays for the research councils - which funds PhD students  and then a huge number of PhD students and postdocs end up leaving science and not using their expensive scientific education. This is highly inefficient. I am talking about research here, not undergraduate education.

false,leviticusreeves,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"I think normal British people are to blame for most of the country's woes and failings, and politicians get far too much of the blame. 

You could argue that modern politics is now far too concerned with the latest polling data, and that politicians need to start making less populist decisions and making stronger arguments based upon political science and economics, but if they did, they know voters would punish them for it. 

A good recent example of the public making things worse is the immigration debate, where populist movements have lead us to a point where all political parties have to play along with the misconception that immigration is a bad thing for the country (it's not, study after study and report after report show that immigration is a net positive) but because the public hate the political establishment so much, no party has the political capital to spend trying to make these arguments. Worse, if any party attempted this, they'd get destroyed on election day by whichever party is willing to tell people what they want to hear.

The most destructive aspect of all of this is the widespread distrust, not only of politicians, but of the political process itself. People need to wake up to the fact that nothing in society changes for the better without the machinery of politics, and that by rejecting politics altogether the tyrannical, ill-informed majority are dragging us into a country where there is nothing to protect us from the self-interests of the rich and powerful. People are incredulous about the existence of 'experts' who understand the nuances and complexities of politics better than the average Joe Bloggs. Somehow, even making this point seems anti-egalitarian in this bold new world of instant polling and live public reactions. 

Often in life the correct answer is complex and cannot be distilled down into a soundbite or even a speech. Something like, for instance, man-made global warming, takes about 3 weeks of lectures to understand, and only then with a real effort from the listener. But real action on climate change is hampered by a general public who either a) don't claim to understand the issue properly or b) actually claim to have a worthwhile opinion on the subject but categorically do not. Many of these people are swayed by moneyed interests, the media, or simple NIMBYism to oppose potentially catastrophe-averting measures. And because politicians are now forced to coo and pander to whatever opinions the public are shitting out this month, or else face annihilation at the ballot box, any sort of long term planning, any best laid plan, is being consistently derailed.

It's certainly more wasteful to have two governmental organisations than one.  We've got one already.

As to the rest... It doesn't sound outside the realms of practicality to have a standards-and-regulation setting organisation which didn't have any actual power.  Nothing is then wrong with certification against that standard.  e.g. ISO standards seem fine; and the computing world manages to survive without legal force for its standards.

""Race to the bottom"" is not appropriate where you've used it.  Unless you consider ""competition"" a race to the bottom.

There's far too much reliance on ""common sense"".

It's an attitude that doesn't allow for nuance or the consideration of answers that may seem counter-intuitive at first, but with further thought may promise greater benefits.

It's both a kind of bludgeon with which to assail the political class (often deserved) and it's a sweet spot that people like Farage like to stimulate in order to curry favour with the rather sizeable group that adheres to it religiously.

In short, it's a self-righteousness to which a lot of the general public stubbornly try to cling.

If you're still reading, I'll just add that I'm obviously not against ""sound judgement"", but I think that ""common sense"" has become a term that implies that ""everyone should think what I already know"" and it's frustrating.

&gt; First, people should acknowledge that this rather heated policy discussion is over a very small group of people. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are about 3.6 million workers at or below the minimum wage (you can be below legally under certain conditions). ***That is 2.5 percent of all workers*** and 1.5 percent of the population of potential workers. Within that small group, 31 percent are teenagers and 55 percent are 25 years old or younger. That leaves only about 1.1 percent of all workers over 25 and 0.8 percent of all Americans over 25 earning the minimum wage.

It doesn't cover buses and lorries.

You need to apply for a provisional Category C license (rigid lorries up to 32 tonnes). Also tick the box for Cat D as well on the form. You will also need to take a medical to do this which your GP will charge for. You do not have to go to your GP and charges vary. Once you've passed your Category C you then have to go on to take a Category C+E which will allow you to drive artics. This will still not allow you to drive a bus. To drive a bus you need to take a Category D test.

The sum total for all of this is going to be in the region of £5,000 - it typically costing around £1500-£2000 per license.

If you then want to drive for a living you have to take a Drivers CPC course. That will set you back around £300 and take a week.

Furthermore running science on a shoestring like that has led to a large number of people leaving science or moving to industry or other nations like Singapore which are more prepared to invest.

You are just crazy man, the UK is the 6th largest economy in the world, but we have 4 of the top 6 universities located here, and you think that somehow we can improve on this? That the indicators i am using (even though used regularly by other countries i.e. the US) are wrong, and we shouldnt just look at statistics but we should infer things and therefore come to your same conclusion?

No thanks, ill stick to facts and figures thanks, rather than expecting the UK to become some sort of utopian fantasy land. The UK is doing extra-ordinarily well in terms of its scientific research and development and we simply couldnt do any better without investing a hell of a lot more money (currently we make money because of the highly sought after university places Britain has).

Nope, a decrease in prices would be damaging to the economy as a whole.

Supply of houses on the market will dry up. People are unsurprisingly reluctant to sell if they suddenly have negative equity in their property. 

It could trigger a mini credit-crunch as bank assets suddenly dry up. Their mortgage portfolio will suddenly find a huge jump in cases where more is owed on a property than there is value in that property. Banks become very conservative with their lending when this happens, meaning that first-time buyers have to stump up huge deposits to get a mortgage, still-pricing them out of the market despite your correction.

Economic activity is somewhat tied to house prices. When property value goes up, so does economic activity. This is because people who suddenly have several thousand pounds of equity have more financial confidence and are willing to spend more, as financial troubles will be stayed somewhat by this equity cushion. If someone finds that they are suddenly in negative equity, then a problem with their job or a large unexpected bill could properly destroy them financially, so they spend less. Multiply this across the country, and you have an economic slowdown.

So no, a correction would do more harm than good. A plateau for a few years so income can catch up would achieve the same good results with little to none of the bad ones.",0,1411994814,null,0,false,0,ckvi2gk,t3_2hs10q,t1_ckvi2gk,t1_ckvha4x,null,1426770981,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Just because a metric is commonly used doesn't mean it's worthwhile (although sadly we are yet to develop another) it's like that quote about the things we can measure aren't always important and the things that are important we can't always measure.

Just go through the Nature careers section such as [this](http://www.nature.com/news/life-outside-the-lab-the-ones-who-got-away-1.15802) or [this](http://www.nature.com/news/there-is-life-after-academia-1.15808) and you'll see the nightmare, or read the articles like [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/09/345289127/when-scientists-give-up), [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/16/343539024/too-few-university-jobs-for-americas-young-scientists) and [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/17/348998609/top-scientists-suggest-a-few-fixes-for-medical-funding-crisis) or perhaps you prefer [The Economist?](http://www.economist.com/node/17723223)

We make money by using international students as cash cows - but this has little bearing on research which depends upon the research councils as the money goes to administration whereas the research labs are funded pretty much exclusively by the research councils alone.

I don't buy into the argument that it's a bad tax because it's not perfectly implemented because the same is true of practically any tax. To a large extent it does what it is meant to do. The point about rich people is that rich enough people find ways around any tax you try to levy and it's important that we write and modify laws to stop that happening, but I think that's part of wider question we need to ask our government.

You guys make it sound like Scotland NEVER votes Tory. But the Conservatives consistently get 15% or more of the vote in Scotland.

And yeah, FPTP makes it WORSE for the conservatives. Look at 2001. Labour got 45% of the votes and 56/72 seats. Lib dems got 16% of the vote and 10 seats, but the Conservtives also got 16% of the vote and only 1 seat.

Or let's go back further and look at the 1970's.
Labour got 1-5% more of the popular vote but end up with 40 seats while the Tories only got 20 seats. So in all of those situations, Conservative voters were absolutely fucked over. THEY are the real ones who did not get representation.

So look at voter numbers and you'll see that many Scottish people vote Tory. FPTP is fucked up, but under PR, you should expect around 10-15 Scottish seats to go to the Conservatives.

Yes balo is cramped of space because of the ""bus"". For me its not the running behind which is the problems , its the general getting used to the game we play on the counter attack. Balo is not used to stretching defences by making diagonal runs or run into the channels if needed which was an important part of the game of our strikes last year. 

For me it seems the team still play as if the striker is a sturidge or suarez who will make the run for them but ballo doesn't seem to make those runs.. I am not saying balo is not capable or is not good enough .. I think he should be given more time .. I believe he will start scoring heavily when the team has gelled which might mean that the attacking players get used to the strengths of balo and play to his strengths ( and balo making some of the runs )

Second: The specific line is ""You might say I've been doing this all my lives"". Not that they've spent their entire lives doing so.

You put the calculations into the TARDIS and each iteration of the Doctor would, upon being pulled out of their timestreams, check up on the calculations and make sure they're going in the right direction.

My father does, for one of the London Universities mentioned in the article i linked, thats been the source of most of my information.

&gt; I don't understand how you can be ignorant of the current crisis

The ""crisis"" is economic and nothing to do with the universities in the UK. That economist article is 4 years old, and those other articles are pure anecdotes. The economist article does have some valid points though, which can all be put down to lethargic economic growth. most definitely NOT the UKs university system.

&gt; there is a massive crisis at the moment not least in the USA which outperforms even the UK in research metrics.

There is a jobs shortage, not a university crises, and i fucking hope the US outperforms the UK, since the US is the single biggest national economy on the planet.

&gt;Just because a metric is commonly used doesn't mean it's worthwhile (although sadly we are yet to develop another) it's like that quote about the things we can measure aren't always important and the things that are important we can't always measure.

So how can i objectively compare them if your proposed system has no ""decent"" statistical indicators to measure against...

&gt; The system is completely and utterly dysfunctional and this is finally being noticed even in the non-academic mainstream media.

How is it ""completely and utterly dysfunctional"", am i supposed to read your 7 anecdotes and be convinced? I mean after all the UK is still the third best country in terms of scientific research as i previously stated, and i dont know how we can get any better. But for some reason you think that we could, that just seems like lunacy to me.

&gt; To be entirely ignorant of these problems is astonishing

To blame lack of jobs on the university system is entirely ignorant of the state of the international economy, you are ignoring the financial crises and current slow/lethargic growth happening in the world. Times are tough for everyone.

&gt;  but then you started by stating that Germany was 'garbage' despite it being a renowned leader in scientific research so I'm not entirely sure how well informed you are.

Germany spends almost twice as much as the UK, and still performs worse than the UK in terms of scientific contributions, that seems pretty garbage to me.

&gt; We make money by using international students as cash cows

yes we do, we make rather a lot from international students wanting to study at prestigious UK universities, and making those universities like the German universities is just stupid. Why would you want UK universities to get worse and make less money for the UK?

&gt; but this has little bearing on research which depends upon the research councils as the money goes to administration whereas the research labs are funded pretty much exclusively by the research councils alone.

And yet the UK pays far less than Germany but still has better international results, strange that.

&gt; I just don't understand how some with apparently so little working knowledge of the system can continue to argue so vehemently in its defence.

I could say the same about your knowledge of the economy.

You: ""academics cant find jobs, lets blame the UK university system""

me:""No, its the economy which is too blame for your lack of jobs, the UK university system is one of the best in the world.""

You: ""you know nothing, im right so here are some anecdotes.""

The taxes thing is a bit strange, but sales taxes are governed at a very local level in the US and vary a lot. As much as people from the outside view US as a monolith, we are truly a collection of individually governed states. Our federal government, in a distant part of the country for many of us, in many ways, has much less to do with our everyday lives as our state and city governments do. 

So with regard to sales tax, a less prosperous county's constituents can decide amongst itself by vote to lower the sales tax from say 6% to 3% in an effort to encourage people to shop at local businesses in their community. While maybe another state or county is in debt and needs to raise revenues, so they may go from 4% to 6%. It's a fluid amount that can change every 5-10 years or sometimes more often.

So with that variation, not having to include the subtle variation in prices by a few cents from region to region makes it easier for businesses to advertise prices without having to put a million caveats in. Also, some states have no sales tax whatsoever. So in the state of Delaware, the advertised price actually is the correct amount because the government has decided to tax their residents in different ways in an effort to attract business. 

I do understand your sentiment though and it always is a surprise when you get the check out counter whether a final price is going to be, say, $6.04, $6.10, or $6.12 and if you pay in cash that can be annoying.",0,1411997993,null,0,false,0,ckvj2vy,t3_2hrrxs,t1_ckvj2vy,t1_ckvimxv,null,1426770509,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

With the presidency, came the authority to grant himself and the Doctor new rounds of regeneration. 
The Doctor finds The Master doing ambiguous stuff, assumes he's up to no good, stops him, and The Master recriminates: ""Why do you think you're *still alive*!?""

Stop. Accept that the requirements exist and do what you can to meet them, that's the reality of being on benefits *and* working: you accept things and deal with them as best you can. Nobody expects you to be perfect, but they do expect you to try. You'll be surprised how much people and organisations are willing to accept failure, but what they're not willing to accept is refusing to even try and being argumentative. If you have an opportunity: take it. If you fail... so what. I fail frequently and I'm gainfully employed.

I know how hard it can seem to ""just stay positive"" but that's pretty much the key to giving yourself the room to achieve and be successful, just focus on the positive side of opportunities and ignore any barriers, pretend they don't exist. For example:

&gt; but at some point they're going to wonder why I'm running to the loo every five minutes, calling in sick at least once a week or passing out at my desk because my blood sugar's too high or low.

That's not your problem, how do you know that the jobs you have applied for *can't* cope with that? You're creating a barrier! Everything is flexible. The best example of this are ""5 years experience"", ""Degree in Computer Science of equivalent"" requirements on job applications: they're *so flexible* and that goes for a lot of jobs and employers in general. There are 3.2 million people in England with diabetes, and millions of them are employed.

 [**Financial Conduct Authority**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial%20Conduct%20Authority): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Financial Conduct Authority__ (__FCA__) is a [financial regulatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation) body in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), but operates independently of the United Kingdom government, and is financed by charging fees to members of the financial services industry.  The FCA regulates financial firms providing services to consumers and maintains the integrity of the UK’s financial markets.  It focuses on the regulation of conduct by both retail and wholesale financial services firms.  Like its predecessor the [FSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Services_Authority), the FCA is structured as a [company limited by guarantee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_limited_by_guarantee).

Can you actually do some research on internet learning please, its one of the absolute worst teaching techniques, sure its easy and accessible, but studies have been done to show how utterly terrible they are for effective learning.

&gt; The global university system is at fault to be sure but we can improve the situation in the UK and benefit from the researchers that would move to benefit from it.

Even if the global university system is at fault, why would we change the UKs? They bring in so much to this country, the current system is definitely benefiting us.

&gt; The current system is obsolete and leads to a massive inflation of the costs of education which is incredibly harmful to the economy as it puts retraining out of the reach of many thus reducing the ability of the workforce to adapt to changes in market demand for skills.

But it doesnt though, the costs of education have increased because the demand has increased for those sources of education. Thats simple supply and demand. Just as the economy recovers there will be greater demand for highly educated people which means more jobs and greater pay.

I do take what you're saying. I knew the requirements before attending the interview and wanted to register my objections and point out the flaws in their requirements - as much to judge, from the reactions of the staff, how much flexibility there was nowadays, having been out of the loop for a year. There's not much.

&gt; You'll be surprised how much people and organisations are willing to accept failure

This might be so, but have you been on JSA recently? They tend not to accept failure in favour of sanctions. This is the reason they place so much emphasis on not actually helping you - or to put it in their words, to focus on helping myself - then, if you fail, which you do every week, they can blame you, tell you you're not doing everything you can, and sanction you.

&gt; how do you know that the jobs you have applied for can't cope with that? 

I'm sure they can. However, once I'd secured the job and begun work, how sympathetic would a company be when they found out I hadn't disclosed a current, significant medical problem? Lying to an employer about something that big surely isn't a good idea?

&gt;  focus on the value you can provide

I had an interview last week and sold myself as well as I could.

They said that the van delivery guy was off sick, so I had to take all of the parcels, and the route was 2 miles away, but would take about 5 trips to get it done, and there were no bikes. This was around the time when they were merging routes (every 3 routes was becoming 2, because they said people were using RM less, and postmen were finishing their shifts too early). 

I didn't take all the parcels because some of them were heavy as fuck, and I get a phone call from the ops manager that he's arranged to have the parcels delivered to a corner shop for me to pick up and deliver. At that point, I went to said corner shop with my post bag and left it on the counter and told the girl behind that someone would be by to pick it up. Phoned the manager and told him to stick his delivery job up his arse and that I won't be picking up shifts for him again. 

 So I'm not surprised they went down the shitter and got sold off, and I wouldn't be surprised if your postman skipped a few parcels on his route.

Iraq and foreign affairs are admittedly something very different, where politicians have their own agenda and public opinion is just another hurdle.

You also need to consider the array of government and university grants (+tuition fee reductions) which are mostly based on household income. At Oxford, for instance, they will reduce your first year tuition fees to £3.5k, and give you £5.5k in grants in addition to the £7k from the government, if your household income is below £20k. Which means that ultimately living costs and tuition fees are covered... with a fair bit of cash to spare. You don't need to pay to go to university; you get paid to do it. 

Unless all European governments and universities tend to be equally generous, the comparison of (basic, non-reduced) tuition fees serves little purpose. 

Few people understand much of this. Which is unfortunate because, as you say, the circlejerk of (usually ignorant) criticism ends up discouraging poorer students from actually applying to universities. It is the critics of the system, not the system itself, which is the problem.

Then again, the 'problem' is not as severe as some people think, since people around the age of 18 are actually forced to understand the system.

false,Vorsa,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire. Ex - Wales,"I used to work as a Chef, Barman and a Waiter for many years and the way most people tip make things very difficult.

As a Waiter, I was occasionally tipped specifically for my service (usually because I made the kids behave/laugh). If I was told that the tip was for me and is a thank you for great service, then it's mine. Thank you very much, have a nice day. 

90% of the tips I've dealt with have been a few quid, a fiver or a tenner under a dirty plate and the customers have cleared off. 

Well, where's that supposed to go? Do I get it because I'm front of house? What about the Bar staff? They've probably had as much interaction as me. The Chef's did most of the heavy lifting, should they get it? 

If I take it as a waiter, it feels like a game of Finders keepers and that's complete bullshit, but should I get the whole tip as the Chef when it could easily have been a tip for someone at front of house who was quick to sort out an issue they were having? 

Well, what if it goes in a pot? Should I be splitting the tips I earn with the waitress who can't do her job properly and the barman who's rude to anyone who wants something out of the ordinary? 

The best way I've seen of dealing with the whole thing was with the system the couple who owned the first pub I worked in implemented

Their POS system automatically added 3% on to any food order and the whole lot was put into a pot that lasted from Dec 1st to Nov 30th. All full time staff, from pot wash to head chef to manager, got an equal share and part time staff (who were mostly teenagers) got half of the full time staffs payout. 

This could obviously be removed at request by the customer and was stated on the menu. This system was implemented on a simple premise: All cash tips are put into the charity pots on the bar. If you were caught pocketing them, you lost your share of the tips pot.

Because the tip amount added was so small per order, I can only ever heard of two people asking to remove it. On a typical meal it was pennies (even on a £50 order, tips were only £1.50). The cash tips stopped almost completely and absolutely no one pocketed what was left. 

If I recall correctly the two years it was run before the pub was sold, I got around £600 each year. The owners even took a share themselves, but that was put on an account behind the bar for a massive party just before christmas. 

Honestly, I think that's the only way a tip system can work in the UK. All shared with everyone, or none at all.

If you set a legal minimum number of hours per week, anybody unable to work that number of hours is suddenly out of a job - schoolkids, students, mothers with young kids who do the odd bit of work here and there when they can get rid of the kids for the day, et cetera. Small companies which are very exposed to fluctuating demand are forced to either cut staff and offer a reduced service, or employ more than they know that they can afford and potentially end up out of business - so everybody loses their jobs. That's just a couple of examples though.

The labour market is a complex beast but zero hour contracts help it to clear more efficiently. I'm all for job security and workers rights and all that but banning zero hour contracts is likely to do just as much harm as good.",0,1412001339,null,0,false,0,ckvkeqp,t3_2hrrxs,t1_ckvkeqp,t1_ckvhp50,null,1426769889,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

More people leave University with a media related degree than there are jobs in the entire industry - every year. People with these degrees are propping up fast food, table waiting and hospitality work in general in this country. There are some notable exceptions of course where the industry head hunt from (NFTS for example) but the vast majority are just printing paper and turning them into quaint little scrolls with ribbons tied on them. The poor buggers are then tossed, ill-equipped into the market with a £40k+ debt around their necks. Foreign students get fleeced for more but probably stand more chance of getting a job since there is still much kudos with a UK earned degree especially in the far east. The quality of teaching, studio space, face to face time with tutors etc is at rock bottom with Uni's forced to take on more and more students without an equal amount of investment to cater for increased numbers. Now there is this new initiative by the treasury whereby they are forcing Uni's to take responsibility for debt repayment (quite how I don't know if the jobs just aren't there!) and the trade off is they can charge what they like in return. The ceiling will be scrapped and we can expect to start seeing high performing courses and faculties charging US level rates per year with still no real substantial increase in employability once graduated.

University should always be for the top achievers IMO. There has to be something there for those exceptional people to go on to. The Polytechnics should have remained where they were and catered for the masses. Too many were upgraded without the proper care and consideration they required and now we have this situation with degrees cheapened to almost a prerequisite for even the lowest position within a company. With Universities literally rubber stamping students with 2.2's and above, hardly a single person ever failing or re-taking despite in many cases having come straight from school with zero foundation it's no surprise really. When someone truly exceptional comes along they have nowhere to go and no better accolade to give than what they give the numpty up the road with 3 A levels because they lowered the entry criteria to get the numbers and the money up.

Isn't ""entrapment"" only when it is a law-enforcement agency persuading someone to commit an illegal act?  The argument goes, I believe, that there is no way to know that the person being entrapped would have committed the crime had the law-enforcement agency not been involved, hence entrapment is illegal.

Now... that's very different from private organisation tricking a private individual into performing a completely legal (but presumably embarassing) action.

As to public interest -- anything that tests the moral character of those that have the power to set laws (which presumably flow from morality) for the rest of us seems to reasonably come under ""public interest"".  In the end then, I suppose the only question is whether ""MP likes naked girls"" is morally questionable (I'd say not).

false,ig1,null,null,"Firstly let's note that this has huge support across party-political lines in polling, only 12% of voters oppose a benefit cap (71% of Labour voters support it; most of the others are neutral on it).

The argument for a benefit cap is that someone earning a 25k/year salary shouldn't have to pay taxes that go to support someone who makes more than 25k/year in benefits. 

For example the case study linked from the article has the story of a single mum who struggles because her £400/week London flat takes up most of her benefits. There are many working single mothers (and I suspect many redditors) for who affording a £400/week flat would be completely out of the question. 

The fundamental issue is that jobs don't pay based on the needs of the individual who has the job (i.e. you don't get paid more if you have more kids) so should benefits ?

You could argue Yes, especially in the case of where we're talking about children in poverty, but then you will end up in disparities where people on benefits will make more money than those working (which most people would consider unfair).

Even if you think the answer is ""Yes"" there's a complex question as to how you measure need, for example do you calculate how much they need for housing based upon where they want to live or based upon where's affordable.

false,MyreMyalar,null,null,"Forums have been dealing with these problems for years. There is plenty twitter can do if it cares about the problem. For example:

- Main abuse vector is @replies, and the main circumvention of blocking method is to create a new account. Twitter could probably do a lot here by adding a week long 'cooldown' on new accounts before they can make @replies to non-mutual follows.

- Throwaway 'low post count' troll accounts are also a common abuse vector in and of themselves. Twitter could put similar restrictions in place on these so that you have to have a certain amount of activity (number of tweets, length of time account has been active) before you get the ability to DM &amp; @reply non-mutual following accounts.

- Cleaning up after abuse/filtering out abuse. It'd be nice if twitter provided some default filters. Right now the basic options for sorting your feed are 'Tweets' &amp; 'Tweets &amp; replies'. Plenty of room to add extra columns so you could see the @replies of your mutual followers distinct from the @replies of the general public. 

- Once you have those filters in place it'd be useful to have an option to just clear out general public @reply tweets for say 'the last 8 hours/24 hours/week' because these harassment episodes tend to take the form of a wave of attention that arrives and then dissipates a few weeks later. Asking the person being harassed to individually block potentially hundreds of separate accounts seems like a piss poor solution.


Obviously those things won't eliminate abuse but it might help stem the tide to a manageable amount where they can be handled via things like the court system. Why don't twitter do these things? 
1. It's more work.
2. Some of them might affect user growth (and therefore potential short term profit).

I spent some time on benefits (HB + ESA) before I found work, so I had a go at the entitledto.co.uk website and seeing how much I - a 20 year old single, disabled male with no children or dependants - would get if I lost my jobs today.

I'd get £6,790.53 a year - or £130.40 a week. It would be closer to £150 a week after the ESA assessment phase, although given it took the government 9 MONTHS last time to get me one, I think it's pretty irrelevent. So... £130 a week it is to live on - of which I would only see the ESA amount of £57.35.

Now according to this site where I'd be given council tax reduction at £12.21 a week. I'd still have to pay £2.15 a week.

I'd only get £60.84 of my £105 weekly rent paid for. So there's a £39.16 a week shortfall I have to make up. All of a sudden I have £18.19 a week. That being said, when I was on benefits I got all my rent paid for so I can only assume it's changed.

So with £18.19 a week, I have a few things I'd like to pay for.

Food? I've survived on a pound a day before, mainly a combination of bread, cheese and eggs. So that's £7 a week - and, lets be honest, that's an INCREDIBLY low estimate.  

That leaves me with £11.19. A lot of money, I know. Electricity? Around £5 a week - and given that my shower and cooker is electric it would be nice. Down to £6.19 a week now.

Oh! Lets not forget water. That's £26 a month. £6.50 a week.... Oh. 

Guess I can't afford any gas this week. Guess I better find my jumper. In fact, I'll probably run out electricity now as well, it gets dark earlier and earlier. Oh well.

Even without making up for my rent - as I didn't have to when on actually on benefits - I still struggled. I brought almost no luxuries (I ""saved"" best I could and if I could on friday I'd buy a bottle of that cheap £2 cider you can get from Tesco's). Just cheap food and the rest went to bills. It's not much fun sitting in a tiny flat alone. Even with gas and electric there are little luxuries that most people take for granted that I didn't have. Want to watch TV? Nope, need a licence. Internet? Too expensive. Phones? Nope. Books? Could afford one a month. Can't afford to travel so I had no social life. My spare money went into an hour internet rent at the library so I could so my weekly job search.

Of course this does wonders for mental illness.

Whilst a very valid point, it's almost impossible to gauge and police effectively.

&gt; Also, 100MPH is quite high given that even in Germany they advise 80MPH. My car can't even reach 100MPH.

They advise as such, and various parts of the Autobahn do actually have legally enforced limits, but the Autobahn is an absolute pleasure to drive on at speed. People actually get the fuck out of the way and back into the correct lanes when they're not overtaking, unlike this stupid fucking country where people occupy the far-right two overtaking lanes on 4/5 lane motorways.

We regularly play large parts in developing things for the ESA like Galileo with BAE Sys. and Rolls Royce being massive in aircraft (whole and parts) manufacture among other areas. If we change the regulations for how we manufacture aerospace components to make them different from those various 'nasty' EU regulations (e.g efficiency requirements for jet engines or different safety or materials standards for aircraft) they will no longer be of use to many European organisations and 1 of 3 things will happen to British aerospace companies:

1. The companies will relocate to France or Germany to manufacture for the larger EU market and will abandon the much smaller UK market. 

2. The companies will voluntarily continue to manufacture according to EU standards and spend money designing 2 different products for the UK and EU markets increasing their overheads and possibly leading to consumers paying more. 

3. The companies will not be able to afford to design and make 2 different versions of every product and will chose to give up their market share in Europe focusing on the UK. 

Either way the companies lose out and British industry loses out. Car manufacturers already have to do this between the US and EU. There are 2 different sets of regulations governing safety etc - different tints of amber on indicator lights, different materials for body work or different sizes of windscreen wipers. Neither set of regulations has proven to be safer than the other but every year car companies spend millions and millions of their own money redesigning and remanufacturing everything to be sold in the other market. It's totally pointless and an obvious barrier to international trade because it adds to the overhead costs of entering a foreign market. The EU seeks to avoid this by 'harmonising' regulations to make it as costless as possible to enter each other's markets, increasing competition and bettering the consumer and manufacturer. Leaving the EU then changing our regulations to British ones (that's why UKIP want to leave isn't it, silly EU regulations?) will erect a giant trade barrier between us and Europe hurting our companies, their employees, consumers in Europe and the UK and, of course, the treasury who will collect less tax as UK companies do worse. 

Anti-EU people say we'll make up the difference in trade by trading with the rest of the world. The aerospace industry is one area where that's simply never going to happen. Russia, China and India all have their own space stations, their own GPS systems, their own rockets and aircraft and military manufacturers. India put a fucking rover on Mars for gods sake - these countries don't need our aerospace industry they have their own and it's doing just fine without UK products. In Europe we are doing very well with long term contracts and lots of business collaborating with European companies; why Nigel Farage et al want to go to India and gamble that they'll abandon their own technical industries in favour of ours I will never ever know.

The West Lothian Question is a serious problem in our democracy (well, oligarchy), and I fundamentally agree that the current arrangement is unfair. However, ""English votes for English laws"" within a UK parliament context is, in my view, unworkable. Barring Welsh, Scottish and NI MPs from voting on certain issues will not so much *solve* the WLQ so much as *reverse* it, because of the way that the level of funding for the devolved administrations is determined. The Barnett Formula works out the level of funding based on population and the level of public expenditure in England - if the party of government decides to drive through a program of cuts in England, the budgets of the devolved administrations are also cut. Consequentially, if Welsh, Scottish and NI MPs are barred from voting on particular issues in the HoC, cuts can be forced on the devolved administrations without anyone representing those parts of the UK having any sort of say in the matter whatsoever.

Adittionally, it's easy to imagine a situation where a Labour government has a majority in the HoC but not a majority among English MPs, leaving it unable to influence many of the policy areas it has responsibility for.

The only sustainable way to solve the WLQ is to have a separate parliament for England - or a number of regional assemblies.",0,1412005386,null,0,1412006309,0,ckvmb0l,t3_2hq5q8,t1_ckvmb0l,t3_2hq5q8,null,1426768972,9,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,9

How long do you think people will let them get away with it before they get sick of faith schools intellectually stunting society on these subjects? How long are we going to perpetuate this black hole of information for the sake of tradition? 

They will never teach the current evolutionary biology theories on homosexuality in a million years, so how long will we avoid teaching kids about advances in the sciences over the past several decades for the sake of tip-toeing around a 2000 year old worldview and avoid offending those who refuse to move with the rest of society because they were unlucky enough to be indoctrinated into a cult as a child?

Then you are refusing to communicate in an understood and efficient manner. I'd suggest just using actor names rather than numbering, as that is another accepted way of communicating.

Don't tell me about my tone or demeanor. You are relatively well versed in the lore of DW, so you know this numbering system is not an effective way of communicating and you know that even the show writers do not agree with it. I'm not about to tell you to never use your system of numbering, as that is not my place to do so. I'm heavily suggesting you stop trying to be a unique snowflake on the internet and use the system that already allows for easily understood communication between fans, the show writers and producers, and the actors themselves.

This would reduce crimes such as rape and prevent public beheadings in the streets where the police and citizens can do nothing.

Before you start the down votes and calling me a ""fucking criminal"" let me give some example view points and counter arguments:

- *But criminals will get all the guns!* - Criminals can already get guns if they want them, they don't have to follow the law, they have unlimited funds and we are an island. They can just ship them in on a boat if they want. And that is without even considering the millions of legal guns they could steal but don't.

- *But think of the dunblane!* - The dunblane shooter was a paedophile, shouldn't have been given guns but mysteriously was. If you think trained safe citizens shouldn't have guns because a paedophile shot some kids he molested then something is wrong with you.

- *But handguns are concealable so if bad people get them we will all die!* - You can cut down a legal shotgun or rifle or pistol and make it concealable, so this would have no effect.

- *Handguns are only for killing* - Tell that to the olympic team. Oh wait you can't since we exiled them.

- *Only the police, army and david cameron should have guns. We cannot trust ourselves.* - The police and army are just under qualified, low wage people who we give guns to. Their sole purpose is to kill people that the government doesn't like. Arguing that they are safer just doesn't make sense. If normal people can't be trusted then why do we give them guns? 
We can give them guns because normal people won't just randomly start killing other people*. That also applies to trained citizens.

- *What about America?* - What about ireland?

As far as I'm aware, people who haven't had a medical assessment which proves they're not fit for work can't claim ESA. I mention in my Op that I've been on ESA for a year. If that doesn't make things clear, I apologise. To be utterly clear, I have a medical certificate in front of me which states I am too ill to work. I have had identical ones for the last year. It's a stipulation of remaining on ESA, which my GP practise has been happy to comply with.

The JC staff are not going to question a GP's assessment, but at this moment in time,the situation is this: My ESA claim has just finished going through Mandatory Reconsideration. The decision - that I am not ill enough to continue claiming ESA - stands. The next step is an appeal at Tribunal. In the meantime, the JC has to comply with the decision of the ESA decision makers, meaning that, as far as they're concerned, I am fit to work.

And now I have to show them that sick note saying I'm not fit to work tomorrow.

My concern isn't really for the JC or ESA bureaucracy. That's all in hand.

false,spras1,uk,London,"&gt;Personally, I'd rather see the government put more money into research, keep the current system of university fees (which is the best, most flexible deal students have had since top up fees - if not before), and then at least fees can at least begin to cover the cost of teaching.

The current fee regime is more expensive than the last one (by about £250 million IIRC). It's got nothing to do with saving money and everything about enforcing market discipline in the HE sector. The success of the British University system was made by free education (see here: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n10/howard-hotson/dont-look-to-the-ivy-league) - fees are taking us backwards. Rapidly. As it is it is only propped up by astronomical fees for foreign students (which, financial issues aside, are at a rate that is surely quite simply unjust). 

&gt;And we're orders of magnitude cheaper than them!

I assume you mean the US. The UK system is now on average more expensive than them. Although headline US fees are well out of whack with the standardised fee here, the average is balanced by cheaper in-state fees and more generous bursaries (coming from the huge US top research uni endowments, which are not rivalled by any university here except possibly Oxbridge)

&gt;You know why undergrads even exist? So that the University can get he best ones to do PhDs, so they can publish shit and make the University look good. That's it.

PhD funding is in even more of a dire state than undergraduate funding, and worse again is Msc/MA funding - a hurdle you have to cross one way or another to even get on to a PhD course (at least for the vast majority). If the aim is to get the best ones to do PhDs we're going very wrong - as it is it seems more like the aim is to get the rich ones to do them.

Sometimes it can be difficult to determine what the right level of democratic ""granularity"" is for a region; considerations of the matter can involve the level of education of the people, how well rights are protected at a local level and so on, but a good indicator of whether a region should be under its own democratic control is if it has its own laws and government. An even better indicator is whether it has its own laws and government that have been tried and tested.

Scotland has its own laws and government and it has been governing its own affairs very well. There are arguments that it is a better form of governance in its own right than the U.K. (it has proportional representation, far better performance in combating global warming and a generally more socially-oriented government, for examples).

&gt; Problem with West is they link Muslims with their religion.. Going with same argument, it was a Christian ( Hitler) who killed millions of Jews but nobody puts forwards the narrative that it was act of a Christian.. The narrative till now is he was an individual despite the fact that whole German nation fought for him..

He didn't use Christianity to encourage followers to join his crazy insane ridiculous stupid plot. He used nationalistic ideals and hence is reviled in Germany and the world has been extremely wary of regimes formed in a similar way. So arguing that we should judge him based on it is not really rational.

If you want a Christian example, try the Crusades. Europe collectively trashed the Middle East several times, wrecking the then caliphates in existence. The Popes of the day encouraged such behaviour.

Alternatively, the other recent Christian supremacist organisation is the KKK. They are probably the western comparison to the Taliban, whereas the Crusades was the Western comparison to AQAP.

&gt; So till people in UK can't learn to separate Acts of certain misguided Muslims they will continue to live in that fear and hatred...

I've made the isolation argument already on this thread, so I'll limit my comment here to: people judge by what they see.

I really wouldn't be so sure about it. The typical ""explode"" is a rather very small risk but we underestimate dependencies in nature and how quick changes in climate can have worldwide devastating effects, like dominoes.

UKIP-ers aren't. They don't even believe man-made global warming (unless they changed their position, just like with the u-turn on super-value VAT). They think it's pointless to built these and would invest more into nuclear and that that gas thing, what was it's the name.... I'm not saying that all green is super-great but the problem is that if we stop investing in research, we won't achieve anything in that field. Maybe now all those solar and wind isn't as good but in next 10 years it will be much better.

Yeap and I could easily point out to both of them they didn't do it good.

I'm always happy to debate. The same ignorance is shown from the right wing. I've noticed it plenty of times in discussions. Not bothering to reply to ALL my points or not continuing discussion due to lack of arguments, yet not saying ""OK, maybe I'm in wrong"".

&gt;Leaving the EU isn't going to prevent you from going to Europe.

It will prevent some people going to Europe, not all of them though. It will also make it much more harsher to move between. Brits with lack of proper skills and work placements could forget about working abroad in the EU.... unless of course they do it illegally or through some other dodgy way.

&gt;As for saving the planet (I'm assuming you are talking about carbon emissions, the UK makes less than 2% of the worlds carbon dioxide. Countries like China and North America make far more than we do. Why should we take the burden when we cause such a small amount?

Why do I have to pay for the weight of a person on board a plane, which is fatter than me? Also, what kind of example do you think it would be? After all, the UK is a first world country, the one which in the past and in present makes great examples. If UK was to say, ""you know what, fuck it, we don't even produce much"" it would only make those with huge emissions even less forced into change.

Just because people around you are idiots, it doesn't mean you have to become one. Unless you are the passive kind of guy who gets easily influenced.

&gt;Several of the countries we give money to don't need it

Then change it but don't make it a kind of a campaign we could see in media and shown by politicians. Why does it have to suddenly change its colour directly from white to black?

I know that India will cease to receive (all or some?) of UK's aid. Good. Although that's another issue, just because a country is idiotic, it doesn't mean we should be making poor people there pay for it. We should focus on convincing them to change their attitude but also somehow continue helping if that's really required. For example, should UK help North Korean citizens if they had a change to do it? No? because fucking dictator rules them and thinks he's a god?

&gt;The money doesn't always go to the right people. Realistically: how much money that we send to Africa do you think actually helps the poor and how much do you think is used to buy newer weapons for soldiers?

If an MP does something in his private life that we may disagree with then that somehow makes him bad at his job. People are far more complex than that, and he could cheat on his wife with 100 different women and still be a great politician. This is a private matter and entirely irrelevant. I find it just as disgusting as how papers used to out gay politicians for their 'immorality' on front pages.

It would seem mass media wants a politician to be all things to all people, which in itself leads to a distortion of our perception of their character, but we have to draw a line and that line is between public and private. 

If you caught him in a corrupt deal or abusing staff members etc. then that is a very important matter and that is in the public interest.

If the MP doesn't, then the story shows his character is essentially deceitful, and I think it is in the public interest to catch out MPs behaving deceitfully.

I don't buy the argument that a man who cheats on his wife is just as likely as anyone else to be corrupt - people who routinely break solemn oaths won't stop doing so just because the sphere of influence has changed from private to public.

I personally think you should be supported where you are immediately after you register (let's say you're suddenly out of work), but if you wish to claim more after a certain amount of time then you will be required to move to a cheaper area. It's tough, but in the end the family will be left with more money from the benefits to spend on the essentials. 

However, I imagine most people don't get anywhere near the cap. Jobseeker's Allowance, for example, pays £3,000 a YEAR. Add to that the cost of a one bedroom flat in a reasonably cheap area and the benefits still don't reach £10,000 in a year. 

I am shocked that such a large amount of people are complaining that someone, in perhaps the toughest time in their life, is receiving the equivalent of £1.63 per working hour. And that when a requirement is to make applying for work a full time job in itself (so we're not talking about slacking off and getting free money for it).  

Okay, so we can't spend half the entire GDP on benefits. But we need to take a bit more pride in helping our poorest and most vulnerable. We need to stop branding those working hard to find jobs, who themselves have paid their taxes and National Insurance, as 'work-shy scroungers' and instead look to see how we can further help people to get back on their feet.

No-one is claiming that no-one whatsoever is claiming fraudulently no matter how much you want to strawman on the subject. However, the data the DWP has is that payments made due to fraud and overpayment (the DWP bundles the two figures up together) is an absolutely tiny amount of the total benefits bill in percentage terms.  
  
Unfortunately, possibly due to the repeated rhetoric of certain segments of the media and particularly right-wing demagogues, the popular perception of the scale of benefit fraud and overpayment is that it is a far, far greater amount in percentage terms than is the reality.

With the delivery, you'd take it to the hospital with a member of the games developer and get a picture taken with the nurses/equipment we're donating. I can sort each step so that all you'd have to do is middle-man it. 

I'll reward you with some games - we have a lot of excess that we can't give to hospitals.

If you are interested in some kind of long term working arrangement with us, it would be useful to discuss that - this stuff is always good for the CV!

How about popping us an email and we're discuss further: getwellgamersuk@gmail.com

""And in those countries, outside of Germany, not huge amount of write home about.""

Plenty to write home about they just don't publish it in English which is why you won't tend to hear about it and see university ranking (bullshit) with them low down but UK and US universities high up.

""Problem is reserch is super expensive (essentially you pay people a fair bit in wages and other capital investment, for something that might net nothing""

Research is not very expensive alot of the time, for example a friend of mine is working on a lower cost project right now.

""People like to run the narrative that the system is fine and the country is in moral error not throwing money at it, but its not. Fundamentally we can focus back on the reserch and maybe issue more than 3 funded M.sc's per course (god damn, is M.sc funding fucked atm). Or we can accept that undergrad classes of 400-700 or what we want and accept that we need to focus on university as school+ and scale back on research. ""

Don't assume people think anything when your can't speak for 63 million people... sure some may agree with he changes and that's their opinion and they shpould have it but there are plenty who disagree. It would be great to focus on R&amp;D but I think (my own opinion) that we should stop being a cunt as a state to our poorest before we look elsewhere (no I'm not job seekers).

""TL;DR before yet another bitching session about UNIVERSITY EXPENSIVE, shall we as a country figure out what we actually want from the university system first? because the de facto state is 'pipeline for people to get more qualifications for qualifications sake'. Which is contrary to what universities were established to do (research).""

No universitys were established for a place of debate of philophy.. (didn't spell it right I know) and maths etc.. they were about debate and learning that way not research. You could argue that learning from other was research I suppose though.

Years 2, 3 and 4 for my course qualify for NHS funding. For a 5 year course, Years 5 and above qualify for NHS funding. The NHS pays around £3k towards the fees. There is a loan for the remainder.  

In addition, there is an NHS bursary, at least £1k during NHS-funded years. You can claim more if you live in London, earn less than certain amounts etc.. The maintenance loan entitlement decreases by £1k during these years.

I already have an undergraduate degree, so this is in addition to the £20k I owe already (managed to sneak in before the fee hikes). But it's all my own fault.

Nursing is entirely funded, and nursing students can be offered secondments and be supported by an NHS employer through their training, sometimes in exchange for working for them for a set period of time. Though this is becoming quite rare as trusts tighten their belts.

Interestingly paramedics don't receive any NHS funding for the new BSc courses. ",0,1412014734,null,0,false,0,ckvr48s,t3_2hrzdm,t1_ckvr48s,t1_ckvp1vy,null,1426766688,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- housing: if you do not have a car I recommend you live somewhere central or close to work as the public transportation isn't that great in MK. Most areas are OK to live in but I would definitely stay away from fishermead and netherfields in particular. For a one bed flat you're looking at somewhere between £600 and £800 depending on location and how nice the place is. You can find flats using www.rightmove.com and I would recommend having it viewed before moving in.

- banks: most banks have one branch in Milton Keynes and almost all of them are in or around the central shopping centre. If you've just moved to the country they'll ask for a variety of papers and documentation so I would just go with whoever asks for the least.

- transport: there's three train stations in MK so that's convenient. Busses are kind of a hassle and not very dependable. Your best bet is to have a car or a bike if you're living central and close to work - bike paths are every where!

- transition: it's a quiet-ish town and the night out is OK but nothing special. Restaurants are mostly chains but you'll find a few nice restaurants in the villages surrounding MK. There's a lot to do in terms of activities (skiing, adventure courses, wake boarding....).

""Welfare spending makes up a third of the entire government budget..."" 

True. That includes pensions. His very next sentence starts: ""We are going to live in a country where the elderly have dignity in retirement..."" 

So clearly he's not TOO concerned about welfare spending being a third of government spending as he's increasing the largest part of it. 

""We can't afford to live in [a country] where we spend £100bn on welfare payments on people of working age."" 

He is implying that the workshy bastards, the shirkers, *those people* are taking £100bn from the government. This is simply untrue. 

I urge you to have a look at the spreadsheets on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/benefit-expenditure-and-caseload-tables-2014) The Outturn and Forecast sheet for budget 2014 gives you a decent breakdown. 

Yes, total people of working age spending (on sheet 3) is £93.7bn this year. Table 1a breaks that down by benefit where we see Disability Living allowance is over 5 billion of that. Housing benefit, of which ~80% is paid to people who are in work (I would source it but I need to get my daughter to bed) makes up £23bn, winter fuel payments another 2bn... 

Job Seekers Allowance (which, I accept, is only one of the benefits we pay the unemployed, but it's the bills and food money assuming rent is covered completely which it rarely is)... JSA is 4.3 billion, of which 3.8bn is contributory, which means they are simply taking out what they've already payed in, which implies it's short-term unemployment. 

Which leaves us with the ""problem"" £530m, and I remain unconvinced that the way to deal with that line of the budget is to make them suffer.

My point is simply that his rhetoric does not match the numbers. 

I love that we live in a world where I can hear a politician say something that sounds a little off and look up the data for myself.

He determined that there with the same end goal in mind that any reasonably competent programmer would have been able to come up with a similarly different solution, and that Oracle had no claim.

Immigration from countries outside the EU should be controlled, but I would like to see more open borders between the the rest of the EU and the UK.  I think we have a better chance economically if we move toward the EU rather than the US, which, excluding Russia and China is our only other option. I see no problem with other Europeans living here on a temporary or permanent basis, just as I have enjoyed living and working in other countries.

Scary. It smacks at worst of the old National Front / current EDF and at best jingoism.  I can't think of a single instance in history where nationalism has lead to good things. Realistically this is all to do with image.  In the UK, flag waving has been the preserve of the extreme right wing for decades.  They own the brand now.

* As someone who's looked to go oversea or work in europe, i understand the needs of a country to have visa for a set skills and how it's harder than you think to relocate. EU open borders is interesting it has fair amount of pros and cons, i've known some skilled workers who have benefited and contributed fine, but i can see the risks of unskilled movement and resentment from unskilled workers here or taking too many skilled workers from a country and creating a job service hole there. I do like how it opens some people to other countries and cultures and that has huge benefit to society across the world, since issues we have usually comes from cultural isolation. I think both sides go ott in doom and utopia stories, i dislike UKIP because they only seem to sing the doom of immigration like it's 100% bad. Also majority of great things in England have come from immigrants bringing in new ideas, skills and good work ethic. Since it's huge deal to move country, leaving lot behind and costly i don't think many lazy people as some say would bother, it is usual done by the best and hard working people. Lot of benefits is limited to EU people, after 3 months you can only get jsa and not housing benefits, and it's not enough to live on luxury. 
Also its good way to get taxes from skilled work if there's shortage in certain sectors, for me long as people pay into the system of a country they shouldn't be adding any strains but boosting it if the tax and budgets are balanced. Lot go home after a while and can use money and new skills to improve business in their home country or if they stay after few generations no one notices or cares they're british now. I would be more happy for reforms if there was still open borders in the EU, but some reforms to address the negatives which causes lot of over heated immigration hatred. I've read about immigration from Victorian era and it is funny how complaints on too many, British jobs for British, cultural clashes/fear of violence has always dogged immigration with every generation and yet the doomsday never comes. What started off and different gets absorbed into what some fight for as britishness later on. 

* I only like things to be PC if it taking away something which was used to push someone down for their identity and bully is made more superior with the put down or the harassment. Of course people can still say what they want, but i can say they're being a bigoted idiot back if it's offensive to me or others.

 * its not needed all year round, unless you're a lord or the queen we don't need to see a statement of nationalism no one really cares. 

* They are getting too the same i do blame how parties are funded, they're all appealing to the same lobbyist imo it's dark side of capitalism in politics, it sucks life soul out a party it becomes business rather than ideals. But to be fair we had a bad economic crash and everyone's following the same plan, which is to be a bit middle and right politically to recover some money. Maybe that's why they all seem to be the same. I'm disappointed in labour and lib dems, but tories are doing their usually thing they pretend to have changed but they're the same as always. There are problems in Westminster but Farage is playing the same game and just bluffing that he isn't. It's strongest card he has in the election game as leader of a smaller party than the other three at the moment. Greens and lib dems used it too, its a vote getter statement for a new party fighting for seats against the regulars.

false,Physics98,cnty-scotland,Edinburgh,"* I think that, in the modern world, we do need a free and open society where people can move freely with minimal hindrance from country to country. I think that immigration is a fantastic thing as a vast majority of foreign nationals come here to work and pay taxes as is their right. Of course there will always be those who will attempt to come here and cheat the system but they are in a *very* small minority. I think that current levels of control over immigration are a tad harsh but I respect the fact that the UK does face a slightly more elevated security risk compared to some other EU countries. That being said, I hope that in the long run we will be able to abolish border control altogether in line with most other EU nations, as unlikely as it may seem in the current climate.

* Political correctness is an odd one, nowadays it has gone a little over the top to the point where almost anything you say could be considered derogatory in some way. I don't think that it is a big issue but it'd be nice if people were slightly more able to speak without having to think twice if something could be considered as offensive. At the end of the day, it's up to the individual regarding how politically correct they want things to be. In my experience, people are generally quite lenient with it and don't take offence. Just as long as you aren't being racist or attempting to be hurtful in your comments, it isn't something to worry about.

* I don't have a problem with people expressing their pride for their nation with a flag or something else. If they want to do that then that is their decision and I would respect that. Although many people think that nationalism is dangerous, I disagree. I don't see anything wrong with being proud of who you are and where you come from. Ultimately, as long as you are humble, and don't boast or become arrogant or ignorant because of your nationality then by all means feel proud. As long as you don't offend anyone else with your nationality or views then there is no problem. I am proud of being Scottish, but that does not give me the right to belittle others because they are not.

* The political state of affairs in the UK is something which I find concerning. Labour, Lib Dems and the Tories are not really impressive choices. The parties have somewhat converged although they do still maintain a few differences. The problem is that the main parties are losing the hearts and minds of their voters. The Lib Dems have destroyed themselves in the coalition after pandering (in good faith at times) to the Tories and failing to follow up on some of their key policies. Labour are just not cutting the mustard at times, Ed Miliband doesn't really seem like PM material and Labour are all over the place, especially in Scotland where they are collapsing at quite a speed following the referendum. A void which will be filled by the SNP and the Greens. The Tories just seem too arrogant and unrelatable to so many people. David Cameron, and the rest of his party just aren't seen as likeable by many, and the austerity in government will not have done them any favours. I do find the rise of UKIP concerning, but I agree that the 3 'big' parties have converged somewhat, but not completely as Farage has said.",0,1412017297,null,0,false,0,ckvsh6z,t3_2ht4rp,t1_ckvsh6z,t3_2ht4rp,null,1426766023,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Correct, that's how public spending works. Ironically, in many cases the stagnating wages and increased benefit spending is linked, because working benefits essentially means we are all subsidising sub-standard pay.

Spurs ended up filing 2 complaints to the Premier League board that Man U and Liverpool were breaking rules regarding contacting players in the transfer process of Berbatov and Keane.

 [This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7514933.stm) explains it, Premier League rule K3 states ""Any Club which by itself, by any of its official makes an
approach either directly or indirectly to a Contract Player shall be
in breach of these Rules”. 

Rule K5 is basically the opposite where if you're a player on a contract at a club, you can't just go to other clubs and start negotiating terms, contracts and transfer without getting the permission from the club you're on contract to, unless you're on the last remaining days of your contract.

Anyway Spurs felt that Liverpool were breaking those rules but then eventually a formal bid and transfer happened. Liverpool even donated to a charity Spurs have and publicly apologized for their behavior in the whole situation.

Levy issued a statement coinciding with the confirmation of the Keane transfer:

""I was incredibly disappointed when I first heard, not only that Liverpool had been working behind the scenes to bring Robbie to Anfield, but that Robbie himself wanted to go and he submitted a transfer request to this effect. I have already made my opinion clear on the nature of this transaction. I don't regard it as a transfer deal – that is something which happens between two clubs when they both agree to trade – this is very much an enforced sale, for which we have agreed a sum of £19m as compensation plus a potential further £1.3m in additional compensation.""

It was a very rough situation.


Despite all that(as well as the sale of Berbatov, Kaboul and other crucial players) Spurs were still pretty damn bitter and it didn't help the first half of the season they were plagued with a shit ton of injuries and poor form, they were 0-2-6 until the end of October. 

When Keane was set to return back to Spurs, he brought up how ""the move wasn't the right one, he didn't click in Rafa's set up, and how his family wasn't crazy about the area"".

Personally I feel like he felt pretty bad/guilty leaving  Spurs and seeing them in such rough shape, after all he was a bit of a iconic hero for them. Also the whole controversy around his move might have added to him feeling a bit worse. I mean he wasn't a bad fit for the team or constantly in risk for play time, there was just a lot hanging over his head and bad blood all around.

""Geez, it annoys me how much people put into pointless civilities like these..why is everyone obsessed with formality, seriously? The match was close to an end, there was a stoppage in play, next kick would sound the whistle.

Arguing about whether or not 'it's proper'.. He can do whatever he wants, an early exit doesn't hurt anyone.

Do people realize that we are talking about whether or not someone felt disrespected because another person didn't shake hands 10 seconds later? Sounds outright silly."" 

Civilities, to be blunt, are stupid and incredibly outdated and at times, dishonest. Are our collective egos so fragile that if a boss doesn't hear a good morning out of *everyone* he'll be offended? A handshake literally before the last kick of the match is disrespectful?

People's reaction to something so pointless is what frustrates me. Pointless formalities just make our world more dishonest and diplomatic, directly or indirectly. This is what breeds ass-kissers. 

I think it depends on the opposing manager. People choose to feel disrespected over something like this. Flipping the bird, that's disrespectful. An early shake hand? Man, maybe he wanted to take a leak, you wanna stop a man from his natural urges for a handshake?!

This scene from House M.D says it all- 
Cameron: It is so wrong for them to want to have a normal child? It's normal to want to be normal.

House: Spoken like a true Circle Queen. See, skinny, socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle. Everyone inside the circle is normal. Everyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken, and reset, so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized, or worse, pitied.

Cameron: So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?

House: Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere, and therefore degrading? This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain, or your excretions or your grandma's itchy place. Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties? I don't pity this kid. I envy him. That last line of House's is one of my all-time favorite lines. It's just so House, in a nutshell

In essence, pointless attempts to please each others' egos even though people know that a particular formality is being done for the sake of it is lying to ourselves. And forcing ourselves to lie to ourselves..is pathetic, isn't it?

Benefits are supposed to be a safety net for the poor, not a system to top up the wages of people who don't need it.

At the end of 2012 the number of people claiming JSA was 2.5million. At this same time there were 11.6million people claiming a state pension, and another 11.6 million people claiming disability living allowance.

The only one of those that is means tested is JSA. We are paying out billions every year to people who don't need it because we don't means test the other two groups, because those groups are massive voting blocks.

Pensions are by far the largest drain on the benefits bill, and nothing is done about it because to do anything to change pensions is an easy way to get yourself voted out of office.

The government have been trying to help in the past couple of years in the new scheme that requires all employers to enrol employees into a pension scheme, but this doesn't go far enough. Unless we see some serious changes to the pensions system, they (the government) are either going to cut benefits far more for younger people to further fund the pension pot, or the pensions system is going to collapse in around 20 years time.

A lot of people like to complain about young people on benefits sitting on their arse doing nothing but collecting government money, but when you reach a pensionable age it suddenly becomes perfectly fine to do just that, even if they don't need the money.

Also, keep in mind, although it's a 60/40 split in 20 years for people alive now, the majority of people who'll be dead in 20 years will be British/protestant and the majority of people who'll take their place will be Irish/catholic. This means that in 20 years it'll be a lot closer than 60/40.

Also, the pro-union side won't be able to use the same scare tactics as they did for the Scotland referendum. Ireland will be a country that's over 100 years old. Economists will be able to give us a pretty good idea of the economics of a united Ireland. In fact, reuniting what should be a natural economic zone would spell a greater deal of prosperity for both communities.

It'll be made mandatory for certain claimants; The Government will roll out some poor sods who'll be pressured to volunteer for it, and praise it as the second coming, then it'll quietly die away.

Its in the [New Forest National park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Forest) which allows free roam of horses, cows, donkeys and pigs so often you will see them wandering around the high street. 

Brockenhurst is a busy junction on the Mainline (train), So significant number of the population are commuters. 

I believe there is only one cricket club, which has a pitch in front of the [balmer lawn hotel](http://www.balmerlawnhotel.com/). 

At New park (about a mile north) they have regular Polo matches which are fun to watch. And every year New Park hosts the [New Forest Show](http://www.newforestshow.co.uk/), which adds to the traffic. 


**Pubs include :**

[The Forester's Arms](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g190805-d3263304-Reviews-Foresters_Arms-Brockenhurst_New_Forest_National_Park_Hampshire_England.html): good ale and quite cosy. It can get very busy towards the end of the year when the Sixth form students (16-18) hit drinking age. 

[The Snake Catcher](http://www.thesnakecatcher.co.uk/): Named after a guy called Brusher Mills who was famous for catching snakes in the forest, good pub and decent enough food. The pool table has a lot of room so its good for a quiet game. Garden is nice when the weather is. 

[The Rose and Crown](http://roseandcrownbrockenhurst.com/): Also a hotel, lovely garden which is only hurt by the main road next to it, and good enough beer, very close to the college but im not sure if they ban students but isn't used by them. 

**Bike Hire**

Brockenhurst is basically the cycling capital of the New Forest and its where a lot of the races start its also has two cycling hire companies, both extremely close to the station.  I had my own bike when i lived there so i can't vouch for the quality of the hire bikes. 

[Cycle Experience](http://www.cyclex.co.uk/) : The Largest cycle hire shop in Brockenhurst, They have two sites, one is for bike purchase and repair, the other on the other side of the station is for hire.  

[Country Lanes](http://www.countrylanes.co.uk/index.php): Country Lanes is situated on the far side of the train tracks from the village. It is placed very close to the hire place for cycle experience (or vice versa i don't know who was there first) so that can cause confusion. 





PS : If you have any other questions i don't mind answering them, i visit a lot as my parents and many of my childhood friends still live in the area.

This is really top notch stuff by Gary. 

And to add on, I'm surprised they didn't pick up on another thing that happened with Mignolet against Everton. Ball is played through, Skrtel doesn't have anyone close to him, so he is screening the ball for Mignolet to come out and simply pick it up, but Mignolet just simply refuses to come off his line, he stands there for a good 5 seconds, until Naismith starts pressuring Skrtel, and it ends up with Skrtel having to knock it out for a throw. Skrtel screamed at Migs for a good while after that. I don't know, Mignolet just doesn't seem to have the confidence from his defence, and he isn't able to control his box, and both things are huge NO's for a modern goalkeeper. If Valdes doesn't work out, we might be buying a goalie in maybe even January.

*What do you think of controlled immigration?

My heart tells me we shouldn't worry much about borders unless invading armies arrive; if people just want to move from one place to another for work and a better life, then let them. They'll grow the economy, pay tax and probably spend the money in the UK.

My head tells me that for the sake of forward planning, we should at least be measuring immigration and ideally be prioritising the skills we need. But we've had a tiered and points-based system since 2008, so I don't understand why people are still using the phrase ""open door"". It is not an open door, and hasn't been for at least six years.

I think the use of net migration as a target is stupid, because it's affected so much by changes in emigration. Now that people aren't retiring to Spain like they were, it makes the net migration figures look frightening. But net migration is really useful as a tool for demographic planning, not a basis for policy.

I think there should be free movement of labour around the EU, and the impact of the A2 countries is quite small. I don't hear so many  complaints about Western Europeans from France or Germany, so the fuss about Eastern Europeans does have a tang of racism.

&gt;
*What is your opinion on political correctness? 

I thought the point of political correctness was to point out that behind some disparaging language was a disparaging attitude - and attitudes needed to change. There is an insidious Newspeak feeling to  the notion that you can change the way people think by changing the words they use - but I thought it was essentially like pointing out to Grandad that we don't say ""wog"" any more, not becoming Airstrip One.

I think it's been distorted by the Right and the Left: by the Right as a scapegoat for every idea they don't like; by the Left as an excuse for paralysis, tiptoeing round things instead of confronting them in the spirit of free speech.

A little political correctness isn't so bad; it gets more blame than it deserves.

&gt;
*What is your opinion on people who have flagpoles/flags in their gardens?

I assume they're proud of their nation. But I find national pride a bit odd. There are other nations (more accurately, people of other nations) I feel good about too. I don't see why this one deserves special praise just because it's the one I happened to be born in.

*Farage has said before that he thinks the 3 main parties are basically the same.

Well, Farage knows there are ideological differences between them, so he's being a bit sneaky when he says that.

What he's trying to say is that his party is the only one offering anything different, which is untrue.

In fact, I see UKIP as the isolationist splinter group of the Conservative Party. UKIP has more in common with Cameron's party than Farage is prepared to admit.

Labour, in spite of Blair's influence, is still fiscally further left than the Tories, with more inclination to taxation and spending. I wish they'd have the guts to admit it, because it's not _necessarily_ a bad thing. It just depends on your point of view.

If the US decided to cut off Chinese trade tomorrow, you'd have about a year of things being more expensive that usual, and subsidies from the government to offset that, then things would normalize because business always finds a way (Probably India). China however would be so irrevocably damaged they would loose the right to call themselves a major world power. China thrives because American businesses like the fact that slave labor is essentially legal in China. As for the Chinese using force to retake HK, Japan and Taiwan would immediately call for military action and stronger international military presence in their region, and Japan has considerably more world influence than Ukraine does, especially with the US. What the US gets from China is cheap toys and IPads. But everything from game consoles to TVs to cars comes from Japan, who has considerably more political and trade influence with the US and elsewhere. If Japan felt threatened, you'd better believe the world would more than take that seriously. Not to mention an aggressive China is going to worry *both* Koreas, and India. India is especially bad for China to worry, as India has one of the few militaries that can go toe-to-toe with China on a numbers basis and possibly come out on top. Add in the fact that India has reliable nuclear SRBMs and you have something that China has to worry quite a bit about. Not to mention that an agressive China could worry Pakistan as well, maybe even enough to side with India in a conflict, which then adds Pakistan's nuclear SRBMs into the equation. We haven't even started on the fact that the relationship between China and Russia has been slowly deteriorating, and despite the fact that China is probably doing what it's doing because it feels emboldened by what happened with Ukraine, the Russians are more than willing to call out the Chinese.

Basically, China could be really screwed if they decide to recapture HK. *BUT* a lot of that hinges on the US not being lead by a wild pack of spineless fools who refuse to take any kind of action that could potentially represent them in a bad light with someone.

There is no reason not to wait until the final whistle.

If Mourinho did this only a couple times randomly nobody would care because its such a small thing. But if you do it constantly it shows that it *matters* to you, for some reason.

Poland has free education at all levels, and ranks in the top 10 of the world [according to Pearson](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27314075) (UK is 6). Nevertheless, salaries are low in Poland, and many of its university graduates emmigrate. It is much easier for the well educated to emigrate, because they are more likely to speak foreign languages like German and English, have slightly smaller transaction costs than the very poor, and have more to gain by moving abroad. Overall, 20% of poles have a bachelor's degree or higher, while [more than 40%](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-1615575/Special-report-Finance-for-Poles-in-Britain.html) of those who emigrated to the UK have the same qualifications. These people now earn, pay their income tax, and spend their money abroad. 

This means that largely, despite being poorer, Poland is subsidising a good number of qualified workers in Germany, the UK, Ireland, and the rest of Europe. The economy of Poland suffers the double blow of having to pay for education and not receiving its benefits. 

This is not to say that free trade with Europe does not benefit Poland, its volume of trade with the EU is equivalent to 40% of its GDP, its largest trading partner by far is Germany. A great part of Polands economic success is due to access Europe's capital markets. But in terms of labour, Emigration hurts the Polish state more than it helps it.

The cash thing is intresting. From my perspective and yours too by the looks of it, not only did I save cash on fuel/tax/parking, I also saved maybe £3k on not buying a 2nd car and all the added tax year on year that comes with owning a 2nd car.

---
&gt;
&gt;The Valeyard claimed that he was created during a period when the thirteenth incarnation of the Doctor was experimenting with ways to break the twelve-regeneration limit imposed on Time Lords by Rassilon. The Valeyard was created as a Time Tot on a mud planet orbiting Etarho. At the age of four the Valeyard was found wandering the mud swamps of the planet by a group of scavengers, who gave him something to eat. When they learned what race the Valeyard belonged to, the scavengers sent him to Gallifrey.
&gt;The Time Lords examined the Valeyard's biodata and found that it was an exact match for that of the Doctor's. Knowing that this meant that the Valeyard was a temporal anomaly, they sent the Valeyard to a Shadow House. In the Shadow House the Valeyard met a Time Lord who had been damaged due to temporal interventions by his future self and therefore had his regeneration permanently stuck in a paradox. The man told the Valeyard to study the science of regeneration, in order to gain revenge on the Time Lords for what they had done to every member of the Shadow House.

A few more tips for anyone thinking about it:

- Get yourself some full mudguards. They look a bit naff, but they keep the shit on the road off your feet and back when it rains. SKS are good.

- Get a decent set of lights, and some of those little reflective things for your wheels. The most common way to hit a car is when some berk turns or pulls across you, so visibility is better.

- Don't buy a £100 special from Argos, Halfords or Tesco. They're heavy and shit to ride. If you don't have much cash, buy second hand. Just like cars, a good second hand bike will run forever, and it's so much cheaper than new!

false,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt; Hello! Hope you've had time to try the new makeup by now!

I mixed the green of the Makeup Revolution Eyes Like Angels with a gold from my Naked2 today (an idea stolen from a mate). Initial impressions of the Angels quality: YUK. It's a 32 shade palette so I guess they used cheaper products for it than for the Iconic 3. The packaging is gorgeous though. My eye primer has gone walkies. I can get away with it with Urban Decay, but clearly not some cheaper eyeshadows. It was fine once I mixed the gold in though. [Crappy pic](https://i.imgur.com/rOvqWgo.jpg) taken for another Redditor to show her the darkness of the Artliner eyeliner (she was worried it would soak up the eyeshadow, but the stuff applies like non-sticky tar). 

First impressions of the new Sleek mascara - urgh. But then it often takes three or four applications until the product settles down. And nothing can possibly be worse than Benefit's They're Real handbag sized mascara, which is the only mascara I've ever returned out of disgust. 

Yay for boozy weekends! It was a bit too boozy here this weekend and both uncle and I have promised to lay off it this week. That said, auntie is away next weekend, so boozehavoc may happen if the two of us are left to our own devices. 

How's the YSL? [This](http://www.boots.com/en/LOreal-Paris-False-Lash-Flutter-Mascara_1305566/) is my bestest non-premium mascara, mainly because the brush is absolutely amazing. Speaking of which, have you ever heard of people transferring a mascara into a different bottle? If I could, I'd transfer the Sleek to the L'Oreal bottle. 

I spent a long time talking makeup to my aunt on Saturday and she went out and bought herself all the things I told her about, which is really nice, as she's nearly 50 and she's only just learning about makeup through me. Sort of makes it feel as though my passion is worth the effort when it makes other people happy.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Whats the code like behind this? Just a frame with x/y co-ordinates and recalling the paint method when the ball moves? 

Pretty much. Each of the balls/holes has it's own vector which is just an x and a y coordinate. The program then updates each of the objects on the screen and checks the distance between their vectors to determine if there has been a collision or not. The game just constantly keeps updating the objects and redrawing them at 60 fps. The most complex part is determining the direction the balls should move if they collide with the white ball.

&gt; How do you deal with randomising the other balls? 

It depends on the game mode. Infinite mode just has a ball counter which increases by 1 every time a new ball spawns. The ball is yellow or red ball depending on whether the ball counter is currently odd or even. The timed mode generates a random number between 0-6 which then determines the colour of the ball. In the snooker mode the game just runs through an array of numbers set up so the balls spawn in the order you would need to get a max break eg. red, black red etc. then the colours at the end.

The source code is simple enough but because it's my first game I imagine I made it more complex than it had to be! Do you program yourself?

I can see why you are confused but this is what I meant when I said there's a difference between ""guidance"" and ""law"".

It's the same as the highway code: if it says ""must"" it's law, if it says ""should"" it's best practice but cannot necessarily be enforced legally.  Para 39 says the govt ""expect"" these rules to be followed, but that's not the same as saying they ""must"" be followed.

In fact the doc even says this bluntly (para 49):

&gt; This camera signing, visibility and conspicuity guidance has no bearing on the
&gt; enforcement of offences. Non-compliance with this guidance does not provide any mitigation of, or defence for, an alleged offence committed under current UK law.

The only ""must"" in this context is in para 43 which refers only to signage, not to the cameras themselves.

So as a general principle the govt recommend that cameras should be painted yellow etc, but the doc you've provided is very clear that this is not required by law and (by extension) motorists cannot rely on the absence of a yellow camera to avoid speeding tickets (which is what you claimed).",0,1412023554,null,0,1412026425,0,ckvvzlu,t3_2hiiea,t1_ckvvzlu,t1_ckvviiu,null,1426764385,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

To put it into perspective before the war (WWII) about 10,000 people were attending university. Last year there were just shy of half a million.

&gt; Poland - that ex-Warsaw Pact world-beater - continued its run up the charts of the past decade, earning spots in the top 10 in reading (10) and science (9), and a strong performance in math (14).

&gt; It outperformed much wealthier countries, from Britain to Sweden, across the board, and even nudged out the Canadians in science. This is from a country that in the early 1990s had one of the lowest participation rates in secondary education among OECD countries.

http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/02/poland-europes-new-university-destination

&gt; Higher education is highly valued in Poland and around 80% of graduates go on to study to master's level.

If you can't keep up with technology you should face the consequences. Convert the high street into things you can't get online, have restaurants, museums, the like. Make the high street a cultural experience not a commercial one. (Although the two are not mutually exclusive, obviously.)

Also, extremely pro-EU, and pro-immigration. The arguments I hear a lot, at least around my area is,

A. They're taking the jobs from hard-working people  
B. They come here, take our benefits.

My response to 'A' is, do your job better. Make it so your company *has* to employ you. If someone comes to your country, doesn't speak you language and can take your job then you're a shit employee.  
My response to 'B' is, they're entitled to come here, you are entitled to go there. I would much rather not sacrifice my right to free travel through the EU and the right to reside anywhere in the EU and cope with a few people who come here and exploit the system.

Also for people who are against immigrants I ask them, could you imagine leaving your home country where your ancestors are (probably) from, most likely leave behind your family to come and work in a country where most people don't want you, you can barely speak the language all to send money home to your family so they can live a better life. They're being extremely selfless in doing that and all I ask people is to put yourself in their shoes, it's be scary and you probably wouldn't want to do it.
