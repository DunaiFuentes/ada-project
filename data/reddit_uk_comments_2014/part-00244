He has the ability to be one if the best number 9s in Europe, but he doesn't have the mentality to be consistent and make it to that height.

He's someone who makes great runs off the shoulder of the last man, has good pace and strength, great balance and first touch. A good finisher, strikes the ball as sweetly as anyone with great technique.

But it's intermittent. He rarely plays to his potential, or even 70% of it. Consistency is not his thing.

You'll get a lot of half arsed performances, some sulking, but some great goals.

Some of Balotelli's best performances in a City shirt came on the big occasions. He tends to rise to them, with a desire to prove himself.

But equally this can lead to him getting frustrated and being a complete liability.

To put it simply, you never know what you're going to get.

I like Mario, but I wouldn't want him back at City. I'm not sure he'd make a great signing for Liverpool either given his baggage and inconsistency.

But if he turned his entire career around, and fulfilled his potential, he'd be an incredible signing - for any team. But make no mistake, that is an astronomical 'if'. The likelihood of it happening reflected by how few clubs are in for him.

&gt;

&gt;On 19 April, four days after the disaster, [Kelvin MacKenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie), editor of *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom\))*, a British [red-top tabloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format\)#Red_top_tabloids) newspaper with national distribution owned by [Rupert Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch), used ""THE TRUTH"" as the front page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims"", ""Some fans urinated on the brave cops"" and ""Some fans beat up [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable) giving [kiss of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_respiration)"".

&gt;The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.   *The Daily Express* also carried Patnick's version, under the headline ""Police Accuse Drunken Fans"" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the ""mayhem caused by drunks"" and that policemen told him they were ""hampered, harassed, punched and kicked"". 

&gt;The story accompanying the *Sun* headlines claimed ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"".  These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.

If you work full-time on minimum wage you pay just over £400 tax a year. That's so little as to be negligible.

Also, as you point out - they make national insurance contributions. If they then lose their job, they've paid in to the JSA fund and they should be entitled to that money without being forced to work for free while trying to find a job that will once again pay them minimum wage and allow them to continue paying in to the system.

In a business like this, the whole thing is a chess match, misdirection, leverage, etc. With so-called 'information' being leaked by managers, club officials, agents, players, etc. And the way one speaks about a player differs from situation to situation, player to player.

Let's take the Mario Balotelli situation for example:

* If Rodgers is confident and says: 'Yes, we're going after Mario Balotelli. He's our man.'

Then what happens? AC Milan knows LFC wants Balotelli so they can continue to string us along to get the best fee possible. Say, after this statement, we *don't* get Balotelli? Then it's: Rodgers over-played his hand; Ian Ayre is a shit negotiator; Supporters are let down; Rivals are saying, Liverpool can't attract the top players, etc. etc.

* If Rodgers is on the fence and says: 'Balotelli is one of many options we are looking at.'

That still gives up leverage to AC Milan. That still raises expectations.

* If Rodgers says: 'I can categorically tell you Mario Balotelli will not be at Liverpool.'

Then no one thinks anything of it. LFC plays it cool and tells AC Milan, sure, we'd like Balotelli for this much (our valuation), AC Milan says no, he's worth more. Then we can shrug our shoulders and say, fine, you keep him, we didn't want him anyway. *If* we do get Balotelli? It's a coup. Ayre and Rodgers look like geniuses, supporters get to see the crazy and talented Balotelli run wild.

---

Personally, I'm of the belief that if there is smoke there is fire. So, at the very very least, *something* is happening.

I love Brendan Rodgers, I trust in Brendan Rodgers to do what is best for the club. But in the transfer window Rodgers is constantly making business decisions. He's playing chess with other clubs. He is playing smart politics. So, I don't think one can read a statement like his original statement on Balotelli and then clap your hands and say, 'Welp. That's that on Balotelli.'

And, of course, as the transfer window dies down, circumstances change, someone eventually blinks in the standoff.

As I said before, comments said during a transfer window cannot be seen as black and white. What Rodgers said could be true. Or it could be false. But that's the game.",0,1408591073,null,0,false,0,cjw6zoy,t3_2e4iwy,t1_cjw6zoy,t3_2e4iwy,null,1435353377,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I suggest that you come and visit the United States, where you will witness no change in your own lifestyle. Don't look toward the United States as anything lesser than that which it should be seen as, a beacon of freedom, opportunity, and one of the most advanced nations in human history.

Also, having a video is great, but I do think there needs to be text first.  What if your visitor is at work? What if they prefer reading instead of watching a video?  If your template supports a slider where the video is, I would have positioning text as the first slide, then make a button that says ""watch the video"" that takes you to the next slide.  

I've worked with a bunch of startups in a marketing analytics role and right now, your main goal is getting traction with user signups and retaining those users.  I would HIGHLY recommend Dave McClure's Startup Marketing for Pirates.  It's the best crash course out there for learning about the customer lifecycle and how each stage really makes a difference in your success.

Right now, I bet you are getting a decent amount of clicks but few signups (clicks from here do not count as marketing this way is inefficient).  

You have something like 3 seconds to capture a new website visitor's attention.  You need an attention grabbing headline in 3-5 words then a supporting subheadline with 8-12 words.  Then have a sign up button in the most prominent position on the page and keep it there.  Then test, test, test.  Use A/B testing and test the layout, the content, the colors, and how to implement photos/videos.

I would love to help you out in any way, especially with how you can implement analytics.  Good luck!

Both of them as head writers aren't that amazing but in terms of vision for a bigger story I think Moffat is better. There was a more cohesive tone or atmosphere with his run than with Davies.

You acknowledge that the Islamic world *was* competitive in knowledge production for a time - in fact, it was pretty much the global center of scientific understanding and development while Europe was a shithole. How, then, can you claim that the ideology of Islam holds people back from knowledge?

Fact is, many Middle Eastern countries have poor economies and weak governments. Schooling systems are undeveloped, etc. That's not a Muslim thing, that issue is present in most countries in the world. So because of a lot of the Muslim-majority countries have poor education, it logically follows that the amount of Muslims who achieve Nobel prizes is disproportionately small.

Furthermore, ask any Muslim what their religion says about science and learning. I think you'll be surprised.

Obviously, the two men had a lot more to do than to focus solely on Suarez, and obviously Suarez has some atypical behavior out there, but things still happened even after Dr. Peters had arrived.

I do think Rodgers is FANTASTIC since he's been in charge, and I'm only happy that he's at Liverpool. He managed Suarez's tantrum(s) really well, and has coached the players we all adore into a cohesive and brilliant unit. I just don't know that it's okay to turn a blind eye to all that Balotelli has done in his past, with this odd notion that he'll be wrangled in by two men who have a lot of other shit to deal with.

&gt;As of March 2014 [update], there are 97 episodes unaccounted for from 26 serials, including 10 full serials. By far the majority of the missing episodes are from seasons 3, 4 and 5, which have a total of 79 episodes currently missing. Of the 26 serials which comprised seasons 3-5, only five (*[The Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ark_(Doctor_Who\))*, *[The Gunfighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gunfighters)*, and *[The War Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Machines)* from season 3, and *[The Tomb of the Cybermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomb_of_the_Cybermen)* and *[The Enemy of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemy_of_the_World)* from season 5) exist in their entirety in the TV archives, leaving a total of 21 with at least one episode missing. By contrast, seasons 1, 2, and 6 have only 18 episodes missing in total from a total of 5 serials, with 19 of them complete. All but three of the missing stories have clips of various lengths surviving from different sources, with *[Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(Doctor_Who\))*, ""[Mission to the Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_to_the_Unknown)"", and *[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Massacre_of_St_Bartholomew%27s_Eve)* having no surviving footage whatsoever. While the Patrick Troughton era has more episodes missing (53 as compared to 44 for the William Hartnell era), there are more Hartnell stories completely missing (6 as compared to 4). Stories highlighted   in red  are missing all episodes, while stories   in green  are substantially complete, missing fewer than 50% of their episodes.

Here - some sources which back up an argument that banks would be under pressure to relocate (I should note at this point that I am a Yes voter, so while I think this is a part of the argument, it isn't ultimately the most important):


**The Weir Report (April 2014) by Oxford Economics:**
in full: http://www.weir.co.uk/media/85604/INDEPENDENCE-REPORT.pdf

Key Excerpt: 

&gt;2.7.1 ""Higher sovereign funding costs for a newly independent Scotland would be of significant concern for banks. The Eurozone experience has shown the close relationship between sovereign and bank funding costs within currency unions, particularly during periods of financial stress. The reasons for this are intuitively clear: when banking system liabilities are either explicitly or implicitly seen as being back-stopped by national governments, the risk involved with lending to the one will inevitably track the risks in lending to the other.


&gt;But there are other more immediate transmission mechanisms for the spillover of sovereign funding costs. Banks’ holdings of domestic sovereign debt expose them to rising bond yields in the form of falls in the value of that debt. That, in turn can curtail banks’ scope to lend, with consequences for the wider economy. If Scottish banks were required to hold large amounts of Scottish debt – something that might help with sovereign funding costs35 – they could be very exposed to the likely rise in government funding costs under any of the currency arrangements discussed here.


&gt;IMF research, for example, has attempted to quantify the degree of the spillover between sovereign and bank borrowing costs in Italy during the Eurozone crisis. This suggests that when sovereign spreads rise by one percentage point, domestic banks’ borrowing costs increase by between 0.15 and 0.2 percentage points. This scale of spill-over is comparable with other estimates. With sovereign bond spreads in Italy ranging between about one and five percentage points above German Bunds for the past five years, this rate of spillover implies significant increases in funding costs for banks based in those countries.


&gt;Moreover, it appears that the risk premium attached to the sovereign where a bank is domiciled can even raise funding costs for that bank’s overseas subsidiaries. HM Treasury has cited Santander UK – the UK subsidiary of the Spanish bank – as illustrative of this effect.


&gt;Consequently, for banks currently domiciled in Scotland, if independence were to involve any sustained funding cost disadvantage, it would likely raise the possibility that they would reconsider their location.""


**Moody's rating analysis brief May 2014**
in full: https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Scottish-independence-unlikely-to-have-rating-implications-for-UK--PR_298421


Key Excerpt:


&gt; Moody's says that Scotland's credit profile would almost certainly be consistent with an investment grade rating. While there are significant uncertainties associated with Scottish arrangements post-independence, an 'A' rating is perhaps the most likely at the outset, but with risks tilted to the downside. Over time, greater clarity over (and confidence in) Scotland's institutional structure and measures to address longer-term fiscal issues could make higher rating levels attainable.


(This compares with the UK's current Aa1 rating and so suggests higher wholesale borrowing costs for Scottish Banks. The UK's Aa1 rating would be unlikely to be affected by Independence).


**NIESR - Scotland's Lender of Last Resort Options (August 2014)**
in full: http://niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dp434v2.pdf


Key Excerpt:
&gt;We expect that RBS and Lloyds would take a commercial approach about where to have their registered offices and headquarters. First, banks are rated on a standalone basis together with the strength of the fiscal back-stop of the country in which they are incorporated in. The lower expected credit rating of an independent Scotland suggests the risk is toward higher funding costs which would be passed on to borrowers. This may raise competitiveness concerns. Second, the banks will need to assess whether customers north and south of the border would prefer deposit insurance ultimately back-stopped by the UK or Scottish governments. Third, the costs and challenges of dealing with two sets of regulators would be likely to be significant. Fourth, the Prudential Regulatory Authority is likely to require an systemically important bank carrying out its business is sterling to be based in the UK. This would be necessary to protect the integrity of the sterling payments system. Finally, the UK government owns an 82% and 24.9% stakes in RBS and Lloyds respectively. The regulatory and commercial interests both suggests that at least the two government part-owned banks would re-domicile into the rest of the UK. The banks could open branches or subsidiaries or even divest their Scottish operations. Other UK banks would be free to compete on a branch or subsidiary basis.

What's Reddit general view on this? Everyone seems to oppose this article. Are they opposing the idea that ""we should discriminate against people with tattoos""? I can't tell what is hate for the argument and what is hate for the article/author. I agree that the article is pretty crappy.

I don't think we *should* discriminate against people with tattoos, but I don't think people should be protected from the repercussions of their own adult decisions. Generally, an employer should have the right to conduct their business how they wish. The exception to this would be if it's something the person cannot help (e.g. disability, race etc.) If they wish their business to have their customer facing staff who are perceived as more professional, they should be well within their rights to sack someone or turn them down who made the choice to get a tattoo, if they believe that tattoo doesn't promote the professional image they're looking for.

The alternative is that other people should be forced to employ someone who isn't suitable for the job (as part of the job maybe to present a professional image). This would, in some way, be because that candidate isn't willing to accept the responsibilities and repercussions of their decisions.

We can argue ""but tattoo's are an a personal expression of identity that should be protected as personal freedom"". 1) Freedom is a 2 way street - people should be free to choose to get tattoos, but other people should be free to not employ someone because of their decisions in life. 2) What if I said covering myself in faeces is part of my identity and self expression - does that mean an employer shouldn't be able to discriminate against me, despite me being covered in poop 24/7?

I agree that our width should come from our wing backs but 1. They need to be fit to track up and down. (Byram and Taylor could be a pairing worth looking at). 2.

Shortly after birth, a mother would bathe her child in wine to see whether the child was strong. If the child survived it was brought before the Gerousia by the child's father. The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not.

Having said that, if you do want to watch *Torchwood* concurrently with DW, here's all that's important as far as what to watch and when:

- Watch all of *Torchwood* Series 1 after DW Series 2 and before the DW Series 3 episode *Utopia*.
- Watch all of *Torchwood* Series 2 after DW Series 3 and before the DW Series 4 episode *The Stolen Earth*
- Watch all of *Torchwood* Series 3 after DW Series 4 *Journey's End* and before *The End of Time*
- Watch *Torchwood* Series 4 whenever the hell you want after DW Series 5 because it doesn't really fit anywhere. There's a reason I say to wait until after S5, but it's a too-spoilery theory of mine. It aired during DW S6, if that matters. Really, anytime after *The End of Time* works.

There's also *The Sarah Jane Adventures*, which I've never been able to watch in its entirety (it's a children-oriented spinoff), but there are two stories featuring the Doctor:

- *The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith*, which fits between *The Waters of Mars* and *The End of Time*

Yep, he is definitely suited to the pressing game, much more so than Eriksen, even if Eriksen is a much more talented and refined player at this point in time.

The only downside with Holtby is that for all his energy, I think he lacks defensive discipline.  The way a tactical high press works is that one player has to initiate it.  In other words, he has to be hugely aware of his teammates around him and their positions respective to the opposition backs/defensive mids.  He then makes a choice to press.

Immediately, all the teammates around him MUST follow suit.  There is no point one player pressing if no one else does, because they just get easily passed around (best exemplified by this Cristiano Ronaldo vs Barca gif: http://off.net.mk/files/offside/2013/11/01/ronaldo-mrazi-tiki-taka-65665.gif).

What Holtby seems to do is chase hard without being more tactically aware of his teammates.  He seemingly unwittingly initiates the press even though his teammates are not really in a position to do so.

Without manufacturing or natural resources, England would need to actively pursue more socialist policies, because when your main industries are banking and services, you need your poor people to actually have some money in their pockets. Thatcherism was paid for with oil. But that's getting off the point. 

I don't believe the UK is a healthy partnership. It is being driven in a destructive direction, and the English voters are on board. That's why I'll likely vote yes. I don't want to see the good British institutions broken up and sold off. Now if a serious left wing (in the true sense) organisation was turning the tide in English politics and popular opinion, I'd be more inclined to vote no, but there has been plenty of time for that to flourish, were it there at all.

Also, though the rUK would inherit the state which today is often called ""Britain"", you wouldn't remain a ""British"" citizen strictly speaking, because the island of Great Britain would not be united. It would be the UK of England Wales and NI, or something like that. But you're playing a semantic trick. We are breaking up Britain, as it has existed. That state will disappear in reality. What's left will be too new states, both with proportional rights to accrued assets.

He was the fast wide man that really helped make the system work, which makes sense of why we've been linked with him in the transfer market despite his injury.  Poch must realise that we lack someone with both his pace and end product (Lennon and Townsend have the former but not the latter).

I read something just the other day that said Southampton had a much better first half of the season than second half, and I think a big part of that is losing Rodriguez.  Straight after his injury, they lost at home to Cardiff and drew at Villa.  That definitely speaks of a team that lost its spark once Rodriguez was out.

But, I enjoy it. I know that I won't get a full time job at the end of the year purely because this scheme is only so employers can get cheap work in for £2 wages and then fire them and hire new people instantly.

The scheme is abused. And it's quite shocking. The only reason I got this job was 

1. I didn't want to go to college. Education was over for me at the end of high school I just didn't want to continue

2. I can use my knowledge and skills to help others which I really like.

The present state of the north sea is this:  rapid decline, which we're attempting to arrest by sucking the gunky sludge out of the bottom.

true,Sinical-,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire/Southampton,"Yep, I finished my apprenticeship last November and still work for the company I did my apprenticeship with. I did my apprenticeship employed by my training provider so my assessor was also my boss.

They have a shell company to provide their IT support services basically. All of the assessors are field based so. I started here when I was 16, now 18 and going to uni in a couple of weeks. I work as a web developer (thats also the degree im getting) and I'm completely self taught.

The company I work for employ around 9 'IT Support' people aged 16-18 only because of the amount of funding they get. I'd love to post the training provider I work for but that's probably illegal or something.

Got £95 a week during my apprenticeship and only got a payrise because they legally had to, even then I manage the social media, printed marketing materials, the website and company intranet all on my own for £5.50 an hour.

Ironically I have a job at a pub on the weekends/nights and get £5.53 an hour, for unskilled work. The apprenticeship scheme is totally exploited by this company, all they care about is funding. This provider turns over millions a year.

Traineeships are fucking bollocks too, they're 6 month unpaid 'work trial placements'. They're meant to be for people who don't have level 2 (GCSE) qualifications but I've seen them put people with 7 A*-C's on a traineeship simply because of the extra funding they get for putting people through them.

TLDR; Work for a training provider, manage the whole web/print department on my own with no training. They have an apprentice farm",0,1408610119,null,0,false,0,cjwcw3x,t3_2e2yp0,t1_cjwcw3x,t3_2e2yp0,null,1435357070,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Personally, I hope we pull this off. How could he not score goals with the players we have creating chances for him?? Sturridge, Sterling, Countinho, Lallana, Henderson we've now seen, and of course Gerrard. He'd really need to be taking a piss to not get good numbers with us, and we've seen that Brendan doesn't put up with that shit. Imagine Balo, Ricky, Lovren, and Skrtel all attacking a Gerrard set play when we're pushing for a goal or Balo and Sturridge beasting CBs with their ridiculous athleticism and skill.

The second, was going on a school trip to the UK in 1999. We stopped at Old Trafford for about 2 hours for all my classmates to gorge themselves on Utd pencil cases, jerseys, mini footballs, etc.

What? In the latest edition of the Deloitte money league, Manchester United has about 178 million Euros in revenue from merchandising and sponsorships, while Real Madrid has about 212 million Euros revenue in the same segment. 

As for fanbase, I know there was that ridiculous statement a couple of years back that they had 659 million fans. Which means they claim that 1/10th of the planet are Manchester United fans. Sadly, that has been debunked thoroughly. [Here is a pretty comprehensive article from BI](http://www.businessinsider.com/hey-gm-manchester-united-admits-it-doesnt-have-659-million-fans-2012-8?IR=T&amp;). Furthermore, Manchester United themselves admit that the figure was trumped up, that based off this survey of 54,000 people, it extrapolated that there are 277 million people who consider Manchester United their favourite football club, and that due to the limitations of extrapolating data for such a huge population of people, the real figure could be significantly less than the expected one of 277 million.

Its not what it says on the tin; they advertise themselves as on-the-job education and skills building, and are sanctioned as being so by people with power and authority, but in reality, they are no different to the kind of jobs that are poorly paid and mistreat their staff.

Another difference I suppose is that with a shitty job, before these changes came through, you would do one if you really wanted money/experience in order to better yourself or fill up your time, whereas with these, because they call themselves a 'scheme', people are forced into doing them; in that sense; being compelled to do something is analagous to slavery.

300 is a celebration of bravery and a small elite force standing against insurmountable odds.

300 is not a celebration spartan culture, it largely breezes over the homosexuality for one thing, and I certainly missed the bit where they had a discussion about art and literature. 

&gt;The Spartan military culture is claimed to have been strong directly because of a eugenics program similar to the one being called immoral here.

Even within the context of the film this is dubious. There's a five minute long montage on why they're good at fighting and why the king is well 'ard that briefly touches on the killing of babies with physical deformity. 

To claim that their military prowess is dependent solely on the first thirty seconds of the movie is a bit of a stretch. 

&gt;It appears we don't seem to have a problem celebrating the end result of what people call an immoral system.

We watch films because they are entertaining not because we celebrate and agree with the cultures behind them. I quite enjoy period dramas, am I in favour of reforming the british empire and removing women's rights? I enjoyed Rambo 2, am I celebrating the Vietnam war or Rambo's mental illness?

Things we portray in film are to be exciting and titillating not manifesto's that we sign up to by our enjoyment of them.

true,Tabathock,EN,england,"Fernando Torres could leave Chelsea after the Stamford Bridge club held talks about a swap deal with Mattia Destro, of Roma, one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.

Chelsea’s proposal is that they would sign Destro, the Italy striker who is valued at £20 millon, and allow Torres to move on loan to the Italian club for the season.

Torres has had a largely unhappy time since moving from Liverpool for £50 million in 2011, scoring 20 goals in 110 league appearances after a brilliant spell at Anfield, and has fallen down the pecking order since the arrival of Diego Costa, also a Spain striker, for £32 million this summer.

Roma are interested in signing Torres, who has two years left on his contract, if they are able to reach agreement on his wages of £180,000 a week.

Walter Sabatini, a Roma director, flew to London yesterday for the second time in a week, accompanied by Mauro Baldissoni, the club’s general manager, to try to thrash out a deal.

Sabatini tried to tempt Chelsea and Manchester United into buying Mehdi Benatia on his first visit at the weekend and is also looking for a replacement in England for the Morocco defender.

Roma have conceded that Destro could leave. He scored 13 league goals for the club last season, attracting the attentions of Tottenham Hotspur and Wolfsburg, both of whom now appear to have fallen out of the race.

The 23-year-old would provide competition for Costa and Didier Drogba, the 36-year-old striker who returned to the club this summer.

Destro began his career at Ascoli and spent five years at Inter Milan’s academy before spells at Genoa and Siena. He has been capped by Italy at all levels and was named in the provisional 30-man squad for the World Cup finals before being cut from the final list.

Roma were hoping to sign Stevan Jovetic as a replacement, but the Montenegro striker wants to stay at Manchester City, leaving the possibility of a deal that includes Torres.

Here is a link to the actual poll being used. The actual question was as follows:

""Levels of public spending in Scotland should be reduced to the 
levels in the rest of the UK.""

That isn't spite. That's wanting the distribution of funds to be fair.

As I understand it Scotland might need more money per individual because, as an example, the place is more rural and it costs more to get energy etc to those people. Chances are, however, that the people answering the question don't know that. 

Some other Questions/answers not being reported so much by the YES campaign:

[Assuming a no vote] The Scottish parliament should be given the power to decide its 
own policies on welfare benefits:

- TOTAL AGREE --&gt; 40%
- TOTAl DISAGREE --&gt; 26%

[Assuming a no vote] The Scottish Parliament should be given control over the majority of taxes raised in Scotland:

- TOTAL AGREE --&gt; 42%
- TOTAL DISAGREE --&gt; 25%


But of course the above questions don't fit the narrative that English and Welsh people have it out for Scotland.

Tattoos make people look like cheap tacky  morons in the same way there is no such thing as a classy and decent bumper sticker.

the worst tattoos i particular hate are people who think they are being deep or mystical such as the "" everything happens for a reason"" or go on about how ""my tattoo means something special to me""

Completely oblivious that the actual act of having to permanently mark your body to ""mean something"" is the  tacky hallmark of the stupid.

If something is significant and means something to you, you don't need to jot it down as a reminder unless of course you want to somehow try and show other people ""how deep you are""

In all the people i have met in life i have only ever been surprised by one guy who was a good friend and intelligent guy who had a tattoo, and it was non visible.

We have situations where kids are born into families who suffer from high obesity and smoking. Traits and attitudes that will more than likely be passed on to their kids.

Now you could argue that those kids have a chance to change, and that's fine. But equally you could argue than in the 60 year average life span of a person with Downs medical advancements might be made.

Correct, but the context of the conversation here makes it clear this is not the case. Dawkins is making a direct comparison.

&gt;The decision to abort a child at a very early stage has no moral import because the collection of cells (called a Blastocyst) in the early weeks in not a human in any sense of the word.

You are saying that as though it is fact but your assertion is highly subjective as you must surely know. Not only is there no scientific cut-off point at which something becomes human there isn't consensus about when we should choose to identify this point either.

Moreover, diagnostic testing for Downs is normally done by amniocentesis (which incidentally has a [miscarriage rate](http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a327/amniocentesis) of 1%) or chorionic villus sampling (2% [miscarriage rate](http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a328/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs)).

These are normally done in the second trimester (or from 11 weeks for CVS) at which point the baby has all its features including separated fingers, toothbuds and toenails. Diagnosis is not instant and the decision to abort would naturally come even later.

As an aside his idea of local and global maximums for overall wellbeing worries me. Mathematicall speaking to travel from a local to a global maximum you must decrease overall wellbeing temporarily. I'm not sure whether or not you'd have to travel along the curve or you could jump from one to the other but it seems to very easily lend itself to ""the ends justify the means type thinking""

He definitely does but I'd argue that he's not being self consistent. 

I think as another poster /u/therationalparent has pointed out he'd claim to be some kind of utilitarian. I've always been a little bit suspicious of utilitarianism as it seems to lead to some very dark places if followed to it's logical conclusions.

In regards to whether or not it's a defensible position for a materialist I'd argue that it still probably isn't. 

The assertion that we must act to maximise total happiness is not something that can be derived purely from sensory evidence via reason. I agree that it's a nice thing to drive towards, but if someone says to you (as the selfish bastards so often do) ""why should I sacrifice my happiness for the greater good?"" you're pretty stumped for an answer that doesn't claim some sort of greater moral authority.

The issue is the criteria on which you're judging whether or not it's morally correct to abort. If it's about pain prevention then absolutely he's right, but he seems to be saying it's about societal contribution in which case he's not only dead wrong but also a massive prick. 

This:

&gt;Yes he does. When asked if autistic foetuses should be aborted he says no because, 'People on that spectrum have a great deal to contribute'. I.e. the reason it's OK to kill Downs foetuses is because they can't contribute.

It's an entirely personal choice and I don't think you can definitively say either way what's 'morally' correct - I imagine there are some conditions where it would be absolutely the right call to abort (Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa, for example).

true,CD17,null,null,"Hey, as a 22yo English white guy from Newcastle, I'll do my best to answer your questions :)

1. What can you expect from Edinburgh? Well, this depends entirely on what you actually want to get from the city. It's a lot more expensive than pretty much everywhere I've been with regards to rent, but living costs aren't too extortionate in my experience.

2. I've only just moved back to the city and I'm living on my own now; however, I lived here in 2012 for a year and I used [spareroom.co.uk](http://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/index.cgi?&amp;search_id=187044645&amp;show_results=as+a+map) to find a flatshare. I would definitely recommend it. Gumtree would be another alternative, but not as easy to see properties on a map, which I would DEFINITELY recommend you do, to make sure your transport links are covered. Edinburgh can be deceptively big if you're not living city centre, so check your bus routes are covered, both to town and your place of work. [Lothian Buses](http://lothianbuses.com/) have a decent website for checking routes, and they do a monthly bus pass called a Ridacard which is great value if you use the bus/tram routes regularly.

3. Where is it that you're going to be working? I'd be surprised if there isn't at least SOME young people working where you are. Generally, getting a job as a graduate implies that the company also hires other graduates. Also, as another Redditor mentioned, Uni societies are generally receptive to non-students joining, and you'll also probably develop good social links from your new flatmates.

I wouldn't really consider rap fans to have any sort of grasp on music in general due to their extremely poor choice of music preferences, so when you say ""Generally considered"" i'm gonna take that with a pinch of salt. 

&gt; What an ignorant opinion

Well it's my opinion that rap is mostly shit. People have different opinions, get over it. LIke I said, I can't fucking stand what they have to say and how they deliver it. Also it's kind of weird how they say *nigga* every 3rd word, even though it has a different meaning in their context it's not a word i'm very fond of and it isn't used anywhere outside of rap for a reason. The vocals of rap ruins what could otherwise be a pretty decent beat and unlike rap, trap usually has no vocals which makes it a hundred times more listenable in my opinion.

As someone who's just finished A-Levels, I'd like to just remind you all of something: celebrate or commiserate your results today, but so long as they're going to get you through to the next stage, their meaning is negotiable. I thought I was hot shit because I got 9A*s and 1A in my GCSEs and then slacked my way through my AS levels. I got AAABB, so I did okay, but I didn't get the grades I wanted or needed to apply to Oxbridge. A lot of it was down to me assuming that, like GCSEs, I could just cruise on through and come out with a string of top grades. Similarly, there are kids who didn't do as well as I did at GCSE who worked their asses off for AS and A-Level and came out with amazing results. It's all about the hard work you put in from here on out. I made it up for A2 and I did very well uni-wise and results-wise, but honestly, your GCSE results are what you make of them when it comes to doing A-Levels or embarking upon your chosen FE path. 

Today is always going to be a day of mixed emotions, but remember that the important thing is to stay humble if you've done well, and to remember that it's not the end of the world if you haven't.

2. Set up Halifax for £100 bonus (min monthly pay in £750) (£5 a month)

3. Set up transfer between these two accounts, however much you can afford till you meet the requirements and paid bonus. 

4. Set up COOP for £100 bonus (£25 to charity) min deposit £800. 

5. Change the tranfer ping pong into a threeway. First direct -&gt; Halifax (+£5) -&gt; Coop.

6. Set up M&amp;S account for £100 voucher. 

7. Make transfer into a fourway. 

8. All bonuses paid. Close M&amp;S and COOP. 

9. Maintain transger between Halifax and First Direct collecting £5 from Halifax each month. 

10. Any savings get put into First Direct savings account at 6%.

So this time next year you will have £300 bonuses + £100 M&amp;S voucher + £60 Halifax 'interest' + 6% interest from First Direct savings.

Hope to see more aggressive/physical play against Hull. 

I think it'd be interesting to see who's in the starting XI vs Hull though. Surprised that Odemwingie and Cameron weren't even on the bench. Though Bojan and Bardsley did pretty well I thought. Now that Bardsley seems to be the first choice RB it will be interesting to see if Cameron is sold or gets to play in central with Shawcross or maybe replaces Whelan in the midfield. Also interested to see how much playing time Moses gets. The midfield is pretty stacked, we'll see who comes out on top.

Science deals in doubt.  It holds that all ideas can only be held to be provisionally true subject to possible later revision.  Religion however deals in certainty.  Muslims don't think that the 'truth' in the Quran could *ever* be overturned.  That's a *fundamental* conflict.

On a more basic level, even the first chapter of The Bible is in contradiction with all of modern science.  Turns out that we don't live in a world of talking snakes and Noah's ark couldn't physically exist.   Every non trivial claim made in religious texts about the universe is false or has no evidence to support it.

Finally, religion provides fundamentally supernatural explanations, whereas science is predicated on the idea that the universe behaves rationally.  That's a conflict.

Also, as Rodgers said with us being in the CL again this window was always going to be the biggest in the next couple of years. We went inform depth and have purchased very good balance between the young and the experienced. I couldn't have asked for a better window.

Also (not sure if I mention this in that post) but he's not imposing enough, nor does have the discipline with his press/positioning to play CM. It just highlights his faults (imo) and is wasting his amazing vision, technique, agility and also his work rate if he only has the defense to press. He wasn't Schalkes 10, a team arguably on par with us for no reason - I genuinely think he can provide as much as Eriksen can. And his press fits Poch's system from an advanced position perfectly - it feels like we're playing Kagawa at CM or something when he was *amazing* in Germany at AMC in a high pressing system. 

Even someone like Bentaleb with just over a dozen EPL games looks more balanced and comfortable there.

Yes i am new to following football. I started watching in the middle of the 2012 season when City won the title under Mancini. Last year was specially difficult as i wanted City to win, but Liverpool was playing so well and Suarez was so good, it was hard not to cheer for them.

I did watch 30 for 30 and it was quite eye opening but of course i never really grasped the extent of the damage already done , am still realizing that. 

I am very excited that Balo might come to Liverpool Some crazy drama is coming. He will greatly bolster Liverpool in the Champions league. 

People say i am fake for following Man City bit i dont get it. Its the team is first saw playing so its the team i follow now.

&gt; Since Series 5/6 the story has been poor. The last series could easily not have happened.

I'm starting to detect a pacing problem.  The show is having a problem balancing chaos and order.  I liked Series 5 and 6 a lot, but I feel like the Ponds needed to stay for all of season 7.  I would have kept Assylum and moved Angels to the last spot.  In between I would have expanded on some of the ideas and themes introduced in ""The God Complex"", ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", and the ""Power of Three"".  This would have provided the Doctor with a period of relative calm and order between two periods of major chaos.  Instead of moving from chaos to chaos the show would be moving from Chaos to order, something would happen to disrupt the order and bring a new and different chaos, with that chaos slowly giving way to a new form of order.  (I hope that made sense, its an idea I've just started to think through.)

I would have introduced Clara Prime in Series 8 and used all of Series 9 for the Tranzalor story.

&gt;I honestly do not think anything will surpass the Amy Pond/Rory Pond story.

Look at how we're reacting to this deal, and how people in general are reacting to the price, majority opinion is we are getting Balo for an absolutely amazing deal here.  Balotelli is clearly pretty unhappy with the way things are going at the club and especially with how last season went. He spent most of the season looking like the only ayer in the pitch for Milan that gave a damn at all, and nothing has been done to improve the playing staff or change the situation there. Milan has money problems, board problems, player problems (that are not Balotelli related), and manager problems. It's not a good club to be at right this moment, especially for a character like Mario with the abuse he receives from fans in Italy and from his own club's supporters.  It's good he moves on now before a major flash point occurs.

Milan is still a great club with huge history and I'm sure they'll bounce back eventually.

As for Super Mario coming here... I'm cautiously optimistic. I maybe wouldn't have picked him out of a lineup of strikers to join our squad, but he is outrageously talented and at this price, very much worth the risk. If he comes here sharp, hungry, and motivated, he is going to be incredible. We k ow he can be a big success in the premier league and that he has all the tools to be world class.

If you're not that well informed about universities, don't rush into it. I thought it was bad enough that I came out with a £12k debt. It's at least three times that now and not something to be undertaken on a whim. 

If you're not desperate to go to university, I wouldn't push yourself to go for goings sake. Take a year to look at the different courses, even the people. Hell, by then you'll have friends at some of the universities you're interested in. Rock up for a week of sofa surfing and check the place out. Meet the people involved with the course and... well, you get the picture.

Couple of questions. What's the apprenticeship in exactly? Is it the sort of skills you think you will use for a while? My other question is that if it was so interesting to you, why didn't you do chemistry at A-level?

I've been in Southampton for prolonged periods. I loved cycling down there. I could cycle 15 miles and have a total elevation range over the entire journey of about 150ft. As well as that, the roads have cycle lanes and the drivers are relatively considerate.

In my local area (edge of the peak district) you'd be lucky if you could travel 1 mile with an elevation range of less than 150ft. On top of that, the roads are in terrible condition, there's no provisions for cycling and since barely anyone cycles in the area, the drivers aren't accustomed to sharing the roads with cyclists.

I like cycling in my local area, it's a good high risk work out, but it's not a practical or safe form of transport.

edit: just to confirm, I used to walk everywhere in my local area. I still do where possible.

I wholeheartedly agree with having all this historical information included on the Life in the UK test (and I'm speaking as an immigrant going through the naturalisation process).

UK's history is one of the richest of the world. It is also quite complex, but several historical events have forged the British character as we know today and, most importantly, the British institutions and their relationship with the community. 

You can't expect someone to respect (and I mean respect, not simply following due to fear) your laws without understanding the basis of how these came into being. 

You can't expect someone to respect the way British healthcare works without teaching them that modern nursing was born here. You do such thing by teaching them who Florence Nightingale was, for instance. 

A person willing to be a UK citizen should and must know from where all the peculiarities of the relationship between Scotland and England come from. You teach them that by showing how Scotland was in fact a different country, with a different government, which ended up joining England due to the fact that the Scottish government was broken (bear in mind that I don't simply mean the union of the crowns). Why would this be important? Well, how would you explain to a new citizen the devolution of powers to the Scottish parliament or, in fact, the Scottish Parliament? Such thing is not common anywhere. 

Whilst all these history questions may sound like a pub quiz, they are there to force whoever studies for this process to at least be exposed to these topics.

Almost every single revolutionary that has inspired revolution and bloodshed across the world educated themselves in Europe and went through the European system first, even the current leader of North Korea was educated in Switzerland. 

Infact if we're specifically talking about political Islam then part of that typically is going to the West to develop a sense of culture shock and disdain. That's how the guy that thought all this up got started.  

&gt; It also represents a shocking series of failures.

If we're playing outrage then how about Mark Thatcher? At least we can pretend this guy was an impressionable kid, Mark Thatcher was the principle backer for a military coup in Equatorial Guinea. He was the fucking _son_ of a Prime Minister.  This kind of absurdity isn't without precedent. If anything its a product _of_ the sort of free nation we desire. People are free to think and do what they choose (as long as you don't mess with other people) and as a result of this some people hate the very country they live in. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this, its what having a free nation is about.  

While I don't really support the sort of activity they're getting up to out in Syria/Iraq I'll defend any Brits right to fight in whatever war they choose, much like George Orwell fought in Spain in a war that was technically none of his business. We're supposed to a free nation that is relatively relaxed about what its population thinks and does.  
If British citizens think this shouldn't happen and are shocked then perhaps they should pay more attention to current affairs? Its obvious that there would at least be _some_ Brits who are into Islamic Jihad much like _some_ people like noise music (this one puzzles me more to be fair). In addition considering the public backlash to the Iraq war its not surprising that some might think its their duty to enact change in the Middle East, they might feel a bit of guilt.

I think we celebrate the success of Sparta despite the system, not because of it. Even though they were child-murderers, we can recognise also that they were exceptional fighters. Importantly, the qualities of Spartan soldiers that we most admire are not exclusively derived from infanticide; soldiers from other nations have shown skill and bravery in battle, and have achieved military success, without committing atrocities against babies or children.

Whilst Spartan 'ends' have been praised, and all military forces want to emulate similar attributes such as bravery and skill, I've never heard a serious suggestion for their morality to be adopted because we recognise that is too high a price to pay - we would lose the qualities which make our society worth fighting for in the first place. Losing compassion altogether is even more grievous to society than losing a military battle. We can recognise that the ends were in themselves impressive but, the means still do not justify them and are not desirable.

Independence has nothing to do with it. Just because you are dependent on someone does not make your life 'terrible'. That's pretty obvious.

But since you ask, have a look at the [Down's Syndrome Association](http://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/information/for-familiescarers/adults-18.html) website:

This is two Xs

An understanding of ourselves ultimately comes back to biology if you are a materialist. This is a circular argument.

The second point (understanding of the universe and our position in it) sounds suspiciously like general revelation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_revelation

However in the case of the materialist this is pretty irrelevant. There is no creator that has formed an ethical code to deduce facts about.

Look I get that not all atheists are moral relativists. However if you keep pushing 90% of atheists on the subject of why things are right or wrong they eventually say ""they just are""

This doesn't make them bad people or their atheism any less valid. It simply means they're practising a touch of moral relitivism to fit into society better. 

Some atheists go a step further and claim that ethics are illusory but necessary. As such they are imprinted in our genetics.

Not really. You could however spend a week specifically studying for the test and pass it, but not generic learning.       

A lot of the test questions (in both the UK and US) are both utterly useless stats questions, like ""what is the number of X?"" or completely trivial like ""tell me the words in this sentence you've memorised for this specific test."" That few would naturally know.     

For example:     

 - How many amendments does the Constitution have?    
 - The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the Constitution. What are these words?    
 - The House of Representatives has how many voting members?      
 - In what month do we vote for President?       
 - How many justices are on the Supreme Court?    
 - There are four amendments to the Constitution about who can vote. Describe one of them.    
 - When is the last day you can send in federal income tax forms?    
 - When was the Declaration of Independence **adopted**?     
 - There were 13 original states. Name three.     
 - When was the Constitution written?    
 - The Federalist Papers supported the passage of the U.S. Constitution. Name one of the writers.        
 - Name one of the two longest rivers in the United States.    
 
Even for people who casually enjoy studying American history and American government they wouldn't know a lot of these.    

The UK test is worse. But they're both like being on a lame gameshow where they're testing you on how well you studied for this test specifically and nothing that will ever have an impact on your life or welfare.    

PS - If anyone replies with all of the answers just assume they googled them regardless of their claims.

Basically I was analysing the three chosen texts in relation to Feminist and Adaptation Theory.

Is falling in love a weakness? (no although it's often represented as such). Does the fact that her character is often exacerbated into a great lover or villain diminish or enhance her character? (it's complex). What elements of her character are necessary to be retained in order for her to remain 'Irene Adler'? (IMO, the fact that she beats Holmes and that he admires her).

None of the adaptations are perfect but why should they be? We've got Granada!Holmes for that. 

People criticise Sherlock's Irene for losing at the end but it's a matter of perspective. Elementary's Irene is a whole other kettle of fish. Guy Ritchie's Irene was, IMO, dulllll.

It goes much further back than that, to the fundamental nature of the universe we live in. For example, the reciprocity and empathy in human nature is likely to exist mainly due to the mathematics (game theory and emergent systems).

true,UmberSkies,null,null,"See, I never got to that point, I cannot stand Smith =/ 

When I first started watching, I adored Eccleston, and when he left I didn't like Tennent. That changed after a while though, and Tennant is now actually my favorite doctor, and his regeneration is the only tw I have actually cried because of a TV show. 

So I figured I would give Smith a fair chance, but after almost a whole season, I actually had to stop watching, because he just feels so wrong as the Doctor. I like Rory and love Amy, but Matt Smiths portrayal of the Doctor feels more like a kid with magic blue box, rather than a scar'd, lone survivor who committed dual genocide. To this day I haven't finished watching his episodes, which I feel really bad about with Capaldi starting up soon.",0,1408625706,null,0,false,0,cjwgbvb,t3_2e439f,t1_cjwgbvb,t1_cjw8eqo,null,1435358961,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,gary1994,rory,Rory,"I wasn't a big buffy fan but I loved Once More With Feeling.  I thought it was actually an episode of extreme importance for all the characters.  It was when Buffy's friends realized they had pulled her out of *heaven*.

&gt; they only have 12 episodes to develop a character

This is why I think they really need to start thinking about retaining cast members for as long as 4-6 years.  Obviously that wouldn't be necessary for everyone.  Martha was fine with one series, a few appearances in the next, and her time on Torchwood.  I think Donna needed 2 years.  But, I think to truly do Matt's Doctor justice he might have needed 6, the Ponds needed at least until the end of series 7 and I could see Clara's story needing as much as 4-5 years to fully develop properly (if it is what I think it is, [Casting spoiler rumor](#s ""though, if she is leaving her arc will have to be abandoned unfinished"")) 

&gt;I honestly draw a blank on defining moment in the last series.

I can think of four, but three of them are based on my guess as to what Clara's arc is intended to be.

1. The Angels Take Manhattan, after Amy and Rory have been taken in the by the Angels, the Doctor and River are speaking in the Tardis.  First the Doctor reaches out to River *offering* her consolement, she rebuffs him.  Then he reaches out to her *for* consolement and she rebuffs him again.  She basically says ""No, find someone else.""  Earlier in the episode she had said that the Doctor couldn't handle seeing the damage, but the truth is that it was her problem, not his.  She was projecting.  When the Doctor reached out to her in his moment of grief she rejected him.  It was the end of their relationship (and set the stage for Clara).

2. The Rings of Akhaten.  The Doctor and Clara standing together silhouetted before the Old God after Clara offered up her leaf.  In this moment you know exactly what their relationship is going to develop into (or at least what is planned).

3.  Journey to the Center of the Tardis.  Clara learns the Doctor's name.

4.  The Name of the Doctor.  Both Clara and the Doctor offer their lives up to save the other (the Doctor didn't know if he would be able to come back, River's reaction strongly suggests he wasn't bullshitting about that).  In a way this could be considered a marriage, couldn't it?  That's what marriage is, isn't it?  Offering your life up (in a sense) to your partner?  I think that them wrapping up River's storyline completely just before the Doctor jumps in after Clara lends some credibility to this idea.


Edit: I just thought of a 5th.  The One Word Test from ""The Snowmen"".  Compare Clara's answer ""Man"" to River's response in Angels...

Edit 2: If I were to pick a theme for the season I would say it is ""Connection.""  Basically it was about the Doctor's ties to those around him, breaking them, and forming new ones.

true,ezekielziggy,,"Anti-Powlite (FUCK /POL/) ","Junior partners in coalitions often get much of the blame and little of the credit in coalitions, it is not unique to this one. I do agree that the LibDems might have done better in terms of political distinction should have pushed for individual ministries and Nick Clegg should have pushed to have either be Minister for the Home Office or Foreign Secretary (which is often the position awarded to junior coalition leaders). The Challencor of Exchequer is almost never awarded to the junior partner, if you give away that position you might as well give them the keys to 10 downing street. 

In 2010 the LD's were keen to prove that coalitions could work to a sceptical public, the markets and to ease concerns regarding the economy. They had to prove that they were a serious party and not one who would play opposition in government and duck the hard decisions for political advantage. Unfortunately this strategy might have legitimised the idea of coalitions with the British public but it did not give them any credit for it and as you said, it undermined their visibility. Given that Labour essentially spent it's first year in opposition attacking Nick Clegg and the LibDems, this strategy has been particularly damaging (as can be seen by the amount of LD-Lab switchers). 

The LibDems have generally had alright policies with competent mps but they suck at spin/politics and have very few allies in the press, which makes things rather difficult for them. 

If there is a hung parliament in the next election (and it isn't completely out of the question, although I think Labour will win a small majority), I think they will try a different approach from the 2010 negotiations. 

Another thing that hurt them was the restrictions they agreed on about reducing the number of SPAD's, which meant that they were sometimes out of the loop on certain issues. ",0,1408625853,null,0,false,0,cjwgdni,t3_2e68x8,t1_cjwgdni,t3_2e68x8,null,1435358990,12,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,12

**Edinburgh-Based Post Rock**

[The Gothenburg Address](http://thegothenburgaddress.bandcamp.com/album/the-sky-the-mountains-the-land): Revolving line-up, all centered around one guy called Luke Joyce, who also puts out music as I Build Collapsible Mountains. Really excellent stuff.

[Tidings](http://tidings.bandcamp.com/): more post-metal than post-rock, but it's really strong musically. Good live shows, huge sound, and a good time.

**Post Rock Bands That I'm In** (so you can easily skip over the self-promotion if you want).

[Penguins Kill Polar Bears](https://soundcloud.com/penguinskillpolarbears): Not necessarily post-rock, but a big sound with definite influences.

[We](http://wescotland.bandcamp.com/): Bit more straight forward than Gothenburg but maybe your thing. 

**Other Good Bands**

[The Lonely Together](http://thelonelytogether.bandcamp.com/): Broody alt-rock/pop, like a melancholy Snow Patrol (like Run). 

[Urvanovic](http://urvanovic.bandcamp.com/): A nine-odd piece outfit of quirky alternative pop. Just amazing music.

Also, keep an eye out for other noteworthy small Scottish bands: Vukovi, The Winter Tradition, Fatherson, Copper Lungs, Lightguides, Farewell Singapore, Bear Arms, Blood Relatives. 

For venues, Sneaky Pete's is great for smaller acts, Electric Circus is good, Wee Red Bar is good for quieter music, Bannerman's is half-decent, The Mash House is pretty good, and Opium is good depending on the music.

So the rUK has the benefit of inward investment in oil, whereas Scots would only have the direct tax receipts.",0,1408630970,null,0,false,0,cjwifgt,t3_2e5z0h,t1_cjwifgt,t1_cjwho5y,null,1435360378,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

With changes to fullbacks 
(Enrique, Flanagan and Johnson(Pls no))

With changes to Gerrards position (Lucas Leiva, Henderson)

With Changes to Henderson Position (Continho, Can, Markovich)

With changes to forwards.
(Ibe, Markovich, Borini, Lambert)

As well as players to put in against lower league teams, cups etc such as suso, Ibe, Markovich, Borini, Flanagan, Coates.

Although Continho at the moment is a must play type of player but I just can't place him. :/ in Brendan I trust for that.

Perhaps we could put Sturridge on the left, sterling on the right with Continho 1 ahead of Henderson, and Ballotelli as single striker.

Or (downvotes Inc) we remove Gerrard, fill Henderson in his Place and put Coutinho in Hendersons place.

Without oil Scottish GDP is about on par with the rUK... but that fails to take into account the fact the Barnett formula gives Scots £1200 more per capita.

Personally I would favor Scots having control over tax and spend as much as is possible (for example things like VAT, inheritance tax etc. might still need to be set nationally to prevent regional under-cutting undermining the wider economy. It would give individual scots more accountability for the politicians - as they would not only be responsible for spending money, but for actually raising in the first place.

Another big reason is EU regulation. EU regulates fucking everything these days and anyone looking to ship a mass consumer product like this has to make sure it passes a shit load of that regulation.

There are probably a variety of reasons so many sites do it badly. A lot of them probably copy each other so they're not exposed to risk in isolation. I imagine some of the warnings are decided by the legal/policy team as opposed to the user experience team. Plus annoying the users means they hate the law so future ones are less likely and it encourages them to keep long-term cookies so the warning stays away; both are in the site's interests.

&gt;to protect themselves every site prompts you

The ICO have even said they would only punish sites that wilfully disregard the policy. And some of these sites' annoying warnings are far from clear about the purpose of the cookies, so if they were worried about protecting themselves they should've done a better job there.

In the decade before when the tax rate was 60%, the richest 1% paid between 11 and 14% of total income tax, when it was reduced to 40% in the following decade it had increased to 21%. The richest 5% went from between 24-29% to 40%.

That infers that the number was somewhere below 60%. Considering the number is also determined by the ability of the wealthy to avoid tax it seems reasonable that with globalisation this would be reduced further.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I know this is sports and players are held to a different standard than normal human beings, but the most encouraging thought, to me, in regards to Balotelli's personality/emotional/ego/motivation issues, is that he just turned 24 a week or so ago.

I'm 23, myself, and look back at myself a few years, two years, a year and even six months ago with embarrassment and astonishment at the level of immaturity and selfishness I contained and displayed- and I consider myself a fairly well-adjusted person for my age, for the most part. Even now, I know I still am much more immature and irresponsible than I would like to be, though I know I'm working in the right direction.

Balotelli, from most accounts, has had relatively few behavioral issues during his run at AC Milan. His motivation on the field seems to have been inconsistent, but Milan is in shambles. The organization seems to be a mess and he's had several managerial and personnel changes over the past couple of years. 

Again in comparison to myself and other people my age, however mature and well-behaved one is, it would be extraordinarily difficult to achieve one's potential, talent-wise and personality-wise, while working for a disorganized, fluctuating company or organization. Many footballers are able to still remain motivated in such situations, which is a testament to their incredible mental discipline. 

To loop this all back to how it actually relates to his seemingly inevitable move to Liverpool- it seems that Balotelli has turned something of a corner in the past couple years but has had to play in a poor situation that has stunted his growth. I am (somewhat cautiously but mostly) optimistic that under a strong, stable system, a manager who seems to be able to inspire and nurture his players and a strong core of guys who it seems like Balotelli would get along with (I particularly look forward to seeing him and Sturridge becoming buddies up top), I have high hopes that we might have just pulled a coup.",0,1408633158,null,0,false,0,cjwjhcd,t3_2e6cje,t1_cjwjhcd,t3_2e6cje,null,1435361062,33,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,33

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; a social trend that blights the job prospects of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and women

Has it never occurred that the employers pay a part in this? Choosing not to employ a qualified and able person because they have tattoos is, apart from in a small number of fields where tattoos would be inappropriate, discriminative, prejudiced bullshit.

&gt; My grandfather had a tattoo but he was a bona fide seaman and his was an anchor on his arm – that was fine; de rigueur, in fact, for sailors at the time.

'Tattoos are only acceptable when they are on my family members for reasons I deem appropriate'

&gt; It’s not just the irritation of looking at a stupid slogan or a perfectly hideous bit of design on someone’s face or neck all day

'I don't like looking at them so I shouldn't have to. Much like darkies.'

&gt; it’s the thought that the individual who does it is apparently oblivious to the shifting, ever changeable nature of the human psyche

or, you know, made a decision about their own bodies that they are perfectly happy and comfortable with for their whole lives, like many tattooed people are. Just because the writer is too fickle to conceive of someone being satisfied and confident in their tattoo and never regretting it, it doesn't mean other people are.

&gt; David Beckham succeeded despite his tattoos, not because of them.

Which is why, despite his success, he's never been hired to model for underwear, revealing the tattooed skin all over his body. Oh, wait, that *did* happen, numerous times.

I can't conceive how people like this writer can exist without realizing what warped cognitive processes are going on in their brains. ",0,1408633963,null,0,1408634320,0,cjwjvsk,t3_2e5eir,t1_cjwjvsk,t3_2e5eir,null,1435361375,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's *cheaper* for the consumer but it's absolutely **not** environmentally friendlier. Electric heating has the potential to come from renewable sources while at present we don't have any renewable gas/oil heating options. 40% of the Scottish electricity supply is already renewable (2012 figures) and that's only going to increase. 

So, on paper, a person in Scotland using incandescent bulbs with gas heating is actually MORE ""green"" than someone with CFLs in the same home because a small portion of their heating is being met by renewable electrical sources and reducing their CO2 output. Probably negligible amounts though. Add in the complexities and waste with CFLs and people like me get angry. Stupid stupid kneejerk legislation.

If you own a home you can either pay off the mortgage early or just save cash for market downturns to buy stocks on the cheap.

Anything that's left over, invest a monthly amount in a S&amp;S ISA (I use Charles Stanley direct) and buy a well diversified index fund, it's up to you which one (vanguard UK equities for yield or vanguard lifestrategy for whole world exposure).

As a general strategy it's pretty conservative but also likely to give you good results over the long run, it just depends on your particular risk tolerance what proportion of the £1k you put in cash/shares.

true,Chive,null,null,"I moved to Canada from the UK about a year ago and frequently make calls back.

UK phone numbers are typically of the format: 01234 567 890, whereas a Canadian number would be: 1 403 234 5678 (used my local area code) 

When dialling out of Canada you start with 011 and to phone the UK you add 44 after that, so any call will require the code 01144 to be dialled first.

The ""tricky"" bit is dropping the leading zero in the UK number. They're required for making calls within the UK but aren't used for international calls- unlike the leading 1 in Canadian and US numbers.

So using the same example, the UK number above becomes +44 1234 567890 for purposes of international calls.

The number you should be dialling in your case is 011 44 333 7000 022

Andreas Weimann’s strike was a decent one, but he failed to provide a single key pass in the clash, while averaging 0.9 per game over the course of last season.

On the other flank, an out-of-sorts Charles N’Zogbia returned to the side but recorded a rating of just 6.19 as he was ineffective both with and without the ball. Gabriel Agbonlahor and Kieran Richardson are Paul Lambert’s other options on the wing, but both would probably see themselves as best-suited to other positions.

It'll be fine for 10 - 15 years before the cheapo pipework starts to fail and maintenance costs skyrocket. The only reason we have a functional water and gas network in the UK today is because everything was overengineered when it was run by the state. Cooperative living cannot happen in a country like the UK because it's simply not liberal enough (on the whole). That is to say that lots of people don't want to pay up when stuff needs fixing ""Got mine"" etc.

One of the biggest improvements the UK could make would be to tear down our old housing stock and put up newer, more energy efficient buildings.

Unfortunately much of the UK has been put off modern housing because of the slapdash construction and low quality materials due to the obliteration of regulation under She Who Shall Not Be Named's reign. Buyer beware and all that.

So instead we have some perverted nostalgia for aged buildings which aren't really fit for purpose any more, simply because stuff we've built for the past few decades is shite generally speaking. Combine this with the disappearance of council housing which was, at the time, relatively good quality and built to last. These things do not exist in isolation and should be integral to joined up planning.

Yes having 'fuck off' tattooed on your forehead would stop you getting a professional job. But you have to be stupid to get that done. 

I have a tattoo, it's on my shoulder. You cannot see it unless I show you, or I'm naked. 

Only one of theclients I work with know I have it, and that's because he got a tattoo and we got talking about them.

It has absolutly no influence on my ability to do my job, because you cannot see it. It's not on show during meetings, job interviews, in any situation. It does not affect my professionalism at work, it does not affect how people see me. I am clean, and professional. I'm not a pikey, or a thug.

I have a tattoo, I love my tattoo, I love the story behind tattoo. I also have a professional job, a clean smart image, look bloody good in a suit and have a whole list of clients who are more then happy with my work.

&gt;  it is not enough to cover the whole electricity demand

Not yet. It's an easily achievable goal for us though, for once our turbulent weather is an advantage! Lots of rain for hydro, lots of wind for turbines and a whole lot of waves on the west coast. They are already planning a [new distribution system](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/press-releases/ofgem-gives-green-light-new-%C2%A31.2-billion-scottish-subsea-link-and-transmission-charging-reform) so that this can be sold across the UK and eventually western Europe. We've got a great future on that front. 

&gt; So any marginal increase in electricity consumption will come overwhelmingly, if not completely, from fossil sources!

That depends on a lot of things. If it's predicable demand then it can come from anywhere. If it's unpredictable then it has to come from a system with a fast spin-up time. The fastest ones are mostly renewable e.g. batteries &amp; hydro-electric. Gas is also fast, that's what's been traditionally used but it's still not as fast as the newer ones. 

&gt; It would not be 40% of supply if everyone were using incandescent light bulbs

I'm not suggesting that, we'd all need sunglasses at home!

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Don't know.  Let's have a look.

Hart v Courtois - I don't know enough about Courtois (whenever I've seen him he's barely had anything to do) but everyone seems to think he's the second coming of Yashin.  I'd assume there's merit to that reputation so let's assume Courtois edges this one. 0-1 CHE

Caballero v Cech - I don't know enough about Caballero in this instance, but I doubt he's as good as Cech.  0-2 CHE

Wright v Blackman - I think Blackman *may* be a top keeper *eventually*, but not yet.  Wright for me.  1-2 CHE

Zabaleta v Ivanovic - Ivanovic is one of the few right backs that can give Zaba a run for his money, but it's still Zaba for me. 2-2

Kolarov v Azpilicueta - I don't know.  I prefer Kolarov but that could be bias.  I think Azpilicueta is possibly a little more complete. 2-3 CHE

Clichy v Felipe Luis - Pfft!  Clichy. 3-3

Sagna v nobody - We've got more depth there, but I'll not count this in the man-for-man comparison.

Kompany v Terry - Kompany. 4-3 CITY

Demichelis v Cahill - I actually really like both of these guys.  I'm going to call it even-stevens. 4-3 CITY

Mangala v Zouma - another one I have to go on reputation.  Mangala. 5-3 CITY

Boyata v Ake - Well I *know* Boyata is shit whereas with Ake it's just an assumption on my part.  Ake. 5-4 CHE

Fernandinho v Ramires - Fernandinho. 6-4 CITY

Toure v Matic - Matic came out better in the actual head-to-head last season, but Yaya wasn't far off being Premier League player of the year last year.  I'll give it to Yaya. 7-4 CITY

Fernando v Mikel - Despite Chelsea fans protestations, I really rate Mikel, he gets a foot on everything and while it doesn't necessarily stop attacks, it slows them down enough that Chelsea can get numbers back.  I like what I've seen from Fernando so far, but I'll trust what I know.  Mikel 7-5 CITY

Lampard v Fabregas - eek.  Fabregas. 7-6 CITY

Silva v Hazard - Both difference makers, but Silva has the advantage of being Silva.  Silva (I just love saying Silva). 8-6 CITY

Nasri v Oscar - Nasri is better without Silva, but Oscar can play just as well with Hazard. Oscar 8-7 CITY

Navas v Willian - Navas can be a bit predictable, but Willian can be a bit green.  I think Wilian will have the greater impact this season. 8-8 CITY

Milner v Salah - I don't know much about Salah.  I don't even know his reputation.  Based on virtually nothing I'm giving it to Milner. 9-8 CITY

Costa v Aguero - If Costa can stay fit and Aguero can't he could be worth more points  over the course of the season, but assuming both stay fit it has to be Aguero. 10-8 CITY

Jovetic v Schurrle - Fitness could again be our undoing here.  I think Jovetic is probably a shade better, but I *really* don't trust his fitness. 10-9 CITY

Dzeko v Torres - Both capable of fluffing the easiest of chances, but Dzeko is definitely the better player these days. 11-9 CITY

Negredo v Drogba - Drogba's old as fuck and will barely play.  Negredo is injured and has a piss poor second half to his season last year.  Take your pick.  I reckon Negredo 12-9 CITY

So I've got us on top but it's not as clear cut as that.  There are some players where the difference is wafer thin.  Plus they have possibly the best active manager in the world, and (I'd suggest) a little more hunger to get their hands back on the trophy.

I tried one of the cheap ones out of curiosity, had it for a day, then binned it and went back to real smokes instead. That was just before I got my 'proper' e-cig.

While it's a bit more expensive, the higher cost pales compared to the amount of money you'll be saving from real cigs anyway, and it's far better at giving you a proper nicotine hit, so you're much less likely to switch back to real smokes.

&gt;
&gt;Adric was an Alzarian born on the planet Alzarius in the parallel universe of E-Space in the 32nd century. He was ranked as an elite and was awarded a blue star-shaped badge with gilt edging for mathematical excellence. His brother Varsh belonged to a gang of teenage thieves. Adric wanted to join them, but was refused. Varsh asked him the embarkation question: ""Where will you be when the starliner leaves Alzarius?"" Adric replied he would be somewhere else entirely. This proved to be true; he was on board the TARDIS when it took off. To prove himself to the gang, he tried to steal some riverfruit, but failed. (TV: *Full Circle*)
&gt;Adric stowed away on the TARDIS and was discovered by the Fourth Doctor and Romana II. He pretended to share the agenda of the Three Who Rule, a trio of vampires who ruled over a small community. He tried to save Romana from being sacrificed but failed; both were saved by the Doctor. (TV: *State of Decay*)

The LibDems do not have the leading representation on any of the 3 big beasts (treasury, home office or foreign office) which hurts their visibility (to a certain extent this doesn't apply to Danny Alexander who has more visibility than most).

The libdems are pretty terrible at owning their major and popular achievements in government such as the raising of the tax threshold and pension reform. 

The FDP were in government in some shape or form consistently throughout post cold war Germany, they were deeply damaged in the last election by a scandal relating to a major donor and the sheer popularity of Merkle, which resulted in seeing their vote squeezed just below the 5% threshold.

It shows a group of Israeli school children visiting Poland to see Auschwitz. You get to see the indoctrination their teachers subject them to (claiming that there are neo nazis wandering about looking for them, not to mix with other people, the entire world hates them and that's why they're in Israel etc). It also follows Abe Foxman leader of the ADL (Anti Defamation League) and shows how his organisation fish for ""anti semitic incidents"" which in reality are not proven at all. 

However, if you follow what's happening in Manchester outside the Kedem shop you realise there is definitely an element of antisemitism in that protest.

Using figures for the financial year 2006/2007,[4] if a UK-wide per capita average were a notional 100%, identifiable per capita expenditure on services in England would be 97%, in Scotland 117%, in Wales 111% and in Northern Ireland 127% (this does not take account of non-identifiable expenditure, such as defence and debt interest, which are deemed to be for the benefit of the entire UK, regardless as to where the money is actually spent). In cash, this would work out as (per person):[5]

England £7,121
Scotland £8,623
Wales £8,139
Northern Ireland £9,385

Later in the article it says that spending in London is 124‰ which is higher than everywhere except Northern Ireland.

I'm not saying I agree with this, I'm just sharing this because I only found out about it yesterday and it annoys me how Scotland has this reputation for scrounging off England when the formula means that Wales and N. Ireland also get more money.

The cycle routes that you highlight are in the city centres, not in the rural parts where I (and presumably OP) live. I don't fully believe those maps though - it's definitely easier cycling round Southampton than any of the towns or cities near me.

Just for the record, I still do cycle (I like to tell myself I'm sub 10 stone, I think I maybe a bag of sugar over it now) but as I said it's for exercise  - and as far as exercise goes, it's high risk. But it's not suitable for casual transport up here. Even for regular transport, it's only viable if there's a shower at the other end. And if you're going to visit a mate, you don't really want to have to bring a change of clothes and use their shower when you get there.

Also, I'm referring to the nature of the roads as well. Local (rural) roads near me are typically narrow and winding with poor visibility and lots of large dangerous pot holes. That's simply not the case in Southampton. Although in your defence, it's probably not the case in the cities round here either.

But your original statement 4 miles in 20 minutes as a replacement for the bus doesn't work out up here. Average speed is going to be more like 8 - 10mph, or less with big hills, meaning you're cycling for more like 40 mins. On top of that, you've then got to prep before you go and clean up when you get to the other end. So from starting to get ready to leave, to being able to start your task at the other end, you're talking more like 60 - 75 mins. I can call a taxi, have it arrive in 5 minutes, be ready to start my task at my destination with 15 minutes after it picks me up - will cost about £3. Since I get paid more than £3/hour, it works out better for me to pay the £3 and have 45 minutes extra time.

I don't have a problem with cycling as a hobby or sport or even a mode of transport when it's viable. When I was in Southampton, it was my transport to - I was cycling 50 - 75 miles a week. But rural hilly areas, it's not an efficient form of transport. I've also found as I've got older I've used it less as transport. If you're working 8 - 6, you don't want to be spending over an hour either side of work preparing and travelling when you could be spending just 15 mins.",0,1408639191,null,0,false,0,cjwmkko,t3_2e4hp3,t1_cjwmkko,t1_cjwfz1q,null,1435362703,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In cash, this would work out as (per person):

England £7,121
Scotland £8,623
Wales £8,139
Northern Ireland £9,385

(Later in the article it says spending in london is 124%)

true,egran,present,Eden Hazard,"No, current striker we have are not enough, in my opinion. If Costa is a super human and can play every single game without any fatigue or injury, then we are good to go, but he's not. One injury to him, god forbid, then we are pretty much back to square one from last season. Yes, we have Fabregas who's going to make our midfield more lethal and composed, but if there is no person to finish, then there is no product. Drogba is a threatening presence, sure, but we all know he is not the same Drogba we used to know. Relying on only Torres and Drogba is not something I would be confident about. Which leads us to Schurrle and Fabregas who had striker/false 9 experience. But frankly, I would rather see Schurrle as RW, Fabregas as CM than to see either of them playing in striker/false 9 position since they are way better at RW, CM respectively. So what can we do? I think we have more limited freedom compared to other clubs. We have to keep our foreign players and HG player in check, and as far as I understand, we have one extra foreign player than supposed to. I think that's why recently there were rumours of us trying to swap Torres for Destro, foreign player for foreign player, and that Cech might leave us (even though I saw  the twitt saying Cech is going to stay to fight for the competition.) Perfect situation would have been to keep Lukaku as 2nd choice striker (as he is HG) and sell/loan Torres. So here are options i think we have so far: 1) Stay satisfied with strikers we have and bring one youth from u21. 2) Sell/Loan Torres (which will be difficult) and another foreign player, but buy a foreign striker. 3) Go after HG striker which I don't think much out there.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; You're confusing energy sources with energy stores.

No, I'm talking purely of spin up time. The National Grid has to cope with an ever variable demand and they put huge resources into tracking all of the factors to best predict things. The stories of them cuing in on Eastenders finishing are 100% true.

Despite all this they still have to cope with sudden unexpected demands. Certain energy supplies (be they primary or stored sources) are faster than others at producing that supply. Hydro is in the order of seconds, turn a valve and the turbine is spinning up very quickly &amp; that's true for both pumped storage and regular damns. At the opposite end is nuclear where output levels take rather long to increase to a control change. Coal is pretty slow, gas is a lot faster but still not ideal. It's down to the mechanics, if you are making steam to drive a turbine then there's always going to be a lag. 

So, tl;dr: we don't ""need"" traditional sources, they don't provide anything special, the renewable technologies can meet 100% of the systems needs if invested in. 

&gt; If all electricity was renewably sourced, then it would not be an issue, but if you're planning on selling the renewably-sourced electricity around the UK/Europe, then you'll probably never reach that point.

Yeah, it depends on why it's being bought really. There are EU targets for things like renewable usage and one easy way to meet the target is to import ""green"" energy from another country. 

If we export to meet purely to exploit that demand then we'll still have traditional sources for our own use. But if we go fully renewable and have a surplus (which isn't all that hard for Scotland itself) then we are laughing.

I think the test forced her to learn/care about arbitrary things within the UK. Where she still doesn't understand all of our laws. Wouldn't the test have been must better focussing on the legal differences between the UK and China?

Manquillo/Johnson------Lovren/Skrtel-----Sakho/Agger-----Moreno/Enrique

-------------------------------------------Gerrard/Lucas

---------------------------Hendo/Can--------------------Coutinho/Allen

-----------------------------------------Sterling/Lallana

-----------------------------------Sturridge----------Balotelli

Basically the same 4-4-2 diamond formation we used towards the end of last year, I like it as it allows for two strikers to both play centre forward. 

Notes: 

* Coutinho played in that position last year, but he can also play CAM. 

* Can, Gerrard, and Lucas can all play as both a CM and a DM, so none of them are tied to the positions I put them in. 

* Flanagan might replace Johnson as one of the RB options if his form is good enough (i.e. better than Johnson's). 

* Lambert (and maybe Borini, if he's still here) can come in for either striker if needed.

* I reckon Sterling can also play as a centre forward. I don't think he's done it before, but he has all the right qualities for a small, tricky, pacey striker. Perhaps he could also be an option if I am right about this. I think Messi also went from a winger to an attacking midfielder to a striker.

The ones I consider **very important** are bolded and **should not be skipped** - the rest are (mostly) nice extras, but don't add anything important.

And make sure you don't watch them before they take place. You don't want to get overzealous and spoil future events for yourself!

Leaving before you completed the minimum term set out in your contract.

Virtually every company that gives you a contract will charge an early termination fee. Phone companies, ISPs and yes, even Agencies.

You're being charged for wanting to leave before you finished the terms of your contract. Sure, in a perfect, loving world, there'd be no such fees. But alas, people want to grab as much cash as they can off you. And if you signed on the dotted line, they're allowed to; because you gave consent!

&gt;1. Improve what visitors see as they arrive in Belfast: The approach to Belfast by sea is largely industrial with Kilroot power station one of the first sights before sailing closer and viewing defunct industrial sites and rubbish tips.

&gt;2. Extend shop opening hours: Cruise passengers have been spotted wandering forlornly around Belfast city centre on Sunday mornings, peering into closed shop windows. Our trading hour restrictions mean that shops in, for example, the Victoria Centre cannot open until 1pm on Sunday, and close at 6pm.

&gt;3. Licensing hours: While the rest of Europe allows bars to stay open into the early hours, most of our bars must close between 11pm and 1am depending on their licence.

&gt;4. Deeper ports: Belfast is one of the few ports with deep enough waters to accommodate larger cruise ships. Lough Foyle is too shallow to welcome in any larger ships. A spokeswoman for Visit Derry told the Belfast Telegraph that the cost of dredging Lough Foyle would be significant, but that it was a long-term aspiration.

&gt;5. Revamp some of our beautiful old buildings: The Cathedral Quarter in Belfast has seen a resurgence in recent years with the Merchant Hotel in particular bringing new life to the old bank on Skipper Street. But there are scores of other old buildings tourists could enjoy which are currently crumbling.

&gt;6. Purpose-built facilities: Cruise ships in Belfast dock at Stormont wharf in Co Antrim, a long way from the city centre. However, plans are under way to create a new facility at Alexandra dock close to attractions Titanic Belfast and HMS Caroline.

Fucking hell. Acting like some starry-eyed jester-hatted knobheads like Man City fans, who can't quite believe that such a well-known 'star' has signed for Liverpool.

Get Yourselves A Fucking Clue. We've already got bigger stars and better players than Balotelli at the club. We're Liverpool. 

As for all the drivel about how similar he is to Sturridge, or Suarez or Cantona or any other controversial supposed bad boy of football, again, it's clueless and small-time.

The aforementioned players had flaws, but what they did (do) have is an unquenchable desire to win, to be the best, to work like demons in training  and demand the best of themselves and their team-mates.

Stupid Mario doesn't do any of that. He exists in a Mario bubble, permeated with stupidity, misplaced arrogance and laziness. He has the mental age of a nine year old, and everything he does, or doesn't do, is entirely about himself.

He has no concept of team, or real desire to improve himself. Every halfwitted stunt, or cringeworthy Tweet is only ever about him.

He is the living antithesis of what a Liverpool player is.

twatting about in his ridiculous fucking car, throwing darts, being unable to dress himself, fighting with teammates, throwing around money, stamping on players, alienating  and disobeying his manager, making incoherent look at me statements about issues he has no genuine concept of.

He'll get fucking twatted by someone in town within a month, and probably deserve it.

He's shit, stupid and will be a gigantic, toxic mistake for LFC.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Per capita is a terrible way to judge it though, you can't just plonk down a hospital and say *""Well that's 15,000 people taken care of for £6m""*. The people have to be nearby, which they are in England and they aren't in Scotland.

If Scotland got the same per capita funding as the rest of the UK people in the north wouldn't get the same services everyone else in the UK gets purely because they happen to live somewhere that makes providing services less efficient.

You're applying flexible numbers to inflexible costs. If one 15,000-capable hospital costs £6m that doesn't necessarily mean 7,500-capable hospitals cost £3m each. Building a road for one person isn't really any cheaper than building one for 100 people.. they still deserve a road though.

It's not all one way either, that 15,000-capable hospital can probably do things two 7,500 ones can't thanks to economy of scale. Don't necessarily need to buy two of everything, don't need to deliver to two places, don't two wholly separate full staff rotations.

It's a matter of efficiency. If everyone deserves a hospital then by way of nothing but geography it costs more to give that to some people than to others.",0,1408643723,null,0,1408644114,0,cjwp0a2,t3_2e231g,t1_cjwp0a2,t1_cjw4wne,null,1435363655,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,m1ndwipe,null,null,"Sigh, complex issue, there's a lot here and reporting on this (and most of the stuff coming out of anyone proposing anything) is based on simplistic bollocks where they don't understand the issues.

Nobody knows what happens to the BBC in an independent Scotland. Nobody. Not the SNP. Not the British Government. Not the BBC, as it happens.

But there are plenty of good reasons to suspect it would be a mess, and it certainly won't be as some people say it will.

1.) The biggest issue is that nobody knows that happens to existing copyright licenses and permissions that cover ""the United Kingdom"" in an independent Scotland, and the chances are that it would have go the European Court to decide if independence happens. I don't think it would cover it personally, but it's a bloody complicated issue and I wouldn't put money on my opinion. And if it doesn't, then the BBC doesn't have the rights to distribute the vast majority (99%+) of it's archive (including clips in new make programmes) in Scotland anyway. The logistical cost of doing such a clearance, even aside from paying people, would basically make it completely unworkable.

Going forward, there's no costing of how much it would involve to clear those rights. What happens if separate publishers own a book in Scotland vs the rest of the UK? Who pays for the second clearance? Stuff like this is the reason the BBC don't sell a lot of programming in the rest of the world. Who would the music rights be cleared with? PRS doesn't have a mandate from it's members to sell those rights ""abroad"" in several circumstances. If they can get them is unclear.

2.) For new make programmes roughly 35-40% of the BBC's programmes aren't made by the BBC, and aren't owned by the BBC. The BBC if it wanted to sell them lock stock and barrel to Scotland there's no guarantee they could enter into such a commercial negotiation and obtain those rights without an increase in cost. The BBC wouldn't be able to subsidise that arrangement out of it's own pocket - that's probably illegal under European State Aid law as the BBC wouldn't be Scotland's national Public Service Broadcaster any more, and is therefore required to act in a commercial manner.

3.) Yes, personal opinion here, but the notion that an SBC with a budget of £300m would deliver even £90m of international sales in to the UK market is just a fantasy. RTE delivers a fraction of that. No broadcaster in the world returns that. Even assuming an SBC could spend all of it's money on new content and didn't spend most of it on foreign acquisitions.

One bit that does annoy me though, they tell me our queen is a constitutional monarch, as far as I know, a constitution, is something that guarantees our human rights. 

Our queen did not even guarantee the right of her own son, to retain the body that he was born with, he was circumcised by a mohel, just after he was born. The first big split in the royal family happened, when they wanted to circumcise William and Harry, princess Diana would not let them.

Representatives are the lower house IIRC. Roughly one for every 500k Americans. So 650?

&gt; In what month do we vote for President?

October

&gt; How many justices are on the Supreme Court?

9

&gt; There are four amendments to the Constitution about who can vote. Describe one of them.

Amendment 17 gave dem coloured people the vote.

4th July 1776

I don't watch TV so being harassed to pay the fee on a monthly basis even after I've told them multiple times that I don't watch TV just becomes annoying and furthers my distaste concerning the fee altogether.

In my opinion, if the BBC truly believe in the value of their services and believe that people actually want to pay for the content they provide, then they should become a subscription based channel. 

Holding other channels that get no benefit of the fee hostage is a pretty egregious move and to me, it shows their lack of confidence that people would still pay for their service without being forced to.

It strikes me that Scots probably won't be able to set theirs *much* lower - either as part of a formal currency sharing arrangement OR through EU regulation. The days when countries like RoIreland could undercut their neighbors on corporation tax are probably a decade gone by. An area where the Scots *might* be able to undercut the UK is actually on higher rate income tax... but that would be controversial north of the border. Furthermore, with EU legislation stating that most industries must operate their tax expenses from the location in which they do their business will mean for most companies (particularly in industries like finance and petroleum products) the rUK and more specifically London makes more sense.

I don't think Scots are going to be able to build a successful economy by undercutting the British... it just isn't going to happen. The EU let the RoI get away with it for a long time because it seemed fairly harmless, but those days are gone. And since the Scots would be so dependent on British acquiescence to much of their currency, EU and broader independence plans I don't think they will be in any position to *""beggar thy neighbor""* over corporation tax. Perhaps quite the opposite.

You'd need to find a spot for acceleration outside of the village (given they'll be 30 or 40 zones) and only then start steadily climbing up, leaving the average speed much slower.

50-60 isn't that rare on rural roads, but your typical bus wouldn't average it within 5 minutes.  Over a longer journey, it is quite possible.",0,1408646116,null,0,false,0,cjwqa7r,t3_2e4hp3,t1_cjwqa7r,t1_cjwlbir,null,1435364440,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Unicross,flare-brum,City Centre  - Formerly of Kings Heath,"No where near comprehensive, but I've posted this previously, hope it helps:


&gt;City Centre Places to visit:

&gt;1. [The Library of Birmingham](http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/):This is open after a move from the old Central Library at Paradise Forum.  look forward to poking your nose round, the Shakespeare room looks amazing.
2. [BMAG](http://www.bmag.org.uk/birmingham-museum/):The Main Museum by Victoria Square is a great place to go to, it has the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings in the world and the Staffordshire hoard too. The newly opened [Birmingham Exhibit](http://www.bmag.org.uk/new-birmingham-history-galleries) is definitely worth a wander around and will give you a background on your new adoptive city.
3. [Thinktank](http://www.thinktank.ac/): At Millennium Point is a great interactive science display to go and see (tailored more towards kids but still fun for adults too!).
4. [The Back to Backs](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/birmingham-back-to-backs/): The only National Trust place inside the city centre. A row of preserved 19th Century houses originally built for workers, definitely worth a visit.
5. [The Ikon Gallery](http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/) in Brindleyplace is the hub for more modern arts, but is free has a good cafe and a nice courtyard and definitely a good few hours worth of entertainment.
6. [The Sea Life Centre](http://www.visitsealife.com/birmingham/) round the corner from the Ikon is also a good place for a few hours, especially if you have little ones in tow.
7. And if you're a fan of chocolate there's of course [Cadbury World](http://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/). No need for an explanation here I think!
8. [The Electric Cinema](http://www.theelectric.co.uk/) is the UK's oldest working cinema (licenced bar too!). It shows a great eclectic mix of blockbusters, Indies and golden oldies.


&gt;Shopping

&gt;1. [The Mailbox](http://www.mailboxlife.com/). Plenty to see and do here. Many High End shops, and eateries (Pennyblacks is a particular favourite of mine). There's also a few hotels around if you end up staying late.
2. [The Markets](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/bullringmarkets) Are worth a visit if you're after, well, pretty much anything! Split into three main markets: [The Open Market](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Markets%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092598418&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper) is the place to go for cheap fruit and veg shopping (early mornings are best), with a wide range of local and exotic fruit and veg. [The Rag Market](http://www.ragmarket.com/) Has a wide range of goods from fabrics, to electricals and general handy stuff. Finally, [The Indoor Market](http://www.bullringindoormarket.net/index.html) is the place to go for Meat, Fish and Exotic foods, with ample parking above it. There's an AMAZING little sushi place in there called [suishi Passion](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sushi-Passion/212584485422108) which I urge you to try.
3. The Big One... [The Bullring](http://www.bullring.co.uk/), which I'm sure you've probably heard of is the main shopping centre coming up to it's 10th Birthday. It's got over 160 shops including Selfridges, a mahoosive Debenhams, and a TK Maxx which I can never get the missus out of. Right next door to the currently being refurbished [New St Station](http://www.newstreetnewstart.co.uk/) (due to have it's own shopping centre and John Lewis within the next year or so). A new eating development has just been added at the bottom of the Bullring called Spiceal Street, with a few nice restaurants and a Jamie's Italian which is worth a visit
4. [The Pavillions](http://www.pavilionsshopping.com/) situated next to the Bullring from the other side of Markets has a few good shops, a large Waterstones and a good food court upstairs if you ever get bored of the Bullring.


&gt;Dining Out and Drinking

&gt;Apart from the aforementioned Mailbox and Bullring

&gt;1. A short walk down the canal from the Mailbox is [Brindleyplace](http://www.brindleyplace.com/), opposite the ICC. Brindleyplace again is full of restaurants and bars (mostly chains; Pitcher &amp; Piano, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Handmade Burger Co., Cafe Rouge, Pizza Express, Carluccios, etc). Personally I recommend [Chilaccas](http://chilacas.co.uk/), great little burrito place open late, if you're on the way back from Broad Street.
3. Talking of [Broad Street](http://www.broadstreetbirmingham.com/). Birmingham's 'Premier' drinking location. Nice in the week but I avoid it like the plague on a weekend as It's usually full of Stag Do's, Hen Nights and Students who've had a few too many beers.
4. For an alternate drinking / shopping venue[The Custard factory](http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/), south of the City Centre in Digbeth is good. Plenty of vintage shops, eclectic bars, and the [Digbeth Dining Club](http://www.digbethdiningclub.co.uk/) on Fridays is a great place to meet people and enjoy some of Britain's best street food.
5. [Moseley](http://www.moseleycdt.com/) is described as an urban village. about 15 minutes by bus from the city centre it's basically Birmingham's version of Carnaby Street / Soho. Lots of independent shops, craft fairs and farmers markets. And a few great Pubs too. recommended are [The Prince of Wales](http://www.theprincemoseley.co.uk/), [The Bulls Head](http://bullsheadmoseley.co.uk/) and the [Fighting Cocks](http://www.thefightingcocksmoseley.co.uk/) are great pubs if you want to stay away from the chains.
6. Harborne, again about 15 mins bus ride is also great for a few ales, with some good bars, eateries and a few stand out pubs.
7. Around the city itself, there's a funky collection of Pubs and Bars called [Bitters'n'Twisted](http://www.bittersntwisted.co.uk/) Each is unique, The Victoria doing amazing soul food, The Jekyll and Hyde with a gin bar and film evenings, all worth a visit.
8. Chinatown and the [Arcadian](http://www.thearcadian.co.uk/) is great for food and there's a few funky restaurants and bars. [Le Truc](http://letruc.co.uk/) is a personal favourite.


&gt;Parks 

&gt;Birmingham has over nearly 600 parks and public open open spaces, totalling over 3,500 hectares (14 sq mi) of public open space, more than any other European city. The two main parks sites include:

&gt;1. [Sutton](http://www.sp.scnhs.org.uk/) is one of the largest parks in the UK, you could spend at least a few days exploring all nooks and crannies. 
2. [Cannon Hill](http://www.cannonhillpeoplespark.net/) is much smaller but no less exciting, there''s a boating lake, tennis courts, mini golf and events throughout the year. If you're up for a run there's a free 5k [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/cannon-hill/) event every Saturday morning at 9am.
3. [the Lickey Hlls](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/lickeyhills) are great for a breath of fresh air about 10km south of the city near where the Rover plant used to be. There's some great panoramic views and opportunities for horse riding.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; As far as I know a lot of Jews outside of Israel do not support what is being done over there in their name

Synagogues, Jewish Federations, Jewish Community Councils, Rabbinical Boards and all three major Jewish movements (Orthodox, Conservative and Reform) from Detroit and Cleveland to New York and Miami have thrown their unconditional support behind Israel.

In the past few weeks, virtually every Jewish communal institution in the United States has organized, sponsored or participated in rallies to ""support Israel"" or ""stand with Israel,"" ambiguous language which actually means ""stand with"" or ""support"" the policies of the current Israeli government.

I am not aware of a single rally organized by a single Jewish institution of the kind described above to have opposed the policies of the current Israeli government. Just as there were no statements from the major Jewish movements criticizing Israel. If Israel is indeed imperfect, as we are so often told by its supporters, what are imperfections?

Of course, there have always been Jewish groups to oppose Israel’s actions, such as Jewish Voice for Peace, but they remain at the margins of the ""the Jewish Establishment,"" and have long been left out of organizations such as The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations - an organization which itself includes almost as many self-described ""Zionist"" organizations as it does Jewish.

They needed to negotiate with Labour in order to have any sort of leverage in their negotiations with the conservatives, one example is Cameron telling his mps that they have to offer a referendum on AV as Labour were supposedly offering it without a referendum (I don't know if there is truth to this, I can't remember). 

Labour certainly were not serious in their negotiations, unlike the conservatives they had not prepared in advance for them and not only were unaware of LibDem policies but didn't even know a number of their key representatives. A number assumed that the LibDems would back them come what may and a number were very content on a stint of opposition. 

Given that Labour could barely stop the infighting when they had solid majorities, the idea that they would have been able to pass key legislation, particularly unpopular measures that were required as a result of economic circumstances, is laughable.

You're right about tax, and it obviously varies by state, but you pay essentially around 10%.

If you feel threatened or have received threats/abuse in the past then I think it's an ""extreme case"". Despite what Eastenders etc tries to portray, it's not normal for people to be abusive to each other.  I'd ask to speak with a police inspector, and maybe also ask to make a (late) report in relation to the assault/harrassment/[domestic violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence) that occured previously - if you'd done the latter at the time you'd perhaps not have this problem now.

Abusive behaviour readily affects health. You've witnessed this person being physically abusive in the past, no wonder you're on edge.

There's an implied duty of care also that your flatmate should do nothing to put you at distinct risk of harm - if you're stressing then harm is being caused. This aspect might fall into civil law though. 

From the link above, you can ask Shelter to comment on your specific case.  Are you collecting evidence?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Given alternatives on the market, the price and your other points above, I don't see him as a risk at all; definitely not more so than signing promising but unproven players like Markovic (especially at 20 mill) and Origi, or proven but pricey players like Lovren or Lallana. If it works out then he could just win us the league in the next couple of years and if it doesn't then we can sell him on for what we spent (someone will always be willing to take a risk on him). 

I see it as less of a risk as perhaps others do because I simply can't see him compromising the team togetherness, chemistry and overall mentality in the way that people suggest. I think this for the following reasons:

Firstly, Rodgers would never let it get to this point. If Balotelli intends on causing an issue, then Rodgers will have him straight out the door; he isn't a man to fuck with as he proved with Reina and Suarez. Rodgers also has a track record of getting the most out of 'troubled' players and whilst Balotelli is, of course, a new challenge entirely, I think there is few managers better equipped to try and tame him. 

Secondly, the team is far too tightly knit to let one player destroy what they have. The team's belief and togetherness was there for all to see last year, that doesn't just change with the misbehaviour or indifference of one player (Suarez, Reina and Moses are examples). 

And finally, whilst *very* erratic, I genuinely think Balotelli is a good person (like many would say, to the laughter of rival fans, about Suarez) who generally gets on with team-mates. His public actions have even appeared altruistic at times which suggest to me that there is more to Mario than meets the eye; many who know the man well would vouch for this. He seems like a flamboyant, attention hungry and immature.. but ultimately, I think, a well-meaning person. There is no guarantee the Liverpool players won't see this and take to Balotelli.

I think people are mad to question this signing and I think it's the smartest piece of business we've done all Summer, even ignoring the tangible morale boost a signing like this comes with and also the marketability of the player.",0,1408648174,null,0,false,0,cjwrdw4,t3_2e6cje,t1_cjwrdw4,t1_cjwplrz,null,1435365102,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I've mentioned a few times how creative he is on this sub (and underrated at it) and how much danger he causes when he gets inside the central positions. I actually posted one of my little rants on it which started because there's some footage of Lamela in the Villa game last season where he plays some balls that if Eriksen played - we'd cream our pants.

""Anybody who still talks about him in that way is living in the past.""

I can imagine Brendan give him a talk saying about how he can become a fan favourite. He'll show him videos of the kop bouncing to the name of Gerrard, Torres, Suarez, explaining how ""this can be you.""

Yes i agree, add diesel (which my car is) on top and it will total more, but i couldn't work out my precise amount as i travel long distances for work, not the 5-10 minute journey as supposed here.
My diesel costs around £25 a week solely to work which is around 160miles a week. The car is a 1.4 ford fiesta, 54 plate, runs like a charm and fingers crossed ive had no problems (may be a lucky one). 
In terms of a car compared to a bus, personally i think this highlights the fact that cars can, and arnt much more expensive than buses, they also provided easier commuting, no more waiting 5-30minutes for a bus, which can be a major inconvenience and if the service runs overly late can cause you to be late. Plus you get the added bonus of connivence on the weekend, making small trips like shopping and family visiting much easier. 
In terms of myself, id have to catch 3 buses to get to work, easily taking me an hour or more if they were on time, the drive is around 30minutes. Without my car id never be able to get to work, and the journey would turn my day into a 12 hour day, where it currently only stands at a 10hour day. 
The bus, like this thread is about wont charge you per mile, more as a one ticket system costing someone around £2 for a single journey and £4 for a day saver. I could travel 18more miles than someone doing a 5minute bus journey and it would cost me the same amount which is a joke. Buses are a major rip off, especially for short haul, the fact it can cost me less to travel to london by bus than anywhere in my own city begs more of an argument. But thats for another day.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"That is a shitty way to look at it.  
Put simply (and probably somewhat wrongly) its a condition where the child's mind isn't setup to pick up on social cues and empathetic motivations, which does result in a setback in regards to social development. They find it _really_ hard to relate to people so picking up language and stuff like that is very hard for them at first.  
HOWEVER its a trade-off. Very often autistic children are much better at understanding complex and abstract systems and sometimes excel in one particular field (e.g. maybe music or drawing or maths).  

So its not like an illness that only fucks you over *it just gives you a different mindset*. Saying its an illness isn't quite right because when you get a cold (and I'm being a touch silly here) its not like you can fly to compensate or have super human strength for the duration of the illness.  

Think of it more as an evolution of sorts. Sure, it might be a deadend but its altogether possible that autism is actually the beginning of the future human that ignores the social aspect of humans in exchange for a deeper understanding of something else like errrr say.... technology? Which... is a pretty useful skill in today's world.    
Once we've sorted the social acceptance and bypassed the developmental challenges it might even be viewed as a benefit by some.  ",0,1408650429,null,0,1408650730,0,cjwsl64,t3_2e6pmw,t1_cjwsl64,t1_cjwpacs,null,1435365737,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

One thing I loved to hear him talk about was the _narrative_ and the need for us as a community to provide our own. He then falters (IMO) by stating we have to suppress the dogma.  
Now I don't think this is the kind of thing where telling kids ""to say no to Terrorism"" is going to work but we can greatly lessen the effect by (as he said earlier) providing alternate narratives.  

You're never going to prevent children from growing up, being rebellious, having delusions of grandeur and wanting to change the world. What we can do however (IMO) is two things:  

* provide alternate rebellious narratives so that young Muslims fall into better locations than political Islam. Something more about liberalism and the Middle East so we end up with peaceful political activists who are upset about the lack of liberty in the Middle East as opposed to warriors.  
* provide amnesty to those that go out there but then realise their mistake.

I know the second point wont be popular but as our children, if they're not too far gone we have to be able to pull them back from the edge and demonstrate that we still love them and they still have a place here.

Russian - A* (I'm a native)


I'm a bit disappointed. In the end, it all came down to how much effort was put in right before the exams. It's not some measure of ""how smart you are"" or anything, as I know some people who were predicted high and are intelligent/successful overall as people simply didn't revise nor put in the effort... although most ""smart"" people do know of the value of education at this age. I used to put in a lot of effort into school in earlier years, but as the time went on, my motivation dwindled, and I think that by the end, I just pissed about. Seriously, I spent around 6 months doing nothing in my IT lessons. Got a merit, it's alright I guess. Pissed about in the last 2 months of English. Only revised for 2 days for maths. There you have it.


They're not bad results and I won't have any trouble getting into college to do my desired options (Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Physics), but damn I should've revised for a week or two right before the exams just so I could have more to show at the end of it. I also should've read the instructions on the paper - because I fucked up my geography paper - I got an A*, B, and a U. It averaged out to a B in the end, but I answered the questions that I shouldn't have had, as you had to only answer one from each section, and well, I tried to answer them all.


I will get really good results in sixth form, I promise. Judging by what many have said, GCSEs don't matter much, if at all, especially when your A levels are excellent.

Any property you rent in England will almost certainly be let on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy.  This is a fixed term agreement generally for a minimum of six months, although they can be longer.

During that fixed term neither party (tenant or landlord) has the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement unless there is a significant breach of contract, or there is a specific ""break clause"" in the contract.

Once the fixed term has ended if a new agreement is not signed then the tenancy becomes periodic and can be ended, generally by a month's notice from the tenant or 2 months from the landlord.

The best psytrance in the South-West is found in Bristol - http://www.tribeoffrog.com/. They have an event on the 27th of September which is gonna be awesome, I highly recommend it. As for actual clubs, the good underground ones are Lakota, Thekla, Basement 45. Or Motion if you're looking for more of a big rave scene. I can't really tell you about the mainstream ones but I'm sure you can find them when you get here if you're interested.


If you want to do yoga, the class I go to is Ashtanga on Monday nights at 7pm in Stoke's Croft, but there are plenty of them around to suit your time and needs.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Anyway, your point is kind of irrelevant because you imply the only role of the RAF is air-to-air combat.

If you'll refer to the section I quoted, it specifically mentions combat and in my response I specifically included mention of any threats to our squadrons deployed in the Middle East. 

If what I said is irrelevant - so is what Graydon said there. 

Furthermore we're actually *ahead* on defence budget spending... 

&gt; His comments follow wide-ranging defence cuts across Europe. Last year, of the 25 European members of Nato, only Britain, Greece and Estonia met an unofficial target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence. The average was 1.3 per cent. 

You make mention of our responsibilities to NATO? In terms of spending - we're surpassing them.

If recent months have taught us anything, it's that we've dug ourselves a bloody hole as the result of our previous involvement in the Middle East and our economy is still not fully recovered with cut-backs across government branches, facilities and services across the nation. 

Sorry if I'm not quite like Graydon and his understandable interest in preparing for war (he is an Air Chief Marshall after all, it's little surprise he has an invested interest in seeing the RAF and by extension our forces continue to grow and flourish) - but we need to look beyond building a fleet of expensive war planes and ships - when the job's done we'll still have huge financial problems at home and we'd better hope there's a war so we can say 'it was worth it'.

I am sorry but how did you come to this conclusion? I understand that most of the strikers we have had at Chelsea that were not good enough to be our main strikers, like Eto'o, Ba, even Lukaku to a certain extent, would be great for most teams outside the top 4 for PL, but that is because despite them not being *amazing* they still perform to a certain level and score goals.

Torres hardly ever scores and his performances are terrible. He has no physical presence, no aerial threat, he has *anti*-poacher instincts (always ends up wrong spot, wrong time) and in general is a pretty shitty shooter, hardly even takes any.

Unlike Ba, Lukaku, Eto'o, even a player like Drogba (who offer pace, strength, goals, headers, etc..), Torres can't offer any PL club anything worth having him for. In his glory days Torres relied a lot on that extra bit of pace he used to have and his great runs he would make. At least in Liverpool he had world class players feeding him ball over the top, he wouldn't get anywhere near that quality at a midtable side. That being said even his best strengths, his runs, have been non existent at his time here at Chelsea.

Whenever I see people commenting that I he would be a good player for a midtable club I really only think they are saying that because he is a Chelsea player so it automatically makes him very good, which isn't true in this case. 

If he can't score with the likes of Ancelotti and Mourinho at the helm and players like Mata, Hazard, Lampard, etc behind him.

That's not true of CFLs at all. I have some really good CFLs, but they were very expensive - think around £10 each - and you cannot easily buy them on the high street. You really need to use a specialist online retailer.

This is why I think Destro would be a great purchase for us. He is everything that I described in the first sentence.

Players that would fit the bill for us:

* Destro
* Josip Drmic (this guy can really score, supreme finisher)
* Connor Wickham (used to have so much promise early on but hasn't completely lived up to it. Still HG and promising though.)
* Benteke ( would be amazing 2nd choice, but a bit unrealistic)
* Luis Muriel ( a little risky since he didn't have that great of a season last year but the one before it he was outstanding. Fairly young and experienced in Serie A)
* Wilfried Bony (not exactly a youngster but he is 25 and is definitely one of the better strikers in the PL.)
* Lacazette (very promising french player, did amazing in ligue 1 last year. Small but fast, strong and can definitely dribble and finish.)

If I was Chelsea this would be my short list of players to try and purchase. Some of these guys are a bit more experienced then others (Bony and Benteke) but the vast majority are still fairly young. If Bony and Benteke are not available which is probably the case I would be looking very closely at Lacazette (easily my top choice), Destro and Wickham (he is english and HG). Josep Drmic would actually be very high on my list as well, right up there with Lacazette had he just not transferred this summer.

Fact of the matter is that, in a one striker system, there's no point having more than 3 strikers. If Bamford isn't ahead of Torres and Drogba then regardless of how 'ready' he is, he should be out on loan getting regular first team football.

Even, basing a player's ability off half a season of football in a lower league is ludicrous. Yes, I know he was great for MK Dons but league 1 is so far from premier league level it barely factors. But for half a season Nikica Jelavic scored 9 goals in 13 games for Everton, in the Premier League, but would that have made him 'ready' to lead the line for Chelsea.

Fact is, there's no knowing how good he would be. Sure, we can chuck him in at the deep end, but that's stupidly risky when you're competing for 4 trophies, when at top level he is, for all intents and purposes, completely untested.

true,latinsonic,smith,Smith,"I went there is past Monday, and had the wait an hour and a half outside with a bunch of other Whovians who were very patient and generally pleasant about the wait.   
  
The staff is very overwhelmed with the amount of people that are coming to the cafe. The owner has asked the locals to give them a couple of weeks before coming so they can organize better and hire more staff. The owner wanted to do a makeover of the cafe and she went with Doctor Who after binge watching it on Netflix.   
  
Over the weekend they had 4 hour wait. It was never ment to actually be a themed cafe but more drawn on inspiration. But since the initial reddit post, the place exploded in popularity.  
  
When I went I had a 1.5 hour wait and took a hour inside until I left. There isn't much to it, the picture pretty much capture all that's inside. The capacity in there is only rated for 30 people so that's why people have to wait outside. If you are going there from out of time and now is the only time you have, then you should go. If you are in the local area and are able to go whenever, just give them some time.   
  
They will be adding more Doctor Who themed items to make the experience better. Also they are in the process of getting t-shirts for the staff to wear and then more to sell. If you have any questions about the cafe or the area let me know. This is my hometown but have since left when I joined the military.

I don't think it makes any difference. We like to think that mental disorders absolve people of responsibility for their actions, but in truth no one chooses their brain to be wired the way it is, irrespective of whether we choose to label them as mentally disordered. 

Though it isn't polite to say so, autistic dickheads are just as responsible as normal dickheads for their dickheadedness.

Probably explains a lot now then. Nah we didn't do that, just blew them up. Finding different ways of making shitty incendiary devices from aerosol/household flammables and bonfires in the middle of the woods.

true,DorothyJMan,null,null,"""Talk about a straw man"" - ""you must be watching Derby week in week out.""; ""So you know better than Jose and RDM do you?"" ... lets not make this hypocritical.

Lets actually check the history:
1) Drogba, Crespo, Gudjohnsen and Carlton Cole. Cole made 1 start all season, and that was in the FA cup. May as well include Schurlle as a striker if that counts. Secondly, between them Drogba, Crespo and Gudjohnsen made 56 league starts, so it patently obvious we didn't solely play 433, or solely play them only up front. Given our depth in attacking midfield this season I doubt we'll so any of our strikers given any real amount of time anywhere other than up front.

2) 2011/13 - I'm going to assume you meant 2011/12 because in 12/13 we only had 2 strikers at any one time - not even 3! Last season, how many strikers did we have? Eto'o, Torres, Ba. 3. So you know better than Jose and RDM do you? Because they've both gone into seasons with 3 strikers. In fact, RDM went in with just 2. And sold one in January.

You're right, I didn't watch Derby week in week out. Did you (if you did, fair enough, I'm not going to make assumptions). I also went to the game at Pride Park that he played the full 90 minutes in. 

I'm not denying he can't be a very good player, he's actually one of our prospects that I'm most excited by, but as good as the Championship is for a 2nd tier league the Premiership is a whole 'nother kettle of fish, its faster, stronger and mistakes get punished much for frequently.

The burden of proof is on you, having made the claim that he's good enough to play a role in our squad. So please, tell us why. And include the number of Derby and MK Dons games you watched last year as well if you please.

When spurs got their Bale money and bought a load of players it was crazy, but they were a lot of unknown players from around Europe. I don't claim to have really know Can and Markovic until they were linked to us, but signing the saints trio and Origi post world cup. Borini looking like he's staying but a having 14 mill deal on the table is amazing. But (touch wood for tomorrow) Mario on top of all this is just mental, i'm elated. Studge and Mario on a good day is looney tunes. 

To think a few years ago it was Adam and Cole coming in, this is a totally different dimension. I'm literally so happy to be a Liverpool fan now, incredible business.

Shame to see Reina go, and there isn't much more anyone needs to say about Suarez. But this is building for a LONG time.

Osgood's scarf is *based* on the 4th Doctor's scarf. Hers is a different color palette; much brighter than anything Baker wore. Also, the order and amount of her color blocks are different as well. 

I started the scarf in December, so there was not a lot of information available at the time. I ended up doing an insane amount of research. I've looked at tons of pictures, gone frame-by-frame through the movie, and I'm a member of several cosplay and stitchery groups that have discussed the scarf at great length. One of the members in one of those groups did a chart comparing counts and colors from one of Baker's scarves (S14, I believe) against Osgood's scarf.

Initially, users had to give 'explicit' consent before any cookies were stored. That is to say, they would have to tick a box or click 'Yes' before even the most rudimentary of cookies could be kept, which meant you couldn't even use the site until you accepted.

Good GCSE results help you get into Higher (? Is that the term in England?) levels, which, in turn, help you get into university. 

After about 2-3 years, all qualifications are pointless. I did terrible in my Standard Grades (more or less GCSEs), and struggled to do decent Highers with those. Got okay Higher marks, then got into Uni. Didn't get into a spectacular uni given my Higher marks. Stayed there for four years, and finished with a first-class Hons. That was enough to lead me onto a Masters degree in a very good university (saying its name seems mostly bragging).

true,naryn,eng-kent,Canterbury - Kent,"The Netflix House of Cards series cost $100,000,000 apparently to make 2 series.

That's just ridiculous that you're expecting the BBC to produce dramas that cost that much. The only program to come close to that figure would probably be Top Gear, which if I'm not mistaken is one of the highest earning shows in the world. House of Cards is a great show, by all means but for every House of Cards, every Breaking Bad you have just as many stinkers.

Sherlock comes as close as any American drama to perfection in my opinion, and some of their mini series' come fairly damn close too. The BBC produces fantastic content for its budget, which is much much smaller than many of these amazing American dramas we see

Things like Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Breaking Bad etc employ big name actors, pay ridiculous sums for cinematography and the like, the BBC tends to do great drama's with fairly unknown actors outside of the UK, and they often receive worldwide appeal.

House of Cards was great, but it was also ridiculously expensive. If you gave a monkey $100,000,000 to make a television series it would be something at least worth watching, so I'm not surprised HoC turned out so well, give Netflix the budget of many of our dramas to work with and see if the quality is as good",0,1408660916,null,0,false,0,cjwy17d,t3_2e6fuu,t1_cjwy17d,t3_2e6fuu,null,1435368700,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He was getting 6 MILLION POUNDS of tax payer's money every year. Our council turned the street lights off to save far less than that, and it is quite possible that people *died in accidents* as a result!

When he left, he just went and did the same show on ITV. Everybody wins, people still get to watch his show, he presumably still got paid what he was actually worth, ITV got more viewers and became more viable, the BBC saved a shitload of money.

I actually think if that happened across the board, with all the mediocre stuff the BBC produce, someone else would pick up the slack and people would still get to watch the programmes they like without my taxes funding it. If the BBC halved the licence fee as a result, a subscription iPlayer might be viable (at £150 a year I really don't think it is).

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Tattoos are stupid and sad. I suppose it would be to consider permanently marking your body for the sake of aesthetic change decided upon arbitrarily.

By that logic, equally sad and stupid is the idea of cosmetic surgery. Who cares about having larger breasts or a straighter nose when a person is greater than the sum of their parts? What meaning could such vanities have compared to the simple unique nature of humans?

By extension, any vanity-based undertaking is equally to be dismissed. Trying to lose weight? Just as bad. Going to the dentist to get your teeth straightened? Equally stupid.

And then some. If an act of arbitrary personal vanity is to be shown such disdain then all acts of arbitrary personal vanity, from dying one's hair to shaving one's face or legs or underarms to simply hygiene itself, even down to wearing fashionable or name-brand clothing.

Perhaps we should extend this to perceptions of equally vain activities that do not affect one's physical body, such as attempting to get a better or more sought-after job or promotion. After all, money cannot buy happiness, nor can power or responsibility, or perhaps any attempt to seek pleasure of any kind, for surely such pursuits run on the assumption that the person seeking them deserves these pleasures no matter how hedonistic or modest, and thus seeking any pleasure of any kind is to be treated with equal disdain as tattoos.

Perhaps additionally the attempt to buy anything that is unnecessary for survival should also be included, we buy plenty of things we do not need, what else is this but an exercise in vanity? ""Look what I can afford, look what I can waste my money on""

So so truly shed the shackles of vanity, we must live in garden sheds wearing hemp and jute, foregoing all entertainment or ambition, working a job we may not like forever and seeking no respite from our daily responsibilities, we must partake in no unnecessary purchases of anything, nor seek to elevate our standing in the world or our community. Individuality is slavery, pleasure is pain, free thought is indoctrination. We have always been at war with East Asia.

Or we could just let people do what they want with their own bodies. If the fact that someone has some ink bothers you that much then you can probably pay to get yourself blinded.

In my living room light fitting, the recommended bulbs are 40W equivalent SES halogen candle bulbs. Unfortunately I have tried these and they have a lifespan of a mayfly, typically they only lasted 3-6 months. It is not easy to use CFLs which have a longer life because there is insufficient room to fit all but the very narrowest. Even then their lifespan has been far less than the often claimed 10 years, usually they last about 18 months, and the light output is lower than for the equivalent halogen.

This is most likely to be due to the poor design of the light fitting which like many does not provide for the greater cooling air flow required by modern low energy bulbs. If I had realised this would be a problem I would never have bought it.

A few weeks ago I gave up with it and changed to a different fitting which hopefully will allow the bulbs to last longer.

CFLs were marketed as drop-in replacements for incandescents but this is simply not true in many cases.

Many comedians and comedy writers would just be another act at the Edinburgh fringe or in your local pub, if it wasn't for the breaks the BBC offers.  Then of course, once proven, Ch4, ITV, etc can step in and throw money at them to defect.

true,dhy615,US,usa,"The highlight of my time studying abroad in England last semester, albeit in Manchester, was seeing Chelsea play City in the Etihad and win 1-0. The atmosphere is just unparalleled with all the singing, chanting, clapping, and cheering. Nothing in the states can compare. Even coming from someone who attends one of the biggest college football schools in the country, The University of Michigan, the passion and atmosphere I experienced in the away section with all of the Chelsea fans is something I will never forget. I've never experienced such passion and emotion from a sporting event. Everybody there seemed to be connected through the club and I just am so grateful to have had that experience. From chanting and singing in the areas outside the entrance to the seating area before the game to belting ""Jose Mourinho!"" when we emerged victorious, it was all nothing short of incredible. I only wish I could have gone to see a match at The Bridge, but unfortunately I wasn't able to. But the experience I had in the away section at The Etihad was just plain awesome. If any of you from the states haven't had a chance to see Chelsea play in England, it is something I highly recommend. I've seen them play twice during US tours over the summer but it just doesn't compare.

Thanks OP for posting this video and bringing back memories of one of the greatest things I've ever experienced.

Manquillo, Lovren, Sakho and Moreno will probably end up being our strongest back 4 but who cares about the back 4 right now!? We all want to discuss fitting Mad Mario into the team!

Also 4-3-3 with Gerrard sitting, Henderson and either Lallana Coutinho or Can featuring in midfield depending on the opponent. Then either play both Balo and Sturridge up front with one drifting wide and either Sterling/Markovic as the other wide forward. Or rotate and have one of Balo/Studge on the bench at times with Lallana/Sterling/Coutinho or Markovic filling the other 2 front positions.
