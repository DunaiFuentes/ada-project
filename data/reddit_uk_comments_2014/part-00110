It totally depends how you define violence. Is getting shouted at violence? What about if YOU instigated the violence, then suffered violence in return? Does that count towards violence? 

Also, if we compare the UK to somewhere like Uganda, would they consider violence differently there? For instance, if a woman got shouted at in the UK, in a similar situation to that in Uganda, would both parties report it as violence? Or just the woman in the UK?

It's interesting also that we never really see statistics for violence committed against men in these situations, nor any indication what kind of violence is reciprocal. Neither do most of the big news outlets bother to define what the reports mean by violence, simply going for the most news grabbing headline and leaving the reader to think every woman on that list has been beaten by her partner.

"" Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.

Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object. ""


That's probably because most of the violence that you are considering violence is probably not the sort of violence outlined by the report. By the definitions of this, a woman can be shouted at, AFTER shouting at someone else, and if they hurt her feelings, that is considered violence. 

There are many other examples of why the kind of stereotypical and real violence that you are considering gets lumped in with a bunch of stuff which is incomparable to it. ",1,1397826944,null,0,1397827636,0,cgvorqz,t3_23cenc,t1_cgvorqz,t1_cgvogiv,null,1433411321,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's undoubtedly true that men (and to a lesser extent women) have an innate tendency towards violence and sexual violence. After all, we are apes, with brains shaped by evolution.

And men probably *do* tend to lack empathy compared to women.  The over-whelming number of people with empathy related disorders are male.  (These disorders aren't necessarily always a bad thing.  Just look at how much someone like Bill Gates has contributed to the world considering that he very likely falls on the low empathy side of the spectrum.)

Having said all of that - it's remarkable that we have managed to create modern societies in which the rates of both violence and sexual violence are massively lower than found throughout history.

It may seem like there's an epidemic, but the statistics tend to show that we're currently living in the safest era in history.  And Western nations are the safest societies in the world.  

Perhaps the big question is not why we rape and kill, but why we *don't* in the same numbers that we used to.

Culture isn't really a good explanation, because how do you explain the changes in culture?  

Pinker's main conclusion I think is that moral progress is essentially the product of applying *reason* to solve our problems.  Our moral sense by itself is quite fallible, but throughout the centuries using reason has allowed good ideas have won out over bad, allowing us to make slow but steady progress.

Sturridge: 20 goals and 7 assists from 24 EPL games = 0.83 goals per game, 3.5 shots per game, 2 MOMs - rating= 7.52

Hazard is ahead on MOM but that is really a reflection on the relative lack of competition within that squad.  Luis earned 14 of 28 MOMs for Liverpool. Goals as a % of team goals: Hazard has 14 of 66 = 21 % and Sturridge has 20 of 93 = 21.5%.  So that's a push.  Everything else breaks for Sturridge.  I know Hazard is an attacking midfielder and Sturridge is a fwd but Chelsea's attacking thrust comes from their midfield so - it is their goal engine.

Sterling isn't anywhere near the same class except on player rating 7.73 according to whoscored.com.  He started just 20 games (without being sidelined by injury), scored 7 goals and 1 MOM.

Your initial question was ""why is the NHS paying for this..?"". I attempted to explain the process by which decisions are made with regard to funding treatments. I then speculated as to how this may apply to a case of which we have very little detail and so the minutiae of which cannot be commented on. Admittedly, this is only an opinion, but it is really all anyone can say from the scanty information the article gives us.

Please don't try and twist my words. Here is what I said:
&gt;This is a potentially curative treatment

I'm afraid this is a fact. [There are a whole bunch of papers](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=proton+therapy+for+Mucoepidermoid+Carcinoma&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GjNRU93KCO6O7Qbwk4DgAg&amp;ved=0CDAQgQMwAA) on this treatment (with some conflicting opinion) but there are at least some people out there saying that proton therapy can cure Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma i.e. it is potentially curative.

&gt;I have no idea what evidence there is for this treatment

I would disagree that I am ""dumb as fuck"" because I haven't reviewed all the evidence for and against this treatment. What I am saying is **I** have no idea if this works. **Me** personally. **I** have only briefly reviewed the literature and **I** have no first hand experience in its use so admittedly don't know very much about it. Just because **I** have no idea, doesn't mean that **no one** has any idea. I'm sure experts in this field (i.e. the doctors treating this patient) are better equipped than you or I to decide whether this course of treatment is one which should be pursued.

I hope this helps clears things up a bit. It seems you have some personal grievance with funding decisions given how passionate you are about the subject.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"i'm torn on that opinion, though i do agree with the 2nd choice reasoning.

I think for someone like LvG 2nd choice isn't necessarily bad, and won't necessarily impact how he approaches his role. He goal is to leave his mark in the PL and he is (possibly?, definitely? not at all?) weighing out his options to ensure that he gets the best situation to do so.  Its annoying as a supporter but i can at least understand the reasoning.

I would hope that after the amount of time that this has been going on we would have some sort of indication of what is actually happening (is he waiting? or has he committed and both parties are keeping mum till end of season?) and would plan appropriately. 

I think there is probably some internal debate going on (or did go on) at the club regarding alternatives if we don't (or feel we can't) get LvG and that is where you are getting the Poch, FdB, Yakin, Tuchel, Ancelotti and Benitez talk.

If we know or reasonably believe we can't get LvG then i think we have 2 distinct groups of managers that we are doing risk/reward debates on.  The young up and coming (Poch, FdB, Yakin, Tuchel) and the proven and experienced (Benitez, Ancelotti, Klopp, Allegri, Spaletti).

Personally for me most of the ""experienced"" group all seem like pipe dreams (Ancelotti, Klopp) or underwhelming (Benitez, Allegri, Spaletti) while the ""up and coming"" all have a question mark (Poch's exit from Espanyol seems similar to AVB's exit from Spurs, FdB and Yakin are moving from small leagues, Tuchel has never held a major role) or two.  But given the choice between pipe dream, underwhelming or ""up and coming"" i would opt for the last personally.  However most of the mangers we are connected with already have a role that they are under contract for and those that don't are a bit underwhelming.  Means we still have to wait to even make a gamble.

I would prefer we come to a decision and name whomever we are going to employ as soon as possible as i think it can have a major impact on the squad and next season but i also find myself thinking that if we have a chance at someone like LvG it may be worth the risk to wait.",0,1397833722,null,0,false,0,cgvrdkw,t3_23cc8x,t1_cgvrdkw,t1_cgvqlbw,null,1433412549,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,rydleo,null,null,"I'll admit it's hard to compare Hazard to Sturridge as they play different positions.  Instead, let's compare Sterling to Hazard who play similar roles.  Sterling has played roughly 1000 minutes less than Hazard to start, so keep that in mind-

- Sterling has 7 open play goals, Hazard 10.  Goals per minute goes (slightly) to Sterling.
- Sterling has 3 assists, Hazard 7.  Assists per minutes goes to Hazard.
- Sterling has created 41 chances to Hazard's 87.  Slight edge to Hazard.
- Switching to defense, Sterling has 32 tackles and Hazard only 17.  Sterling wins that one hands down.
- Sterling has 13 clearances to Hazard's 6.  Again, hands down to Sterling.
- Interceptions are 16 to Sterling, 19 to Hazard.  So, interceptions per minute played is in Sterling's favor.

My point of all of this is it's arguable that Sterling has been as good or better than Hazard and they're more comparable than Sturridge and Hazard as they play similar positions.  Hazard has a bit of an edge attacking wise, but Sterling is clearly the more resolute and effective defender, leading in all metrics worth note defensively by a good margin.

It's time to remove those people clogging the road.  

It's what the Netherlands did.  People started to have priority over motor vehicles, cycle lanes are well funded and as a result nearly every single person there cycle, from very young children, to very old adults (look at how narrow the streets of Amsterdam can be, they have some of the same issues)

[Eight to eighty, people of all ages cycling in the Netherlands:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swqaAIkGtpA)

As numbers of people cycling increased, need for motor traffic reduced.  Less aggression and danger on the roads that don't have cycle lanes since nearly everyone young or old cycle there.

There are many main roads that could be redesigned without much issue.  Plenty of room for redesign. We can start dealing with small streets when needed.

While I certainly don't hide the fact I love cycling and I'm ""into it"".  I'd rather see the likes of me (30's, fit(ish), fast rider, confident rider) be the minority, I want my 5 year old niece to be able to cycle to school safely, I want the elderly to be able to stay active and well by cycling to the shops, I'd also like to feel safe and unpressured when I can't be arsed to pedal as fast as I can and just want to plod into town.

The CSEW provides some interesting data into the characteristics associated with being a victim of violence. Young men are most likely to be victims of violence according to the report.

Men were nearly twice as likely as women (3.8% compared with 2.1%) to have experienced one or more violent crimes in the year prior to interview. The figures also showed that single people had the highest chance of being a victim (6.6%).

Simple - next time a road needs resurfacing, you allocate a cycle path.

But on a less obvious angle - cycling actually saves the nation money via its many benefits. Cars unfortunately cost the nation money via their many negatives.

Unfortunately people rarely ever consider this because driving has become very much the acceptable mode of transport for everyone.

Personally I think changing that attitude will take years, if its changeable at all.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; It's more like a very small team in charge who listen to the forums..not great

My thinking too. The ""staff"" on the forums are just customer services (and I'd argue not necessarily as good as you get with the proper networks, which isn't that great in itself), they don't make any management decisions. Ultimately O2 (as owner and their network provider) will be deciding what Giffgaff can offer and for how much, not the customers or anyone who ""works"" for GG. That's probably why their 4G offering is quite bad, they don't really want cheapskates clogging up the 4G with unlimited data.

It seems like their customer service is especially useless when they or O2 are having problems. They just give vague ""yeah something might be broken"" type responses, and you get the twats pushing their SIM cards in the replies or asking for points for free credit.

&gt; Devon/Cornwall was good actually, used to go really rural doing ballooning (on a side note, amazing signal up in the air!)

Perhaps you'll get an O2 3G signal while in the air :) but I don't agree that the 3G signal is that good in Cornwall (I have less experience of Devon), it's very splotchy and urban areas/main roads at best. 3 aren't perfect but they do so much better, their in building coverage can suck though. In my house all of the networks suck, but at least 3 provide a free signal box so it's not a big deal (Vodafone makes you buy one, O2 doesn't really offer one except in rare circumstances, EE are stingy too)

To take one example, we maintain a pretence that the monarch can veto laws for no real reason other than because they could historically and we like to imagine that we haven't changed anything.  As a result, every bill has to go through a completely pointless ""Royal Assent"" procedure and at any given time, there are a series of misinformed campaign groups who are upset with the queen for failing to veto a law they don't like (the campaigns against the NHS reforms and same-sex marriage being two recent examples).  Another example is that lots of people are under the impression that the queen directly controls the Church of England, which is understandable given that she is its ""Supreme Governor"" and that monarchs historically had a huge influence on it, but nowadays she seems to have even less influence over the church than she does over the state.

true,CaporalViolet,num42,,"Van Gaal is obviously still the number 1 choice, but if he doesn't work out there are several interesting options. 

Pochettino: We all know how Pochettino likes to play, high-pressing and possession-based but more direct than other systems that focus on ball-retention, which likely has to do with his time playing under Bielsa 

Frank de Boer: OP explained why he would be a good fit; winner who likes to play attacking football and well-liked by Jan and Eriksen. 

Tomas Tuchel: Unlikely, but he is worth looking into for Levy &amp; Co. He has worked wonders with Mainz and has them not far away from a CL spot. He is known for his tactical flexibility and often switches between a 4-3-1-2 and 4-2-3-1. I wouldn't be surprised if he eventually became manager at Bayern. 

Outside shots/Highly unlikely: These are managers who most likely aren't even in consideration for the position, which I think is a mistake.

Alejandro Sabella: coach of the Argentine national team. Had a very successful spell in charge of Estudiantes where he won the Copa Libertadores, and lost 2-1 against Barcelona in the 2009 Club World Cup final where he was highly praised. 

He has developed a system that has allowed Messi to recreate his club form for Argentina finally, and he is known for being very tactically astute. I suspect he will be looking to manage in Europe once the World Cup is over.

Jorge Sampaoli: My personal pipe dream for next Spurs manager, and current manager of the Chilean national team. I wrote an analysis of his Chilean team here --&gt; http://thenewlibero.blogspot.com/2014/01/world-cup-preview-sampaolis-chile.html 

Also, he has said he wants to manage in Europe after the WC and has been learning English.

There's an obvious conflict between the multiculturalist  dogma that all cultures are equally worthy with the fact that Muslims tend to hold comparatively illiberal and religiously conservative beliefs (e.g. women should dress modestly, faith is a strong value).

So far, The Guardian is favoring multiculturalism over liberalism and practically every opinion piece about Islam is about how it's wrong, even racist to criticize the religion.  

Personally, I think that there's room for both sides of the debate.  I have no objection to articles praising British Islam as long as there's also room for criticisms.  What annoys me is that The Guardian on this, and many other issues, seems to have largely closed down debate and only one side is presented.

Why are UK newspapers so polarized?  It would be great if we could have one newspaper which combined the sorts of articles we see in The Guardian and The Telegraph.  All readers could have their personal views challenged and it would improve the level of argument.

Is he good enough for the world cup? No. He's still too raw for me. Reminds me of a young James Milner, all bustle but no craft or guile.

Its been about 7 or 8 years since it started but in that time I've spent about 2 months of combined time in hospital, seen many different doctors at 3 different hospitals. Had a variety of tests including an MRI scan and I think it was an EEG. Been for more appointments than I can count and have to take 7 tablets per day, 3 of one kind and 4 of another. I still do.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt; There's a lengthy cycle path near my house, they barely use it

There is almost always a reason why its not used.

Bad design, stop/starting abruptly, does not lead where the cyclist wants togo, not joined up like roads, not safe when a cyclist wants to turn right across 2 lanes of traffic, cars parked in them.

Fact is most cycle lanes are nothing more than a  token gesture, and if the roles where reversed car drivers wouldn't use them either.

As for cycling 2 abreast...Live with it. Its legal, and lets face it, car drivers drive with often an empty seat right next to them, taking up the space of 4 cyclists in their single occupancy car. Making every town and city congested in the process. And I'm as responsible of that as everyone else.


&gt; but I don't see it being adopted by cyclists.

maybe - but remember cycle lanes are not really there for the benefit of current cyclists. The ones cycling at the moment are confident to cycle on the roads already and put up with all the bullshit that comes with it. Cycle lanes should be designed to get everyone else (from 5 to 95 years old) on a bike and off the roads where they are currently too scared to ride.

&gt;**What about savings?** If money in the bank is being eroded every month how can we save up for a new car, or a deposit for a house, or make sure we have a cushion of cash to cover a family crisis?

&gt;A UBI that gives everyone in the UK a guaranteed cashflow of £12,000 per annum requires a negative interest rate of around 2.5% per month. This means that if you have £5,000 lying idle in your bank account at the beginning of the month, by the end of the month you’ll only have around £4,884 left because £116 will have been taken out and put into the UBI pot. This sounds terrible until you remember that on the first day of the next month you get your UBI payment of £1,000. If you use £116 of the UBI to replace what was “lost” the previous month you still have £5,000 in the bank and £884 of spending money. You can repeat this month after month, ad infinitum to keep your £5,000 intact. If you have other income off which you are able to live, the £1,000 that you get as UBI every month will maintain an idle balance of up to £43,000 in the bank, which is enough for most people’s “rainy day”.",0,1397848066,null,0,false,0,cgvy4sa,t3_23cxk0,t1_cgvy4sa,t1_cgvxy8z,null,1433415837,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I was... blown away. All I had to do was give my name, address, and phone number (plus some other things I can't remember). Since I still have my accent, they didn't even check for my passport!

The best example I have had:

Woke up with severe pain in my scrotum, called my GP as something really didn't feel right. They asked me if I could come in at 9:30am the same day. Doctor looked me over, was concerned due to redness and tenderness and referred me to a specialist unit at City hospital for suspected torsion as I would need an operation. She called the hospital and told them I was on my way. 

I went to City and had it checked over, the pain had decreased slightly but was still bothering me. The put it down to an infection and gave me some anti-biotics with the stringent advice that if the pain occurred again to go to A&amp;E immediately. On the 14th day of my 14 day course of anti-biotics the pain started again and really badly. Went to A&amp;E, triage nurse first to make sure I was ok and to refer me to the right department. Because a torsion is time sensitive I was moved to a room straight away. A doctor had a look over and could see that my testicle was sitting at an odd angle, they called a surgeon to have a look. 

A surgeon appeared, asked if it was ok for some medical students to have a look. Surgeon had a feel and asked ""does that feel any better because I think ive just untwisted it""

Anyhow to be certain I went for an operation, the pre-surgery room (not sure what its called) where they do the general anaesthetic was filled with nurses and surgeons, about 6 in all. They were really nice to me and I said I was scared about the situation. One nurse reassured me and then injected me, it was like ice going into my arm, ""don't close your eyes, keep them open and count back from 100"" I remember 98ish and I was gone. 

Woke up with a nurse next to my bed who was monitoring me, then a doctor came to check me over. Then went to the ward, was very groggy, it was about 10pm so everyone was in bed. They asked if I was hungry and I really was, the nurse went and got me a sandwich, a drink and some fruit :) 

Spent about 18 hours in the ward, got morphine, constant check ups and then I was discharged.

Not one penny has been asked for or was paid on the day. 

Its not perfect, but I really couldn't have asked for more.

Exactly. *If* you have health insurance. Many, especially those on low incomes, simply cannot afford healthcare insurance. I'm no expert on the prices, but after some googling, you're looking at around £10,000 a year for a families medical insurance, which is much higher than general taxation for many lower income families in the UK.

Plus I'm not sure how that's relevant anyway. You pay for healthcare insurance, and you pay for the NHS. The main difference is that making it optional and private increases the prices and discriminates against the poor.

Don't get me wrong, I still love the NHS. It's principles are great. But come on guys, it needs to continously strive to be better. I think constantly comparing the NHS to the American system which happens on reddit all the time is wrong (most developed nations actually have some form of universal care, America is the exception). We should be comparing the NHS to other European/Scandinavian countries who outperform the NHS in many areas. 


- We need to be easing the pressure on A&amp;E.


- Demanding more GP services out of hours and longer than 5 minute consultation periods and being allowed to discuss more than one symptom (I've heard of many GPs where this is the case). 


- Raising the standard of care in many of the poorly performing hospitals.


- reducing the burden on nursing staff and doctors who seem to work harder than anywhere else in the World. 


- making the NHS more efficient. So much money is wasted. Failed IT projects. Staff being made redundant on large packages, then being re-hired a week later as a contractor on £1,000 a day.


- create databases that actually work and allow hospitals and GPs to communicate and get rid of ridiculous paper files. Use national wide data to improve care and focus money where needed. My GP had to send a letter to a specialist. Who then sent a confirmation letter back with a date and time. Then my specialist had to mail my results back to my GP which took weeks. Seriously, it's the year 2014.

This is one section that stuck out:

&gt; Professor Esmail's report for the BMJ was published on the same day as an official review of the exam, also written by him, which was commissioned by the General Medical Council following long-standing concerns about its fairness. His six-month review found that ethnic minority doctors trained in the UK were four times more likely to fail the exam at the first attempt than UK-trained white candidates, while ethnic minority doctors trained abroad were 14 times more likely to fail. The two reports used the same data.

&gt; **In the GMC report, Professor Esmail and co-author Professor Chris Roberts say they cannot ""confidently exclude bias from the examiners in the way that they assess non-white candidates""**, but did not include the specific statement that ""subjective bias owing to racial discrimination"" cannot be ruled out – leading to disagreement over their conclusions.

I'm not sure how the case you mentioned is a way to tactically eliminate discussion when a GMC commissioned review said they can't 'confidently exclude bias from the examiners in the way that they assess non-white candidates'.

Plus, the allegations of racism are another part of the discussion on whether the tests are biased against non-white candidates. Couldn't your comments be seen as a way to ' tactically eliminate the potential of a serious and much-needed pragmatic discussion', by claiming people who do think the tests are biased are only trying to avoid criticism by pulling the race card?

However so many people have a mental disconnect between ""money that comes from my pay packet"", ""services funded from taxation"" and ""limitless pot of cash at the end of the rainbow"".

Actually it does. 

That's why we have bodies like NICE and QALYs, so we can ascertain if that £20,000 cancer drug that extends your life by two weeks is *really* worth the cost to the public purse or if unfortunately, its not something that the limited resources of the NHS can really support.

Unfortunately we live in an entitlement culture where people feel that they have ""paid in"" and are ""entitled"" to everything under the sun, no matter what the invisible cost to the tax payer is.

true,Micros0,null,null,"What some of you here need to understand is that these aren't real muslims.

Islam is a religion of peace. Most of these people who resort to brutality are forced there by the British government, and the British people. Many of you here who take Quranic verses out of context and claim that Islam is a religion of violence do so, I think because you are racists.

Ultimately all of these problems can be traced back to White racism against muslims. Do you really think they would go off to fight in wars if they weren't treated like dirt by the native British population and government?

These people are given hardly any money by the government, they are given small houses to live in, the food they are given by the government is of low quality, their Islamic values are rejected by Britain at large. How can you expect them to be peaceful when they are treated so terribly by British people ?

I think we need to have a lot more sympathy with muslims and allow them to have aspects of their own culture in Britain. Let's face it, British culture is outdated and racist by nature. People here oppose sharia but I do not see what the harm would be in letting British muslims have their own sharia courts and sharia areas.

I saw people here complaining about the muslims who went around doing the ""muslim patrol"", saying ""this is Britain, if you want sharia why not go to Saudi Arabia?"". How racist can you get? 

Do you not realize how disrespectful it is to muslims to drink alcohol in public, or for women to wear short skirts or be promiscuous. This is extremely offensive to muslims and to their religion. What ever happened to respecting religious people?

If you want to see an end to violence then you will simply have to adopt some Islamic values. The UK is already 5% muslim, in time that figure will grow. You tell me, if the muslim population is growing in the UK, why aren't their views being respected in the courts and in the law?

This is a belief that is echoed by many muslims. As more and more muslims come here you will have to make accommodations for our culture. This is a view that is held by all my muslim brothers and one that we are scared to say in public for fear of racist, violent reprisal. 

We are tired of being oppressed by British culture and it is about time we got some representation through common law, and it was about time Britain changed its White racist culture to be more in line with Islamic values.

A few months ago, I found myself in an A&amp;E, at midnight, with a fracture.  The issue was that the A&amp;E was so busy, and so badly run, whilst dealing with difficult people.  After 6 hours, I hadn't been seen by a Dr.  I knew what the problem was, the x-ray tech knew it, but the doctors were too busy.  After an incident when a user had tried to hit a nurse, that I'd managed to stop because I had one good arm, I was told to go to the walk in centre in 2 hours time when it opened.

What a difference.  The walk in place was a veritable utopia, the A&amp;E was rotten.  I was done within 15 min of being in the walk in centre, I'd spend about 7 hours in the A&amp;E.

Absolutely.

&gt; I thought it was well known he was the driving force behind many of Tony's best ideas

Yes he was.

Unfortunately he was also visibly associated in the minds of the electorate with ""selling off the gold"" and ""wrecking the economy"", even though it was the actions of his chancellor that propped up the UK economy when it was all going to shit, and the underlying issues were global rather than local.

Don't get me wrong now, I think the Conservatives called it right and their policies are paying dividends, but Darling make the right calls when it counted and even the Conservatives supported him at the time.

They got a shitty hand and they played it to the best of their abilities, but that just wasn't enough to overcome a toxic image in the eyes of the British public.

At the start:

Save £200 in a savings account that earns 1.55% pa, after 3 years this is worth £200 * 1.0155^3 = £209.44

OR

Pay off £200 * 97% = £194 of mortgage at 2.69% pa, after 3 years this will have saved you £194 * 1.0269^3 = £210.08




With 1 year to go:

Save £200 in a savings account that earns 1.55% pa, after 1 year this is worth £200 * 1.0155 = £203.10

OR

Pay off £200 * 97% = £194 of mortgage at 2.69% pa, after 1 years this will have saved you £194 * 1.0269 = £199.22




I used 1.55% as that is what Halifax are currently offering on their online ISA. You might be able to get a better rate elsewhere. You'd save more by initially paying off the mortgage but it doesn't take long for it to be better saving as cash. Interest rates could fall though, but I can't see them getting below the 0.75% allofthekings mentioned in his comment. You might prefer to just save wholly as cash for the added benefit of it being there for emergencies.

What I have been saying throughout my posts is that we need to have discussion on issues, even if people disagree with them. I agree with you that certain topics shouldn't be removed from discussion because some claim they are racist. However, if you claim people only complain about racism to hide their incompetence, that is trying to remove a subject from discussion because you disagree with it. In this case, it's the topic of whether the GMC exams are biased against non-white people, where you seem to claim the only reason the court case was begun was to tactically eliminate serious discussion, which in itself is ignoring a line of argument simply because you disagree. 

I assume your next post is going to be something along the lines of 'if you don't think you know better, how come you are still disagreeing', or something along those lines, so I'll answer that in this post too. 

I don't claim to know better than the High Court, which is why I'm not saying whether GMC exams are racist or not. However, that doesn't mean I think the High Court is infallible, or that I can't disagree with their judgement, and I don't think that their judgement should be the be all and end all to a discussion. For example, the Court of Appeal (which, alongside the High Court and Crown Court is the senior court in England) refused to hear the case of [Eweida v BA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eweida_v_British_Airways_plc) in 2010, showing they wouldn't have found for her, but discussion still continued regardless of whether she was discriminated against or not, with the ECHR eventually finding for her.

I think the people that have that disconnect are just idiots, full stop, and highlighting the source of the funding will do nothing anyway.

&gt;That's why we have bodies like NICE and QALYs

Except that has to do with appropriate use of the money, and nothing to do with public perception which is what the person I was replying to was talking about. You think the person that has problems understanding where NHS funding comes from knows anything about NICE or QALYs? Not to mention, QALYs aren't absolute, and arguably NICE have undermined themselves by affording extra value to drugs that prolong the last few months of life, basically because of public pressure. So a drug could fail the QALY calculation, and still be approved because it is somehow decided that those extra months are worth the extra money. It's a difficult position, sure, I'm just saying that these things have issues.

&gt;Unfortunately we live in an entitlement culture where people feel that they have ""paid in"" and are ""entitled"" to everything under the sun, no matter what the invisible cost to the tax payer is.

No, I don't think that anyone works in the NHS ""for the money"".

That doesn't mean that you need to plead poverty or pretend that you earn a pauper's wage either - I've seen the Agenda for Change pay scales and I know as well as you do that the average NHS nurse earns a very competitive wage (even excluding London weighting) that more than keeps up with the ""average incoming"" in the United Kingdom, even before you consider the pension that they get.

Now, that's not to say that NHS staff don't have to deal with their fair share of shit - I know as well as you do that it's not an *easy* job or one that someone can coast in - but it's not as poorly paid as some people would like to make out.

&gt; Fact is, most NHS jobs are shitty, hard-working ones

I don't dispute that you have to work hard in the NHS, but I don't know what your definition of ""shitty"" is.

&gt; I mean stuff like: you've been working in Orthopaedics for seven years, you want to try something different, maybe oncology, you've heard good things about the ward sister there and you fancy a change. 

So apply for it and make your case then.

&gt; You haven't got the experience, but good reviews from your patients can help. Is this so detestable to you?

Orthopaedics is not oncology.

It's not detestable to me no, but if someone spent seven years in orthopaedics (and I have me own horror stories there) then changed over to oncology then yes, I *would* have my concerns there - why on earth would I not?

That's not to say that they wouldn't make a good oncology practitioner, but the two specialisms are not directly comparable as you well know.

If my wife had cancer and was being treated by a nurse that transferred in last week... yeah, I'm going to be worried about that.

Absolutely people need to be trained and it's good that we afford people opportunities, but recommendations an Thank You cards from one speciality do not necessarily suggest a suitability for another.

*Ulster History Museum
*Ulster Folk And Transport Museum
*Titanic Museum


Do a bit of shopping around Royal Avenue and Victoria Square. It really is a lovely city centre. My personal favourite pub if I'm showing someone the area is Bittles. It's cozy, and encapsulates the charm of the city well. Even visit Belfast Castle and cavehill, there's some cracking views and the castle itself is fancy. I'm sure many others here could give you good restaurant recommendations. If you're feeling flush have a drink in the Merchant, it's pretty decedent. 


From there, how about renting a car? That way you can travel all the way around the north coast to Derry. Take the M2 up to Ballymena and then head East to Glenarm (avoid Larne, it's shit). Glenarm is a lovely, charming and colourful little village and from there you can make your way up to Moyle via the A2. Lovely towns there include Carnlough, Waterfoot and Cushendall (in particular stop around Cushendall and Waterfoot, here you're in the Glens Of Antrim, possibly my favourite place in the whole island, the views of the Glens- giant old valleys formed by glaciers- are phenomenal). From there, you can head round to Ballycastle (lovely town again), Ballintoy (head into the harbour for some excellent grub and some tea, then take a walk around the local caves and nooks and crannies- beautiful scenery), then from there head further west towards the Giant's Causeway. The Giant's Causeway is really incredible to look at, you'll want to spend a good while there taking photos. From there, you can head around to Portrush and the triangle area, where you can find Dunluce Castle (it's really cool), and Portrush itself is a fun, quirky little town full of interesting things to explore. From there, drive further west to the city of Derry (the scenery on the way there is excellent too). Derry's a fun, vibrant city that's full of history.


Sorry for the block of text, just typed it out as it came to my head. You can cram this in within 6 days easily, as you only need a couple of days in Belfast, and a lot of the places in Moyle aren't necessary aside from wonderful photo ops, though you mention taking in the culture, so I do recommend spending a little time in say, Cushendall.

I love [Alley Cat](http://belfastcraic.com/alley-cat/) in the city centre, good beer and food! (That's a blog I started and never really continued with but has some suggestions).

If you fancy treating yourselves to some fabulous cocktails try [The Merchant](http://www.themerchanthotel.com/). One of Belfast's only five star hotels. The cocktails are expensive but totally worth it! (I am a little biased as we got married there a couple of weeks ago and I love it!!!). For the cocktail bar you want the Waring Street entrance up the flight of stairs. The food in the Great Room is fab too and not actually terribly expensive.

For fine dining [Tedford's](http://www.tedfordsrestaurant.com/index.php) is lovely. A little bit on the expensive side but worth it.

Rock up to the county hospital, get seen straight away - nurse cleans me up, starts injecting freeze into my leg and spends the next three hours stitching it all up whilst keeping me upbeat and joking around with me. I leave with some painkillers and some advice, all bandaged up and stitched together. Go to the GP after a few weeks, get the stitches removed and job was a good'un!

Benn's words that if we could find money to kill people, we can find money to help people, to me are what should be the central tenet of NHS management.

UEFA requires 8 on the 25 man roster to compete in Europa or CL.

For the PL currently we have 15 foreign players:
 
1. Ade
 
2. Soldado
 
3. Eriksen
 
4. Holtby
 
5. Dembele

6. Sandro
 
7. Capoue

9. Kaboul
 
10. Vlad
 
11. Jan

12. Lloris

13. Gomes

14. Lamela
 
15. Chadli

Meaning we have 2 slots open before we hit our max (3 if you consider that Gomes will leave in the summer) in the PL.

In UEFA we need to have 8 (and 4 of those need to come from the club itself) players to compete in Europa (provided we qualify) we can have this covered with Dawson, Walker, Andros, Siggy, Kane, Zeki, Bentaleb and 1 other player.

Also keep in mind if we were to send say Rose, Naughts, Jake and Lennon out it would depend on who we brought in as well.  Caulker is one we are rumored with and he would be homegrown, same with Lallana, Milner, Davies, Reid.

We aren't as bad off as people think in terms of the homegrown rules and certainly not bad off enough to do Jake a disservice by keeping him on the roster as a bench player when he could be playing regularly for someone else.",0,1397861320,null,0,false,0,cgw3yon,t3_23cc8x,t1_cgw3yon,t1_cgw2vac,null,1433418672,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Ziggaroll,null,null,"Hazard has obviously been playing primarily as inside forward all season. Everybody knows this. The term forward doesn't just mean striker, it can be used interchangeably for the attacking players.  But that's besides the point. 

I don't care what some website says he plays. He plays in the central midfield in a 4-3-3. The midfield trio is Alonso, Modric, and Di Maria.  The forwards have been bale on the RW, Benz playing as striker, and Ronaldo on the LW. This would be *painfully obvious* for anybody who has watched Madrid this season.See this: http://this11.com/boards/abGrioGai3.jpg

 There are exceptions like the Barcelona game where the formation was switched to accommodate Ronaldo's injury. 

""Angel Di Maria has had his role shifted in the past couple of month playing on the left side of central midfield in Madrid’s 4-3-3. Di Maria is of course renowned for his attacking work, but his workrate is a major factor as to why he’s a main-stay in this Madrid side. Against Schalke 04, the Argentine made the most tackles on the pitch, which gives an insight to his ‘secondary’ role in midfield; making sure Madrid aren’t exposed on the left flank. Di Maria is still of course one of Madrid’s most prominent attackers despite his more defensive role. According to stats, no player in Europe created more chances in the this month. ""

Since taxation is re-distributing wealth, it must, through some process (capital accumulation) become concentrated, it is that process that needs to be disrupted and it can be if people organise and exert themselves as human being and individuals and reserve their right to control their own lives and not be controlled by either governments or capitalists (after all if we were to characterise the rule of capitalists in the economic sphere to a political system, it would be totalitarianism, the economic sphere is more important since we spend more time there, economic freedom however is a paradoxical idea that means the right to exploit - we want all our life to be free)

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;If across the economy the cost of a man hours labour were to increase by 25% then the purchasing power of money in that respect would have been decreased by the same amount.

Not it wouldn't. If no one could buy a service the service doesn't just remain the same price, it generally falls, especially when the gap we're talking to is 25%. The prices must fall or the businesses will fail to get any sales at all. A new equilibrium would be established, and that's exactly what happened when the working-day was shortened. If prices increased 25% then wages would increase, in fact they must to retain the demand in the economy.

&gt;This is patently untrue.

You don't provide any evidence. I meant under the general reign of capital, workers around the world work on average between 16 to 8 hours a day, never in human history have human worked that much, that is a fact, and unlike you I have evidence.

For example the famous anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, surveying the data on contemporary hunter-gatherers, exploded the Hobbesian myth in an article entitled ""The Original Affluent Society"". They work a lot less than we do, and their work is hard to distinguish from what we regard as play. Sahlins concluded that *""hunters and gatherers work less than we do; and rather than a continuous travail, the food quest is intermittent, leisure abundant, and there is a greater amount of sleep in the daytime per capita per year than in any other condition of society.""* They worked an average of four hours a day, assuming they were *""working""* at all. Their *""labor,""* as it appears to us, was skilled labor which exercised their physical and intellectual capacities; unskilled labor on any large scale, as Sahlins says, is impossible except under industrialism.

true,GruffalosChild,null,null,"Don't know if this is answered below. We moved over 15 months ago, from Bristol. Our health insurance is tied to my work. Every place is different, so I can only speak to the two places I have worked (government jobs). I paid $360 a month in health insurance premiums for a family of 3 at one place, $120 at another. We pay $20 when we see a doctor, $120 if we have an inpatient stay in a hospital. Drugs are funny ones. Each insurance company will have something they call a formulary, which is a list of their preferred drugs. AT my current job we pay $7 for generic drugs, $14 for drugs on their formulary and $50 for non-preferred. My husband's insulin is not on the formulary, although an alternative is. So we pay $50 for his prescription.

At my last job we paid 20% of the retail price for preferred, 45% for non-preferred. You can get the costs for drugs on the Costco website. Insulin is around $270 every 6 weeks for 1 prescription. Plus 7 other high cost drugs.


We also have a FSA account, which is like the childcare voucher scheme in the UK where you have money taken out of your salary before tax and pay tax on a lower amount. We put away $500 each year and save $100 all in.

I did a huge 'are we better off' costing after we had been here a year. In the UK I had my salary from the council, child benefit, tax credits, and my husband's ESA (before they cut it). Then take out rent, council tax, PAYE, road tax, etc. In the USA I had my government salary, less rent, federal tax (no state tax in my state), social security (same as pension tax), and so on. And even though it's a gigantic pain to negotiate plans, FSA account reimbursements, shopping for prices on drugs, we are significantly better off financially. 

Oh - part of the Affordable Care Act means there is an out of pocket cap. Each plan is different, I'm not sure the overall rule. But on our current plan we can't pay out more than $7k a year or $750 on drugs. If we get billed for another over that, all costs go to the insurance company.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; Hazard has obviously been playing primarily as inside forward all season.

Wrong. Ronaldo plays as an ""inside forward"" (sick of all this football manager bs). Bale plays as inside forward because they have Alonso, Modric and Di Maria that track back for them. An inside forward's defensive work-rate is abysmal. Have you even watched Hazard at all this season? IMO he doesn't even play as a LW but more of a LM and only stays up during corners because of his pace on the counter.

Also, you do realize that the ""inside forward"" role is just fiction, right? If you're going to consider Hazard as a forward, you should consider Oscar as a forward as well. And if you count Oscar as a forward, then Di Maria becomes a forward also, since Oscar and Di Maria play in the exact same position.

And you're linking me to, firstly, a blog, and secondly, a blog that cites Bleacher report for its posts. 

Also, if you knew anything about football you'd realize that a 4-3-3 is such a fluid system that it usually has no problem turning into a 4-2-3-1. All Madrid need to do is get Di Maria to push forward in between the two lines and for Modric to tuck in..... Which is pretty much what happens when Madrid attack. Hence, Di Maria is a CAM, not a CM.

&gt;This would be painfully obvious for anybody who has watched Madrid this season.See this: http://this11.com/boards/abGrioGai3.jpg

What am I supposed to do with a random image of a formation? Willian plays in a withdrawn role as a RW as well. Does that some how mean he is better than everyone at Madrid? I don't understand this logic at all.

&gt; Against Schalke 04, the Argentine made the most tackles on the pitch, which gives an insight to his ‘secondary’ role in midfield; making sure Madrid aren’t exposed on the left flank. 

""secondary"". Your own source is proving your point false.

&gt;According to stats, no player in Europe created more chances in the this month. ""

So because he created more chances than anyone else in ONE month he is better than everyone we've got? Gtfo. I just posted stats in reply to your other post that show Hazard has been a better offensive player than Di Maria all season.

I think if I had to mark one thing that really brought Labour down - it's that they didn't act fast enough to oust Blair. He was toxic to the party. It was his inability to change his policy in the face of the single greatest mass protest I've ever experienced in my life time. He poo pooed it. You could site other factors such as their 'Conservative Lite' attitudes or their inability to cement overseas treaties with some of our non-US allies but overall it's so hard to like a party that actively encouraged a Leader that appeared to Follow. The death knell was playing star and stripes when his career hit the toilet pan. Poor Gordon Brown was left to go down with the ship. Sometimes, no matter how policitcally informed you are, pride gets the better of you.

https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Panfield/@51.878395,0.496635,3a,75y,210.97h,70.6t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sr8-WQr7TRXzH3iGGqHm6xQ!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d8f107755e8761:0xc2667c5005c6fb2f

This road for example has a major gas pipe facility down the end of it, you can't just relocate that for some bikes. During the summer there isn't that lovely grass strip either, it's hedgerow used for wildlife and farming.

Obviously an extreme example but seriously, you can't just say everywhere should have a bicycle lane. Even in most cities, where do you displace the cars to? Use government money to knock a local building down and build a car park?",0,1397865285,null,0,false,0,cgw5k7g,t3_23crpa,t1_cgw5k7g,t1_cgw2s9g,null,1433419426,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think Suarez is plenty of firepower to deal with Norwich; 2 up top probably won't be necessary. It may end up looking more like a 4-3-1-1-1 in the end, and almost certainly asymmetrical.

I just got the cheapest, shittiest plan there is, because I can't afford anything better -- it's $120/mo for just me, and I pay 100% of everything unless I hit my $6k deductible. Some of my prices are lowered a bit (birth control is $20/mo now instead of $39/mo), some are not (last I checked they don't cover my inhaler, but I haven't purchased one since I got insured). It's pretty much just catastrophic insurance -- if I get hospitalized or something I'll ""only"" come out with $6k in bills (and yes, it would be all $6k) plus costs for whatever they don't cover, which is probably a lot, because like I said -- cheapest, crappiest plan out there. The only saving grace is it's through Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is generally regarded as a good company to go through.

My employer insurance, which I can't afford, is something like $240/mo for the cheapest plan (again, for just me, some of these other posters have families and such), and instead of the ""you pay 100% to a cap and then we pay 100%"" that my plan has, it's like ""you pay 80% before the cap and then 20% after it,"" but instead of a $6k cap, it's a $2500 cap.

It sucks either way, really. Generally the less you pay monthly, the higher your deductible/cap before your insurance is actually useful.",0,1397867924,null,0,false,0,cgw6l5p,t3_23deux,t1_cgw6l5p,t1_cgvx3p4,null,1433419909,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,GruffalosChild,null,null,"Excellent question! I feel like I should do an AMA for brits thinking of going to America...

What happens in an emergency? Pre-ACA (i.e. Obama care, affordable care act) it all depended on your insurance. When you hear about people going bankrupt or not able to get insurance, this is all pre-ACA.

But now in the new world this is how it works: You will buy your health insurance through your employer or through the health insurance exchange. In your first 5 years of being an immigrant that is all you are eligible for - no Medicaid (poor people) or Medicare (old people). 

So let's pretend your brother was in full-time employment, had health insurance and got sick. He'd have co-pays (i.e. think of it as the excess payment on your car insurance) of $20 - $75 for his doctors and specialists visits, maybe $50 for ambulance, and copays on the drugs, etc. But there is an out of pocket cap. Which means all in each year the cost may be $50,000 (made that up), but you only pay your co-pays up to your annual out of pocket cap. So mine is $7,000 for our family (this is lower for a single person) - which means you'll get hit with some big bills in Jan &amp; Feb, then pay nothing.

Also, in the BAD OLD DAYS this also meant his health insurance could drop him, or refuse to cover anything ""pre-existing"". So anything related to his illness would not be covered, but that is now all illegal. Oh and also it is now illegal for insurance to have a 'lifetime limit' on treatment. In the bad old days some companies would say to a person with cystic fibrosis, 'welp, we've bought you enough oxygen. Good luck.' That is now illegal.


If he was here and maybe working part-time and didn't buy health insurance through the exchange, or wasn't working and wasn't on someone else's insurance (parent, spouse, or family member who can claim him as a dependant) and got sick? well, it depends on what state he is in and how long he has been here. Less than 5 years, I'd fly back to the UK. Over 5 years and he can apply for Medicaid. And that is a messy issue that depends on which state he lives in.

There are no premiums, deductibles, co-pays, or coinsurance charges levied upon patients using the NHS at the point of delivery.

For inpatient hospital care: **up to 50% of the 1st day's cost.** You know 24 hrs. in an American hospital can exceed $10K/day, right.

NHS physicians cannot ""opt-out"" of providing general and specialty medical care for patients because they're covered by the NHS rather than private insurance or paying solely out of their own pocket.

In my dad's 52 years alive he has only seen 1 more championship than I have from all those same teams. And these teams don't even give me hope for competing for the title and losing every single year fucking sucks. I said to myself, I really want to start following this league because I have loved the sport my whole life and played while I was younger, so why would I choose a team that sucks? I watched the 04-05 season as a neutral but the ass beating that we put down that year convinced me to support from then on. 




But now I really do love this club, and not for them being winners. I just love the club. It has become one with every other team that I have supported since birth. Also, this community has given me a chance to converse with so many more people sharing the same passion that I really feel a part of it all from thousands of miles away.

*The group's strength is unknown, with estimates that ranged from just 850 to several thousand full-time fighters in 2007. Some sources believe that the group is formed of 5,500 foreign fighters that is its backbone, as well as 2,000 Syrians from the northern part of the country and about 15,000 The people, performing “secondary roles”. There is also a special unit, consisting of 250 militants.*

The mujahideen are generally going out there to fight with ISIS, however...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nusra_Front

*Its goal is to overthrow the Assad government and to create an Pan-Islamic state under the Sharia (the moral code and religious law of Islam) and aims to reinstate the Caliphate.*

The mujahideen arent out there having a jolly boys outing with some bloody spendid levantine tiffins they are out there trying to overthrow Assad in order to create an islamic state. 

These people are the vanguard who will create an islamic state which will expand across the whole world, that's takfiri logic. 

It's Islamism that drives these people, they make their own rules up as they go along, killing muslims,  they can get away with that because Sayyid Qutb justified it in a book written in a prison cell in the 1950s, never mind the quran and the fact that would be a death sentence under the very same sharia law they propose.

-The free tour of Stormont Parliament buildings is a unique experience (similar to the White House as a must see for those who visit DC).
-While you are driving around the North Coast, stop in any village's chippie for a fish supper (aka: fish and chips) or a pasty bap (indescribable for an American palate).
-As for the Titanic Museum, I thought it was particularly informative of a time in Belfast that is not taught in history classes in America. The ticket price is a little high (£15-20), but as a visitor, this would be a one time occurrence and why not support the local economy.
-Speaking of local economy, St. George's Market, is a bit touristy, but has local merchant wares and usually local bands playing. Its nice to just buy a coffee or a filled soda and people watch.
-Tayto factory tour, is on my ""to-do"" list for my next visit later this year. I would kill for some cheese &amp; onion right now.

This is how it needs to be done !

Publish ""league tables"" of who avoids the most tax and let people vote with their wallets. HMRC is well placed to create an ""App"" so that you can easily tell how much the people you give your custom to contribute to the running of the country.

It should be done *fairly* though. I'm not sure it matters too much whether corporations avoid corporation tax, because they pay a *shit ton* of tax in the form of VAT, national insurance and business rates. Not to mention providing employment for almost everyone.

It then runs for a hundred metres or so, before reaching another t-junction, at which point it dumps you back into the gutter on the side of the road - the t-junction is extremely wide, and has poor visibility thanks to building works.

The cycle path then disappears completely for a while, only to resume a short distance before a tram stop. The tram stop cuts into the cycle path entirely. This pattern continues until you reach the region where parked cars either stop in the cycle path, or park alongside it but pull out right in front of you.

Thanks to the stops, in order to successfully ride down that route one has to regularly cross the outer tram line. To do this, you have to slow down, arc outwards and then back across at a sharp angle. 

I know what happens if you don't do this, because a bus driver overtook me once, when I was stuck between the two lines. He didn't give me enough space to get back across, and instead decided to overtake me, shortly before a traffic island. As the bus started to pull back across, I couldn't brake fast enough to get out of his way. I only came to a halt after I pulled left, found my wheel caught in a line and went over the front of the bike, causing damage to myself and to my vehicle.

My take on it is, given the amount of time I have to spend at Queens, both in outpatient/inpatient etc looking after my parents, is if that is a failing hospital given the level of care everyone's received, the NHS isn't in that much trouble.

Now, I could give specific examples of not so good care there, but the overall impressions are good. A lot of the problems are understandable in the context of the area anyway. Bed space is always a problem (not in an hours on trolley way, in the way the 4 hour wait time from a&amp;e to a ward is almost always cutting it fine or breeched). But this area has a lot of elderly people who they can't release alone and have to wait for people to be bothered to pick them up.

Twelfth

Scarva

Relief of Derry


For a good Twelfth (of July) head south or west, and pick a flagship. I'd suggest Markethill even if its not a flagship as it will be the biggest. Stay out of Belfast as its shit and they only have flute bands.

Scarva (14th of July) is probably my favourite, it's a Black parade and is the third largest public event in Northern Ireland (First being the North West 200, second the Red Bull Airshow apparently). Pipes, Drums, Flutes Brass and accordions, in a quaint little village in county Down. Bands and Preceptorys come from all over to attend.

The Relief of Derry Parade (9th of August) is another good one. And is pretty large we are generally finished our lap of the city before some clubs have even started, and they've even taken the spit shields down in the diamond. No pipes however as there are competitions on the same day.

The biggest band parade is Killcluney and its held in Markethill, (first Friday in June?) its a good night with plenty of variation. 

For Lambegs (largest drum in the world that's played whilst carried, also loudest but never played whilst wearing ear plugs, ""proper"" musicians seem to dislike that) again you're in Markethill for Clady Day (last Saturday in July) although these events seem to be more about the drum than the playing of them.

true,bonew23,null,null,"Well in general no religion is really compatible with modern society. The cultural norms and way of life back in the times when these religions started are just completely different to how things work in this country right now. This is why moderates don't follow their religion to the letter. 
Conflicts over ideology and power by various Christian factions made most of Europe a warzone for centuries, the Middle East is currently in a very similar position, just add modern weapons and the twattery of social media which makes for a great propaganda platform for militants to target young impressionable people. 

Do you also think that moderate Christians are a problem, because their book says some rather nutty things about tatoos, women and gays? If they assimilate to modern society why should we have a problem with them? It's a waste of energy whining about those who have done exactly what they should do to fit in. We should be encouraging people to be reasonable, not bully them into thinking they can't ever fit in no matter what they do, as that will cause them to simply push back.

It's fair to say that the average muslim has more ""fire and brimstone"" views than the average christian in this country, but I think most people are open to change, provided they are placed in an environment which exposes them to other cultures and viewpoints. People bring their cultures with them, but over time the more abrasive parts of it will fade away.

The hardliners are the ones that we need to target, they are the nutters driving the changes in schools. Extremists have a lot of energy and drive to get the changes they want, while the moderates have actual things to do in their lives. It's the classic problem that can cause extremists to have a large effect on politics despite not being a massive majority. 

The future is in the education of the children, and the priority should be on ensuring the education is largely secular and mixed, rather than allowing nuts to exert influence over schools which risk ghettoising the Muslim communities.

I think this is a legitimate comment.

Someone in the field of say science with 20 years experience could very well be a better teacher than those who have trained to teach with little or no field experience.

Ill admit I don't think that for the most part that would be the case. As those with stacks of experience could probably earn more money staying away from teaching vs those who look to leave their current carrier to teach.

Taking myself as an example....Im relatively successful in my field (art related). I have pretty crap school results. But I have taught students in a collage/uni capacity in the past, which was as a result of my skills and success at work. And I have no doubt I would be a better artist than say 95% of (school level) art teachers out there. But I suppose the question should be would I be a better teacher. And that I cannot say.

&gt;﴾وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِاللَّـهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ‌ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿٨
And of the people are some who say, ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day,"" but they are not believers. [2:8] Saheeh International
﴾يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّـهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُ‌ونَ ﴿٩
They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not. [2:9] Saheeh International
note: they think that Allah is in their side, but actually not.
﴾فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَ‌ضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّـهُ مَرَ‌ضًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ ﴿١٠
In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie. [2:10] Saheeh International 

(Of course, this is a direct quote from the Quran.)

So, if the commenters on /r/islam are any guide, this is what many Muslims think of those who are only going through the motions of believing in Islam- that they deserve a painful punishment from Allah.

Banning wont happen - at best roads will be closed and re designated for other forms of transport (walking/cycling/bus). But the basic backbone will remain. The powers that be will make it harder to drive and/or easier to cycle. People wont like it, but in the long run its a more sensible option.

Edit:  Maybe that's too pessimistic.  It's *not* just the Christian world which made peace with secularism.  Many modern Jewish people are even more secular than Christians and there are many British Sikhs, Hindus and other minorities who get along perfectly well.

Even so, I think it is worth reminding ourselves that the enlightenment happened once and once only.

We seriously need a result here. We've lost 4 in a row but takeover talk and what seems to be a lot of change behind the scenes has given the fans a bit of optimism. We need to capitalise on that. Because if we lose, that feeling will disappear. We will be left with yet another home defeat, our 5th straight loss, looking over our shoulder and wondering where we are going to get the points to survive. The players heads will drop again before the 2 huge games against Swansea/Hull.


They are without Rodriguez and Ramirez, which means they will have less pace and runners in behind Lambert than usual. They are also pretty much done for the season, Pocchetino future uncertain, lost 3 of their last 4. But they are still a very good side. Lambert Lallana Schneiderlin and co are well capable of beating us. They are bound to dominate possession and put us under a lot of pressure. But that isn't the worst thing as it gives us a chance to get our counter working.

true,Jarrrp,tardis,TARDIS,"The BBC don't employ anyone full time in terms of programme production. Everyone you see making Doctor Who are free lancers who have been employed on a very short term contract in order to make one series of Doctor Who, even just a couple of episodes sometimes. Other than that they get jobs at other companies and other shows at the BBC throughout the year. The BBC have internships and apprenticeships you can apply for including the Production Trainee Scheme and the Production Apprenticeship Scheme (one of which is based in Cardiff) which closed for 2014 applicants a couple of months ago (I applied for the Trainee Scheme). The schemes are one of the best ways into the BBC and the industry as a whole but also do not guarantee work on Doctor Who. There's a lot more to the BBC than Doctor Who. But you also need to remember that no one is employed full time in this industry because the work doesn't exist all year round.

I hope that answers your questions. 

TL:DR Start small and find opportunities to get experience in the industry such as apprenticeships and trainee schemes from the BBC and other production companies.

true,darksurfer,null,null,"&gt; couldn't we do something to level the playing field with smaller businesses?

we do. the tax system has all sorts of rules and variations to try and balance out the ""harm"" done to the people / businesses being taxed. 

for example, corporation tax for profits under [£300,000 per year is 20% and increases on a sliding scale to to 26% for profits above £1.5 million per year](https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates). (These figures might sound like a lot, but the're not so much when you understand that it's probably split between a number of directors).

The key thing to take away though is whoever is publishing these ""corporations don't pay taxes"" is being disingenuous at best, and wilfully misleading for their own reasons.

Here is a chart of where corporation tax fits in the overall UK tax revenue. It's significant, but note that it's a relatively small part of the total. 

http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/25/tax-receipts-1963 

And crucially, most of the other taxes are in fact paid by corporations. You might think/feel that *you* pay your income tax / NI, but really it's a tax paid by corporations for the ""privilege"" of employing you. If you doubt that, consider how much tax you would pay if you didn't have a job - working for a corporation.

edit: on reflection, the burden of tax is shared between corporations and people. most things you buy have VAT at 20%, this burden is shared between you who has to pay more for their stuff and the corporations who make less profit selling stuff for a given price. the same effect is true for the other forms of taxation.

So, isn't it the case that Jesus was more concerned about preaching to the poor than actually feeding them?  Similarly, haven't missionaries traditionally seen it as their man duty to preach the Gospel to the poor with charitable aid coming a distant second place?

And of course there's Jesus' 'The poor will always be with us' speech, which to my mind is again confirming the precedence of spirituality over alleviating poverty.

Primary school teachers are expected to teach English, Maths, Science, History and Geography. Yet in my experience they usually only have a good grasp of one or two of these and just about get by on the others.

The main problem is that these kids go to Uni and get qualified as teachers without ever having worked a real job. They have no life experience.

It gets better in Secondary Schools since the teachers usually specialise in particular subjects and have to do less babysitting, but you'd still be surprised at how ignorant some teachers can be of their own specialist subjects too.

This is why I have no faith in teaching qualifications. I'd much rather schools opened up to a broader section of the community. Get people with decades of experience in their respective fields. People who have real knowledge to share.

Why not have someone like David Starkey teaching kids history?

Why not have someone like Brian Cox teaching kids about science?

I followed very peripherally through high school. In college I discovered that they sometimes played replays of big matches on FSN - and I was enamored with how exciting they were.

In med school I discovered that you could watch replays of matches via Bittorrent.. I started watching every match (1-2 days later) and became ADDICTED. Eventually, as I started staying up-to-date with the team news, replays just wouldn't cut it anymore. Dubious streams of low-quality became the norm every weekend.

Nowadays I keep a paid subscription to foxsoccer2go and have access to NBC sports live extra. I don't miss a match. My wife loves watching as well, and she was even lucky enough to go to the match last summer in Indianapolis vs Inter (I had to work - *tears*).

Then there's the question of whether or not Stormont would be made redundant, and the ROI Parliament would have control.
