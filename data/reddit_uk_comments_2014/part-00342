This particular infection called halicephalobus causes a brain disease called meningoencephalitis - it is rather like meningitis, in that it causes a short illness with rapidly worsening brain function. Starting off maybe as headache and confusion, then progressing to seizures, or coma and then brain death.

Unfortunately, because these type of diseases progress quickly, it is often not possible to determine the diagnosis, except at post mortem (and even then, a definite cause is not always found). In general, however, most brain diseases like this, tend to affect only the brain, and leave the rest of the body and organs untouched. In many ways, this type of case makes a good organ donor.

Flickr allowing more than 18 photos per gallery (as opposed to the previous 18 limit) sped up the finishing process that I did just yesterday.  I tried to lump them in galleries as clear as possible to their name... thus if you were wondering where Georgia's UNESCO sites were located I hope it would be clear it is a ""[Transcaucasian UNESCO World Heritage Sites](https://www.flickr.com/photos/j-fish/galleries/72157632669987121/)""... but if it was not it says in the description which countries are there.

false,withabeard,null,null,"&gt; The NHS is currently facing a funding gap

--

&gt; the population is aging meaning more frail people and less people to pay taxes

OK, a couple of things. Given the NHS doesn't make a profit, any ""funding gap"" is actually the gap between what the NHS spends and what the current politicians want to give it.

If the funding gap is big, then it's because either it's not being given enough money or because it's running scarily inefficient.

If it's because the NHS does not have enough money, then privatising the NHS and making it for profit means that some business owner *will* charge more for the same service.

1) So all costs are covered.  
2) So they make their profit non top of the costs. 

That extra cost will come straight out of your pocket.

Now, that ""saving"" the government makes by not paying for the NHS. Do you really think there will be tax cuts? Or do you think that you'll pay the same out in tax, and then some money out in insurance.

Also, those frail old people you talk of. Now they're frail and old, their insurance costs will be extortionate. No for profit insurance company will take on already elderly and infirmed people. So, either they cough up out of their own pockets, or they die.

The other often trotted out line, is the NHS is inefficient. Well, that might be true. Lots of people might be being paid public money to sit around and do very little.

Privatise the NHS and what happens to those people? They're out of a job. Unemployment sky rockets, we cause another country wide problem.

When people talk about inneficiencies in public sector workplaces I like to think of things like this.

* For public healthcare, I pay £100^* a year. 10% of that is wasted. So I get £90 in value.
* For private healthcare, I need £90 a year in value. But someone wants to make 10% profit. So I pay £100 a year.

In one of those scenarios. A group of people on medium/reasonable salaries take some of my money. In the other scenario, a couple of very rich people take some of my money.

Failing that, if the contract is finished, then there isn't any requirement for the new contract to have the same terms as the previous contract. However, it also isn't required for you to sign it.

If you don't sign a new contract, it DOES NOT mean you need to leave immediately. If you have no contract, then you are on a Statutory Periodic Tenancy, AKA month-to-month, basically the same as your previous contract except for the term.

The landlord would then need to serve you with notice to quit (AKA Section 21 notice), usually 2 month in advance. You still aren't legally required to leave (and it is illegal for the landlord to physically evict you) until they have a *court ordered* eviction notice.

My advice would be to refuse the new contract.

The guy I know from school, Matt, irritated me in this way before I took much interest in the news. This was around 1998. The Harry Enfield sketch of the Tory Boy I think predates this but I saw that after Matt. 
The first time I saw Milliband was probably around 2008. Quite late really. At that time he seemed young to me and over confident; arrogant. He had no humility in what he was saying. He would come back with a smart ass answer too quick, giving me the impression that he really doesn't care about the person he is talking to, or indeed anyone. He put his hands together and rubbed... but also he had that smile in which the mouth moves but the eyes don't. Smarmy. 

Maybe this impression has been created by the newspaper and embedded in my subconcious many years ago. However, I don't read newspapers and I turn off the radio and TV for the news where I can. Perhaps it got in somewhere, who's to say. 
I don't live in the UK anymore.

You could argue Mark Gonzalez too, he didn't exactly pan out.  Looked a player who clearly had ability but rarely ever seemed to use it.  We really went hard in the paint to get him to the club too after his injuries and work permit struggles.

The Alonso/Barry thing is such a strange saga.  The summer before Xabi left was so strange.  Rafa really tried to get Barry in as a replacement.  Barry was playing some superb football at that point and Alonso was pretty mediocre by his standards in the previous season, but for me Barry was still nothing like even average level Alonso.  I think the summer Xabi left Rafa wanted to use them together, but Real came for Xabi and of course he wasn't going to say no to them.  I don't think any other clubs would've been able to get him at that point though.  So with it being Real and Xabi clearly wanting to go to Real plus H&amp;G not giving any money to Rafa to spend in the window (probably because they didn't have any, fucking muppets) we kindof had to say yes and scoop up that nice 30mil to imrpove other areas.  At that point I think Rafa was figuring Barry would be reasonable enough cover since he couldn't play them both together (imagine Mascherano, Xabi, Barry in his prime, playing behind Gerrard and Torres... oh my), and he could make up for Alonso's absence by making direct improvements elsewhere on the pitch.  We then failed to get Barry and the whole thing blew up in our faces.  so then Aquilani happened, he came injured and then basically stayed injured.  I think if he hadn't had such horrible injury problems and Hodgson wasn't such fucking asshat he could have been a very good player for us though, he didn't get many chances to show his quality.",0,1415997568,null,0,false,0,cm2nl37,t3_2ma5it,t1_cm2nl37,t1_cm2dcrl,null,1426023850,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Pellegrini seems like a very calm individual who likes to avoid confrontation and any sort of controversy, the exact opposite of Mancini.  And that's all and good..

However, at times this season its become clear that we need someone who can motivate players, instill discipline and isn't afraid to sit players on the bench if they aren't performing well.  With the squad we have,  no one is too important that they can't be benched if they are giving fuck-all on the pitch--especially if they made some really tasteless comments about the club during the summer (I'm talking about you, yaya).  Don't mean to harp on yaya but after his summer incidents, plus his performances on the field, you'd expect a manager to at least confront this obvious issue.  Perhaps he did it away from the public spotlight, yet yaya still plays every game, the full 90 minutes.

From what I've seen of simeone as a player and a manager, he is very passionate.  He is a leader, and a motivator.  He also seems to get the best out of every player in his squad.  Players want to play for manager's like this.

Cash ISA is a straightforward, tax-free cash savings account. You can place up to £15,000 a (tax) year into an ISA - bare in mind that withdrawals still count up to this total, so if you've placed £15,000 into an ISA and you later take £1,000 out, you can't then replace that £1,000 and have the amount still treated as tax free.

Some ISAs are instant access, some are fixed term. Instant access obviously gives you instant access to your money at the cost of some interest rating - currently the top-end instant access ISAs are paying 1.5% or thereabouts. Fixed term ISAs are paying a little better but with the proviso that you can't access the money until the end of the term, and if you can you normally pay a pretty hefty 'penalty' against the interest.

There are several current accounts currently paying very high rates of interest if you meet the criteria, TSB, Lloyds and Santander all have one off the top of my head. Look into which one is best for you as they all have different eligibility criteria.

He gave us so many fantastic memories as Liverpool manager which I will never forget. I was absolutely gutted when he was sacked, even though a lot of people thought it was time for him to go. I honestly believe that if he was still our manager today; we would have won the league by now.  As far as tactics go the man is a genius.  You just have to look at some of the incredible results we achieved with him in Europe, against teams like AC Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, etc.  Results we can only dream about now.  

Also, a lot of people seem to forget that, even though he spent a lot of money, he also made most of it back himself from sales.  I can't remember the exact figures and can't be bothered looking them up again, but he didn't lose a lot of money overall.  And if we're being honest, for every bad player he signed, he signed a good one.  I think fans sometimes have too high expectations for transfer dealings.  Every manager has flops.  Look at Fergie - the most successful manager of the last couple of decades and he signed the likes of Djemba-Djemba, Klebersen, Veron, and Anderson.

I agree with you about Rodgers also.  I'm a big fan of the guy and I think he can be very successful here.  But to suggest he is on the same level as Benitez was is wishful thinking.  He showed us enough last year to give me faith in him for a few seasons at least.  Even if we finish 10th this season I am more than happy to give him another year.

20% of 10k = 2k

[NIC class 2](https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates) is £2.75pw

£2.75 x 52 = £143p/y in NIC (if class 2)
£143 x 3 years = £429 class 2 for the full 3 years.


so for all your rebate to be taken back in class 2 contributions would mean that you've only earned a total of £2145.

take (£429 as tax paid / 20)*100 = £2145

which would mean you could claim for exemption from NIC as this is below the 5k(ish) limit. 

However £2145 for a years earnings seems extremely low!

If you have paid no NIC for 3 years and your earnings are around that figure it's most probably right, although i would make an appointment to see them or an qualified accountant.

*these figure of from the top of my head so please double check

**if you have any 'fines' for late payment of NIC this would push up the final earnings for my figures... i think its £100 p/y for late payment on each years accounts.

1 year late = 100 fine = increase of 500 on earnings

In the eyes of the law, Romanian citizens enjoy every single one of the rights afforded to the citizens of any other EU state since the travel ban was lifted. Just because they are a relatively poor country does not make them 2nd class citizens. Systematically curtailing their rights as EU citizens does.

I love Europe and want to stay a part of it, I think we just need to help and support some of the ""lesser"" (by whatever metric they're judged) countries so that we can act as an example for others.

That poses a challenge in itself but the EU is a huge enterprise designed to unite a continent that was brutalized by 2 world wars.

false,morphinapg,tennant,Tennant,"&gt; Why did the cracks only have certain effects depending on the story? Erasing people from existence in season 5 yet can be communicated through in season 7.

There was communication through them in the first episode of Season 5. It was always established that there could be something on the other side.

&gt;Gallifrey is timelocked in a different dimension. We know this. Yet Clara could go there in Listen? ...no

Not time locked, it's in a pocket universe. The time lock was never actually real. The Doctor just didn't realize that until after the 50th. She was connected to The Doctor's timestream, so perhaps the TARDIS was able to figure out a way to travel to that pocket universe.

&gt;Clara and River Song are supposed to be connected somehow, and when asked how, River says, ""SPOILERS."" (barf) We still know nothing more.

I really hope we get back to this. They had the perfect opportunity to merge ""heaven"" with that server thing in the Library to bring her into this season's finale, and potentially even bring her back at the end, but nope.

&gt;So that bracelet that Danny used to come back from the afterlife (don't get me started) was supposed to be for controlling the cybermen. WHY COULD THAT BRING SOME KID BACK TO LIFE. No rhyme or reason.

Yeah that was stupid

I suppose the reasoning would probably have something to do with the bracelet being cybermen technology, and with Danny and the kid probably existing in the Nethersphere at the time (Cybermen technology, although also timelord) somehow they were able to ""reverse the polarity"" of what happens when you die, since it was directly related to that technology.

&gt;How on earth did Missy get out of gallifrey? I thought her and that council from End of Time were in their own separate bubble? (I could be wrong) and how on earth did she get control of the cybermen

I was really hoping for an explanation for this, but apparently Moffat prefers The Master to just show up with no explanation for how he/she escaped their previous predicament. He said so in the Dark Water Doctor Who Extra. He apparently liked that when they did it a few times in the old series and wants to go back to that. He's quickly been drifting towards a ""this doesn't need to make any sense"" mindset over the years and it frustrates me, because when he started, he was pretty much the opposite.",0,1416001034,null,0,false,0,cm2pgfx,t3_2m90mg,t1_cm2pgfx,t1_cm22448,null,1426022976,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt; Dr Matt Taylor has done more for humanity than those petulant little wankers ever could

This one makes no sense, unless you believe that a person who does worthwhile things cannot also do bad things, or that doing good things renders you immune to criticism for bad ones. That's without commenting on the shirt even, the argument is just an ad hominem.

&gt; It was made by a friend of his, a woman no less. 

I don't think many people would seriously argue that individual women can't or won't do things that may harm women as a whole. There's also a question of context, what's appropriate to own and wear on some occasions is obviously not necessarily appropriate to wear on others.

&gt; IMO this is ridiculous. While it's a bit of a crap shirt I'm certainly not offended by it.

This one is just a 'so what?'. For any contentious issue, or even an issue that a majority of people agree on, there will be *someone* that doesn't care or isn't offended or whatever. It's simply a non-argument.

&gt; Pictures of sexy women aren't sexist. The people who think that are the ones that have a problem

This kind of argument misses the point. Nothing is sexist in a vacuum, it's a societal contextual thing. That's not to say that the shirt is or isn't sexist (I'm not even commenting on that), but as above a shirt that may be appropriate to wear sometimes might easily contribute to a larger scale bad trend then worn in other places or circumstances. I guess the real point is that people perceive these kind of clothes to be much more socially permissible for men to wear, and/or that this shirt helps to propagate such attitudes, and *this* is the aspect that would make it sexist. It's fine to disagree with that, but to simplify the issue to 'pictures of women aren't sexist' is just a strawman.

&gt; He (along with a huge team) achieved a feat no human has done before by landing a hugely expensive, complex bunch of instruments onto a rock hurtling through space with perfect precision (and almost perfect landing) and the only comment these people can come up with is that there are women on his shirt?

'Only comment'? It's easy to dismiss people by pretending they only have one opinion, and that it's 'obviously' stupid because you disagree, but the reality is that all the complainers probably think the scientific achievement is really cool. What they don't think is that impressive scientific achievements render you immune from criticism.

&gt; The kind of woman who is offended by a fucking shirt shouldn't be in science.

I think this one is just really misguided. I don't see why being a scientists should be incompatible with potentially finding things on t-shirts offensive. And besides, as above it's not just about 'I'm offended' (framing it this way is a misunderstanding or a strawman), but about the shirt in the context of perceived wider issues.",0,1416002434,null,0,false,0,cm2q75o,t3_2maui2,t1_cm2q75o,t3_2maui2,null,1426022633,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I just got myself a full-time job just under a month ago, and had been working as a temp before that.

I did 2 days work in my penultimate sign-on fortnight gap. I fully declared it, got essentially scraps for my next JSA payment, and it was made extremely clear that it was irregular temp work.

There's a 4 week gap between my last JSA payment and my first payday due to unfortunate job-start timing. For that last payment, just after I'd signed off, they decided that the temp work was probably a regular thing and 'adjusted' my payments to match. I have had £35 to last me 4 weeks (had I not been working, it still would have been £35 for 2 weeks).

I actually directly lost about £80 for working, and would have been financially better off ignoring the phone those mornings and going back to bed.

Zebra crossings. Give traffic plenty of time to see you and to stop before you start to cross. Vehicles will need more time when the road is slippery. Wait until traffic has stopped from both directions or the road is clear before crossing. Remember that traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the crossing. Keep looking both ways, and listening, in case a driver or rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle that has stopped.


**From the Highway code for motor vehicles.**

195

Zebra crossings. As you approach a zebra crossing

*     look out for pedestrians waiting to cross and be ready to slow down or stop to let them cross
*     you MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto a crossing
*     allow more time for stopping on wet or icy roads
*     do not wave or use your horn to invite pedestrians across; this could be dangerous if another vehicle is approaching
*     be aware of pedestrians approaching from the side of the crossing.


Looks from the angle of the camera that the pedestrian was walking up until he was hidden from the car behind the black 4x4, it would have been difficult for the driver to have seen him running until he was about to hit him. Having said that, the driver approached the crossing too quickly to be able to give way.

If it goes to court I bet the driver gets a fine and points for driving without due care and attention despite the fact that the pedestrian did not check that it was safe to cross before entering the crossing.",0,1416003766,null,0,false,0,cm2qum1,t3_2mbp8y,t1_cm2qum1,t3_2mbp8y,null,1426022326,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

At the financial levels under these top dollar players, where Spurs does 99% of its business (the 5-15 million pound range), I think that premier league experience certainly should come into consideration. At this level, you aren't exactly looking for world-class talent, but rather you want to spend money on a player that will be dependable and productive. Why take an even bigger gamble on a player that, while they may produce in France/Spain/Holland, has to adapt their play to a new league?  
  
I am of a belief that way too much emphasis is placed on WHERE a player played, and not HOW, and I feel like that is the point of your analysis, which I generally agree with. That being said, by only comparing a Top-5 list, you remove the vast majority of data points from your sample, and it does not do too much to answer the question of exactly how much Premier League experience is actually worth.

&gt;Unfortunately I am unable to provide you with a full ingredients list, however, if you would like to advise me on any particular ingredients you need to avoid, I am happy to check and ensure these are not present by referring to the packaging of a product sample which we have to hand.

&gt;I am sorry but I cannot disclose the percentage of ingredients we include in formulations, except for where this is listed on our website. This is for commercial reasons. The percentage is often not the most useful way of comparing products. Often, the purity, stability, chirality, and ability to penetrate the skin have more of an effect on the product’s performance.

&gt;I can assure you that the percentages of every ingredient are the result of careful research and extensive testing, ensuring our products deliver fantastic results and meet all European safety criteria.

&gt;I cannot disclose exact pH or manufacturing methods of any of our products. However I can assure you that the pH level of each product is the result of careful research and testing. It is a surprise to many people, even those of a chemistry background, how important the exact pH and method/order of manufacture is to achieving the outstanding product quality and customer satisfaction which we are able to deliver. As you can appreciate this information is the result of years of research and development, and the dedication of experienced and highly qualified development staff.

People associate Labour with the NHS, increasing government, welfare whereas Tories are known for 'better' economics, cutting taxes and being the 'nasty' party.

Newspapers are generally liberal and change allegiances depending on who they think will win, e.g. BBC accused of being left/right all the time by opposite number. 

Most MPs have a Twitter account and even fewer post non-party propaganda so have a look for your local MP on there, wide range of political programmes. I'd suggest Daily/Sunday Politics, Question Time, This Week, HIGNFY (politics too dry without satire), The Agenda.

British politics is great but you have to know most of it is a well played out charade and majority of politicians will spout the party line. If you're more interested in policies rather than this, try to find a local grassroots organisation as it's the best way to engage with politics IMO :)",0,1416005306,null,0,false,0,cm2rlj3,t3_2mbouj,t1_cm2rlj3,t3_2mbouj,null,1426021923,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

One thing I have noticed is how much all the roadworks that are going on in and around town are impacting my journey time.  There is so much happening at once it's crazy, there's just no way to get into or come out of central Ipswich without being impacted by them.

It took me over an hour to get from town to Tesco Copdock on Saturday when the football was on.  It was a huge turnout because of the ticket prices, but it was compounded by roadworks and a traffic control system that just doesn't work.

One small example is the lights from the road that goes past Riley's / Portman Rd and joins on to ""The D's"" are stupid.  They stay on long enough such that the enough traffic goes through to block the other traffic when their light is green.  The only way to get through was to jump the lights.  A simple cross-hatch ""Keep Clear"" area would really help.  But all this is being driven by the ridiculous amount of roadworks that are going on at once in that area... there is no clear way through in any direction, so every junction is pushed to breaking point.

Secondly, this sort of thing does happen, HMRC may repay something based on their calculation which was mistaken and a correction will be made.

Best way to look at it is as follows:

Class 2 NIC of £2.70 per week is payable if you expect your profit from self employment to exceed 5,795 (I think these are the limits but may want to double check) you will also pay class 4 nic at 9% on profits over primary threshold and income tax at 20%/40% on profits over personal allowance (currently 10k).

Isn't it a bit murkier than that?  As far as I know, most church-aided schools were originally paid for (entirely or almost entirely) out of public funds, but they have a [slightly weird legal status](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020619/text/20619w10.htm):

&gt; The normal pattern of property ownership at a voluntary aided or voluntary controlled school is for the trustees to own the site and buildings and for the local education authority to own the playing fields. When a voluntary aided or voluntary controlled school closes, the playing fields remain the property of the local education authority but what happens to the site and buildings depends on the type of school and the circumstances of the closure.

&gt; When a church voluntary school which is located on its original site closes, the Secretary of State may be asked to make an order under section 554 of the Education Act 1996, which allows the diocese in which the school is situated to use proceeds from the sale for the benefit of other church schools within its area.

&gt; However, where a local education authority has provided new or additional premises for a voluntary school, the local education authority may later claim compensation from the proceeds of sale of the former premises. If the local education authority and the trustees are unable to reach agreement on the amount of compensation the local education authority should receive, the Secretary of State may be asked to determine the amount.

&gt; Where the trustees of a voluntary school have given notice to terminate the school's occupation of any land, the Secretary of State may require the trustees to repay to the Department any funds it has provided, or to transfer to the local education authority any part of the premises it needs for educational purposes. The Secretary of State may require the local education authority to pay compensation to the trustees, or vice versa, depending on whether she has ordered land to be transferred to the local education authority, and on the extent of any public expenditure on the premises.",0,1416006931,null,0,false,0,cm2sd7b,t3_2m9xem,t1_cm2sd7b,t1_cm2afhc,null,1426021562,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We also need an injury prone winger who has talent, but also has dodgy knees. Theo Walcott I hear you say! No, he is too good. Afellay is where it is at. 

So now those problems have been sorted out, we need a marquee striker who has burned bridges at every club he has been at, and is looking for a move away again. I am sure Balotelli will be at this point by the next window.

&gt;Shouldn't the cracks in the universe still be everywhere? They were all throughout time...

The cracks closed when the universe rebooted.  One weak point remained.
(Sources: ""The Big Bang"", ""The Time of the Doctor"")

&gt;Why did the cracks only have certain effects depending on the story? Erasing people from existence in season 5 yet can be communicated through in season 7.

Each crack led to another part of time and space.  Some of the other places had already been erased, though, so there was nothing on the other side.
(Sources: ""Flesh and Stone"", ""The Vampires of Venice"")

&gt;A ""miracle"" is not a good enough reason for him to escape the pandorica...

This is not a question.

&gt;Everything Missy ""planned"" with Clara leads up to absolutely nothing. Why. Why. Why.

Missy told the Doctor she chose someone she thought would easily control him.
(Source: ""Death in Heaven"")

&gt;Speaking of Clara, what the hell did that leaf have to do with anything? It's a leaf. A dead leaf.

The leaf belonged to her mother, who died unexpectedly when Clara was a teenager.  It means a lot to Clara for that reason.
(Sources: ""The Rings of Akhaten"", ""The Name of the Doctor"")

&gt;Gallifrey is timelocked in a different dimension. We know this. Yet Clara could go there in Listen? ...no

The TARDIS safety was off, allowing it to make dangerous trips that crossed their own timelines.  Only the Time War was time-locked.
(Sources: ""The Stolen Earth"", ""Listen"")

&gt;Clara and River Song are supposed to be connected somehow, and when asked how, River says, ""SPOILERS."" (barf) We still know nothing more.

They were connected because River didn't hang up on the telepathic connection.  River was telling the Doctor that her presence was an indication of Clara still being alive.
(Source: ""The Name of the Doctor"")

&gt;So that bracelet that Danny used to come back from the afterlife (don't get me started) was supposed to be for controlling the cybermen. WHY COULD THAT BRING SOME KID BACK TO LIFE. No rhyme or reason.

It was the bracelet Missy used to travel between the nethersphere and the real world.  Danny used it to let the boy out of the nethersphere.

&gt;So this kid they brought back to life...is Clara just going to get a flight to his war torn country and use her GPS to go find and give him back to his parents? Several years after he's been dead? And has not aged?

Yes.

Because it's possible that you hadn't, with regards to Class 2 NICs.

The fact is that Class 2 NICs are not collected as part of your yearly self assessment tax return. It is an entirely separate process, and you receive the bill every 6 months, for the previous six months. There is a limit where if you have earned below £5,725 (for 2013-2014) then you might be exempt from paying, so if your income on your previous years tax return had suggested that this year's income would be under that limit then it's possible that HMRC might not have billed you (this is a guess on my part) until you sorted out the tax issue this summer that you mentioned.

Basically... no. Not in the UK. Tax + the prices vendors charge means there's essentially nowhere reasonably priced to buy in the UK.

There *are* however places you can buy within the EU.

www.top25cigars.co.uk (ships from poland)
www.cigarworld.de (german)
www.ihavanas.com (Swiss, boxes only)

These will be substantially cheaper. 

On ihavanas you *may* have to pay tax when they enter the country but this seems to happen relatively infrequently. On the other two sites we *think* that because they're in the EU they're paying UK tax, but we're not 100% certain on that.

At any rate, even paying tax (which some of us have on some orders) the cigars bought from those sources are still at least a third cheaper than buying in the UK.

&gt;Well, Nigel, we’re waiting to hear what you’ve got to say.

Nigel literally offered Miliband a chance to debate him on it, and Miliband chickened out.

2. As soft golden sunlight arcs low across the paddock and gilds the chromework of the Aga like melted butter, find a big pan. 
 
 
3. Heat an unconscionable quantity of oil to a gentle simmer and slip in the freshly made local sausages. Sausages should not be pricked and never fried. The intention is that they should poach in the oil. 
 
 
4. As the sausages poach make tea. If it is a proper farmhouse there will be a gigantic 'Brown Betty' teapot of the type used to fortify British battalions throughout the last Great Unpleasantness. Add a spoonful of leaf tea (need we mention the sordid subject of bags?) for each person and 'one for the pot'. At this point the kettle will start its song, beginning the process of gently awakening the recovering partygoers. Pour the water over the leaves. The tea serves the same purpose to a hungover Englishman that chicken soup serves to a Jewish New Yorker with a headcold and hives. This is not cooking...it's an emergency clinical intervention. An Englishman's mother will offer him tea as first response medical aid even if his arm has been severed by a combine harvester. 
 
 
5. Move the sausages to the warming oven, pour off all but a light glazing of the oil and begin to brown the bacon. Much has been written about good bacon and I do not propose to repeat it. Suffice it to say...smoked...streaky...thin...crisp. Place in the warming oven when done. 
 
 
6. Open a can of Heinz baked beans -accept no substitute- these are not so much a foodstuff as an architectural element of the finished plate. Think of beans as colour and a concealer of disheartening flashes of empty plate between meats. 
 
 
7. Mushrooms and tomatoes may be grilled at this stage but no gentleman would consider eating them. They are vegetables. Vegetables are a form of table decoration. They aren't food - they go next to food. As the great Dr Johnson should have said 'Vegetables are what food eats' and I have no intention of disagreeing. 
 
 
8. Americans eat hash browns at breakfast. Theay are disagreeable to an Englishman. I understand that the French, who can make food out of almost anything, use them to sole espadrilles. 
 
 
9. There are many different ways to cook eggs but most of them are purely of interest to invalids, children and the feeble-minded. The correct or 'proper English egg' is fried with lightly browned edges in the fat left over from the bacon. At the last minute, oil is flicked over the top of the yolk to seal it. This dangerous procedure causes the yolk to form a perfect, golden, viscid capsule, the violation of which with a rough shard of toast, is the nearest that an Englishman will permit himself to unbridled sexual ecstasy. 
 
 
10. While the eggs are being coaxed into tumescence the first of the walking wounded will have arrived in the kitchen. Ignore the bashful looks and tousled hair and administer tea in large quantities. Mugs enable fingers to thaw and many a tryst has been sealed by a coy glance over the chipped china rim. The more robust may be set to the simple task of toast. 
 
 
11. Working quickly, lay down toast, top with an egg, flank with bacon and sausage and fill the spaces with beans. Serve forth.",0,1416012223,null,0,false,1,cm2uqk6,t3_2mc3kk,t1_cm2uqk6,t3_2mc3kk,null,1426020419,21,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,21

It is not. We have talked about it, and will continue to talk about it for many years. It is far from over-looked. We just don't need to have players be judged off of it years later.

&gt; and Ramires is one of the main reason we won

Yes, and so was Bosingwa and so was David Luiz. But we didn't wait to sell them because of the CL. The past is the past, all that matters is how you recently have performed and how you will perform in the future.

&gt; His energy alone is unmatched across the league. Us Chelsea fans are turning into something else these days. We spend lots of time here criticizing how bad some of our players are.

If we are to replace these players then it should only be world class players. Not some second fiddle that can't even start for a midtable EPL team. If those players mentioned here were that good then they should have been playing for a big team by now.

Again, I agree. There is no real viable replacement for Ramires available, which is why I am fine with keeping him. He plays in a position we don't really use anymore though, which is the box-box role. He isn't really competition for Fabregas, because he does not play that role. And he isn't really competition for Matic either, because he is not suited for a lone defensive midfield role. But he is versatile enough that it is very handy to have him around because he can sub in and run around all over the pitch.

The only world class midfielder that is currently available I would think is Khedira, and I would definitely want to get him. But we would definitely sell Mikel to bring him in, not Ramires.

I never said we were, I just said he was never good enough for Chelsea.

We had a reason we bought him, but it wasn't because we really wanted him or we had been following him for a while. It was purely because we lost two very good attacking midfielders and needed someone to fill the hole in the squad. The fact that he scored against us also probably pushed us in his direction.

He recently mentioned he would be playing there and he is trying hard to be really good at it. Why fix something that is already working? If we were to get a big name player, it should be a midfield general that would help the team move forward not just defend. Pogba would have been my choice, but we can't get him at the moment. Matic is way better than Khedira. We don't need help in that position. Another CM would have made more sense than acquiring another DM. For the past two seasons, Khedira hasn't been in his best form and he has become injury prone and lost his pace.

Not really. They're pretty standard throughout retail and service industries now. Aside from being able to save time and weed out people who're clearly not going to be worth employing, the employers are looking at how you interact with people, very important in customer service and retail. These type of situations are much more bearable than sitting opposite a desk facing three suits with clipboards shooting questions at you like the bloody Stasi. So long as you get involved with the discussions, show that you can both listen and provide input in a (purposefully) loosely organised environment and work with unfamiliar people to complete basic tasks and remember a few simple things you'll tick all the boxes they're looking for. 

Frankly I quite liked group style interviews when applying for entry level jobs as they allowed me to show a little of what I'd be like to work with, put myself in an employers mind as someone they could see being part of their team, spending eight hours a day with, rather than just another CV and a nice shirt reeling off rehearsed answers to standard questions.

It certainly delivered a new take on his character and Moffat seems to be continuing in this vein by keeping the crazy aspect. Even if we never actually get a specific explicit answer as to whether Missy is still hearing drums in her new regeneration.

false,dude2dudette,flair5,,"Don't forget Luka Modric... easily one of the best midfielders/play-makers we've ever had and Dimitar Berbatov, possibly the best striker we've had in the last 20 years. Neither of these players had Premiership experience or English language experience before arriving at the Lane and yet what incredibly good signings they were. 

The fact that VdV, Modric, Berbatov, Bale etc. were all around near the the same time is probably the reason fans expect so much of us now. I grew up watching spurs finish mid-table at the best of times, and missing out on UEFA cup qualification due to the disallowed Pedro Mendes goal etc. At those times, if someone suggested we'd get CL people would have accused them of being in some sort of fever dream. 

We've since sold all our play makers (Carrick, Modric, VdV, Sigurdsson), Strikers (Berbatov, Defoe, Keane) and our best player to play for us in my lifetime (Bale). On top of that, Our ""pacey"" counter-attack, fuelled by wingers like Bale and Lennon and the quick and accurate passing of Huddlestone, Modric, VdV or the like has all but disappeared in favour of  the slow build-up. The main issue is, the slow build-up only works if you are:

1. Incredibly patient (which our players have shown that they aren't with all of those shots from outside of the box with no reward)

2. Have great off-the ball work-rate (which our players in the last 2-3 seasons have been notorious for NOT having, hence positional errors in defence and no person ""in the space"" when attacking)

3. Someone who can and will pick out a pass, even (or especially) when under pressure. Eriksen is a great passer of the ball, but when under pressure (as seen in the Stoke game) he just gets bullied off the ball and out the game. Also, his corners have been atrocious. 

It's a combination of all these factors that people just don't seem to actually take into account when trying to analyse our performances. We are comparing ourselves to the best the club has been in 2 decades, (2008-2012) instead of actually looking at how we are now and trying to build on that. I'd say that I'd be happy with just a league cup win this year. TO put that in perspective, we've won that trophy twice in my life. Once in 1999 and again during that 2008-2012 period. If I look at the team from 1999, the only players of note are:

Stephen Carr - a solid defender

Steffen Freund - Absolute legend on the bench atm :P 

Darren Anderton - Famous for his partnership with Teddy

Les Ferdinand - I remember him well growing up

Sol Campbell - went on to join the scum and create history with them

David Ginola - Because he's worth it. 

Now, of those players, I'd say our current team is a darn-sight better aside from Ginola and Campbell. Despite that, it seems that we are headed for a similar place in the league to them that season (midtable) because of our lack of ability to play well at home.

I'm very fortunate in that I'm earning considerably above average salary for a London-based employer, but out of London.  However, it's possible I may have to move to London in order to advance my career, but jury's out on that right now.

&gt; it's going to pall eventually.

In my experience, none of the young graduates ever see that coming.  It hits them like a train when they reach a certain age and they aren't quite sure what to do.

They know that staying in central-ish London is a bad idea, but they don't want to give it up.  What next?

&gt;  Even the nightlife thing, and London offers shitloads of good stuff, can be reasonably replicated with far less hassle and expense elsewhere.

Oh, most certainly.  I've had several nights out in central London - pubs and clubs were ludicrously expensive, often very busy and full of utter wankers, and generally offered a very similar experience you'd get elsewhere for considerably cheaper.  You then had the added challenge of getting home afterwards.

For that sort of thing London doesn't seem worth it.  It's not like someone in Lewisham, Ealing or High Barnet is often going to travel in to Soho or Shaftesbury Avenue to go clubbing anyway, they'll probably stay more local.

While I don't know if anyone's really sure what it actually means (including myself), it's taken to mean not just the actual technology equipment such as workstations, servers, monitors, etc., but the software too, and the skills involved in using it along with things like programming and database creation. It's like a general wrapper of computery stuff, focussing on the information part rather than the technology.

Where an I.T. Department would traditionally be mostly involved in technical support, replacing equipment, etc., an Informatics Department will also assist in things like data collection (such as creating reports from internal systems), integration with bespoke equipment, customised software development, etc.

That said, a lot of staff will still use ""I.T."" in day-to-day speech, possibly because it's what they're used to, and maybe because it seems to flow better in speech.

The numbers for transfers that you put out dont paint the complete picture.

&gt; spent 230m pounds. and that wasn't even with todays prices

&gt; Approximately £230,000,000 was spent on players under the leadership of Benitez at an average of approximately £3,900,000 per player, whilst approximately £162,000,000 was recouped from players sales. This equates to a net spend of approximately £68,000,000 on transfers, at an average of £11,300,000 per year.

From here:

http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/Rafael_Benitez/Transfers

That is a shoestring budget. It shows you how it was constant sell to buy for Rafa. 

&gt; our most important player we had the last decade bar stevie...Xabi alonso. and for what? for fucking gareth barry.

Gareth Barry was a utility player. Xabi Alonso was a specialist. If Xabi had such an issue with competing for places, then Rafa did well to let him go. If you look at his career past that as well, you can see he leaves at the slightest hint of competition. Case in point, Kroos to Real and Xabi to Bayern. I am confident that if this scenario does happen again wherein if he's still playing at Bayern and has years left in him, and Pep buys competition, Xabi will leave. 

I'd be an idiot if I took away that Xabi was phenomenal. He was an absolute Rolls Royce of a player.

As far as I'm concerned if Reid is going to leave I believe he will give the club notice by the January transfer window so we will be able to get a cash return, also I wouldn't be too worried if he left as the club seems more than prepared to deal with that situation if it even occurs.

Final thing, he might be holding out to see where the club finishes at the end of things, if  we get Europa League (or Champions League!) he may be persuaded to stay as he can play in Europe and stay at the club he truly loves.

&gt;Possession of an Offensive Weapon

&gt;Section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or excuse. (Archbold 24-106a.)

&gt;The term 'offensive weapon' is defined as: ""**any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use**"". 


http://www.inbrief.co.uk/offences/offensive-weapon-possessing.htm :

&gt;Is it a reasonable excuse to carry an offensive weapon for the purpose of self defence?

&gt;If the offensive weapon is carried as a ‘general precaution’, then no, this does not constitute a reasonable excuse.

The original tweet that kicked this off was really tame, it didn't call Dr Taylor a sexist or even imply that the shirt was, simply that his choice of shirt was representative of the vastly male dominated nature of science and the space industry in particular.

It's not that the shirt is sexist (which is debatable) or that it was inappropriate to wear (which it was). It's that wearing it can be off putting too women, when we should be encouraging more women into science. I'm not saying that women are delicate flowers who can't work in an environment where that shirt exists, bit that it can be one of many small things that build up to putting women off science.

Being a women in science/engineering is tough. Your abilities are questioned, people consistently underestimate you and the occasional behaviour from male colleagues can be deeply inappropriate and often they don't even realise it.

Dr Taylor isn't a sexist and neither are the majority of men in science. No malice was meant by wearing that shirt, it was just a poor decision and it highlights that men in the industry need to think harder about how their behaviour affects the how they are perceived by the public and how their actions affect the women they work with.

I would like to bring up, I watched nearly the entire steam in Wednesday at work (I'm a physics PhD student at the OU) and one thing that came up a lot with the other women in my group was the lack of female representation.

Next thing about this commitment is how are you going to rent it, all by yourself or using an agent to deal with all the issues a tenant brings, can you cover the shortfall if your BTL mortgage is higher than your rental income and agent fees or if the tenant stops paying rent. 

Now is a tricky time as we get nearer to the general election, property is going to be a key part of each party policy, one party wants to bring in rent control this could hurt a lot of landlords.

Research is the key to this so hit the internet and look at how much other properties are renting for in the area and what do they offer for that price.

Now please don't take this as anything other than advice but you are making 2 major no-no's here. Firstly storing cigars at the right humidity is extremely important as it will effect the way they smoke, the correct humidity is a personal thing as it effects taste which is subjective. Some people like their cigars wetter, some drier. The ""puck"" humidity device you have there has a higher humidity in the air directly around it so will have a wet spot there. It's also only 1 way humidity control, meaning that when you refill it the humidity spikes before evening out after a while.  All this spiking humidity is bad for cigars.  Also because they are usually full of florists foam they can be a major source of mold in a humidor. This will transfer to your cigars.  What I suggest is going over to boveda packs. They are a 2 way humidity control system so will remove excess water from your humidor as well as push out moisture when you need it.  Contrary to popular belief they can also be recharged by immersing them fully in distilled water for a couple of days. I have done this several times with my smaller packs and it extends their lifespan to maybe a year rather than a couple of months. You should have one in the humidor and another one for each twenty five cigars in there. So you would need to have two. They come in a variety of RH's. Personally I think Cubans smoke better at 62 so those are the packs I use. Amazon sells them for £5 each and while you're there pick yourself up a digital hygrometer too. I use the hygroset II and while they are a faff to set up they are well worth it for 15 quid. 

The other thing is the tubos are a haven for mold to grow.  I don't know why they are so susceptible to it but they are. Personally I take anything that was in a tube out and I keep the tubes separate in case I want to trade the cigars they came in.

All that being said, that's a nice little collection there man!",0,1416039762,null,0,false,0,cm34a2g,t3_2mbzvc,t1_cm34a2g,t3_2mbzvc,null,1426015637,1,false,ukcigars,t5_33cs8,1

Because the Master lacks the Doctor's moral compass and his interest in preserving continuity, the Master's plans have been getting steadily more ""hyperdimensional"" in terms of deliberately doing things out-of-sequence from any conventional point of view.  (ie: the entire Saxon plot) 

And Missy apparently took this to new extremes, spending untold personal years flitting back and forth in time, twiddling with the Doctor's timeline here and there, without any concern for effects beyond what she wanted to accomplish.

So she now has a ""God's Eye View"" on time that's divorced from objective causality, but without the intellectual OR emotional capacity to really comprehend what she's doing in the big picture.  She's become so dissociated from traditional linear time that her thought patterns are turning into pure Lovecraftian madness, literally incomprehensible from any temporal POV besides her own.

In other words, she's now playing 5-D chess while her rational mind crumbles beneath the enormity of her own totally bonkers meta-schemings.  It's a super-dark extension of where Ten *might* have gone, if he continued on the same path he was on in ""Waters of Mars.""

**************************

Edit: On reflection, this would also explain Missy's outright creepery-stalky obsession with the Doctor.  Having become *that* unattached from the linear universe, the Doctor becomes the closest thing to a stable external reference point that Missy has left.

**Some History:**  Parliament as an institution is many centuries old, but Parliament as an instrument of democracy in any way we'd recognise it isn't even 150 years old (counting this from the Reform Act of 1867 which gave working class males the vote for the first time).

Parliament originated as Great Councils held after the Norman invasion.  The first Norman Kings realised that it would be far easier to exercise their rule if they first drew the broad consent of the powers in England at the time - the Lords and Clergy (Lords Spiritual) of the land.  Subsequent Kings tried to rule without such consent, and this ended with the murder of Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in 1170 and several civil wars between the Barons and the Kings.  During one of these wars, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester captured King Henry III and convened a Parliament in his name, taking the step of also inviting Knights (from the Shires) and Burgesses (elected representatives of the Boroughs).  Thus was born the idea of having representatives from the *communes* as well as the Lords Spiritual and Temporal at a Parliament - this developed into the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

The development of political parties in any notable fashion didn't happen until the aftermath of the English Civil War, when Parliament debated plans to disinherit Charles II's heir presumptive, the Duke of York, on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic.  The party that opposed this became known as the Tories, while the group that supported it became known as the Whigs.  This split broadly (though not formally) represented the split between Royalists and Parliamentarians during the Civil War.

The Tories later became the Conservative Party, the Whigs later became the Liberals, and the Labour Party became the Parliamentary representation of the trade union movement with the extensions of the franchise (the right to vote) between 1867 and 1918.

---------------------------------

**The Parties**:

**Conservatives:** The Conservative Party (still sometimes called the Tories) are, as the name suggests, a party that tends to be conservative (or right-wing) in ideology; they have tended to be more royalist, more religious and more family-oriented than other parties.  Economically they have been a mixture of many things in their time - the split in the original Tory Party that led to the foundation of the Conservative Party was over the issue of free trade.  Conservatives have tended to be economic liberals in the years since, favouring free markets and less government intervention.  They have generally been opponents of the welfare state, opposing both Liberal and Labour governments on the issue.  They were, for a time, content with the post-war economic consensus from 1945-1979 which included an expansion of the welfare state and the national ownership of many industries, but this was largely reversed in the monetarist outlook under Margaret Thatcher from 1979 that has pervaded ever since.

**Labour:** The Labour Party developed as a voice for the working class that had appeared as the industrial revolution took hold, and became a Parliamentary force at the turn of the 20th century.  It started off as a distinctly socialist (left-wing) organisation at a time when there were little or no protections for the poor, and continued to argue for the expansion of healthcare, welfare provision, education and pensions for most the century.  The 1945 government of Clement Attlee nationalised many of the utilities and industries in the country.  After 16 years of opposition starting in 1979, Labour dropped their commitment to nationalisation under the leadership of Tony Blair - since then they have moved to a more centrist position, being more open to the concerns of industry and business.  Socially, they have tended to be more tolerant than the Conservatives, e.g. being historically more in favour of gay rights.

**Liberal Democrats**: The 20th century was fairly disastrous for the Liberal Party, which had spent the previous century being one of the two parties to dominate British politics.  After the Representation of the People Act 1918 eliminated the property qualification and opened voting up to all adults over the age of 21 however, the Liberals irretrievably lost much of their political ground to the Labour Party.  They tend to be economically liberal (as the name suggests) though there have been internal splits for much of their history over whether to be ""classical"" liberals, that is economically liberal and in favour of small government like the Conservatives, or ""modern"" liberals and accept more government intervention in the economy such as welfare provision.  That split became more apparent with the alliance of the Liberals with the Social Democratic Party, a Labour splinter group, in 1988.  They have also lived up to their name on social matters, where they have tended to be more at the tolerant end of the spectrum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Parliament Today:**

**House of Commons**

**Members:** 650, elected every 5 years by a simple majority (First-past-the-post) voting system.

**Role:** In the modern setting, the Commons is the primary seat of Government.  The Prime Minister is typically the leader of the largest party in the Commons.  The vast majority of legislation originates here, and the the vast majority of Ministers are expected to be from the Commons.  The Commons is therefore simultaneously the primary chamber for lawmaking, and the primary chamber for holding the Government to account in its various Ministerial question times.  It contains a number of Select Committees, which usually mirror Government departments, to scrutinise how their remit is being fulfilled.  The Speaker of the House of Commons, who is expected to renounce their political affiliation upon being elected to the post, moderates the debates and the day's business in the House of Commons.

**House of Lords**

**Members:** Currently 793, mostly appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, with vetting by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission.  92 are hereditary peers, while 26 are Bishops of the Church of England (the Lords Spiritual).

**Role:** The House of Lords is primarily a chamber for scrutiny.  It goes through legislation that comes from the Commons with a fine-toothed comb, to ensure that it does what it is supposed to.  Unlike the Commons, whose timetable is set by the Government, the House of Lords sets its own timetable and can therefore ensure that it has enough time to look at Bills in detail.  The Lords also holds any Ministers drawn from its chamber to account, and has its own Select Committees - usually aimed at specific areas of policy rather than specific Government departments.  The Lord Speaker moderates the debates in the House of Lords.

----------------------------------------------------

**The Legislative Process:**

*Pre-Legislative Scrutiny* - an increasing number of Bills are published in draft before they are introduced to the House.  When this is the case, a Joint Committee (comprising members of both Houses) is usually set up to examine it, and make recommendations before the Government even introduces the Bill to Parliament.

In order to become law, a Bill must pass the following process in both Houses:

**1st Reading** - the Bill is introduced.  Bills may be introduced in either House.  There is no debate on the Bill.  The Bill is then printed.

\\/

**2nd Reading** - the Bill is debated and voted on by the Chamber, but no amendments can be tabled.

\\/

**Committee Stage** - In the Commons, Bills are then sent to a Public Bill Committee, which scrutinises the Bill line by line.  The Committee can take evidence on the subject of the Bill, and can consider amendments.  In the Lords, the Committee stage typically takes place in the Chamber.

\\/

**Report Stage** - The Committee reports to the House.  Further amendments can be added, but only amendments may be discussed at this stage.

\\/

**Third Reading** - The chamber discusses the Bill again.  In the Commons, no amendments may be tabled at this point.

*Ping pong?* - As **both** Houses must agree on the final text of a Bill, any amendments from one House will go to the other to be agreed upon - if any changes are made in that House, those have to go back to the first too, until the final text is agreed to.  The **Parliament Acts** are the Commons' nuclear option here - the Lords may be overruled if the Lords still disagrees after delaying it for one year.  This is seldom used in practice.

\\/

**Royal Assent** - the Queen signs the Bill, which becomes an Act of Parliament.

*Post-legislative scrutiny?* - Around 5 years after the passage of a Bill, it may be examined at the relevant Select Committee to ensure the Bill is acting in the way that it was intended to.

**The Newspapers:**

*The Sun* - Right-wing tabloid.  The most-read paper in the country. Owned by Rupert Murdoch, who uses it as his personal mouthpiece.

*The Daily Mail* - Very-right-wing tabloid.  Tends to dislike immigrants, welfare and Labour.

*The Daily Mirror* - Left-wing tabloid.  Tends to like anything Labour does.

*The Daily Express* - Very-right-wing tabloid.  Also dislikes immigrants, welfare and Labour, but also usually has Princess Diana, Madeleine McCann or a prediction of apocalyptic weather on the front page.

**Broadsheets**

*The Times* - Centre-right.  Owned by Rupert Murdoch, but edited by an 'editorial panel' to give it some distance from him.

*The Guardian* - Centre-left.  Tends to dislike the Conservatives, supported the Liberals at the last election.

*The Independent* - Left-wing.  Also dislikes the Conservatives, but tends to take a particular stand on green issues.

*The Daily Telegraph* - Centre-right.  Tends to support the Conservatives, but not wholly uncritically.

Unlike our adversarial House of Commons, the members of French assemblies sit in a horseshoe.  After the Revolution, the members from the conservative and more-royalist parties tended to sit on the right, and the members from the revolutionary or progressive parties tended to sit on the left.

This was gradually expanded so that the people who were the most reactionary began to sit on the far right, whereas the people who considered themselves most revolutionary sat on the far left.

Effectively the right wing of the legislative assembly had come to stand for existing interests, the upper classes, the landed gentry etc. whereas the left wing stood for the working classes and the poor.  The physical position in the chamber had come to stand for a political position.

This way of looking at politics has since permeated into the rest of the world, and so we describe those different types of political views on that spectrum.

Probably the first thing is to take them to a Registered Firearms Dealer and get them looked at to find out if they even need licensed at all. If they are deactivated or antique then they won't need to be licensed. 

Generally speaking if you come into posession of a firearm, particularly a shotgun as they do not need a ""good reason"" to own, after some-one in the household dies the police will usually issue a temporary certificate so you can legitimately sell or dispose of it or a full certificate so you can keep it.

If you want to go through the court transcripts, I assume you can. But unless we scrap trial by jury, and replace it with trial by plebiscite, their job isn't to convince you of his guilt. 

In pretty much every other legal case we hear of - we hear of the facts that establish guilt. That's nothing unusual and I trust I don't need to go back and find any number of news articles that report about a rape and the facts of what took place - leading to the established guilty charge and conviction of the accused rapist. 

What are those facts here? Where are they?

&gt; By all means, if you think he was innocent, and think the trial was a sham, then campaign on his behalf for a retrial, or an appeal. I'm sure his lawyers are doing just that. But until the conviction is overturned, he's still got the conviction. 

I'm not interested enough to do that, but I'm kind of amazed that you're content to say 'well they found him guilty, so he must have been guilty'. 

Anyone trying to corrupt the legal system would *love* thinking like that. I'm just asking you to show me the facts that established guilt which are usually reported by the media - not to say 'well they found him guilty, so he must have been'.

I listened to the first of their stories, *One Fine Time Lord*, a couple of days back, when this was mentioned before and, TBH, thought it was a bit so-so: a little cheesy and clearly amateur rather than professional. Entertaining, but nothing more.  

Dark Times is in another league though. An excellent story, with great pacing and plenty of action makes this one a clear winner. It still shows its amateur roots, of course, but that hardly detracts from the overall result, and I'd recommend this one to anybody.  

Anyone who wants to get picky about overall continuity will have some trouble reconciling this with Big Finish's take on various events depicted here, and it does, unless I wasn't paying close enough attention, compress some historical events to a degree that can only be explained through narrative necessity, but as long as you accept that, then it's a great production.  

Any continuity issues and the like can always be explained by Rassilon going back and revising Gallifreyan history anyway. There are plenty of suggestions elsewhere that he did exactly that, so no real problems there.

Well, this probably won't be a spoiler since you say you have a basic knowledge but this is the advice I give people who ask...

Do not get overly attached to any of the actors.  The Doctor, or the companions.  Like them?  Sure.  Appreciate them?  Great.  Become so emotionally invested that you feel upset and/or mad and/or actively stop watching when that actor steps down?  Not really.  Things will change.  Characters move on.  Actors change.  Don't get traumatized by it.

Now, your questions:  Whovians seems to be the general consensus, but you can call yourself - and the fandom - whatever you like.  I know Star Trek fans have that whole Trekkie/Trekker thing going on (still!) but it's more important to just be part of a community that enjoys the show than worry about labels.

Series One, Episode One - it's a great place to start, but keep in mind that you're....oh, let's say you're picking up a ten-book series at book five.  You don't *need* to read the first books to get a good idea of what's going on and to enjoy things going forward, but a lot of back story, callbacks and history of the character are waiting for you - whenever you decide to go back to it.

Also bear in mind that this is not a one-writer show.  Each series has multiple writers (even though the ""showrunner"" has overall control of the series) and so some episodes can be great while others...not so much.   Saddle up and watch through the ones you don't like because the gems you'll find will be well worth it.

"" And as for another series? “We’d love it because there’s still so much more to tell - the series hasn’t even covered the war years yet,” said Caroline. “I know Big Talk Productions are talking to the BBC so in the meantime we’re waiting with our fingers crossed.


“There’s definitely such an appetite for it, you can see people are already hungry for more. It’s been great for staff at the zoo to watch it, we’ve all loved it and it’s been a privilege to learn about its history. We’ve also really enjoyed working with June - she’s an absolute star, and still pops into the zoo every now and then. We have so much to thank her for.”

Wait until traffic has stopped from both directions or the road is clear before crossing. Remember that traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the crossing. Keep looking both ways, and listening, in case a driver or rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle that has stopped.

I would be far more likely to appreciate it if it was made by unknown art students with the primary purpose of good storytelling rather than corporate marketing, yes.

&gt; Sainsbury were going to do a Christmas advert anyway, why not do one that spreads a decent message like this?

But where does that stop? Is every 'decent message' ok? Do we allow Morrisons to show the 9/11 firemen fighting through thick and thin to rescue survivors? There are some topics that just shouldn't be approached by supermarkets for the purposes of advertising their brand.

&gt; If you're saying that this advert is exploiting those who fought in the war because it was made to generate profits, then you have to apply that standard to every portrayal of war or disastrous events.

I think it is more nuanced than that. A commercial filmmaker portraying the First World War in order to tell a story is obviously hoping to make money, but I think that is different from Sainsbury's using a story from the war to sell more groceries. The product being sold in the former is the story, the product being sold in the latter is the brand. Sainsbury's would not air the advert is their logo was not shown, thus suggesting that the primary focus is the marketing potential ahead of good storytelling. 

I understand that the line of taste is a tricky one to judge, but I think Sainsbury's crosses it in this instance. I think the comparison with a hypothetical holocaust advert is fair- a Christian homosexual and a Jewish child share Christmas gifts on the way to the gas chambers.

I *seriously* wanted to like them, because I'm trying to get my family to go back to watching Who after they just dropped it following the first couple of episodes this season.

Why were the Cybermen upgrading corpses, if they have the nanotech to create new Cybermen out of thin air? Why did they give people a choice about having their emotions deleted? Why did they download people who retained their emotions into fully-equipped bodies?

Why did no-one care when everyone who ever lived was killed again? Why did the Doctor refuse an army of ethical Cybermen, when he's personally raised an army on several occasions? Why can Timelords suddenly rescue anyone who ever died an upload their mind, and why haven't they before?

Why could the Cybermen suddenly clear the air by exploding? Where did the bodies for people who had been vaporized, or who died in the future come from? Why did Missy need to scam rich people for money, exactly?

How were people in the Nethersphere were still feel their bodies? When we see people being vaporized all the time, and specifically saw that soldier from *Into The Dalek* get vaporized and wake up  in the Nethersphere? When their bodies have rotted away? 

What happened to the scanners on the Cybermen? Why do they suddenly have the Heart of Steel from Cybus again, but only for one scene? What happened to their super-speed from *Nightmare in Silver*?

Below, I have used statistics which do not include winter pool offers or summer pool acceptances. This will skew the per-college statistics.

To answer your specific question: *a priori* one has just under a 40% chance of receiving an offer given one has applied. Most applications get invited for interview. Those that do not do not significantly affect this statistic.

An *a priori* probability is an almost useless statistic however since a) the sample size is tiny and b) decisions are made *a posteriori* with little to no influence from the frequentist prior.

Last year, if you were an applicant to Homerton, Jesus or St Johns you also received an offer. If you were an applicant to Fitzwilliam, Hughes Hall, Newnham or Wolfson you did not receive an offer. Other colleges varied. The highest applicant to offer ratio (by a clear margin) was Kings where just under 1 in 8 applicants were subsequently made an offer.

&gt; My course (BA Linguistics) accepts around 35 out of 130+ applicants per year.

Last year's statistics would seem to suggest this to actually be 100 applicants (of which 38 were offered a place).

I think this line sums up what I'm trying to get at;

&gt;“We established the role of the independent chief inspector of hospitals, and set up the toughest inspection regime in the world, precisely to root out poor care wherever it takes place – meaning that any problems can be confronted and sorted out quickly, unlike at Mid Staffs where sadly they were allowed to persist for years.”

There must have been systems in place that were ignored in order for it to get to this level. The people that are responsible for letting it get to this state should be held responsible. 

I've worked in the NHS for 5 years, I've had multiple family members that have received amazing care at hospitals throughout England and Scotland, but I'm not dismissing that there will be incompetent people who in this case just haven't done their job. 

Funding was mentioned in the article;

&gt;Colchester hospital said it was facing unprecedented demand. Routine elective operations were being rescheduled and a drive was under way to discharge as many patients as possible where it was safe to do so. Extra staff are being drafted in.

I think that's pretty clear to anyone reading that the hospital was undergoing more demand than they could facilitate. 

But reading the article further;

&gt;This is the latest crisis to hit the hospital, which was put in special measures by the health regulator Monitor last November after data inaccuracies in cancer treatment targets meant it breached its licence to provide health services. The CQC found staff were being bullied to alter figures. A police investigation was launched into the data issues.

It's clear that there has been a problem for while;

&gt;Peter Wilson, acting chairman of the hospital trust, said: “The CQC visited here and visited A&amp;E and emergency admission unit departments. Disappointingly, although they commented favourably on some aspects, their general view was that the situation had not improved. We have already put actions in place to address some of the issues they face.

They've had time to address any problems and they still didn't meet targets. 

&gt;“A full report of CQC’s findings will be published on our website in due course.”

It's down to speculation until that happens, but it's pretty clear that a lack of practice has been going on for some time, time has been given to correct those problems and yet here we are 12 months later and sufficient care is not being given due to inadequate leadership;

&gt;The CQC’s most recent inspection report on Colchester hospital, published in July, found that it required improvement in the key areas of safety and responsiveness and had inadequate leadership. It was found to be good in terms of how effective and caring it was.

I'm sure I read somewhere that she requested Evans perform oral sex on her as well - without having been there I don't know if she might have indicated (albeit drunk) that she wanted more than that. 

The moral of the story then is that no matter how eager a drunk person seems, don't sleep with them as their retraction or regret of this could land you in a whole heap of trouble. 

Medical evidence ([source](https://www.crimeline.info/case/r-v-ched-evans-chedwyn-evans)) concludes the girl was not physically harmed and is also a drug user. 

It's entirely possible she agreed to any number of things whilst intoxicated that she later came to regret having woken alone and having pissed herself. That's not to endorse Evan's actions in having sex with a drunk girl - but it's entirely likely that she did not protest at the time. 

The curious thing (for anyone who has lived real life) is that plenty of people get very fucking drunk, meet for the first time and then have sex. Some people even enjoy threesomes or more extreme sexual activities with people they have never met before whilst intoxicated. (Just because that doesn't fit in with what you feel *appropriate* doesn't mean they are wrong to do so). 

The main difference is whether they wake up and regret it the next day - as she apparently did.

It [sounds as though](https://www.crimeline.info/case/r-v-ched-evans-chedwyn-evans) the main questions were whether the victim was so drunk that Evans could not have reasonably believed that she had consented, and whether the circumstances suggested that he didn't care about consent.

Firstly, throwing up to a grand into an event like this is probably not a good idea, because as much as you may want to pay for Rime to have a new set of shoes, you're not going to get the turnout that you want from an online event. Heck the ESL does a weekly cup with a significant amount of cash for a UK torny, and you'll probably get a total of 20-30 different teams playing in a month, with viewership numbers that are, frankly, crap.

Sponsors will also be an issue, as even old UK names (Dignitas, Reason, etc etc) are starting to get sick of UK players in general: Most UK organizations no longer pick up UK teams because most other scenes have this thing called ""professionalism"" that escapes us. Throw this into the fact that although e have a lot of teams (Around 100+ will sign up for the JDL), the current UKDota scene is fractured over several skype, reddit, Steam, TeamSpeak and Dota 2 Chat groups, each of which with their own cliques that hate each other with the same maturity of a MLP fan. This means it's often difficult to near impossible to get anyone to give a shit or even know about your event (whether they are in the UK or not). You also have the issue that if any T3-4 EU team gets even a sniff of your money, they will come in and trash everyone.

However if you still want to run this... well good on you frankly. You're going to need the following.

Some kind of center base. Binary Beast can offer this if you don't have a website to actually host this on. Somewhere to update, give information, and general advertising of your event. An IRC channel/skype chat where passwords and other stuff can be discussed is required. Edit: Just saw you have your own site. At which point the main thing your site needs is ""Visible easy display of upcoming matches, and how to watch them"" and ""Visible display of current event position"".

2-4 Admins who don't suck balls. This can be difficult lest you have another FESL, and often the most overlooked part of an event. 

Casters. We do have a few good UK casters (Heck I'll do it myself if I'm not playing in the thing), however the main ones currently being Durka, joeshow, ODPixel, zLive and rusts (Pyrion Flax also counts, but you'll have issues getting him). Keeping the entire event displayed and visible is important, both for your event and the general growth of the UK scene.

Advertising. This one is overlooked by so many people. The main advertising method nowdays is via betting sites. While Dota2lounge aren't going to touch your event with a barge pole, the smaller sites might (Such as Dota2yolo), and they do have considerable userbases addicted to betting rares on practically on every match ever. In addition you have the usual places (PlayDota, JoinDota, reddit) with varying degrees of success. I guess you could also attempt to generate hype via highlight reels (Ala a more British and crappier version of top 10 plays)

Don't overestimate Steam ticket sales. Now that you can't really get items ingame anymore, you'll be lucky to hit 50 odd sales due to the fact that people don't care about the UK scene, the vast majority of which go to Valve.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Not really. We are generally given an oversimplified narrative of the trial aimed at lay people. Most people (including me) have no idea how a rape trial works or what standard of evidence is required in practice. It isn't possible for the media to give us an accurate impression of what went on just by quoting a few cherrypicked bits of evidence or court proceedings.

I disagree. Obv. it varies from case to case but in most established guilty verdicts we get the reported reasons that the verdict was reached. There's usually something more than 'the person making the accusation said so, but she went back there of her own free will and can't really remember anyway'. 

&gt; It sounds as though the main questions were whether the victim was so drunk that Evans could not have reasonably believed that she had consented, and whether the circumstances suggested that he didn't care about consent.

That's the reason I'm interested in this case. I've gotten drunk, met someone who was also drunk and had drunken sex with them in the past. Of course I believe they consented because that's what they drunkenly said and I drunkenly believed them. I guess the difference is they didn't change their minds in the morning. 

That's what should scare a person a little. If you meet someone and they're drunk, even though they say they consent, they might retract it the following morning and you have little to no defence that will get you out of hot water then. 

&gt; It's funny how people are always so much more suspicious of rape convictions than other kinds of convictions, though, particularly when famous people are involved.

I'll be honest, I don't follow football. I don't like it. I don't know anything about Ched Evans and wouldn't know his name if it weren't for this rape case and Reddit. 

But the particulars interest me.

false,handyandy86,null,[CANADIAN BACON Scally],"See and this is exactly why I think the youth in the UK tend to get a pretty shite deal.  There is very little room to grow and there are taxes on everything.  Council tax, Road tax, extortionate petrol tax (you pay twice for petrol what we pay here), high income tax, etc. On top of that, post secondary education is essentially not free anymore, £9,000/yr tuition is a completely unfair burden to place on our youth in my opinion.  Especially given the relatively low pay expected once entering the work force. As an ""international"" student I paid £10,450 a year by comparison. Its crazy that at 18 you can go out into the workforce in the oil field here in Canada and make £40,000-£60,000 a year. This is with some education mind you, but we are not talking anything more then a few months (so i am told). A skilled labourer can make much more than that as well. I look at what the NHS pays its highly trained workers and shake my head.  I think a band six pharmacist (Junior pharmacist in hospital) makes around £27,000 to £28,000.  This is essentially what we pay our pharmacy technicians in canadian hospitals - they have a six month course and an exam.  To be a pharmacist in the UK takes five years  of education and training, an exam, with additional training and education if you enter hospital.  Starting pay here in Canada for an entry level pharmacist is around $80,000 (~£45,000) a year (in BC) and tops at around $100,000 (~£57,000) a year after 6 years of service.  If you go to Alberta you get more.  On the bright side the UK is very socialist and takes care of its sick and poor so you will never really be homeless or without healthcare.  I can't say it is the same here in Canada, still some safety net but there are definitely homeless here and you do have to pay for some healthcare such as medication (for the average joe) - you do not pay for GP visits, Hospital visits, chemo, surgery, etc...).

You have some really valid points, some which I had considered (marketing, casting and communications) but some which I had not (admins and approaching different UK scenes). I am committed to keeping the prize pool around the £1000 mark. As I think this is necessary to encourage a serious level of competition (from known and unknown teams).

I realise that a ""field of dreams"" mentality may be a little naive, but I hope that by providing a sturdy framework for the tournament and advertising we can build a good number of participants.

For me, I want to see a large number of teams from varied skill levels. Viewership is less important to me than providing a large competition where everyone can get a few games in a really competitive environment. I hope the players themselves will enjoy watching other games within their groups in the early stages, and watching games at a higher level of play during the final stages of the tournament.

I really appreciate this post, a lot of really insightful points. I would like to speak to you personally about potential involvement with the project. I am trying to bring in casters at the moment, on a pay-per-cast incentive if they are good enough.

To be fair I switched from Physics to Comp Sci for graduate school because I felt the same way when I finished.

Now I am looking for work either in data science, operational research or financial services. 

Having switched from Physics to Computational Neuroscience I can say you should be _really_ sure about switching as it's easy to fall for the 'grass is always greener' thing.

If you know politics though then I'd study statistics (which presumably you have done some of - or if not there are online courses on Coursera and Khan Academy) and then do the data mining/machine learning courses (this sounds like a lot of work but you can do them quite quickly) - then make a blog on GitHub Pages where you analyse political statistics _and interpret them using your domain knowledge from your degree_.

That way you get to gain useful skills that people will pay you for and turn your degree into an asset - don't just abandon the knowledge.

But ultimately you are really young so you still have a lot of opportunities and seem very intelligent so you should be fine no matter what you do - it's really choosing which path to pursue rather than worrying about being successful at all.

Granted, he's been out of form this season (due mainly to injuries and illness) but I'm convinced that when fit and if given a run of games, he'll score loads of goals. He has a very good sense of spatial awareness, his movement is excellent. Coupled with that, he has a lethal shot, good dribbling abilities, great workrate, tends to raise his game in big matches, and as I said he has goals in him. Having just turned 24, I think he'd be a fantastic signing for Liverpool. He's exactly the sort of player that would significantly improve you (I said the same thing about Sturridge when a lot of Chelsea fans were saying we got the better end of the deal). 

But Schurrle is in a different position than the one Sturridge (or even Mata) was in and contrary to these reports, I personally don't think Chelsea would cash in on him as they did with those two (unless he pushes for a move, which he isn't, or a ridiculous offer comes in for him). Chelsea scouted him extensively before he was signed and it wasn't exactly easy to get Bayer Leverkusen to sell. We tried once to sign him in the summer of 2012 and went back in for him again in the summer of 2013. So obviously the scouts saw something in him that they really liked and I honestly think he'll be given time. But who knows...

The teacher had to step in finally and told him to not bring it in. Sometimes he will use plots from some episodes and just sit and talk about them for so long that another teacher will tell him to shut up.

They think they know something about the place and written this terribly American long winded fluff, thinking they're being funny or something. Look at the rest of the replies, Mr American OP - this is how Brits write about their perfect fryup, none of this country idyll bullshit. We're not all Jeeves and Wooster.

The best fryup I've had was from a greasy spoon caff. This is where real Brits go for a fryup, if they dare venture outside their own kitchen.

You don't DEEP fry this meal, you shallow fry it. If you fry the sausages and bacon first, that should release enough fat to cook the rest of the food.

The bacon should be best back bacon. I like smoked bacon, but I'm weird. Unsmoked is what you're after, and more than one rasher.

The sausages should also be plural, thick and meaty. There's a place for the traditional thin, gristly disappointment sticks people associate with British sausages, but a fryup is not that place.

Mushroom and tomatoes are *not* decoration! And nobody grills mushrooms! Grilling over in Blighty is not what you call grilling in the States. Grills are what you cook toast on, the heat comes from above, not below. That's frying, or Barbecuing. You do not grill or barbecue mushrooms for breakfast, you fry them, in bacon fat, just enough to heat them through. If they begin to release moisture, you've cooked them too long.

Tomatoes - canned is fine, but if you're going to have fresh tomatoes, cut one in half and also fry that up in the bacon fat.

Eggs. Practice them. It took me so long to perfect the art of the fried egg. I think it might even be classed as a health hazard to eat them like that in the States. You're weird.

No mention of fried bread, or bread at all. That's the giveaway that whoever wrote this nonsense is not a Brit. Bread is essential to a fryup. How are you going to mop up all the delicious, unctious, greasy, tomatoey goodness left behind when you've finished? A Brit never leaves his breakfast plate anything but gleaming clean. You can fry it in the bacon fat, you can toast it or you can have it ""raw"", but bread *must* be there.

Aga's are a fucker to cook on, use a proper cooker. Deep fry the sausages if you have to, but all you need is a saucepan for the beans and tomatoes, a frying pan for everything else and a proper, heat-down grill if you like toast.

Purchasing property to let could be a good idea but the majority of mortgage provides aren't willing to lend to someone who doesn't already own a property, and if your entire net worth is that £33k it would be a poor idea to move everything you own into such an illiquid asset. Letting property is a **business** that requires investment, you would be much better placed looking at true investments. Furthermore purchasing a property to let is far more complex than investing your money, there's much greater scope for things to go wrong and it's not something you should even consider without a solid understanding of the industry and a business plan.

I think it was a vote for UKIP as a party and Farage as a leader, with the addition of protest votes.

&gt;And what UKIP health policy?
&gt;Last time I checked, they don't have a manifesto or a party whip

No party has an official 2015 manifesto. This means any parties current policies and previously held views are subject to change. Yes, you could say this is a load of tosh, but I'd say lets wait until UKIP and the other parties release an official 2015 manifesto, then we can make solid judgement.  

All it is now is speculation, from everyone. UKIP speculating the [ general idea of their policies](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people), Labour and Ed are speculating on whether they are actually their policies. All UKIP and the other parties have, for now, is a general idea of polices - Conservatives: EU referendum, keep growing the economy ect, - Labour: make sure NHS isn't privatised, tighter but fair controls on immigration, stay in a reformed EU. 

Now, none of these ideas are set in stone, and that is why saying what policies a party will or will not have at the moment is quite silly, and pure speculation. UKIP does have a history of  wanting privatizing of the NHS however until their manifest is released we can't be sure of their polices.

I'm not sure I agree with you that the other main parties have more developed policy ideas, I think you'll find they very much make policy on the hoof based on focus groups and what their big backers desire rather than anything else, and that they don't have a permanent manifesto decided by the membership like the Greens. You can't see any specific policy for Labour or the Lib Dems at the moment for example (I think anyhow I may be wrong).

Anyhow despite that I think it's worth going into the level of detail you have, I understand the concern that if we become to specific in our manifesto it'll be 10000000000 pages long but I don't think thats a problem. We can still do a bitesize version to go out before elections, and it's useful to have a comprehensive document to cover all of this, maybe it'll prompt the other parties to do the same.


Anyhow below is the guide on making Green Party Policy if you want to read the whole thing. I think what you are suggesting would be a simple policy change as it would just be going into more detail rather than a major change

**Edit Document to long so I've messaged you**


I'm assuming you're not a member, so can't propose policy, but if you help me develop something I'd be happy to take it to my local party. We'd look at changing DU405 although maybe you think we should tweak other bits as well, the whole policy thing is here http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/du.html

I'll try and have a proper look at the links you've suggested but I'm fairly busy with more local politics stuff and will be until the local elections next year and we've missed the deadline for this years spring conference anyhow.

false,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"&gt;1 MP for now, sure. But based on the public opinion polls, they are the third most popular party in the country, with over twice the amount of popularity that Lib Dems have.......y'know, the party that is actually in the coalition.

The Lib Dems are still going to get many times more MPs next year than UKIP are, because UKIP's support is far more dispersed. Lib Dems may well still be in government next year, just with Labour this time. See any prediction, from [Electoral Calculus](http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html), [ElectionForecast](http://electionforecast.co.uk), [The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/), or [May 2015](http://may2015.com).

&gt;My opinion is that there isn't much difference between the two parties anyway.

Your opinion is irrelevant. The point is that Lib Dems will get many more MPs than UKIP will and they still aren't considered on a level to justify a 1 on 1 with Labour or the Conservatives.

&gt;Third most popular party in the country. The winner of the European elections. Winning Clacton - a seat considered a safe Conservative seat. Coming a very close second in Middleton; very nearly beating a safe Labour seat. Looking likely to beat Conservatives next week. If UKIP were as inferior as you make them out to be, why would Miliband have felt the need to mention them? Why would the Deputy PM have felt the need to have a 1 to 1 debate with Farage? Why does Cameron keep mentioning them? Why is it that any bad news about them makes it to the front page of this sub? Surely if they are such a non-entity, they wouldn't be worth mentioning?

None of that means anything at all. They will still get very few MPs next year. The only reason parties are talking about them is because they're draining enough votes in a general sense to make clear victories for other parties more difficult. UKIP don't have enough support in most of any given constituencies to have a chance of winning outright (Clacton was, as any analyst will tell you, rather lucky for them, because the people who voted for him voted for *him* not for the Conservatives or UKIP), but they're making it more difficult for other parties to have convincing majorities.

The deputy PM felt the need to have a debate because his party is squarely pro-EU while UKIP is anti-EU and there was and is a feeling that such issues need to be discussed and that Nick Clegg was probably the best person to represent that side in the debate.",0,1416066209,null,0,1416070437,0,cm39sgx,t3_2mdl2c,t1_cm39sgx,t1_cm38ic6,null,1426013033,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

The real difference is actually on the employee side of things, since there's little obligation on the driver's part to go out every night and earn unlike someone who does it for a living.

When you have the likes of Delta with 2,000 drivers (or any other local cab company - I can name a minimum of two where I live alone), an established user base and a high level of reliance, there's little in the way of service that will make the majority of users change to Uber. The only way to compete is on price and that's already in the margins. Ironically, because Uber is a larger business than any town or city-scale cab firm, their overheads are higher too and their prices are more expensive. The one thing that might win the battle for them is the one thing they'll lose at, but they'll win the war due to international brand recognition just like you might choose Dominos over Jimbo's.

Irish rugby has never been a stronghold for Irish republicans, rugby was often called a garrison game, so it is not a surprise that some unionists do support the Ireland team.
Rugby was never spoken about where i live until about 15 years ago when it seemed to become popular.

 ""I look forward to a debate with you, David Cameron and Nick

It went from a head-to-head with Farage before the General Election campaign, to a 4-way as part of the General Election campaign, in 1hr 3 minutes.

There used to be talk around an insurance based model based around German or  Dutch systems, or a French carte vitale system, but they've plumped for a clinician lead model with elected public health boards to act as watchdogs.

Compare this to Labour that actually introduced privatisation of hospitals through PFI (which UKIP actively advocate local NHS trusts get out of), or the Conservatives which began privatising services.

I mean, it would be really nice if we could actually have a mature discussion about the German, Danish or French models as possible alternatives but the cancerous vitriol that spews forth from some people,  make that near impossible.  The French system is world renowned, but it's not free at the point of use for all.  It would be nightmare even considering that, even if it turned out to be an improvement, because of commentators like you who shout first and think second.

UKIP policy is perfectly clear.  It's people like you that espouse anti-policy as fact that are trying to make it unclear.   It was the same about controlled immigration for the longest time.  Any mention of EU immigration controls was met by waves of allegations of racism and xenophobia.  They won that argument and put the immigration debate centre stage.   They could stand centre stage now with the other main parties each holding their own health policies and kick lumps out of everybody.

Their policy is actually written and chaired by somebody with over 20 years experience working in and then consulting for the NHS.  The other parties rely on focus groups, which is why they're both so out of touch.

You'd make a great dictator. Everyone's opinion is relevant. 


&gt;None of that means anything at all.


Actually, it does. 


&gt; (Clacton was, as any analyst will tell you, rather lucky for them, because the people who voted for him voted for him not for the Conservatives or UKIP)


So if Mark Reckless wins next week, is it because of his personality or because of UKIP? Because I have a feeling that if UKIP wins, this sub will be saying ""haha that's cause UKIP suck"" whereas if they win, it will be ""it's only cause people like Mark"" or ""People from Rochester and Strood are stupid"". 


&gt;The deputy PM felt the need to have a debate because his party is squarely pro-EU while UKIP is anti-EU and there was and is a feeling that such issues need to be discussed and that Nick Clegg was probably the best person to represent that side in the debate.


So you've just made a post stating how UKIP's accomplishment's ""mean nothing at all"", only to then admit that  ""The only reason parties are talking about them is because they're draining enough votes in a general sense to make clear victories for other parties more difficult"". UKIP are either relevant or they aren't. Can you make up your mind?

There is a very vocal, and not insignificant, part of their 'fan base' (of a team that hasn't even kicked a ball yet) who are utterly determined to undermine and disregard the MCFC connection.

I mean to the point of insulting MCFC, and utterly distancing themselves from us.

Inspite of the fact that their whole club is being built from the ground up by our club officials, their key signings were made by our CEO, their club will benefit from taking our young players on loan, and has benefitted from coaching assistance.

Inspite the fact that the clubs are irrevocably linked. Sharing the same colours and a name for fucks sake.

And, ultimately, it's all borne out of them supporting other premier league clubs. From Chelsea and Liverpool, to even United.

That, is the core sticking point - not the concerns about becoming a Chivas 2.0.

Of course, I recognise that people who want to get behind NYCFC want the club to be independent, individual, and represent the city it hails from and harbour it's own culture, and it will. There's no doubt about that.

But likewise, there's no doubt that the MCFC links will always be there.

But the people who support other PL clubs refuse to accept that, particularly the ones that support a club that has a historical rivalry with MCFC - ie United.

There's even a guy on that forum, who has an avatar with the NYCFC badge half and halved with a United badge.

The delusion is just plain staggering. But it often falls into disparaging and disrespecting MCFC, and that's when it becomes really offensive.

MCFC, as I've stated previously, are making NYCFC the club they are. They benefit more from 'the partnership' than we ever will, but if you have a look at their forums you'll see countless entitled, ungrateful pricks disparaging our club at any opportunity.

Some of them need to reconcile the fact that the two clubs are linked, or fuck off. But they won't, because clearly they're gloryhunters first and foremost, and the prospect of being a part of a powerhouse of an MLS club is just too much to turn down.

Unprincipled, fickle, plastics. It's why they began supporting a major title challenging PL club, and it's what attracted them to NYCFC. And it's why they're willing to overlook the MCFC links for the prospect of more glory closer to home in the MLS.

That's the truth.

false,vyvyan,,Bitter.,"When I gave up, I was staggered at how addicted I was. I'd never tried quitting before. I was also prompted to give up by the statistic that if you give up by your mid-30s you're life expectancy goes up to almost that of someone who never smoked (or something like that...). I just about made it before that little deadline...

I hope the vaping thing works for you. I've never tried it but it looks like the best of both worlds: the calming, meditative action of smoking; the social cigarette breaks at work / outside pubs; that sweet, sweet nicotine shot; no cancery smokey shit.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,"&gt;I got finally up-to-date with my taxes. The website said everything was fine, and I was even refunded some money I had apparently overpaid.

&gt;I got a letter from HMRC saying I owed them my class 2 NIC contributions. ... I rather I didn't owe any taxes again, I hurried to the bank and transferred it.

&gt;I realized something: the amount I just paid is almost exactly the same I was refunded this summer. The difference is less than 2 quid, out of several hundred pounds.

&gt;I have the horrible suspicion I was refunded money incorrectly in the first place, then some time later my account was reviewed (there was another letter on the envelope informing about proposed changes on how NICs are paid, so they might be checking on everybody), they didn't find my contributions, and I ended up with this vaguely threatening letter telling me I never paid a thing.

&gt;By the way, while I was writing this post I realized the letter is dated more than a month ago, but just got it today.

&gt;So I have two questions. First, is this kind of thing normal? I expected the HMRC to be cold and efficient, but this looks kind of seedy. And second, how can I find out what has actually happened? I was thinking of writing them a letter but I don't know if I will ever get a straight answer, and I hate calling the helpline (I have yet to find operators with worse accents or harder hearing). Any suggestions? Cheers

a.  The tax system will show you what's due on the basis of what it's told.  If something was missed *(say a self-employment flag which would tell it to calculate Class 2 NICs)* it wouldn't calculate them and then it wouldn't tell you you owed them.

b.  Computers just do two things.  They add numbers and they compare numbers.  The tax system will do the same.  It'll look at what you paid and what it thinks you owed...  If you paid less than you owed it'll send you a letter saying, ""Dude, you owe us money.  Fork it over, already!""  Conversely if you paid more than it thinks you owed it'll repay you.

c.  The postal system HMRC is using is abysmal.  A month is unusual, but not **that** unusual.

d.  Although there will be people who'll argue otherwise Customs &amp; Excise and the Inland Revenue were pretty efficient.  HMRC is a catastrophe of manpower shortages, efforts diverted to arbitrary targets over getting important work done and constant reorganisation that never gets embedded, leading to a state of endless chaos.

e.  Write to them.  Send it by recorded delivery.  Ask them to provide you with a detailed breakdown for each year you're concerned about laying out their understanding of your income, all the payments they have received from you and how they have been applied to your liabilities, details of all and any penalties and any interest you have been charged and the position of any liabilities on the date the response is prepared.

HMRC are supposed to deal with correspondence within fifteen working days.  They'll fail to do this due to a lack of manpower to do the work.  On the sixteenth working day get in touch with your MP, explain the issue and tell him it's causing you undue stress and uncertainty and ask him to contact HMRC on your behalf.

In strictness your MP has no more leverage than you do, but HMRC will deal with it as a priority to hide the wider problem.",0,1416073832,null,0,false,0,cm3cozz,t3_2mbh2e,t1_cm3cozz,t3_2mbh2e,null,1426011606,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3
