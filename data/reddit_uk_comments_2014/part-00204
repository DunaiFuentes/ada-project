However, as pointed out, it's expensive compared to a self-implemented passive strategy. 

Are you talking about a wealth manager (WM) or is the suggestion that you migrate your cash into one of Investec's funds? Compared to the funds, you're probably better off with some sort of passive strategy because of the costs. If it's a WM, then read on...

What the discussion comes down to is whether you think the wealth manager adds enough value to be worth the fee. Just to be clear, they may well (probably will) invest your money in some passive funds anyway. However, their overall performance may be greater than any individual passive fund would be and that may be enough to justify the fee, i.e. (8% - 0.86%) p.a. &gt; (7% - 0.05%) p.a.; it's also worth noting that they add services which you might not have considered, e.g. managing your capital gains tax liability and making use of your annual CG allowance. This could become important over time and may save you as much as the fee anyway!

The reason there are so many fans of the passive approach is that you have no guarantees on future performance of the active approach. It is an educated and sensible way to invest. But, it is worth noting that although many people say they adopt the ""passive"" approach to investing, they are often deciding on and managing their portfolio weighting in a selection of different index funds which means they employ an element of active management! A WM provides this service...

With £200k you have a lot of options. Do you have a personal recommendation from your financial planners on the guy from Investec, or did he come from somewhere else? Do you have friends who use a WM they could recommend? These are good ways to find a WM if you need one as trust is important.

If there is suffering, we work together against it, if there is only opportunity, we grab what we can as individuals. For example, the Blitz, the time in living memory where we faced the greatest collective adversity, is where we found the strongest social cohesion, but the last few decades, where Britain has been more prosperous than ever before, it has been more individualist than ever before. 

Individualism destroyed local cohesion, so now people identify with classes. When adversity hit in the form of a financial crisis, we initially, rightly, blamed the class of people at the top. They in turn have created a narrative which places the blame at the bottom. They didn't create the hatred, they only needed to direct it.

The club provided 3 members of England's 1966 world cup winning squad, Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Hurst and Peters were England's only scorers in the final, and Moore was the captain. We've also won three FA cups, in 1964, 1975 and 1980, also winning the 1965 European Cup Winner's Cup.

Biggest rivals are Millwall, but games against them have been infrequent in recent years because they're one league lower than us. After Millwall, our biggest derby game is probably Tottenham Hotspur. We beat them three times last season :D.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;If the UK courts are given power to override the ECtHR on human rights decisions then that is functionally equivalent to stripping some of your human rights. 

Not override, the ECtHR wouldn't play any part in UK decision making, just like in the past. And again I ask, which rights would you lose?  

&gt;The existence of the ECHR in the rest of Europe would be no comfort to you in a country if that country is allowed to pick and choose which rights it honours, and you couldn't access the whole of its protection.


All the rights in the ECHR would still be honoured. This proposal doesn't scrap the ECHR, it simply changes who interprets it. in 99% of the cases things would be exactly the same. But there are occasionally times when the UK chooses to go one way, and the EU wan't to go the other. Such as the deportation of terrorists. In these cases the UK should have the option of making its own decision. 

You would still be completely protected by the ECHR. 

&gt;Like a lot of things, it also sets a precedent if one country leaves because it decides that the ECHR is inconvenient to some things it wants to do.

Again, the ECHR stays in place, no-one is talking about scrapping it. Just transferring power to interpret from Strasbourg to the UK court system. 

&gt;I mean, it takes a certain arrogance anyway for a government of the day to come up against the ECHR and not reflect on whether or not what it's trying to do is reasonable. 

Its not arrogance. Look at the problems with deporting Abu hamza, and the issues over prisoners votes. In both cases the overwhelming majority of the British public felt the UK system was right and the EU decision was wrong. Sometimes issues are better decided by individual nations.

unfair really - lots of people recognise that the ECHR is fallible and has ending up ruling on lots of things never envisaged when it was set up. questioning that is not arrogant.

again that isn't what is being proposed.

Yes, a rejected offer leaves a spot open.  There will always be students that reject their offer or don't make they grades necessary on their conditional offers.  Depending on the university you are trying to get into, and the program of study, it's not unreasonable to think you might get a spot.  That said, some schools will not give offers to students that do not meet their strict results requirements.  They would rather not fill all spots than give an offer to a weaker student.

&gt; Also, any tips when speaking to a university regarding clearing? How can I convince them I am a strong applicant and willing to work hard in the university? Also who do I contact on the phone for clearing (after UCAS)...Admissions Office?

Do not contact the school you are applying to directly.  This does nothing other than annoy people.  You can speak to the Admissions Office or Student Administration, or whatever they've named their department at the university you are interested in.  Depending on the university you might need to contact the college which houses the school you want to attend.

I would also say that it is extremely unlikely that anything you say to somebody on the phone will get you into your course.  Sure, you'll hear stories where people start with ""Well my friend did this and it worked"".  I have yet to work at a university where this is the case.  Every potential student calling is giving the admissions/college office the same talk, the same ""I promise to work hard"" speech.  They have heard it all, and they hear it every single year.  Simply tell them you are interested in clearing and thank them for their time. 

&gt; If there is a vacancy in another similar course, can I take that place and then switch to my desired course?

Again this will depending on where you are attending, but in my experience you can take a spot in the program that is similar and as long as you apply to switch your degree program in the first two weeks (and it's not a cross college transfer) it is accepted.  The other option is going through the first year, ensuring you have all the required courses for the program you would like to switch to, that you have sufficiently passed them, apply to change your degree program and it should be accepted.

We have some debt but nothing huge (car finance, circa 7k on 0% cards). Household income is not far off 80 and will probably go over 100 if bonuses are taken into account. Credit rating in both parties is solid. 
30k additional would put it at 65% LTV so we still have good equity.

Fortunately now mp's pay are now dictated by an independent body (I think it's called the 'independent pay commission' but I could be wrong) who will base any adjustments based on expert analysis and evidence rather than emotion or populist thought. Politicians lost the public's trust when it came to salaries so hopefully we can agree that this is the best solution.

**1986**

 - The abolition of the Greater London Council and metropolitan county councils, making the districts essentially unitary authorities. 

**1995-98** The introduction of additional unitary authorities following the Banham Commission, the consequences of which being:

- the Isle of Wight became a single unitary authority.

- medium-sized towns and cities e.g. Brighton &amp;amp; Hove, Nottingham, Darlington effectively regained county borough status.

- the replacement of the unpopular counties of Avon, Humberside, Cleveland, and Hereford and Worcester. The subsequent unitary authorities were then made ceremonially part of the traditional counties e.g. Somerset, East Riding of Yorkshire, County Durham etc. The exception was the recreation of Worcestershire, which retained the 1972 two-tier system.

- The abolition of Berkshire County Council. This is on its own because Berkshire, unlike the others, is a traditional county. Some may say that it was abolished because the Tories were expected to lose many seats here and wanted to limit the eventual damage in 1997. 

**2009**

- Cornwall, Shropshire (except Telford and Wrekin), County Durham and Northumberland each became single-tier counties.

- Bedfordshire and Cheshire were each split into multiple unitary authorities whilst retaining the pre-existing ones e.g. Luton, Warrington. 

- Some of the changes were aborted by the Coalition government in 2010. Exeter and Norwich were due to become unitary authorities, and there were plans to reorganise Suffolk. 

These are the reasons why local government is so complicated in England. However, we seem to be trying to replicate the original Redcliffe-Maud report, with the introduction of the Greater London Authority in 2000, combined authorities in the metropolitan counties, and the abolition of districts in the non-metropolitan counties.

If countries pick and choose what rights they want to follow at what particular time then that means that no-one has rights. 


E.g in Putins case he says ""well our interpretation of human rights is we can arrest people for homosexual propaganda"" this is an example of Human Rights becoming discretionary which basically removes all protections for everyone from any future government saying ""well we dont think the right to privacy/arrest without charge etc are very good so we just wont listen to them from now on"". Even dictatorships know that they can never say ""we dont like human rights"" but they will dress up their transgressions as ""our own interpretation"". 

&gt;There have been several occasions where our interpretation of the ECHR has been different the the EUs interpretation,

This is true, but it always seems to be that this ""difference"" is our government wants to do something authoritarian and the European Court is stopping them. It's never the other way around, and their tactic is salami slicing like you say with ""Oh theyre just prisoners"" or ""oh well this guy's a terrorist"". It doesnt matter in this context they apply to everyone unconditionally. 

This basically leaves Human Rights under the control of MPs subject to political whims and not impartial judges. Our own judges are under MP control and are also subject to those same whims and we are then left without a means to challenge illegal law (which becomes legal), it has the same effect as scrapping judicial review because ""people keep using it to challenge the government"".

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"There is no gold standard of what human rights are. The ECHR attempts to be the best source of human rights, but even the writers acknowledged that you cannot have one cast iron list of what a right is and is not. That is why the ECHR is not a list of rights, but a general description of what a nation with proper human rights should be. It should be, and was always intend to be a document that each nation could look at and interpret themselves. 

Interpretation of the law isn't a dirty subject, it is vital for it to exist in a legal system. Imagine not being able to go to court to argue your case. Imagine not being able to explain the details of your situation, and just being given a sentence based on a long list of laws. 

The ECHR is followed by many countries, and in 99% of the cases the ECtHR is not needed, because there is consensus. The EU believes there needs to be consensus on 100%, others believe that there is room for each nation to make its own decisions on a small number of subjects, such as prisoner votes and then they can deport a criminal. 

&gt;If countries pick and choose what rights they want to follow at what particular time then that means that no-one has rights.

I've explained many times why this is not the case. The ECHR would still be a part of UK law, so can you explain why you mean by this statement. 

&gt;E.g in Putins case he says ""well our interpretation of human rights is we can arrest people for homosexual propaganda"" 


No he couldn't because the wording of the ECHR is very clear:

&gt;Article 14:

&gt;Prohibition of discrimination:

&gt;The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.

It is impossible to interpret that in any way as saying that discrimination against homosexuals is permitted. And If you want to try and argue that it can be, well the ECtHR could make the exact same interpretation. There is no mechanism for preventing the highest court from making a mistake. 


&gt;this is an example of Human Rights becoming discretionary 

It is not discretionary for a court to interpret the law, that is what happens with all laws all over the world. The only decision tat has to be made is whether a UK court should be overseeing UK laws or whether a EU court should. 


This is true, but it always seems to be that this ""difference"" is our government wants to do something authoritarian and the European Court is stopping them.

In both the cases I mentioned the public was overwhelmingly in favour of the UK courts decision, which the EU court overturned. Its the governments job to operate in the interest of the public. 

And you must be joking about the EU trying to prevent authoritarianism. Perhaps it wants the UK government to be less authoritarian, but only so it can be more. 

&gt;It doesnt matter in this context they apply to everyone unconditionally.

The context absolutely matters, that's the point. You cannot just blanket pass legislation without thinking about who it will actually affect. 

&gt;This basically leaves Human Rights under the control of MPs subject to political whims and not impartial judges. Our own judges are under MP control and are also subject to those same whims and we are then left without a means to challenge illegal law (which becomes legal), it has the same effect as scrapping judicial review because ""people keep using it to challenge the government"".

Judges are impartial, that's the whole point of them. Show me a case where a judge has been shown to be swayed by political input. We have judges investigated the political system all the time.

I do feel that it is often subject to the wider symptom 'spin politics' which has come as a result of; the media and more specifically tabloid culture, politicians and our own impatience/cynicism/uninformed nature. It is exceptionally difficult to get your messages across to the general public which is often why you see short messages, analogies ect repeated many times. We simply do not have the attention span or desire to see long explanations which argue the reasoning behind proposals. If you want to check these things out then often they will have laid out their reasoning in documents, speeches (often to think tanks or public bodies), forums such as WEF ect most of which are publicly accessible. But if you look at the viewing figures of these videos, documents it tells a different story. People just don't want to know, they want to hear things that confirm their bias or are easily digestible. Which is why populism tends to be rather popular. 

Edit; Also want to add that because of the spin culture anything that strays from the party line is often perceived as an attack on the party or its leadership and can seriously derail the message, the policy or even its ability to get passed.

The problem is that your tax will now be calculated as if you haven't earned this year, allowing you to avoid tax on the full personal allowance, when in fact you have already had some of that allowance whilst working since April 6 at your previous job. This means that during this tax year you will not pay enough tax. 

I'm not sure what the correction to this would be, but I'd suggest getting on the blower to HMRC and explaining the situation before they realise later down the line and hit you with a tax bill you might not be able to pay off (and they'll want their money sharpish).

Think about it this way, no child asks to be born. It's the choice of the parent to have them not of the child to be alive. 

The child benefit allowance has been created to safeguard the lives and health of children who have been born into families which cannot support them. This is it's only purpose. It's not some absurd way of rewarding parents. 

Therefore, if a family, that cannot support 10 children has 10 children, 6 of those children are having their livelihoods seriously threatened for reasons they have no control over. I agree the parents should not be rewarded for having children they cannot support but that's NOT the point of child benefit. 

Reducing child benefit to four children will do nothing to stop families having too many children and will do plenty to endanger the lives of some of the countries most vulnerable.

And if he didn't block Junker, he can use it as a further excuse for us to push for EU reform. It also gives further justification to an EU referendum too since a large % of the public voted for an anti-EU party and the EU just appointed a super federalist dude. So now Cameron can talk all day and night about the EU ignoring the wishes of the public - and he's right.

His actions also pacify the anti-EU crowd, gets back UKIP voters to the Conservatives and gives us more bargaining power in the future. Pretty well played imo - especially since he went it alone (sign of bravery/principle) and nobody expected him to successful block Junker anyway (setting low expectations).

true,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; as in the cases of prisoner votes

The prisoner voting rights is one that the media really did not report correctly. The UK was tasked with explaining their reasoning for not giving prisoners the vote, and that reasoning was found to make no sense. Whether you believe it is the position of the ECHR to make the decision is of course its own issue, but the problem was that the UK defended their position in a way that made no sense.

&gt; The proposal suggests that the UK courts be given back the power to make the final decision on interpreting the ECHR

Honest question here because I do not know if I am missing something fundamental, but surely it *does* mean scrapping the ECHR? If the UK wants to fuck with our human rights they have two avenues; the first is to get rid of the Human Rights Act, which would just cause problems domestically because the European Court would still have the final say (our judges would just end up interpreting law in a way incompatible with the ECHR). The second is to withdraw from the European Convention itself, which is the only way the government can truly remove ECHR influence, whilst at the same time also removing the protection offered by the ECHR because domestic legislation can be more easily amended (from as political perspective).

Anyway, my own opinion on the ECHR is that I appreciate the protection it offers and the UK government should not touch it.

&gt;  I am therefore worried that if I do choose to not pay anything that they will give me bad references in future, despite previous praise that myself and my housemates are some of the best tenants they've ever had.

After renting for nearly 12 years now with 4 different landlords, all private, i've found that references are not going to be a sole item that kills an application, I've found that most landlords now are concerned with your ability to pay. I wouldn't get caught up feeling like you need to pay a fee just to get a good reference from the landlord, I've had a situation where a landlord has presented a bad reference for me (said we destroyed the garden and needed several hundred pounds worth of work) but I was able to provide DPS documentation proving that we have an on-going dispute  and the landlord was being vindictive. As long as you've got documentation to back you up then I don't think you would have a problem.

With that in mind, personally, i'd ask them to request the amount in writing and explaining that its a voluntary payment, if they refuse that then take it to the ADR as a disputed amount and let a adjudicator decide.

&gt;Potential Suarez Profit for Liverpool

&gt;Liverpool originally purchased Suarez on a 5.5 year deal from Ajax in the January 2011 transfer window for a reported £22.8m. Suarez's transfer fee was amortised to around £4.1m annually (£22.8m / 5.5 years).

&gt;Suarez then signed a (presumed) new 5 year contract in August 2012. The remaining book value of the transfer fee at the time of his new deal was £16.65m as around 1.5 years of the original transfer fee (£6.15m) had been amortised. Therefore £16.65m amortised over the new 5 year deal meant a new amortisation cost of £3.33m per season.

&gt;Then in December 2013, he signed a new 4.5 year deal. Almost 1.5 years of his re-amortised total figure of £16.65m had been amortised which reduced his total unamortised value by £4.99m (£3.33m x 1.5 years) to £11.66m His annual amortisation cost became £2.57m (£11.6m / 4.5 years) or £214,000 per month.

&gt;If you are still with me (!), depending on the exact figures that Barcelona are willing to pay for Suarez, an initial conservative £70m transfer fee minus the remaining £8.89m (£11.6 – £1.71m) which is 8 months further amortisation (£214,000 x 8 months December '13 to July '14 inclusive) gives Liverpool a total accounting profit on the Suarez sale of £61.11m. Therefore, with £10.4m in lower wages1, £2.57m lower amortisation costs and £61.11m estimated profit on the sale, Liverpool may show an annual profit improvement of around £74m.

&gt;Such profit will no doubt put Liverpool in a stronger position to spend big this summer but as Liverpool's year end is 31 May, transfer revenue from the Suarez deal will only appear in the clubs 2014-15 accounts thus not one of the periods (i.e. 11-12, 12-13 and 13-14) that UEFA will use to assess the club for FFP break-even purposes during the upcoming Champions League campaign.",0,1405609340,null,0,false,0,cizzp51,t3_2ayioj,t1_cizzp51,t3_2ayioj,null,1434761058,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;The prisoner voting rights is one that the media really did not report correctly. The UK was tasked with explaining their reasoning for not giving prisoners the vote, and that reasoning was found to make no sense. 

The law on prisoners not being able to vote has existed in Britain since the 19th Century. In 1950 the ECHR was written, largely by British legal experts. It is unlikely that they meant for the law they wrote to be interpreted in a way that caused Britain to be breaking the law. The UK courts interpreted the ban as being within the law, the ECtHR interpreted it as being in contravention of the ECHR. 

&gt;surely it does mean scrapping the ECHR? 

The ECHR is the document that we get our idea about what our human rights are. When it was first written, each nation that signed it was free to interpret it in their own way. In 99% of cases they all interpreted it in the same way. 

The European Court of Human Rights was set up to bring everyone's interpretation in line. The problem with this is 1, in 99% of cases it is unnecessary, and 2, where there is a difference of opinion, it makes the whole system completely inflexible. 

The proposal that is in place is to remove the ECtHR as the top court for human rights in the UK, and replace it with the UK supreme court. The benefit of that is that the ECHR can then be better applied to UK court cases. 

We would still be bound by the ECHR, just our interpretation of it would be made by judges who understood UK law better. In 99% of cases, nothing would change. ",0,1405610640,null,0,false,0,cj00br0,t3_2axlrh,t1_cj00br0,t1_cizz2zx,null,1434761265,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,"Welcome! There have been a few other threads on this very topic this offseason. World Cups always bring in some new faces. Enner Valencia bringing yours in is as good of a reason as any, I suppose.

**History?**

West Ham United is one of the most historically relevant teams in the English top flight. While they've never won the league, they have won the World Cup. The 1966 England team was captained by the greatest Englishmen ever to play the game: Bobby Moore. He came up through our youth system, and spent his career in claret and blue. He wasn't alone in that England squad, however. Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters were also key features for the Three Lions... Hurst scoring a hat trick and Peters scoring once in a 4-2 victory over zee Germans in the final.

How else is our history relevant? We're known as ""The Academy of Football"". We produce world class talent here at West Ham. Been a bit of a dry spell as of late, but since the inception of the Premier League no team has produced more England internationals (with at least 25 caps) than West Ham. Notable Academy Grads? Moore, Hurst and Peters (of course), also: Trevor Brooking, Alan Devonshire, Frank Lampard (Sr and Jr), Tony Cottee, Paul Ince, Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and two current starters Mark Noble and James Tomkins.

**Traditions?**

The one you need to know, above all else, is this:

I'm forever blowing bubbles, 

Pretty bubbles in the air, 

They fly so high, 

They reach the sky, 

And like my dreams they fade and die! 

Fortunes always hiding, 

I've looked every where, 

I'm forever blowing bubbles, 

Pretty bubbles in the air! 

United!

United!

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I would imagine it's quite a difficult thing to measure using a single metric or a combination of them; 

Do you base it on voting turnout? Ministers/shadow ministers often have other responsibilities to attend to. MP's often have constituency business as well which can interfere or have responsibilities in other areas of parliament (they also have a system where if one member parliament from the other side of the aisle cannot turn up for the vote, a member won't vote causing it to cancel each other out). 

Do you base it on how many committees they are on? They have different work loads and different levels of responsibility and time frames. 

Do you base it on legislation introduced? It can often be difficult to do this and often needs cross party acceptance and even then isn't guaranteed due to a number of factors (time frame, life of parliament, priority of legislation ect).  

Do you base it on constituency visits? Party responsibilities? Research? Public appearances? Speeches given? ect. 

These things can be very difficult to measure and so any judgement would have to rely on qualitative data as well as quantitative. To give any level of a satisfying response to this query I would practically have to produce a substantial report myself (and I'm sure that somewhere on the interwebz this has already been done in a much better fashion that I am capable of).

&gt; Dear /u/Ambiguous_comment,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for taking the time to write to me regarding the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill. I have recently been contacted by a very large number of constituents who have overwhelmingly expressed concerns about both the content of this legislation and the speed at which it has progressed through Parliament.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I share many of the concerns raised by my constituents and therefore yesterday I voted against the Bill during its second reading to prevent it progressing any further. Sadly I was only joined by 30 of my colleagues who can be found on the Parliamentary record here: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0003.htm.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; As you may be aware, there was overwhelming support from the three major parties which pushed the Bill through to the third reading. I was unable to convince more colleagues to vote against this and therefore I abstained from the third reading of the legislation which was carried through.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; As you may be aware from the debate, the Home Secretary gave firm assurances that this was to be an interim measure which will be reviewed; I will continue to press Ministers to ensure that this is the case and I will follow this matter closely.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you again for taking the time to write to me about this important issue. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further assistance.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; With best wishes,

MPs sitting completely unrepresentative of the larger populations (public school anyone?). The unelected House of Lords which still has reserved seats for Bishops in the Church of England. The disenfranchisement demonstrated by poor electoral turnouts. Heavy centralization and a huge gulf between the people making the decisions and those that have to live with the consequences.

Scotland and England have different legal systems, and church and government relationships are different in Scotland, Wales and England.

true,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;  the ECtHR interpreted it as being in contravention of the ECHR.

I understand the argument that prisoner voting rights is not something that should be determined by the European Court of Human Rights, but at the same time I completely disagree with the approach of our government to it. Should they from a legal perspective have to explain their position to the ECHR? Arguably not. But I think from a moral perspective it is rather important that our government can offer a logical explanation as to why our prisoners cannot vote. Their argument made no sense.

If our government wants to make this a sovereignty issue, fair enough. But I think it is hugely worrying that our government can only justify the ban via vague ideological or populist reasons that makes no sense because it gives me no confidence in how they determine their policy.

&gt; We would still be bound by the ECHR

Well, the only thing I can say to that is that I disagree.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"For one, Arsenal has players who simply won't be healthy for the full season. Wilshere has a long history of not being fit for an entire season, and has only averaged 16 league appearances per season in the last 3 years. Walcott has only made over 30 league appearances twice for them, and that's in 9 years with the club, albeit some of them were when he was a teenager. Ox has only made 20 appearances or more once in three years. I think, at a certain point, Arsenal's injuries aren't due to bad luck, but to the stubbornness of holding onto players who always get injured.

Further, I think that midfield you just mentioned is telling. You have Sanchez and Cazorla who are CAMs or wingers (or out and out forwards in Sanchez's case), Ozil as a #10, Ramsey as an attacking holding mid, Walcott, Podolski and Ox as winger/forwards and Wilshere, who is occasionally a holding midfielder. They don't have a defensive presence that can help shield their back 4. Koscielny and Mertesacker are excellent players, but they can be exposed by simple pace--a quality even relegation sides have. They need Arteta/Flamini to be healthy and on their game to support the two of them.

Onto the next club--Spurs. For the record, their history is to spend big in a summer and then lay a bit low for the next year or two, and then spend big if needed again. I don't think they'll come out spending bags of money. If they don't, their squad has promise, but I don't think they're cohesive enough or complete enough to mount a massive challenge, though they could finally gel this year.

Now, rather tellingly, I mentioned the negatives for two clubs before the positives for Liverpool. But, one thing we have that some other squads don't is a massive sense of togetherness and awareness of each other's style. Hopefully the new boys can jump in and gel right away, and thus retain this while also bolstering talent. We also have an extremely tactically sound manager, which not everyone has, and a manager that is more tactically fluid than any other in the league, in my opinion (though it'll be interesting to see if LVG brings this type of system to United, as he was very willing to make adjustments in the WC).

We've got laws about what kinds of porn you can watch, what kinds of sex acts you can be a willing participant in, what kind of jokes you can make etc.

Having those rights enshrined in some form allows the people to take action against a potential totalitarian before they get too entrenched. Democracy allows for demagogues and extremists to make some headway. It's less likely that it will happen given that society in general will likely be more moderate, but the fact that it did happen shows we aren't free from the possibility.

And no, it might not have stopped Hitler in his tracks, but it does seek to give people some form of redress against a government that, while not completely totalitarian, is edging further and further over the line of acceptability.

This deal will mean 1 of two things. Napoli loan him for a season and he shows that he had only 1 good season in him and Swansea get him back after the season and he fades into obscurity. Or, he has another fantastic season and then he is sold for £10mil at the end of the season and Swansea lose a fantastic player.

HOWEVER, from a financial standpoint, we paid £2.2mil for him. We got 22 goals (iirc) from him and a handful last season and if he does have an average or poor stint at Napoli then the loan fees will essentially cover that. [I'd imagine we are paying about a mil for JdG, Michu is probably gone for more.] If he has a huge season then we've tripled our money.

When Suarez came back, we were on fire.  No doubt about that.

But, then the latter half of the year came.  I have made this claim before, and people think I'm insane, but Suarez's production dipped in the latter half.  He was slower, less tricky, scoring fewer goals, and generally resorting back to his ""your leg touched mine so let me flop around here on the floor for a bit"" tactics.  Maybe it was his knee injury.  I dunno.  But, he wasn't dynamite anymore.    

But, the team got better, so we kept winning.  We lost to Chelsea because BR got out-tactic'ed.  We tied Crystal Palace because...I don't fucking know what happened there.  Emotions got the better of us?  Suarez was playing in that game, too, you know?

Copy pasted here. 

Thank you for emailing me about the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill, which is being voted on today in Parliament. I understand you are concerned by the short time frame for debate. The Government are bringing forward this temporary legislation because without it, the police will lose the ability to access vital information used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse. So this new legislation is about making sure that the current powers continue. Without this new legislation, the police and security agencies would lose current powers due to a European Court ruling.

I think that it is really important to stress that the police will gain no new powers as a result of this legislation and safeguards and oversight will be improved, which Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has pushed for.

However, I share many of your concerns about the short timeframe for bringing forward this legislation. I believe the Government could have come forward with proposals sooner after the European Court of Justice judgment in April that has made this legislation necessary. However, it is important the police and security services do not lose the capability they currently have to fight serious crime. I will, therefore, be supporting the Bill.

Importantly, we have secured agreement from the government that this emergency legislation will be temporary - it will expire in 2016.  And we have also secured agreement to a major independent review of the legal framework governing surveillance so that there can be a proper public and Parliamentary debate over what the longer term legislation and arrangements should be. I want this to be a full and proper debate into the fundamental change that this system needs to retain public trust, so I would welcome your thoughts on these matters.

Given that I share your concerns about the haste with which this legislation has been prepared and proposed, I will be supporting two amendments to strengthen checks and balances even further:

•There will be an independent review of how the existing Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act is being used to gather data
•There will be a review of how the new legislation being voted on today is being used within six months of commencement and in six-monthly intervals thereafter.

I hope that the government support these amendments to ensure that the independent scrutiny of this legislation is robust and that you can have confidence that it and existing legislation is being used in the right way. Thank you again for getting in touch with me about this important matter. If I can be of any further assistance with this or any other matter please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Again, it really depends where you go. London is huge. The centre of the city is relatively safe provided you take the usual precautions (don't flash money, jewellery or expensive equipment around; don't walk down unlit alleys alone; etc).

true,Reapercore,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"Thank you for your email regarding the emergency Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill.

I appreciate your concerns about this issue. 

No-one introduces fast-track legislation lightly, but the consequences of not acting are grave. 

Communications data and interception help keep people safe from terrorists and other serious, 

dangerous criminals. Communications data is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised 

crime prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. 

If we do not act, we face losing these powers that are used to counter the threats we face from 

terrorists and organised criminals. The European Court of Justice has struck down regulations 

that let internet and phone companies retain communications data for law enforcement purposes 

for 12 months. As well as this, some companies are calling for a clearer legal framework to 

underpin their cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept what 

terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each other. This is the ability to access content with 

a warrant signed by a Secretary of State.

The emergency Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill will enable agencies to maintain 

existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ judgment on data retention and bring clarity to 

existing law in response to the concerns of some companies. It is a narrow and limited response 

to the set of specific challenges we face. It solves the immediate problems at hand. Importantly, 

the Bill includes a termination clause so it will fall at the end of 2016 – forcing the Government 

to look again at these powers.

The Government has also introduced a number of measures as part of the Bill which will 

strengthen the oversight of intelligence powers. Between now and 2016, the Government will 

review the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act to make recommendations to reform and 

update it. The Government is also establishing a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to 

ensure civil liberties are properly considered. The Government is also restricting the number of 

public bodies that can ask for communications data and publishing annual transparency reports. 

This will make more information publicly available than ever before.

I believe that the action the Government is taking will ensure we maintain powers to help keep us 

safe from those who would harm UK citizens. Thank you again for writing.

Yours sincerely,

&gt; And lets be real here, do we think its any accident that of all the bakers that these 2 boys could have chosen, they chose the deeply christian one? No, its no accident, they'll have chosen it because its fun to make white christians squirm. Its a hobby to some of these people.

Bringing in race for no reason. The bakery in question was not even noticeably Christian, as in it wasn't advertised as a Christian bakery, it's only after the cake was asked to be made that the Christian stuff got pulled out.

If this is not a case of a secular vs a religious value, are Tesco at liberty to sack him if they want to because he didn't do the job they employed him for? If not, where on the list of examples would you draw the line? (That is why my list of examples matter, incidentally - I'm trying to understand why you *don't* think this is an interesting issue. My guess - and I'm happy to be corrected here - is that you think this is being used as a cover to bash Muslims and want to stifle debate.

As for your comments about self-checkout machines, I absolutely agree with you that they are extremely damaging to working class employment. I think I've even made comments to that effect on reddit. But the two issues are largely orthogonal; if anything, more self checkout machines mean that supermarket employment will become scarcer and instead of relying on a well-functioning market to protect their rights not to handle certain goods (because you can always go across the road to Sainsbury's) workers will have to rely on lines the state draws for them (you must handle meat, but you're ok to pick whether you want to handle alcohol, for example).

true,lemoninfluence,null,null,"&gt;We don't need laws telling us what we can do in this country.

no but we do need something to tell the government what it can and can't do. It's not the government's place to be telling people what consenting adults can and can't do in the privacy of their own homes. It's not the government's place to deem certain jokes as unacceptable. It's not the government's place to say what you can or can't watch or read or draw. And yet we've got laws that prohibit certain sexual conduct between consenting adults, we've got people being arrested for making offensive jokes on twitter, we've got offences for possessing 'extreme' pornography.

Those things (and others) should be beyond the scope of the government's power. That's what these devices seek to do. Without some form of redress we are at the whim of parliament. The Supreme Court can't strike down legislation, only interpret it. The House of Lords can only really annoy a non-coalition government for a little bit and hold legislation back. And relying on the electorate to keep the powers that be in check is as naive as anything you're accusing me of. There are only certain parties that have any real chance at gaining power and with the resources available to them, I can't see it changing all that much in the near future.

And while we may not walk straight into a Hitler 2.0 situation without the ECHR that is no real reason to abandon the concept. Just because you haven't been burgled doesn't mean you shouldn't lock your door at night. It serves an admirable purpose and it does it well.

It would, however, inevitably end up being stingy. Do you think those on welfare would stop being used as a scapegoat if this policy were implemented? Do you think the people and the media complaining about welfare claimants would suddenly stop doing such if a coupon system were implemented?

People on welfare are shamed by politicians and the media who often portray them to be lazy people scamming the government whilst hardworking people are paying for it. Getting basic necessities via food stamps should not be shaming but for many people it would be on the basis of how claimants are so often portrayed and focused upon. In my opinion the implementation of food stamps would just increase this and be used to justify an ever greater focus on welfare claimants to micromanage every purchase because god forbid these people often in a vulnerable position (and at risk of depression) have any fun or happiness.

If the government is to switch its focus to the most vulnerable in society I sincerely wish it is to help them, not point fingers and shame.

true,bigrich1776,kit2012,Garry Monk's Barmy Army,"Michu was out with injury for practically all of last season. I don't know how many more seasons his ankle will be able to last, so I think Monk would rather get cash rather than a possibly injured player. But I think we're getting the short end of the stick with this loan with an option deal with Napoli. 

Pablo has been inconsistent since he joined and it seems Monk is trying to thin out the numbers of Spanish players. Plus I think, if we sign him, Jefferson Montero would be filling in the gap left by Pablo. 

As for Davies, he's a young player with a lot of potential in a position that's in high demand among some of the bigger clubs. He's been attracting a lot of attention from big clubs and it is really hard to turn down an offer for a young defender above £10m. No one wants to see him go because he's a local lad, but £10m today might be more attractive than the uncertainty of developing a young player.

In short, it's not like Swansea is hurting for cash, and in fact Swansea is doing better than most other teams financially. But some offers, are too good to pass up. That combined with Monk's first summer transfer window meant there was bound to be a reshuffling of the squad.

It's a weird trend these days. I know that athletes have always gone to clubs that pay them well, so that's not new. But it seems like players are more interested in joining juggernaut sides rather than joining good sides (even teams are in the top in their league) and building something. 

You also have so much money that clubs like Chelsea, Real, Barca, etc. can just come in and make a huge bid once and end negotiations before they start. I don't want to have some delusional nostalgia, but it seems like every player wants to go play for one of 5 or 6 clubs in the world. It makes it frustrating.

That's not the reason. References like these are code in HR terms. Companies are not allowed to give a bad reference, so they leave things out in order to convey a message. 

To have a reference with simply the word 'dismissed' and the date means your mother has very likely pissed someone off. 

I suspect there is a lot more to this story than she's telling you, or you're telling us. It just doesn't sit right. 

It very much sounds like your mother was fired, possibly for gross misconduct. 

If the reason was truly about the time off due to your father, she'd have had discussions with HR about it and had plenty of warning over a period of time. She also wouldn't have been fired, but would have been given the opportunity to resign and given glowing references. 

None of that helps you now though. 

So here's how your mother deals with the dismissal in interviews... don't tell anyone. 

It really is that simple. Don't mention it. 

When asked why she left her last job she can happily mention that your father was ill and needed caring, maybe make up some bullshit about giving her a new perspective on life, so she felt she couldn't continue on her current role. But do not mention being fired, she should say she left.

Could not care less about Arsenal and who they are linked with. My view on Khedira has been the same since I first saw him about 2/3 years ago. Good player but doesn't really have a particular role (Not disciplined enough for DM and when he plays box to box he breaks down far too many moves when running with the ball and his finish is dreadful) and doesn't excel at anything in particular apart from running around and throwing his body about. 

I said, or at least implied, that Mikel is a better DM than Khedira. Khedira is probably the better player as he's more of a jack of all trades.

The usage of a washing up bowl is the practice of insane heathens. The many disadvantages of washing up bowls are inescapable:

1. They look trampy. There are never any washing up bowls in kitchen catalogues, because the people who design kitchens understand style and panache and making things aesthetically appealing, which washing up bowls ARE NOT.

2. They are inescapably smaller than the sink they are in, thus providing less space for items, particularly things you want to leave to soak. What's the point of not even being able to fit one pan to leave to soak to get rid of the burnt mess I inevitably made?

3. As well as looking trampy, which they do, they also have a distinct retired person feel. My grandmother has a washing up bowl, and she's the sort of person who refuses to wash her dishes in hot water because she thinks it will 'bake on' dirt, which is precisely contrary to all sense and reason. Washing up bowls are, by extension, contrary to all sense and reason.

4. At some point you have to lift up the bowl, full of manky dishwater, and pour it into the sink, which is a process far more likely to cause sloshing of disgusting dishwater than the usage of a sink in an ordinary, sensible manner.

5. Gross scratched plastic washing up bowls are less hygienic than lovely clean stainless steel. It was only when John Snow removed all the washing up bowls from Broad Street in 1854 that a link between filthy, disgusting dirty plastic washing up bowls and cholera was established.

Clearly, a strict (nay, fascistic) anti-washing up bowls policy is the only sensible course of action.",0,1405620382,null,0,false,0,cj05kuu,t3_2az0cb,t1_cj05kuu,t1_cj04xm4,null,1434763761,7,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,7

You can still fight and have combat of course, but it forces players to exist more like the Doctor and his companions (they interact with their foes verbally, try and outsmart each other, and have lots of plot twists). I try and craft my Doctor Who campaigns similar to the older show (Think 3rd and 4th Doctors) where things are rarely as they appear: figuring out who is good and bad is not always easy and often what appears to be going on, is only an illusion, etc. I've played many versions of DnD from 1st ed and AD&amp;D growing up, to 3.5, Pathfinder and 4th, in addition to many games.

You're logic of ""everyone knows Mikel has incredible passing and has the ability to play all kinds of balls but he just doesn't"" is retarded. He couldn't create a damn thing for Nigeria in a slightly more advanced role, his passing rarely exceeds a distance of 15 metres when he plays in a more defensive position (again, where you got that he has a ""great range"" is beyond me), and I could count the amount of long balls he's played that reached the target on one hand.

Khedira is better than Mikel in every single position on the pitch.

If people work hard, play by the rules then British society is fairly meritocratic - there is room for people from all sorts of backgrounds to do well in plenty of different ways. Yes, eduction and background are factors, so is the upbringing and support they had as a child. For the most part though plenty of people from unprivileged backgrounds do well in professional, academic, financial and all sorts of other workplaces. Of course if someone is from such a background and hasn't done well in life it's often easier to blame the system than to look inwards at ones own shortcomings... harsh at that may be. Sometimes doing well in life involves **hard work and sacrifice** and not everyone a) is capable or b) willing to do that. 

If you aren't able/prepared to play the game, then society looks after you. But I do agree with the conservative opinion that the state should provide the absolute bare minimum needed to exist in this country with some sort of sense of meaning and purpose... and I think right now they are pretty close to that. Some policies like Right to Buy are actually amazingly generous and virtually unmatched anywhere in the world.

guess what? I didn't.

That's the point. The majority can essentially dictate to the minority what happens. And with FPTP it can more often be the minority that dictate to the fractured majority. At least with enshrined fundamental rights, there's a basic level of protection guaranteed to all, majority or minority. If Parliament is free to do as it likes (and it is until the next parliament comes along and either undoes the mess or pretends it's powerless to go backwards) then there are no such things as fundamental rights. The concept of sovereignty and fundamental rights are opposed to each other.

You can pretend I think the ECHR is the only thing keeping the next Hitler at bay, and you can keep going on about the history of the country and our record with human rights. But the most telling thing should be that the Magna Carta really only exists as a historical artefact nowadays. We've come up with other ways to protect fundamental rights, we've come up with other ways to ensure that those rights are understood and defined. 

The ECHR may not be perfect, but it at least gives people a way to appeal against the decision of a parliament that may be forcing the opinion of a minority onto the majority. Democracy perfect.

 In answer to your question I'd say a good mortgage broking firm, is all human brains thinking about the information in front of them and paying good attention to each individual application.
 The computers are put to work at the lenders though it does differ because while some will take what your application says at face value others will scrutinise bank statements and spending!

 The final call though? It comes down to the lender's own affordability calculators saying whether or not you can afford to take on this debt/liability once all your spending habits and commitments are taken in to account.

 If you're thinking of it in a year, I would suggest getting some free advice NOW so that you can get an idea of how to set yourself up to effortlessly show that you can afford a mortgage. You've got plenty of time to get all your ID and addresses in check and even just doing that takes some of the complexity out of it.

 It's genuinely a nightmare when someone has one name on their passport, a slight difference in the name on the application, another difference in the name on their payslips. Miss Jemima Smith, Mrs Jemima F R West and Mrs Jemima R F West - they may all be the same person, before she got married, once she was married and a mistake on the ID but to the bank that's three different people and proof is needed to show they are actually one and the same!

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Victorians used to blame the Irish poor when they were literally starving for being feckless. There's nothing that you can do, even up to and including not feeding people at all, that is going to lead to enough savings to stop this sort of rhetoric of feckless scroungers wasting our resources.

So, given that the problem 'undeserving poor people are taking our stuff' cannot ever be solved, you then have to look at it another way.

At what level do we want poor people to live? Literally just enough to eat? What has happened in places where there is just enough to eat? The answer is that people will go hungry so they can have little luxuries. People in concentration camps still put time and energy and very scarce supplies into entertainment and alcohol. So there's no amount you can give that will not be converted into luxuries. You literally can't starve the urge for enjoyment out of people. Thus, whatever you do, people will trade survival allotments into luxuries you may not feel they deserve.

How will you deal with fraud? If you give every single poor person a pound a week, with no checks, there will still be those who manage to register twice or collect money for dead people. 

So. The 'feckless' poor will always be with us. There will always be those who game the system, and people will always spend some of their 'survival' money on treats.

These given, how do you deal with the problem of those who can't earn their keep? What outcomes are you actually after? 

Generally the idea of welfare is to keep society running so that a productive adult who has fallen on hard times is able to get back into the swing of work again, to keep disabled people from starving and making everyone feel bad, and to keep people quiet and entertained enough that they're not causing trouble. It's not even about being nice: if you keep unproductive people content, productive people have less to worry about and become more productive.

Then you run into the other problem: how much are you going to budget? In theory you could end up spending more than you get in tax just on paying people to not work. There's a limit on how much you can give people. So how do you decide how much is too much?

Also, is it even true that poverty incentivises people to work? Is there an amount you can give people that stops *everyone* from working at all, ever? Is there an amount below which people are actually *less* likely to work because they're hungry, stressed and not making good decisions? 

Once you sit and really think about welfare, what it is for, and how to balance it, you're going to toss your voucher question aside as being what it is: a piddling distraction from the real issues.",0,1405626325,null,0,false,0,cj08wb6,t3_2ayhxy,t1_cj08wb6,t3_2ayhxy,null,1434765373,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- You will probably be standing up, as everyone else will be. It can be annoying but it makes for a better atmosphere and you can always sit down at half time.

- Majority of people I see at away games are pretty cool and friendly (with some exceptions), and it's a nice atmosphere to be in, so enjoy it.

- Upton Park is easily one of my favourite grounds I have been to. Great atmosphere on both occasions, proper stadium. Much better than the plastic Emirates.

Enjoy!

I was merely arguing that buyout clauses being mandatory isn't as important as you indicated. I didn't make the statement about the clauses being prevalent. Even still, that point still stands, as the buyout clauses that ""everyone in La Liga has"" are not even relevant to nearly every club not in La Liga, as they necessarily demand a lot more money than the amount of the actual buyout clause.

It's funny how someone who knows the difference between buyout clauses and release clauses doesn't understand this.

true,We_Flatten_Stuff,null,null," Hey, thanks for having a look at this. Aditional borrowing, much like the original debt, is again reliant on the amount of risk you can take on. From what you've written here it doesn't sound like many lenders would turn you away if you wanted to borrow more - income, good. Credit history, good. LTV, good. Would you be hell bent on sticking with the current lender if someone else could get you a better rate on the money for those home improvements?

 For a further advance with your current lender, it will be less convoluted because they have already accepted you once and will be inclined to lend to you again. They know who you are and that when you take on debt, you can pay it back. That's certainly a good thing!

 You'll likely still need to provide proof of up to date income - even if it is just the most recent month's payslip. To include bonuses (now with Mortgage Market Review rules having kicked in) you might need the last three months or possibly last two P60 forms - it depends what First Direct's specific requirements are. They don't use brokers so I am not 100% I'm afraid - it could be very straight forward.

 Going to a different lender will be more convoluted because you're an unknown customer and will be applying from scratch.

 Credit Card balances are taken in to account in terms of monthly expenditure and your credit score but this would likely be something to ask the lender directly what impact it could have.

 The bottom line is, if you have enough room in the monthly budget to add in re-payments for that extra £30k and you'll still be able to bear it all if rates rise (not that you will have to worry about the main mortgage with the fixed rate) and you can prove that's the case even with the mortgage, card repayments and other costs, you shouldn't have much trouble getting it.
----------------

 One tip: get a very good idea of what you want to use that ""home improvement"" money for - it's not a problem being vague but some lenders ask for more of an explanation of what exactly will be done with the money. They might even look for something along the lines of; we plan to spend £15k on kitchen, £5k on the garden and £10k on upholstery throughout the house and here are some quotes we got to show this money is what we require. If you end up not spending it on that, well, it's difficult for the lender to stop you provided you're paying it back.


 I really hope I've provided even just a bit of help but please get further advice - don't base your decision on this - I just hope it gives your a better idea of what you can make room for and get hold of!

With separatist groups things are different. The command and control structure is often archaic. Investigations would require a lot of effort to get anywhere. Economic sanctions and preventative reforms would be difficult, and hard to measure the impact. And with adversaries, military assistance is not viable. So things point towards direct action.

Worst case scenario (though very unlikely to happen) - the US destroys the separatists known anti-air capabilities.

true,Buckfost,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Benefits should be for genuinely disabled people and people who are short-term unemployed. The system we have at the minute encourages long-term unemployed people to have a large number of children as they receive more child benefits. It's condemning children who wouldn't otherwise have been born, to be born into poverty, to be a drain on society and create future problems associated with childhood poverty such as crime and bad health. Giving the parents more money would only encourage this behaviour even more.

As someone else commented, at least if they were given food stamps we know they will be buying food for their kids instead of cigarettes. This is not an unfair stereotype, here's a report from the Office of National Statistics titled [Unemployed people twice as likely to smoke as employed people.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/smoking-habits-amongst-adults--2012/sty-smoking-trends.html) Food stamps are also more cost effective for the government, and seeing as it's funded by all of our taxes we should all insist that that money is being spent as efficiently as possible. 

Lazy people are good at rationalising their laziness and hiding from reality.

I hear people say they can't afford a test, or are waiting for a proper test etc. Then they go and spend £100 on another CBT after two years! (Spicy110 comes to mind... 6 years of CBTs!) Which confuses me as the [fees](https://www.gov.uk/motorcycle-practical-test/motorcycle-practical-test-fees-) are theory £31 + mod1 £15.50 + mod2 £75. = £121.50. You can spread that cost over upto 2 years if you want to drag it out.  

Get the theory done asap. No matter what you decide. So you know the rules of the road. You then have 2 years in which to pass mod1&amp;2.  Get the mod1 done when you can spare the time/cash. Just rock upto the test centre and ride around a few cones and go through the speed trap. Read the [mod1 pdf diagram](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/motorcycle-manoeuvring-area-diagrams) so you know what to practice. 

No reason why you can't pass a mod2 by reading a book and watching instructors on you tube. 

When you turn 19 you'll already be a better rider, you'll have done the theory already, won't have to worry about costs of CBT again and you'll know what to expect for the tests. Probably spend less money on instructor days if you have a full A1 licence already.

On education and background, obviously if someone has been to private school, had good tutors, the right upbringing and family connections then things **might** be **easier** for them. Note the word easier - because even under those conditions success in life still isn't guaranteed... ultimately they need to be able to deliver and just being thrown into an expensive school doesn't assure that by any means. Probably more important than their schooling was simply being exposed to adults who actually gave a fuck about their success in life... rather than just blaming their own perceptions about social immobility.

And whilst it might be easier to do well in life with certain backgrounds, its **possible** for someone from virtually any background, rich or poor, to do just about any job they want provided they put the work in. There are no shortage of state schooled individuals in professions like academia, politics, medicine and law to disprove this archaic idea that you need a good start in life to do well.

18.5k for a job in central London wanting STEM graduates? Wow, you really don't think much of the labour market nowadays do you?

Why not just recruit straight from secondary schools? you get to pay them even less and hey, they might even shine your boots for you too. 

Oh but I bet you're a forward thinking start-up that offers tonnes of ""progression opportunities"" and maybe even a pool table in the lobby? Ping pong? Fresh fruit in the morning?

Well, I'm sold. Time to move across the country and live in a flat share and spend more than half my net income on simply existing, breathing, and eating cold leftovers for lunch everyday.

Honestly -- and I say this as someone who's been in the workforce for a good many years -- this is such a salient example of companies in this country completely under-utilising and, if it's not too strong a word, exploiting those who have tried to get a better education for themselves.

Why do you need graduates for a data entry job (let alone STEM graduates)? Surely anyone with a basic level of IT literacy could fulfill this position.

And why are you offering a salary that's not only £2k below the national median wage, but over £9k less than the London median wage?

Do you know that the average price to rent a studio flat in London is more than your potential employee will take home a month?

In future, it might pay to utilise some better grammar in your job advertisements. Although, you've probably got one of your ""bright fresh"" minds wasting their talents on this right now.

As an afterword, if someone thinks I'm being a little too 'harsh' -- by posting this job on a public forum like Reddit, you surely must have anticipated responses like this.",0,1405630434,null,0,1405630740,0,cj0b5jx,t3_2aymbo,t1_cj0b5jx,t3_2aymbo,null,1434766434,10,false,london_forhire,t5_2sdbo,10

Well I think we can agree it's impossible for the writers to know every future actor who will play the Doctor. So of course they are only able to show any past or current Doctors. Put bluntly Capaldi was probably not cast until after that special was filmed. Matt Smith didn't announce he was leading until June 2013, and Name of the Doctor aired May 2013 (and was filmed before that).

But really think of what happened to Clara, she was scattered across time with her memories lost. It's entirely possible that she did interact with future Doctors but cannot remember them (or perhaps the rift only sent her backwards?). 11 might have left his time stream before he was forced to interact with a future version of himself. (Or perhaps him entering his own timeline created a near paradoxical temporal fluctuation, temporarily removing his future versions for his timeline while he was there?)

Vidal would go a way to help but he still wouldn't fix the problem of has beens and mediocrity. The defence as said is mediocre at best with no notable players doing anything really special.

They will file a plan that is a cluster of these reporting points, joined on jetways.  They then fly with simple quadrant rules for altitude so that you don't hit someone in an opposing direction.

The actual routing will frequently change depending on weather, the currents of the wind, the ability of getting fuel and such at alternates.

Last season, I was adamant that Norwich were going to be half decent and sneak into the top ten - Two decent strikers in Van Wolfswilly and Gary Hooper plus other touted talent like Nathan Redmond and that Leory Fer who we all know shit all about. Then there was the Tottenham shopping spree that gave us a team with no identity or way to play together. More players =/= more success.

Just because these clubs are buying lots of players doesn't mean they're going to overtake us. West Ham have Big Sam - but are making him playing a more attractive style of football.

 Worry yee not - SA302 forms are self assessment summaries that are only provided by the government on request to people who have filed tax returns as self employed workers (somebody clarify any mistakes please).

 As you're PAYE (for anyone unfamiliar, Pay As You Earn, a salary payment system used widely across the UK) the NHS takes care of all your tax and national insurance contributions for you so all you get is the monthly payslip, a P60 in April (showing the financial year's figures, what you have earned etc) and money in the bank.

 NHS payslips are good for the brokers and lenders too because they have all the information you could want on them - name, employer, salary, dates, year to date figures, position and break down of pay and deductions. Just make sure they scan nicely to avoid being difficult to read.

 Even if you haven't kept the physical paper slips you can get hold of then by requesting them and I think possibly from online (not 100% on that)!

true,threep03k64,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; A higher proportion of children in the UK live in households where no one works than in almost any other EU country.

Fair enough

&gt; Children growing up without a working adult are less likely to work themselves than children growing up in households where someone is in work.

Well, this could be seen as a social mobility problem but in general I think it is pretty common sense that people growing up in families dependent on the welfare state are going to continue the trend. For sure it is evidence of a problem that should be minimized but it does not excuse the targeting and shaming of a huge amount of honest claimants, and neither do I feel it can be used to explain away our problem with social mobility which surely is far deeper than a small amount of fraudulent welfare claims.


&gt; One in four working-age adults – 10.6 million people – in the UK do not work.

This one I'm curious about. Don't we have lower unemployment levels than many EU countries at the moment? What are the stats in comparison to other countries?

&gt; At least 12 million working-age households receive benefits each week at a cost of around £85 billion per year.

What has this to do with 'feckless welfare dependent citizens'? Many people who receive benefits are in work. This is a failing relating to social inequality and a minimum wage that is not a living wage.

&gt; 2.6 million people have spent at least half of the last ten years on some form of out of work benefit.

This means little to me unless I can compare it with the stats of countries such as France or Germany in order to determine whether this issue truly disproportionately affects the UK. I also feel this does little to challenge the problems we have with low social mobility within this country (which I feel is a problem far deeper than just our welfare system).

&gt; The number of working-age adults claiming Disability Living Allowance has risen by over 40% in the past decade – from 1.2 million in 1997 to 1.8 million in 2009, despite an overall improvement in longevity and health.

This also means little to me unless there is evidence that a significant amount of these people are actually claiming fraudulently. Public perception is [way off](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html) when it comes to how much welfare money is fraudulently received. I am hesistant to read too much into a single stat and make uneducated suppositions.

No, it wasn't, because the topic isn't about release clauses, it's about buy out clauses and whether or not players in Spain all have them, what don't you understand about that?  The fact that you're bringing release clauses up is what's derailing the conversation because we aren't talking about them.

Read through the comments, literally no one other than you is talking about release clauses.  The title says **buy out** clause, the article says **buy out** clause, the comment I initially replied to said 

&gt; I don't really know that all of this ""**Buy out**"" can be taken without a grain of salt.

My comment said

&gt; All LA Liga contracts have **buy out** clauses I believe, but they may only be applicable to transfers between LA Liga teams.

you said

&gt; I think you are half right. As I understand it, La Liga **buyout** clauses only apply to other La Liga sides, legally. But I don't think all players have them.

I linked you to an article that said

&gt; In Spain, where it is a requirement by the Real Decreto 1006/1985 of 26 June (For the Regulation of the Employment of Professional Sportspeople) for **buy-out** clauses to be inserted in every player’s contract.

And this?

&gt; You, of course, know this, but then you call Suarez's release clause a buyout clause.

No, I didn't.  

&gt;Yes, nobody said they were. We aren't talking about **Suarez or his release clause**, we're talking about **Griezmann and his buy out clause** so Suarez's clause is totally irrelevant.

The conversation is about whether or not players in La Liga have buy out clauses, not the difference between a buyout and a release.

My last few flights to SGN have been direct, Vietnam Airlines have been fairly decent since the big re-creation of the firm.  The problem is that there are many places which you wouldn't want to fly over.

Luckily hitting an airline in the jetway is hard.  These planes normally fly at around 300knots IAS, which at that altitude is probably going to be a ground speed of more than 500mph.  The effort required to shoot one down is high, very high.  The economic cost (as you know, me being a capitalist I believe all war is an economic thing) is so high compared to alternatives.

As for who did it, obviously none of us can say.  But I don't see why it would be in the Ukrainian interest, as a false flag exercise it's difficult, the launch of anything capable of taking out a cruising airliner is enough to show up on sat.  Given the whole claims of shooting a An-26, it appears likely that operator error and a lack of quality training could result in someone shooting something down.  to me this seems more likely.

The fact is, that if anyone *really* wants to, they can down an airliner, it's not hard, it is hard to get one in cruise without being inside, but pilot error is still more common, hell I've had my license just 4 years yet I could fill plenty of posts with serious fuck ups I've made or ones I've witnessed (one will always stick in my mind as being unbelievably amazingly stupid by this pc12 guy!).  For things to worry about, worry about that.

Read the transcripts of AF447 for an example of bad planning, bad pilotage and bad CRM...  It's almost enough to not make you ever get on an AF flight again.  If you feel scared after that, have a look at BA 9 in Jakarta for a story that will make you happy to fly.

response

format is like the cuntiest thing ever. But I digress.

So you don't at all think people are mistakenly using ""buyout clause"" when referring to release clauses in this thread and in general? You just fucked it up yourself when you (yep, [you did](http://i.imgur.com/o8uUwi4.png)) mentioned Suarez's ""buyout clause"" (in fact, it was a release clause) which illustrates that people seem to be confusing the two. I thought that was an interesting topic to point out, but you just got pissy.

The person you initially responded to seemed to be talking about both buyout clauses and release clauses lumped together. The distinction between the two is very relevant to that comment, as he's questioning the prevalence, legitimacy and relevance of these clauses. Buyout clauses are wholly *irrelevant* unless Liverpool FC joins La Liga or gets a fuckton more money than we have, as they add 50% to the fee (probably more given the dire tax situation in Spain).

I'm at a loss, honestly. I started what I thought to be an interesting discussion with you, was incorrect about something, corrected myself and used the initial fact that you were correct on to branch the discussion a different way. Instead, you seemed upset that I dared to respond and are now accusing me of putting words in your mouth as if this is a court or something. Jesus, I just was talking with someone on /r/liverpoolfc, yet you didn't really want to discuss, I guess.

And, for the record, you think I'm derailing the conversation we're supposedly having, but you don't think I shouldn't have commented. I guess I should've just responded, ""this guy is 100% right. About everything!""

It was a breezy sunny day in the south of England and I had just finished setting up a range for the university's archery club. The air was balmy, the birds were chirping; it was the kind of weather the prospectus photographer would sacrifice a large goat for. No one was in any hurry to start shooting, not in this weather.

I was taking the beginners through the last bits of how to check your kit. There were piles everywhere and we had a lot of people because it was early in the year; coursework fatigue hadn't set in yet. Everyone was happy and relaxed. We had no idea of the calamity that was about to befall us.

I brushed a tiny spider from my top and another from my trousers. It was spider migration season and I thought nothing of it. A couple of demonstrations later I rescued another, joking about it because a few other people had been landed on.

Our jocular mood was shattered by the one sound you never, ever want to hear on a projectile sports range. From behind me, from behind the targets, from upwind, came a cacophony of banshee shrieking.

Electrified, I dashed down the range without thinking, head down, horrible scenarios churning through my mind. Which idiot started shooting without permission? Had anyone actually been hit? How bad was it? Can we get an ambulance up here? HEMS? Where's our first aid kit and does it actually have anything to help against three feet of carbon-wrapped aluminium travelling at 200 feet per second? My blood pounded in my ears and the air took on a gritty quality. A foul taste seeped into my mouth.

Wait, what? I looked up.
Huge mistake.

A cloud was drifting over the targets, over the whole field, black and gritty and low to the ground. Within, a floating, drifting armada of gossamer hell, its hour come at last, a myriad of tiny beasties gently flying serenely down out of the sky onto our kit, our clothes, into our mouths and noses and ears.

The kit was covered in spiders. The range was covered in spiders. Everyone was covered in spiders, and the spiders themselves, successfully down and landed, proceeded to scurry and swarm about looking for cracks and gaps and crevices to hide in. Clothes, kit, it made no difference.

Those with phobias did not fare well. Years later, in hushed tones, new recruits who dick around on the range are told about The Day The Spiders Came.",0,1405640056,null,0,false,0,cj0fwsm,t3_2ayry5,t1_cj0fwsm,t3_2ayry5,null,1434768741,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

If he did chose Arsenal over his other options solely because of London you'd expect him to mention London somewhere. Plenty of Arsenal signings mention London, including Özil and Debuchy.

&gt;Once again, if The Grauniad and Rodgers are chatting shite, then Alexis will correct them.

Where does the Guardian say this?

And I'm pretty sure Alexis doesn't give a fuck at the moment. He'd only ""respond"" if he's asked in an interview. And if he ""corrects"" them how is that different from the content in the interview? Of-course he won't respond to a question asking ""Did you chose this football club over that one because of the City it was in?"" with ""Yes"". No footballer would ever do that.

did they give u a discount for the second one? i had 50% off on second time round, everyone was telling me it was easy so i didn't go for a guaranteed pass. still worked out cheaper doing 1 day at full then 50% off anyway

Pitot failure isn't a big issue, least of all during cruise.  Power, Pitch, Trim.

It's more about realising it happened, in my case I was flying with an old timer behind me who realised it was a failure as soon as I said I didn't like the airspeed (I'd pitched down a tiny bit to bring it up, with no effect, yet I know in that attitude it would rise, so obviously it was broken, I just felt like it must be me, rather than the kit).  We did our CRM.  I was flying the plane, holding it straight and level, feeling on the controls for a lack of angle of attack (failure for enough speed leading to a stall).  The old timer immediately was on the radio, telling people what's what, asking for the most accurate wind readings available, then insisted on taking the difficult landing, mostly because he was worried we might ding the 75 year old plane!

If you've good teamwork, such failure shouldn't matter.  What scared the bejesus out of me, I'd flown a single engine plane across the channel, two weeks later it suffered engine failure......  You don't want that in the drink.  Thankfully the guy flying at the time was close to home and able to not make a big deal out of it (glide it in for an amazing perfect landing).

It's easy for me to say, say in my comfy chair, typing away but AF447 they messed up.  Panic took hold, no one just tried to fly the plane.  It would have been fine with better training.  Which is kind of the point I was making at the start, compared to flying over unfriendly areas, pilot error, maintance failures etc claim far, far more deaths.  So don't worry too much about that.  Far more likely you'll die on the roads!

Not Liverpool but Demba Ba failed a medical at Stoke before he want to West Ham. Also Paul Robinson (shite left-back, not shite keeper) failed a medical at Wigan. I'm sure there was someone at Everton too, but I can't for the life of me remember.

So it happens, but it's unlikely for an established player to discover they've got a hole in the heart or something.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Those 'European laws' are laws drafted by British lawyers after 1945, supported whole-heartedly by Winston Churchill and the Conservative party at the time, a convention to which we have voluntarily signed up, made by an institution we helped create and only exists by the mutual agreement of nation states. There is absolutely no question of sovereignty here. The European convention is not someone else's prerogative being imposed on us - it is our prerogative. We came up with it, we agreed along with 47 other countries that we would collectively set the Convention as our minimum standard for liberty and freedom from state interference. These are only European law to the extent that they are our laws and we are a European country. 

By your definition sovereignty is only achieved when all international co-operation to set standards or combat global problems such as global warming or genocide is a deplorable loss of sovereignty. No country can be truly free until it isolates itself entirely from the global community - what an incredibly bizarre philosophy to hold in the 21st century when corporations, communications and commercial travel span the globe. 

The fact is the rights guaranteed by the European Convention are a reflection of the ideals held by the British government after the Second World War. The current government has abandoned these ideals and believes that the concept that a citizen might able to resist the power of the state is a disaster waiting to happen - poor PR, international relations damaged and it generally makes the work of government a hassle. It would rather be able to overrule citizens and enforce it's will without regard to their well-being. 

If the government cared so much about sovereignty it would pass a new British constitution that re-enacted every right in the ECHR as British law with a British origin. Thus British judges would use British law to decide human rights cases rather than using an international convention. They won't do that because that would leave the current standards intact. They want to weaken the current standards and the only way to do that is free itself from strict obligations and ensure than very lenient one's replace it.

No it can't. The supreme court cannot strike down laws and has never had the power to do so. If a new law contradicts an old one however important then the relevant sections are impliedly repealed and the new law replaces it. 

The most judges can do WRT human rights is issue a 'declaration of incomparability' under s.4 of the Human Rights Act. That declaration has no legal effect and is merely a declaration than a law is incompatible with the ECHR.

Birmingham’s Martin Taylor lunged at Eduardo and broke the striker’s leg. Arsenal, top of the table, went on to draw their next three league matches and lose 4-0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They eventually finished third.

February 2011 
Birmingham did it again. Arsenal looked a shoo-in for their first silverware since 2005 in the Carling Cup final but Laurent Koscielny’s error allowed Obafemi Martins to score a late winner. In the league, a 4-0 lead at Newcastle was somehow thrown away.

February 2012 
Arsenal’s hopes of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals were left in tatters after a 4-0 demolition by AC Milan. Sunderland knocked the Gunners out of the FA Cup.

February 2013 
Blackburn stunned Arsenal in an FA Cup fifth-round tie Arsene Wenger’s side had dominated. Colin Kazim-Richards struck to end their Wembley dream. Arsenal were also hammered 3-1 at home by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;we do actually have a strong legal tradition and human rights record in this country.

Yes, because we were the ones that came up with the ECHR and we have until the last 10 years post-9/11 abided by it. Only after 9/11 and the 'War on Terror' has the government's position changed - it now considers human rights an obstruction and has no qualms ignore it. 

I hate to make a hyperbolic comparison but what your saying is effectively like saying the German government had a good human rights record in 1939 so there's no reason to worry. Things change, governments change, cultures change, technology changes. The government's current attitude is irreconcilable with its attitude in previous decades hence the change in policy. You can't take refuge in the false security of past experience if the rules of the game have changed. 

I know your talking mainly about the 'putting us in camps' comment but his point stands. There are numerous things the government would currently be able to do and would no doubt still be doing if the ECHR had not stopped it. Stopping and searching people randomly and for no reason is one - that was stopped after an ECtHR case in ~2010. Detaining people without trial indefinitely for was another where even our own courts disliked the legislation - that was declared incompatible with the ECHR in 2004. The government would still be able to lock people up forever with no trial and harass people the government doesn't like (anti-war protesters in this case) with stop and searches in public without needing to give any reason were it not for the ECHR. Concentration camps may be an exaggeration but to say it would be much worse is a very fair assessment.

I just read this whole thread down and you're both about as far into your own little worlds as anything. If you're going to argue that Gylfi was doing everything better than Eriksen at the same ages, then back it up. I just looked up what Eriksen did in 2012 compared to what Glyfi did in 2010. It's marginally different. 

Over the course of their career? Glyfi has apparently banged in more than Eriksen. If that's your logic, then fine. But it's not the reason we're sending Glyfi on his way. 

Then just look at what we want that CAM/10/ to do, and look at who does it better. 
According to **whoscored.com**    
Eriksen: 31 (7) Apps  G:12 A:13 (includes EPL, Europa, Ajax) for **last year.**

Glyfi: 70 (59) Apps	G:27	A:12 (**total for his whole career**)

ERIKSEN's job under AVB (and then Sherwood, even though he was aloof) was to be that creative unlocking mechanism. Under Poch? It may be modified but he too likes to have one of those three up front being the maestro that unlocks defensive patterns.

If it is found out that the Donetsk Peoples Republic did shoot it down they can expect to be designated as a terrorist organisation and much stronger backing for the Ukrainian Government. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more overt help for the Ukrainian Army as well.

If it's found out that the rebels shot down the plane with Russian assistance we can expect all of the above as well as much stronger sanctions against the Russian Government along with fellow E.U. nations and the U.S.

If it's found out that it was the Ukrainian Government was responsible for the destruction of the plane they will be condemned for their actions and we can also expect that the Government will not be giving non-military aid to the country.

The European Court of Human Rights operates on a common law style basis by following it's previous decisions and in that way is more similar to our legal system than any other. 

All common law still applies in the UK and the introduction of the HRA does not allow the government to break the common law...at all...not even a little bit.

The HRA only incorporated the ECHR into British law. It did not add or take away any rights itself. It added some powers for UK courts and required that a few extra governmental institutions abide by the ECHR but other than that it changed nothing and instead managed to save British people money by allowing them to have their case heard in the UK and ruled on rather than being forced to go to the European court every time as was previously the case.

I think he proved more than competent to do so, but he wasn't ready for the first team yet.

Without other games he just sat.

In the context of the Chelsea game, Smith was brought on in lieu of Alberto because we lacked competent pace on the touch line and the press with Willian was absolutely killing us. Smith came in to stretch the game because he was pacey.

1) get a proven Premier league scorer, who has netted 17 times with West Brom and 15 times with us last season.

2) uncapped potential, which is hard to quantify but exciting nonetheless, which segues into my third point

3) a possible bargaining chip/cash cow further down the road when people are knocking at Goodison to inquire how much they can get the beastly Belgian for.

It's why I think him being sold is pointless for his development because he will run into the same problem wherever he goes. He will still be a player with great physical attributes, good finishing for his age, and a lack of technical ability at the moment. He will potentially struggle to be effective against the packed defenses he'll play against and would be back where he started, fighting for his place on the team. 

The reason I say self-entitled is that a 21 year old with incredible physical gifts could have 15 more years to play if he takes care of himself. Not every striker starts at a top club at the age of 21. In fact, find me one that does because they are few and far between. He could learn a lot being the second striker on this team and I'm sure he could outcompete Torres for that spot.

The UK may feel as if it is low on resources because the size of the pie shrunk in 2008 - 2013. We are finally back growing, and hopefully the conservatives may have at least rebalance things a little with the cuts (I mean it was a really inhumane way to do it, but I seriously hope they have at least helped a bit). If the UK wants to remain relevant and competitive internationally we need more people and an economy to support them.

Edit: Its not paradise and has a lot of problems, just making the point that its waaay more crowded than the UK, as are many places which don't suck. 

The real issue is the shape of the labour market in the UK I think. There are simply not jobs for much of the bottom section of society. Its not their fault, we automated their jobs or rendered ourselves uncompetitive  by making it so they didn't die in droves at work or get paid a pound a day. Thats the right thing to do, its also the reason we can't have manufacturing back (without robots automating it all). 

The only answer I can see to that is to somehow create something productive and profitable for them.... but the service industry isn't enough and the inner cities have been rotting for three generations. You can't put industry back in the bad parts of glasgow or the northern english cities because they and their population are too fucked on drugs and by their life experiences so far.

true,kopking08,null,null,"He's a young lad who clearly demonstrated he has lots of talent. His year on loan will prove all we need to know.

I think a lot of people forget, because Liverpool have not had much upper tier talent to loan out in recent years (like City, Chelsea, Utd, and Arsenal have), but loaning a player out IS an opportunity for him to prove himself. Plenty of players do. Some just don't make the grade. Some may someday but just aren't ready right now and there's no sense waiting on them. 

Who knows what camp Alberto will fall into. He seems like a decent lad so I wish him the best but it's hard to argue with the fact that we have all kinds of talent, not to mention potential signings, coming for the positions he plays.

One thing I have to say I love about our team right now is that we really have so many young players playing the same positions but in different ways. Ibe and Sterling are really pure pace men (although Sterling has obviously show he can be much more than that). Then you've got lads like Coutinho, Suso, Alberto, and Teixiera who are tricky and can occasionally use a burst of speed, but are more likely to hold up play and pick a pass.

No one can deny Brendan has options at his disposal. 

In many ways we're going to see now, more than ever, his aptitude as a manager. It's one thing just picking the best 11 week after week and not having to change very much (barring injury). It's another managing a team with multiple options at every position (mind, I haven't forgotten Alberto and others will be out on loan).

And this was just from filtering the news feed on this sub. 

""Don't I dare""? I'll dare to say w/e the hell I want, since this is after all meant to be a discussion board, not an echo chamber (cue jokes). Lukaku is a big boy and if he opens up his mouth to the media he has to live with the consequences, hence Mourinho pulling that stunt about ""tell the country why you left"", which is when a lot of the people on here at least starting turning against him (myself *not* included). How many times has Bertrand opened his mouth and complained to the media about not starting? How about Ba? How about Schurrle? What about Azpi, who started often under Rafa only to have to beat England's best left back out of a position he isn't even natural in? Does Mikel complain even though he's been here longer than almost all the starters? What about the rest of our loanees? Literally only Courtois and Lukaku are opening their mouths to the media frequently. Piazon only ever says that he just wants to work hard. Bamford never talks to the media as far as I can tell. Atsu? Nothing. Don't act like Lukaku is some lamb that needs defending or being manipulated against his will by the media. There is a reason most other athletes never say anything interesting to the press and you'd think someone as smart as we're told Lukaku is would realize that. 

Which brings me back to my original post. I don't think it's a coincidence that we've had bad experiences with 3 Belgians now over this past season (KDB failing to care and Lukaku and Courtois running their mouths). They are incredibly talented and so young. They've been this way their whole lives and have widely been recognized as a ""golden generation"" for Belgium. I'm not a psychologist, but calling anyone ""golden"" probably is not going to help them develop a well-balanced ego. Of course the media is going to try and draw headlines out of them, but they do that with pretty much all other high profile players and most don't bite. It says something about the immaturity of these kids that they keep falling for the same trap of talking too much to the press.

Short of calling up the player ourselves, we rely on the media, the player, and his managers to tell us what is going on in his world. The fact is, you can complain about the links I've posted above, but pretty much what I said off the top of my head was true. He has said he wants to play for a CL team now and that on more than one occasion has said that he needs to be starting.",0,1405661694,null,0,false,0,cj0oq59,t3_2aztjc,t1_cj0oq59,t1_cj0naap,null,1434773028,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Like with many supporters, of course Torres has been a frustrating case, but he has shown up in important matches to say the least, which of course leads a whole lot to be desired in those pesky lower matches but I'll take it.  

The current Ba circlejerk is kinda stupid if you ask me. He was our most useless striker last season, and if you think otherwise, other than against PSG and Liverpool, where did we benefit from Ba? Against Swansea? Everything else was just goal stat-paddings in matches that were already won. I like Chicharito as a Mexico NT supporter, but like everyone else, I know his limitations....so when I see people in this sub bashing him and then seeing Ba getting praised, all I see is a bunch of double standards. Same with Lukaku, who's great strength of holding the ball hides the fact that he can't do anything else, for anyone else who watched the Everton games to see him....and his ability to go missing in big games.

As for the Bamford circlejerk, I know some people might be joking but there are a few legitimately alarming ones.

The one constant in all their post is not one of them can name a single thing Torres is good at as a striker.  He has nothing going for him.  He has one of the worst shots to goal ratio even in his prime, he has bad first touch, he has bad technique and constantly loses the ball, don't ever look threatening, mentally weak, lost his pace, can't pass, can't dribble.  He had one world class skill with his acceleration to get pass defenders to be 1 vs 1 with gk so he can actually score a goal and he lost it.

He is not even good as a back up as he has nothing in his locker.",1,1405662830,null,0,false,0,cj0p30a,t3_2b0gzf,t1_cj0p30a,t1_cj0oo9q,null,1434773288,-4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-4
