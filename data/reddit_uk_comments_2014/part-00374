There are more complicated factors going on here than simply ""If we can get % of the wind, then we can power the UK.""

Based on 25% capacity (which is pretty reasonable for a wind turbine), each 1.5 MW turbine can generate around 3GWh per year. In 2009 the UK used about 400,000 GWh.

That means we need 133,333 Wind turbines to power the UK (assuming reliable 25% capacity across the board and no peaks).

We currently have about 4000. They were the cheap ones.

Do you see how this is not an issue of lack of resources, but a lack of ability to tap into them?

If you are dying of thirst on a boat, it doesn't matter how much seawater there is, if you are in a salty swimming pool or the pacific, what matters is your capacity to turn seawater into something drinkable.

Really that's not even the problem, eventually it will become economical to do even the most expensive engineering operations (make a really big seawater condenser in my analogy) if the political will is there, the problem is it might take centuries at the rate we are currently at.

That's the real problem, time.

The graph in my previous post shows that even with all the push towards Renewables over a 10 year period, we still are only at around 7%. 

Even if we were doubling the rate we adopted renewable energy, it would still take 20 years to get to 50% renewable.

That isn't even realistic because the costs get higher and higher the more we do of it because renewable energy requires so much land, political will, construction costs and much more.

Looking at the [BBC version](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30426164) there are four main areas being 'announced' here:

1. GCHQ working with police on the 'dark net',

2. Tech firms working together with the IWF on a database of material,

3. Banning the possession of ""paedophile training manuals,""

4. Making it illegal for an adult to send a sexual communication to a child.

Personally, it is 4 that I am most worried about. 1 has been around for ages; GCHQ has the legal authority to aid police in their investigations, and I'm not sure there is much evidence that they're working closer or not than before - I think this is more about reminding people that GCHQ is there to protect children so stop worrying about it for invading your privacy.

Microsoft has been running a database of illegal images of children for some time now (there was a high-profile arrest a few months ago based on something being flagged by it). The 'new' thing here (new in the sense that it was first discussed/announced a year or so ago) is that these companies will be working together from a central database. Expanding this to copyright is an interesting thought given that - from what the articles say - I think that the video-scanning software Google is contributing is probably based on ContentID; something created originally for copyright.

3 is already included in the Serious Crime Bill. This Bill had its first reading in the Lords back in June, so there's nothing new here. It is kind of worrying, given the broad definitions used - similar to terrorism laws.

4 is worrying as it is the new thing. This law hasn't been proposed yet - and I am concerned that it is something that seems easy to legislate, but could be very awkward in practice. Particularly given how they define ""adult"", ""child"" and ""sexual."" For example, a communication could be a Reddit post, to a child could cover ""someone under 18 could be reading the thread,"" an adult could cover an 18 year-old, and ""sexual"" could cover any number of random insults. This will very much depend on the details.

*tl;dr - most of this isn't new, and is mostly just Cameron speechifying.

Even to take your first statement:
&gt;Perhaps people don't realise that the government aren't interested in the youtube videos you watch, the reddit questions you ask and answer, but only the illegal things you do.

The same as every time you walk out your house you should answer a questionnaire on where you are going, how long you'll be and who your seeing?  Then again upon your return so if a crime is committed they can use that data to confirm you MIGHT have committed it, then use that data to search your entire life for ANYTHING that can use to convict you?

&gt;The criminal laws which exist for these crimes already exist and have done for a while

Exactly, so why are we expanding the drag net to cover the ENTIRE population just ENCASE they do something which might be covered in these laws.

Just because technology allows blanket surveillance does not mean it is justifiable or advisable.

Nothing to hide nothing to fear is bullshit.  It is used as suppression of descent or 'extremist' views which frankly now could be anything from thinking people deserve welfare with out having to answer a questionnaire.

The progress would be much more subtle. It's actually already happened, and I didn't notice you protesting...

&gt;Legislation is allowed to be amended, anyone that claimed that if you remove the new filters then you'd have to remove the child porn filters as well would be laughed at, all you'd need to do is pass an amendment that stops the additional filters.

This is exactly what happens. Just look at the debates last year on ISP filtering. Now, when you look at the details you find all sorts of material was tagged on to the filtering; it wasn't just about ""porn"" at all. But nobody successfully made that argument. What politician is going to take a public stand and make that change happen?

As a teacher the closed commercial systems we used like SIMS or the complete mess of VLE systems meant that not only was switching system costly and a huge waste of time (putting off staff from ever investing in the IT) but also that most times you can't actually access your own data (say on attendance cross referenced to home location) because it's owned by a private company.

Proper, high quality open source software supported by open, well organised data could drive massive cost savings in the public sector as well as driving innovation. Even just adding design and focussed funding to some open source initiatives would be great. Imagine improving Libre Office, or porting systems to Ubuntu, or adding some decent design skills to Moodle. The cost savings from MS licences and overpriced Frog systems alone would run to the millions.

A lot of issues have already sprang forth from Sellafield and honestly it's the most mismanaged place in the country.

Unfortunately a lot of the waste that's up there is from several decades ago and we don't have complete records of what has been dumped into silos or vaults. What this means is a lot of designing for worst case scenarios which increases cost significantly which means Sellafield choose not to do it.

I'll give you an example:

There is a particular silo up in Sellafield called PFCS (information is available on Sellafields website). There have been many interations of the plan to empty the silo over the past 2 decades and it just ends up cycling round...""it's too complicated, lets revisit it in a couple of years""....""it's too expensive, lets revisit it in a couple of years""...""theres not enough space for that design, lets revisit it in a couple of years"". Almost every major nuclear consultancy has been given a shot at it as has Sellafields own engineers, most spending at least a year on developing a detailed design of a process which gets knocked back due to cost. 

That design process is bloody expensive.

Thankfully SL are now starting to look at using modular temporary structures to remove the waste from the store which is a lot cheaper, and gets rid of the age old problem of building a plant to demolish a plant. 


Renewables do not compete with nuclear, the variability of the loads has to be dampened with CCGT which makes lowers the overall efficiency of the grid. With the reduction of nuclear capacity we've actually seen a resurgence of coal and increased usage of CCGT to help prevent brownouts. 
This is not a role that renewables can deal with unless we overbuild massively or have a diverse renewables mix to deal with the inherent variability.

The reactor type at Fukushima had known problems for decades. Engineers had asked for that entire generation of plants to be shut down as soon as was possible due to the known flaws. It isn't that they are guaranteed to go bad more that any disaster would be far worse than necessary because of the ongoing decay of the containment system from that generation of reactors*. Not really any different to the situation in Chernobyl. The problem in both cases was insufficient containment.

All of this said Fukushima is nothing like a modern reactor. Modern reactors use more well thought out systems than building a reactor into a plain containment system made out of concrete and steel. Unfortunately the more advanced materials are much more expensive. Even then there are much more intrusive on going inspections (with all the usual expensive caveats that come with working in the nuclear industry) because we aren't entirely sure these new materials will hold up either in the long run.

There is no more repression in choosing to wear a niqab than in choosing to wear a bikini. Both outfits signal things about the culture and religious beliefs of the wearers, and both play to different audiences. Being in a position to choose freely where to walk, what to wear, who to talk to, and what to believe is the opposite of being repressed.

There are some specific scenarios in which neither of the above choices are appropriate, in which wearing actual clothes or a visible face is required. Most people are quite happy to modify their choices for those scenarios - a niqab-wearer will usually accept the need to remove the face veil in a bank or whilst going through customs, and those who do not are generally in a position where it is acceptable to send another person to act in their stead.

false,MrFuckingRandom,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt; do you not think you have a right to privacy?

We do, but we don't have the right to commit crimes freely. The 'surveilance' that people are scaremongering is the equivalent of a policeman on the streets watching for someone committing a crime. If he can do that in public, why not do it in another public domain? (ie: the internet).

People are assuming that every text, email, search term and video they download is saved onto some sort of file for future reference and prosecution. That's crazy. How much memory would that take up and how much would it cost for an unjustifiably small number of convictions for the actual criminals they'd catch? Only the illegal things would flag up (a sort of filter system), and then you'd be tried in court as you said you'd be fine with. 

Your questionnaire analogy simply doesn't hold water, not least because the police are not actively looking for people to convict. It's not a cross-examination, its a guard. They are not going to tear peoples internet history apart, looking for something. 

The expansion of the drag net, as you put it, is simply to catch the criminals who are currently getting away with their crimes. It is as simple as that. 

&gt;  It is used as suppression of descent or 'extremist' views which frankly now could be anything from thinking people deserve welfare with out having to answer a questionnaire

I'm afraid you have delved into the depths of paranoia with that. The government (who is just one political party) cannot suppress dissent because they face publicised dissent every day in the opposition so that would be a futile attempt, disregarding that it is human nature that there will be disagreement. As for 'extremist', well that definition exists because extremist views are those which are held by a very small minority of people. Since they do not represent the majority or even a significant portion of the populus, they should be restrained, but we as a society do that ourselves by opposing them.

If the government did not have to pander to public opinion, I don't imagine it would be much different to what it is just now. The conservatives are not known for holding back what they want to do because of public opinion and in a paternalistic fashion, they tend to just do it. 

I'm not a conservative, but somewhere between a socialist and a liberal. I, like many of you, cannot see the rationale for the recent porn production laws(and find them rather sexist) and I fundamentally disagree with the privatisation of the NHS.

Sure, and going naked is no different. What, are you going to repress me for doing so? Being a member of society isn't about treating society like a chinese meal.

&gt;who do not are generally in a position where it is acceptable to send another person to act in their stead.

This gives away more than you might realise.

&gt;I would argue we need fewer laws restricted the freedom to dress according to choice rather than more.

Sure, remember than next time you walk into a bank wearing a balaclava or a crash helmet.

&gt;The Naked Rambler should not be at constant risk of imprisonment.

Yes he should - for two reasons;

1) He's doing something that he *and he alone* insists is acceptable. That's not how things work, and it's pretty naive to pretend that they do.

2) He has children, but would rather get locked up repeatedly and deny them a father with the justification being a pointless crusade that nobody else cares about.

Maybe you should find a better example than someone who is clearly mentally ill.

I think this it's important that we start to really think about this attitude, though. We're all aware that people have different experiences growing up, their lifestyles, diets, religions, habits etc. We know that we cannot expect people to have the same understanding of things as us. And then we laugh at those who try to learn, just because we feel like we never had to put any effort into learning those things. We grew up with it. It's just so intrinsic to our lifestyle that the idea of not knowing those things is completely alien to us. We're all guilty of doing this from time to time, but I think we need to look at ourselves and seriously think whether this is the kind of behaviour we want to exhibit. Do we want people to think we're going to laugh at them if they come to us for help? Which particular things are we allowed to laugh at people for not knowing? Should we even draw a line?

Aren't we all aware that sharing knowledge is basically a good thing - that helping and teaching others is how we progress and grow as people?

The 'surveilance' that people are scaremongering is the equivalent of a policeman on the streets watching for someone committing a crime. If he can do that in public, why not do it in another public domain? (ie: the internet).

You can see the policeman on the street.  He also has the ability to use common sense and discretion.

&gt;People are assuming that every text, email, search term and video they download is saved onto some sort of file for future reference and prosecution. 

No, I'm assuming that all the metadata is being recorded.  Where you go, who you communicate with, the headings and the timings.  Those are significantly dangerous things to be stored.  Especially useful for squashing protests and descent as you can prove association with known trouble makers, and under current situations that is close enough to terrorism that you can be hauled over the coals and have your entire life opened up for investigation just because you emailed someone a few times.

&gt;Your questionnaire analogy simply doesn't hold water
It does, as they are looking to pertain and hold information on everyone encase a crime is committed so they already have evidence to prosecute should they happen to suspect you.

&gt;I'm afraid you have delved into the depths of paranoia with that

I feel if they are going to take such a hard-right wing approach, the only way to meet a common ground is to present a hard left wing approach and hope the middle-compromise is reasonable.

Rather than they propose a right ring approach, I propose a central approach, we meet half way between center and right.

&gt;As for 'extremist', well that definition exists because extremist views are those which are held by a very small minority of people. Since they do not represent the majority or even a significant portion of the populus, they should be restrained, but we as a society do that ourselves by opposing them.

Wrong, we do that by education.  Extremist views just mean vastly different.  We are being taught to associate the word with terrorists and fear.  It is not those things.  Different should not be illegal, and this society rapidly feels like it is going in that direction.

&gt;If the government did not have to pander to public opinion, I don't imagine it would be much different to what it is just now. The conservatives are not known for holding back what they want to do because of public opinion and in a paternalistic fashion, they tend to just do it.
I actually think they deliberately release what they want to media wait for public opinion to sway into the camps they like and then announce there policies.

&gt;Once we all reach the point of education where physical violence is only indicative of actual mental illness and seriously irrational outbursts it starts changing things quite quickly.

Mental illness is a good place to start. 150 years ago women with ""hysteria"" were placed in asylums for the rest of their lives. Mainly because they [didn't quite take to cleaning the house constantly](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/menalhealthandillness/womanandpsychiatry.aspx). It was seen as a genuine mental illness, to be a real person and not just a ""woman"", as defined by the times. Irrational outbursts, indeed!

So it's not even ignorance of individuals that's a problem, it's the ignorance of ""the times"". Society and science is stupid in terms of the future. Today will be proved to be wrong. Yesterday's hated suffragettes are today's valuable politicians. Yesterday's [chemically-castrated suicide victims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) are today's [top CEOs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook). 

Our current knowledge of the brain and minds are, basically, pathetic. Today's mental illness will turn out to be the response of a sane mind to unbearable societal structuring - perhaps.

So best to keep privacy. So long as people's everyday behaviour with others is within acceptable bounds, let them do as they please behind closed doors - and don't be tempted to make doors (made of wood or technology) become transparent or un-closeable.

Wearing one signals that you are a part of mainstream western culture and aren't a member of several religions and sects, and that you aren't socially conservative. 

I've met women who disagree with women's suffrage. Much as I disagree with them and will fight to prevent their wishes from becoming reality, I believe they have a right to hold that position and a right to have their husbands represent them in life outside the home as far as that is their wish. They are European Christians from a highly conservative area and were given full suffrage less than twenty-five years ago.

Obviously, there needs to be a high degree of scrutiny to identify situations in which women are being represented by others against their wishes and in which the representatives act in bad faith, but I don't believe it necessary that someone deal directly with an institution they cannot comfortably deal with if there is a person willing and able to act as their representative.

It's a very difficult area. Obviously, any area where crime can occur needs to have a police force. However, it's just a fact that if legislation and technology are too broad-brush - if there isn't sufficient accountability or maybe even the *possibility* of that - things will be abused. No conspiracy, just practicality.

It may be that we have to make ""tough decisions"". It may be that we end up with a choice where we have to actually *choose* to not have full powers of investigation, because of the downsides that go with it. For instance, if we fully log everyone's location and internet communications all the time and link it to their ID and medical records and so on - well, we can potentially stamp out crime and run a very efficient country!

But practically speaking, the potential abuse for that power is horrific, and there is no real way for the public to hold the government, police, etc accountable, because the technological aspect is remote. 

So we don't want that. But where do we draw the line? How do we *actively decide to not take all the power we could?* The real answer is that we won't, and it just happens secretly instead of publicly (GCHQ).

Of course, what'll happen is that once companies sense they are being put at a disadvantage they (see: Apple) will start introducing encryption and lobbying against measures. So it always swings back and forth, hopefully. It may be that the tensions been economic and political interests are what keep things from being on the slippery slope. There *is* a slippery slope: unobstructed, our governments would go for complete coverage. It's a case of, do we have appropriate counter-weights?

Although, they may also be waiting until after the transfer window to gauge the club's intentions. Sterling is ambitious; he wants to improve as a player in a way he can only do by having good players around him and he wants to win things.

But they do it already! The equality commission is taking Asher's to court!

&gt; Ok yeah, fair point on the distinction. But yes, while you're right, it's at odds with the prevailing thought these days of ""live and let live"". It's not that I don't understand Ashers taking a stand - I do. But I think it was the wrong stand to make.

Its irrelevant whether you agree with their stance or not, that's why we have freedom of speech.

&gt; If they had made it about the political statement instead of about the underlying issues, it would have been more understandable. They should probably hire you for PR. They said ""We're not making cakes for them because homosexuality is immoral"" instead of ""Politics? We're not fucking stupid, no chance""

They weren't making the cakes in question, because of their moral beliefs.

&gt;No, it certainly isn't. And certainly they were never told not to express their views. 

But they are being explicitly told to express views contrary to their own.

&gt;Instead, they let their views guide their customer interaction and this is why the Equality commission got involved. But the greater picture is the issue - where does it stop. It starts with refusing to sell a cake with a gay slogan, but where does it stop? Refusing service to all gay customers without fear of reprise?

Ah so it's a slippery slope argument then? My opinion is if the product or service is explicitly for a specific agenda. A painter wouldn't have to paint a slogan, but a shopkeeper couldn't refuse to sell the plant. Of course that is what the above consultation says but with the exact wordings proposed its not exactly black and white.

&gt;I was generalising the order as the person, indeed. Fair enough. Yet would it be a logical leap to assume (whether right or wrong) that person was also gay if you were the one taking the order? So I would argue that discrimination is the case here (However possibly tenuous).

I think it is a waste of time to labour on this point, while it may be the case its very hard to prove and isn't necessarily to every case that may arise.

&gt;Yet unusually (as is normally the case in things like this), no-one else has lept on the bandwagon with their own stories. Which suggests this is the first time it's ever occurred. So I stand by suggesting they're cherrypicking.

Again that's a fair bit of conjecture, it could also be evidence that everyone else is fine with respecting the proprietor's right to his own beliefs. 

&gt;Nobody asked them to add ""Supported by Ashers"" on the cake or make a public statement in support of the cause. They're just being obstinate and awkward. 

How is making an item with a slogan on it for public sale and consumption not public? People ask all the time where the cakes come from at all sorts of events.

&gt;If I sell someone an Amnesty International pin at the til, does that mean I support Amnesty? Definitely not.

No, but you didn't make the pin, nor were you promoting its sale, however of you were, for what ever reason, opposed to Amnesty international, then you would have the opportunity not to stock their merchandise.

&gt;Fortunately I can debate without thinking the other person is a tosser (Hint: I don't think you're a tosser), and I agree with freedom of speech and open debate. I just find your stance odd, especially with the suggestion of your beliefs being bought. 

Say the Asher's case goes ahead and Asher's loose. There is a precident set in law that a person can come into your place of business and upon the offer of money force you to by your actions, support a cause you disagree with. Let's take this to an extreme example, I'm a sign painter (I'm not really but just imagine) I'm working away merrily painting slogans for a local shop or business. Some fellow comes along and asks me to paint a slogan in support of Sinn Fein, I'm not going to do that for moral and ethical reasons, never mind my personal political beliefs. However this man can now bring me to court and because of the tort law I'd be liable. You might think this is silly but its not that far fetched. 

&gt;The courts? I joke.

I walked into this one.

&gt;&gt;  And if so how does that equate with your notion of equality?
&gt;Didn't tell you to not express your beliefs - I actually asked!

I can't help but notice this isn't an answer. Regardless.. So I'm allowed to express myself but Asher's can't, and before you say they could still express themselves regardless of whether they made the cake or not, there would be an awful lot less weight behind that statement if they did.",0,1418308712,null,0,false,0,cmrsvgq,t3_2oo83g,t1_cmrsvgq,t1_cmquuv4,null,1425486900,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

Dark net is anything not public. Your work intranet is a 'dark net'. The government is totally overstepping the mark by suggesting it should have access to any and all networks.

The 'deep web' is encapsulation inside encapsulation but tends to be public. The difference is that there is no central directory of sites within 'deep web'. Finding websites by chance inside 'deep web' systems is extremely difficult because not only is there no central listing, it's *really slow* which rules out any chance of just iterating through all the possible addresses to find something. This is where criminals go to do their stuff. It's security through obscurity. You need techy folk to reach into these networks and find these people, mass surveillance is a waste of time.

&gt;So in the interests of public protection it needs to be policed. 

I agree but it can be done without mass surveillance. I would strongly argue it is more effective without mass surveillance which does *nothing* to reach into these 'deep web' networks.

&gt;That being said i'm also against statewide surveillance of everything and everyone, mainly because it could compromise people's intellectual property. 

Well that and it's not your job either. The police are there to prevent crime, not listen in on people's intimate moments to use against them in the future. This isn't policing by consent. This is the imposition of the state over it's citizens. It is a fundamental shift in the power structure of the UK. Those who hold the keys to GCHQ have power over us all.

&gt; I don't believe this is the beginning of a slippery slope, but I do like privacy

It's not the beginning. We're past the beginning. The government has already spent tens of billions of pounds to get to this point, if not more. This is us sliding down the slope and picking up pace. Stretching the truth just a little more each time; justifying further intrusions into people's private lives. Do you honestly trust a system which protects [murderers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan_%28private_investigator%29) and [pedophiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier)? We should all be equal under the eyes of the law, don't you think?

&gt;but I don't see any other way to combat child abuse and drug dealing going forward without some sort of cyber espionage. 

I don't know your professional background but the government cut funding to the police's Child Exploitation &amp; Online Protection which was specifically and successfully tackling child abuse. Ergo, none of this is about protecting children. This is 100% about seizing control of people's lives, adults and children alike. This is the modern day Stasi. This is Big Brother.

There is hope for us all though. We need to *take back* the privacy by using encryption and by securing our communications. The government and GCHQ (NSA et al.) declared war on the populations of the free world without a word spoken in public. They want to strip our privacy from us and coerce us with the information. You may trust the people in power today, but what about in 10 years? Or 20 years? Or 30 years? Will the people with all this power always be so benevolent? History says no. 

I'd ask the police to stand their ground and say no to these new powers, to stand by policing by consent and eventually take the people proposing these things to prison. They will be found to be utterly corruptable and abusive in the fullness of time. 

Edit: Toned down the hyperbole and fact checked some bits. I don't think I can overstate how truly dangerous these technologies and legislation, and the trend they reflect, are.

Still, it's good and fun to keep up eh. :-)

And it's good just to disabuse yourself of the notion that ""humans always make progress and progress continues ever upwards"". We're not on a stairway to an inevitable shiny future. Lots of people think so, and that can make you complacent.

In 1992 Francis Fukuyama - well-respected political scientist and economist - wrote a book called *The End of History and the Last Man*, in which he said:

&gt;""What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.""

See how that turned out.

false,MrFuckingRandom,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt; He also has the ability to use common sense and discretion

Discretion, unfortunately should have no place in criminal law. That is why you have defences available in court. There are 'de minimis' rules which allow a court to dismiss a case for not being substantial but that's up to the court. Believe it or not, the courts are very reasonable and I've seen a few prosecutors get chewed up for charging nonsense.

&gt; Where you go, who you communicate with, the headings and the timings

I still feel that these things are not recorded in general(a 'just in case' measure) because its a massive waste of time and elements of it are potentially inadmissable in court and so are just wasteful. Where they may start doing that, is once an investigation starts after someone is caught distributing illegal materials. But then its an investigation no different to when the police search your home with a warrant.

&gt; I feel if they are going to take such a hard-right wing approach, the only way to meet a common ground is to present a hard left wing approach and hope the middle-compromise is reasonable

This is why we vote! Or why we should. If you want to counteract a far-right party (Tories are actually centre-right), then you have to vote the other way (a left leaning, ie: Lib Dems or equivalent). Whilst I agree with this measure, I didn't agree with others that could have been prevented if there was another party strong enough to oppose them. 

&gt; We are being taught to associate the word with terrorists and fear

Yes and no. The word extremist is currently being used selectively, but it's a media phenomenon as much as anything else. For politics, we favour the term 'radical' and for terrorism, we use the word 'extremism'. They are essentially the same. Those terms shouldn't always mean illegal, I agree. For instance, the socialist party are radical, but I disagree they should be illegal. The BNP are on the opposite side and are radical/extremist, but I believe their racist views, if acted upon, should be illegal (and they currently are). However, there are clear examples where extremist views and acts are illegal and should be (ie: ISIS are extremist and believe that those who don't convert to Islam should die in the name of the Islamic state.). 

&gt; using catching child abusers as cover for a whole ungodly amount of online censorship

&gt; I am going to maintain my stance that the governments actions are not really censorship but policing. You can still access information of any kind except sites which have been shut down for illegality (and they are illegal by the legal view of the entire political spectrum (aside from socialists in respect of piracy). This is totally different to true censorship such as what China has, where they cannot access information about their own history or information from abroad.

&gt; Then why has every single internet police law turned into censorship?

As I said, I don't believe it has turned into censorship, but I believe there are instances where it has been abused. However, evidence has always been the subject of controversy in criminal law, particularly entrapment and police officers bugging cells. These publicised cases are in the minority, and are simply the human flaw of officers being far too eager to convict, blinded to the possibility of innocence. 

I'd like to ask: assuming you are not a padeophile and you agree that while the illegality of being a paedophile (such as one who does not act on it) is questionable, but the production and distribution of child porn is certainly illegal, how do you stop that crime (particularly the distribution element) and serve some justice to the victim?",0,1418309007,null,0,false,0,cmrszuv,t3_2oykm3,t1_cmrszuv,t1_cmrsajx,null,1425486844,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It really disturbs me how many reddit users are totally against any implementation of the law on the internet. Children have the right to safety and their rights are every bit as important as any adult's, that should not be controversial but on reddit apparently it is. 

This sensationalist bullshit always happens, any crack down on rape culture, sexual assault, paedophilia, forced marriage.. it always gets reported here as if the government is planning to ban all porn and sex, because a large vocal group here - which I hope is actually just a minority without much else to do - can't accept the fact that it's not acceptable for one group to have unlimited rights which impede the basic human rights of other groups. 

I swear on this issue this subreddit is just as thoughtless and gullible as when the US pro-gun subreddits get in to hysteria over any mention of gun-control. The same arguments are used in both cases; any application of the law will result in Orwellian dictatorship, no ones' rights, not even the right to life, is more important that OP's rights because individual freedoms always trump the rights of others, victims don't matter, their experience is not valid and they should be mocked and silenced, because paying attention to them would involve having to think about empathy and common sense responses to real problems, and that would involve thinking about something a bit harder than regurgitating the last terribly researched article VICE published. 

The fact that real children are being rescued from harm thanks to co-operation between law enforcement and technology companies doesn't even enter in to the discussion most of time, people are too busy playing devil's advocate and defending the abusers.

The breakdown of the popular vote:

CON: 36.1%

LAB: 29.0%

LIB: 23.0%

Nearly a quarter of the country voted for Lib Dems, yet they have 8.7% of the seats in parliament.

Each Lib Dem seat represents an average of 119,934 votes cast for them, each Conservative seat represents an average of 34,865, Each Labour seat represents on average 33,359. 

At that sort of averages, Even with 12 million votes (1.5 million more than the Conservatives in 2010) they would still only have 100 seats out of the 650.

How can anyone justify criticising the Lib Dems for saying ""hang on a minute, something isn't right here.""?

Sure, a more proportional voting system would benefit them, but only so the number of MPs they have in parliament is proportional to how many people voted Lib Dem. Does that sound unreasonable?

I should also point out that Lib Dems got 80% as many votes as Labour does in 2010, how is that not a massive news story about how badly our votes are mis-represented.

Having a strong one-party government from FPTP is overrated in my opinion, having agreements between parties means they have to focus on the realities and the public's wishes rather than their own ideologies.

Also, Most people on this sub would probably say the Conservatives got their ideology wrong in the last 4 years, but it could have been so much worse with a majority Conservative government.

||
:-:|
Sterling Markovic |
Gerrard |
Lallana  Henderson|
Lucas |
Moreno Yolo Skrtel Johnson |
Mignolet |



I will personally go for the diamond, since it's the formation that evokes the strongest memories last season. I want old hands as our centre-backs, hence no Lovren; no fooling around with our weakest new signing in our weakest area against the scum. I also want attacking full-backs to supplement our mediocre attack, so Moreno and Johnson get the nod. 

Lucas looks very solid as CDM and should be our primary player in that role. Gerrard I put in central attack, since he seems to have genuinely discovered his brilliant former marauding CAM form — if only for 45 minutes. Coutinho can come on for Gerrard.

Lallana and Henderson have *got* to be our creative midfield engine going into the future. Both played brilliantly last season, both recently displayed flashes of their former talent, and both have got to find their respective oppoistion-wrecking forms again or we're gonna be toast as a team. 

Up front, I go for speed; I want the team to base their game around the SAS speedsters of yesteryear. Markovic and Sterling are our two fastest players, so even though they are technically midfield wingers I will want to try them as strikers. Borini can play backup to either, or Sturridge if he ever gets fit enough to last past the starting whistle.",0,1418309959,null,0,false,0,cmrtefo,t3_2oyyuu,t1_cmrtefo,t3_2oyyuu,null,1425486656,26,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,26

They may keep that property in Cardiff to not affect the Experience which is already an attraction, not really a ride. 

Having said that, it would make sense for them to use one of their most international properties so the ride will appeal to a large amount of people. 

They also haven't been specific about whether it's just one ride or a bunch of rides. I'd heard rumours there'd be a whole part of the park themed around BBC shows. Which is basically what Alton Towers already have, with CBeebies Land (which is due to be expanded also.)

As OP said, these are all just rumours. The whole park is really still up in the air right now and there's not really anything tangible to go by. It would be a great thing for the UK, if it's as big and significant as it's been rumoured. All we know is that a £2bn theme park might come into existence in the next few years and that, if it happens, there will be at least one ride based on a BBC property.

I completely with you. It's always been that way. The same reason we have police powers of search and entry: We can't just go into anyone's house, even if we suspect them of committing a crime. Unfortunately it means people get away with things, but it's there to protect innocent people and safeguard some of our basic human rights, right to a private life etc.
  
I think it needs to be exactly the same on the internet. If something is in the public domain then it's fair game to law enforcement agencies, the same way I can patrol any street and any public area. But once GCHQ and co want to read your emails or go on your own private intranet, then they need warrants or they need to abide by RIPA, like they do on the streets, and somewhere, some independent body needs to be checking that what they're doing is proportional, legal, accountable and necessary. My concern is that they're doing things that skirt round that, and that's certainly not policing by consent, which is what separates UK police from everyone else.",0,1418311547,null,0,false,0,cmru4if,t3_2oykm3,t1_cmru4if,t1_cmrsqqo,null,1425486319,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yes, this is vital. It always fills me with dismay when measures are introduced (and it's by governments, not the police themselves) which compromise this. On the whole we have a good system in this country. (Compare it with the militarisation and corruption and overreach in the US!) Issues like the current one are the sort of thing which, mishandled, can screw that up.

Some of this is definitions. Streets and roads are public. The Internet just isn't public in quite the same way. A domain-registered and accessible website could be deemed to be ""public"" - fine, a bit like a shop on a street - but visitors to that website aren't like people in a shop *or* people walking on a street.

Then looking at things at the technological level, it's different, and at an infrastructure level, different again.

Perhaps the big problem here is, the Internet can only be discussed in metaphors, and no single metaphor really applies - perhaps because the Internet just isn't a ""thing"" or a set of ""things"".

However this man can now bring me to court and because of the tort law I'd be liable. You might think this is silly but its not that far fetched.

I agree your scenario may be far fetched but it does have merit and raises a few good points. However, support or opposition to Sinn Fein, their actions and the morality attached to their actions is an informed choice. Without going down the rabbit hole, being gay is not. One thing that's been avoided in this debate is justification for their moral stance.

Yes, the cause is political. However, allowing people to refuse service based upon a ""moral aversion"" to someone's sexuality is allowing them to discriminate against someone's very identity and genetics. I do see where you're coming from (Understanding your point a little better, and honest you are swaying me a little), and I agree that when it's a political/public cause/stance, it's a dangerous precedent. The problem is the application of the law potentially can be used in a far wider scope.

If Mr Givan had said it should allow them to refuse service *where a political context is present*, then yes, I wouldn't actually be that against the bill.

My next-door neighbor runs a clay ground I've been a handful of times but I find skeet utterly disinteresting, and sporting clays kinda gets a bit samey after a while.

So yeah, game shooting is more my thing. I'll usually have a few days away shooting, but at between £600-£1000 per day it's stupidly expensive.

In addition to going away and letting someone else do all the work (and having to pay them for the privilege), some mates + myself run a small syndicate pheasant/partridge shoot on land which borders my property. We don't own the land we shoot on, nor do we pay any land-rent. The landlord very kindly lets us shoot there for free in exchange for a spot in the syndicate which we don't charge him for (other syndicate members pay £1000/year subs).

We run eight or so organized driven shoot days a year, plus night-time lamping of vermin in august/harvest time (when the birds are too young to evade predation).

Because we put all the manpower in ourselves and manage our own conservation efforts (rather than hiring a full-time gamekeeper) syndicate shooting typically costs around a fifth of what an equivalent bought day would cost.

---

Outside of the pheasant season we also organize a yearly summer charity 'simulated game' day  on land we shoot over. On such days the gun line stands as if they were pegged out for a driven shoot, but rather than live quarry flushed over the guns there are 8-10 clay traps on top of a hill or behind a hedge-line firing clays over constantly for 15-20 mins. Each trap is mounted on a 'wobbler' which moves the trap up/down left/right randomly.

Each peg will typically fire 200 odd shells per drive on a 1000 'bird' flush (1000 clays), and we'll generally do four drives over the course of the day.  

...So sore shoulders all-round by pub time.

---

I've also been deer stalking but it wasn't really for me as I didn't find it social enough. Plus, while deer numbers are growing in the midlands (where I live), they're still relatively rare and not yet seen as a pest, so when I go somewhere they *are* a problem I still tend to find it hard to see them in that light (i.e. I'm too soft to shoot a bambi).

false,Daltesse,lfc12,,"With the players at his disposal, I think Rodgers should be looking at playing one of 2 ways. First is 4-3-3 which will have a 1-2/2-1 flip in the centre, Lambert or Balotelli dropping deep and speedy wingers (lazer and raheem) running in behind with a midfielder(Hendo/Allen) also running beyond. 

Alternatively, he can play the diamond, with a target man(again Lambert/Balotelli) paired with a quick player(Borini/Sterling) have the full backs push forward and get crosses into said target man, or play through the middle with balls inbehind for the quicker player to get on to.

What the problem is, in my view, is he has the both of them mangled up so, as in the Basel game, Lambert played high up without any crosses or Sterling played deep as Moreno threw crosses into the box.

There's also the outright refusal to hoof the ball long from Migs. Every team know that it's going to one of the CBs and every team is pushing right up on top of them. If they do that, then just pop it longer into midfield and bypass half the opposition team. It's not about long v short, it's about not doing the same thing over and over and over so the opposition don't know what is going to happen.

We really aren't playing that badly(not as bad as manu anyway) but are making very surprising and poor choices that are costing us. Many times I've been watching a game and see a pass that the player misses or ignores while trying a harder pass.

Poor decisions are affecting everyone, from management to players. Maybe it is a confidence thing and we can get back to the level of last season but I don't think so. 

Rodgers himself has to shoulder a lot of the blame. Some players are knackered plain and simple. A hard season last time out, a world cup and then a hard preseason has left some looking leggy. The hard pressing just isn't working now. Skrtel, Gerrard, Henderson, Sterling all need resting. A lot of our other players Jose, Lallana, Can, Markovic, Sahko, Suso are only coming back from injuries and have missed either preseason and/or more than a week or two. 

Rodgers needs to do better at rotating players in and out to negate the effects of fatigue. Up until recently Gerrard had played the most minutes of any outfield player. This is closely followed by Henderson and Sterling. Last season we played the same team week in week out and during that final few games when fatigue began to creep in, the replacements, like Aspas, were so short of any match fitness they looked absolutely shit(just look at his and Alberto's renaissance now they playing regularly). 

In times like these, Rodgers needs to pick a default formation and system. He needs to tell players that they have a specific role within that. Have more than one player for each position not have a number of positions for one player. This will mean the players focus on that one position and know that they have to be better than the other player to play. We can play this default way for 75% of games. Maybe need to be different(more defensive) for the top teams but we should be imposing our game on most teams.

That said, this weekend we go to OT we'll play Migs, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovern, Gerrard, Henderson, Sterling for definite. The other full back role is up for grabs although expect Moreno to play. 2 from Lucas, Allen, Lallana, or Coutinho although expect Allen and Lucas and up front Balotelli if fit otherwise Lambert. First half will most likely be a dire affair as both clubs are in poor form but the second half Liverpool will dominate and lose by the odd goal(most likely manus only shots).",0,1418313307,null,0,false,0,cmrv09x,t3_2oxijm,t1_cmrv09x,t3_2oxijm,null,1425485906,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I smell some kind of point scoring intent for the save-the-children-moral-hysteria-camp from you.

Let me spell it out.

Rotherham social services and police were allegedly scared to prosecute child molesters for about thirteen years.  In reality, these organisations form a culture of behaviour from a top down directive.  The top down directive, via police chiefs and local government, for a long time was ""Don't prosecute child molesters in Rotherham"".

This resulted in 1400 actual **real life** victims at the wrong end of a crime with known perpetrators.  1400 cases actionable at law.  Not a foreign jurisdiction, but within the UK.

You however are on here cheerleading the anti-privacy dragnet of innocent peoples communications by lazy money grabbing secretive companies vying for the snoopers budget.  You are a cheerleader for **actual** sexual abuse by glossing over Rotherham in favour of **steering this debate** onto what are effectively civil infractions with no victims available to make a claim at.  Government-as-victim in the case of indecent image possession.

You would rather prosecute people who have not harmed children than prosecute those who do and have done so repeatedly and systematically with their fellow gang members for thirteen years minimum.  And that is just one set of cases in one borough.

We got oyster cards and rode the tube and walked pretty much everywhere. We really enjoyed the garden in front of Buckingham palace (St James Park), St Paul's Cathedral, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Leicester, as well as just walking around the city, taking in the sights. The window seat at The Gong (Shard) was a fantastic last night in London as well. The Lion King was also absolutely fantastic!

We did take a day trip to Paris, walked around, rode the metro there, visited the Eiffel Tower, took a boat tour down the Seine, walked around, and enjoyed a nice dinner there before coming back on the Eurostar (very nice train!). But overall, I'd say we enjoyed London more. I'm glad we went to Paris and got to see it, but London seemed better, nicer, cleaner, and more enjoyable. My opinion of course. Although then again, London didn't have the Eiffel Tower either... and even though we had a full day, we could only see just so much of Paris in that much time whereas we got to see a lot more of London because we were there longer.  

We didn't get to Stonehenge or Bath, but we did see Warwick Castle on the way to Stratford-upon-Avon as well as a trip to Leeds Castle (the girl really likes birds!). Both were fantastic day trips. 

I've spent quite a bit of time in Baltimore/Washington DC as well as New York and I'd have to say I liked London more. It felt cleaner, safer, and the people were nicer. I suppose it is true that we didn't visit the 'seedy' parts of London, but what we saw was fantastic, and we did a lot of walking and riding the tube so we made it around quite a bit. We just don't have that kind of history and architecture here in the US.

false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;If the burqa is symbol of oppression then why isn't the turban?

It's a hat. Doesn't cover the face. It could be, depending on what it represents - it's quite legitimate to see the Jewish cap as a symbol of male genital mutilation...but it doesn't cover the face.

&gt;Why not ban the hijab as well?

it's a scarf. Doesn't cover the face.

&gt;You can't tell somebody that they can't wear something they wish to wear and then in the same breath tell them they're somehow freer than they were earlier.

That depends on whether you're asserting that their wishes automatically override everyone else's. I'm not free to walk around naked, but that's not something people would generally consider an impingement on their freedom.

&gt;The vast majority of muslims wear the niqab because they choose to; nobody is forcing them.

I'm sure most of the repressed women in the countries of origin would say the same thing. Not sure what difference it makes when that's exactly what it represents to others *whether the wearer likes it or not*.

&gt;In this whole debate, those who wish to ban others from wearing the burqa say so when it is in fact themselves who have the problem.

Sure, and it's not the naked rambler who's mad, it's everyone else. Doesn't work like that.

&gt;No one's rights are being infringed by someone pulling on a face veil

Arguable - but even ignoring that, because of the origin, it's insulting to men. Why is it so important to do something that you know others find insulting?

&gt;it is up to those who think they are to change their own attitudes.

Sure, but in the real world, go dress like a punk, then wonder why you didn't get treated the same or get the better-paying job at an interview. The question then becomes 'why is it so important to dress in a manner that people find scary?'. The cause and effect are in the same ballpark - people will only stop judging books by their cover once our lifespans are three times longer than they are now, giving us all the time to do so.

Transfer values are generally based on earlier amortised transfer fees and associated costs, wages over the length of the contract, the length of the contract itself, and then the surplus value, which is the yearly additional value of a player to the club; i.e. what he brings to the team.

A contract running for two years at just 30k per week does not afford the selling club a lot of leverage because it doesn't demonstrate a high value. If there is a massive discrepancy between the total monthly cost to the club, and the surplus value, then it becomes immediately obvious that the club isn't paying the player enough, which causes issues.

This is where you maybe go astray. Everyone's done something illegal, potentially. It's not always about what can get to court either.  In the US, plea-bargaining has become a handy method of getting a conviction out of someone because the alternative is horrific; it's just not worth the risk. And who's to say what will become illegal tomorrow? Homosexuality was illegal in the UK until 1967. That seems crazy now. And if something's not illegal - say environmental protests - then infiltration of groups based on previous information can certainly take care of it, as we've seen.

This is an example I like to use when I explain the Internet to people:

*The internet is like the world we live in. It's open, it's beautiful and has many places for you to explore and love. However, there are dangerous places you should never go to without being fully aware of those dangers. You should never leave a child unattended in this free world as they can and may wander to places that are not suitable for children. You also have a moral responsibility to report anyone or anything that may be a danger to yourself and others. 
There are places of this world you will not like, this does not mean that other people should be banned from going there. If it's legal, then it's entirely their choice what they do. 
This world requires freedom, without it we will lose real contact with one another. The same contact they had us in awe when we first experienced the internet in the 90s. If we lose this freedom then we will lose the very thing that has helped us to develop so quickly in the modern world we live in.*

He had two training sessions and played on Thursday night and he played again on Sunday so it is very early for me to make very strong judgments about where his best position is. The work we do on the training field will show me how best to use him. He actually went out wide right late in the United game and did okay there also.

Someone's wish to wear something that is not hateful or violent in any way absolutely overrides your wish for them not to wear it because you dislike it. That's not even a reason.

It's more about how just completely impractical it is, before you even get there. I take your point about getting to the courts; I'm just reminded of how poor the rate of identification is on these things. But I guess this was me drifting a bit off-topic anyway.

&gt;In that situation, there would be a crime when the individual gains access and downloads.

Thanks for the response.

So, obviously breaking into the server is a crime under the computer misuse legislation. After that, copyright/privacy issues are probably a bit more debatable. But in this case, certainly possession of the pictures (which are *copies*; the originals have not gone anywhere) is probably not an offence? The images are of adults, so other than the first step, most of it isn't a problem (except morally).

&gt;The situation is different for adults than it is for children so in making it less emotive, you remove some illegality (which i also disagree with, as I think the status should be the same.).

I did that just so we could go through the list and it be less provocative to the reader. But it also illustrates a problem I suppose: the legal age of consent being different in different countries, or adjustable. If the *images* are illegal rather than the *act captured in the images*, then it's quite problematic.

In our The Fappening case, we'd be focused on prosecuting someone for illegally accessing a computer system - that's pretty much it. If the images were of an illegal act, then the people involved in the taking of the images would also be subject to prosecution.  With the images themselves becoming illegal, we have the whole chain becoming criminal. Which leads us to go to all sorts of extremes to try and detect the possession of images, rather than the act depicted in the image, but worse: examples like the whole sexting nonsense in the USA with kids being prosecuted for taking images of each other.

I understand why it's going in this direction, but increasingly I think it's just the wrong approach and is based on some flaw in logic. In any other area, the *act* is the crime. Otherwise we start to drift into situations like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cartoon_pornography_depicting_minors).

In the *Telegraph* article, Cameron said:

&gt;Mr Cameron said: “Every time someone chooses to view an online image or a video of a child being abused they are choosing to participate in an horrific crime. Every single view represents that victim being abused again. They may as well be in the room with them.""

This is basically just nonsense and does nobody any favours. Bad stuff happens, and we want to stop it. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm pretty certain it's not global surveillance by GCHQ, nor thinking of this form.

He had cold hard money. And buys Ricky Lambert. It's not Lamberts fault. I look at the guy and he;s out of his depth. 

Then I look at the touchline and think there's 2 of them out of their depth. Rodgers is not cut out of this cloth. We will not win the league with him in charge, and you can quote me on that. 

What's even more frightening is how he's making the standards lower. ""Folklore"" for motherfucking getting out of a group stage in the CL with Basel and Ludogorets? Alright, Brendan, all fucking right. Reminds me of the delusion levels and of this shit:

Today was a famous victory because we hadn’t won more than once away in the whole of 2010. When you’re down the bottom, and keep being reminded you’re down the bottom, anxiety kicks in. 

That was said by Hodgson. Rodgers sounds extremely similar in terms of bullshit level. 

Any chance of recovery is now gone. It's almost Christmas time, and the fixture list is going to be very very cruel on the philosopher. If he swims, he stays, if he doesnt, he needs to be sacked. Finished.

&gt;Perhaps people don't realise that the government aren't interested in the youtube videos you watch, the reddit questions you ask and answer, but only the illegal things you do.

If I asked you would you support the introduction of measures like this you'd probably say 'Well, no that's too far'. That implies that we do have some sort of basic right of privacy independent of whether we are a criminal or not. The question is simply where do you draw the line. For me anything I do where I would expect the action to be private meaning internet activity not on public forums etc, private messaging, emails, my actions and possessions in my own house, my financial information and my explanations for these things can and should always be allowed to remain private and unavailable to the government without explicit judicial permission. That's just a principle I believe in. Privacy is the most fundamental of human rights in many ways as it protects the individuality of citizens. The only reason we can exercise some of our other rights (like the right to a secret vote or the right to meet and talk with people even if you're planning an anti-government protest) is because we have privacy. Yes, I'm not likely to commit a crime so unlikely to be caught but that doesn't make it ok. I'm not likely to commit murder either but that doesn't mean I'm totally ok with the state being able to sentence people to death - I don't accept that a state should be allowed to do that. 

In a practical sense too we should always be worried about mistakes and miscommunication. The CIA to torture report yesterday is just one simple example. Nearly 1 in 5 (IIRC) of the people tortured by the CIA were innocent. No government or security service is in right 100% of the time and they will inevitably use anti-child porn or anti terror laws against innocent people. The more we can reduce that by increasing oversight and reducing powers where they are not needed the better. On top of that we should also be worried about unintentional effects or the use of harsh laws for trivial crimes simply because they can. There are innumerable abuses that could arise and for which there's is precious little oversight to prevent it from happening.

It's almost as if there's a precedent.

&gt; Someone's wish to wear something that is not hateful

You're saying that wearing a visible symbol of female repression is not hateful?

&gt;That's not even a reason

I can use reductionism too. Is the whole of France oppressive/ racist for passing laws that mean this sort of thing is addressed?

&gt;What makes you think you know better than people themselves about their own choices?

You're suggesting that there were no protests in Iran when women were forced to wear similar? Were they all wrong because they wouldn't protest now? Is the treatment of women in countries that still enforce this nonsense in the past and therefore irrelevant?

&gt;Am I to believe all muslim women are brainwashed?

That's a question worthy of a thread itself, applicable to religion generally.

&gt; People are free to claim that they think wearing it is demeaning to women

And when the majority think that way, will you complain that it's all them and not you?

&gt;but to tell them ""I compel you to not demean yourself"" is just like telling a woman she shouldn't be a stay-at-home housewife

Gypsies insist on their women generally leaving school at 13. Are you going to defend this or try and do something about it? I mean, who cares about everything that goes with it, we wouldn't want to tell them what to do...

&gt;or (to allude to a different comment you made) telling a Jewish person ""don't wear that yellow badge, you anti-semite!""

There's the rub - if this is really about people being able to make their choices overrule anything else, why *aren't* there Jewish people wearing them?

&gt;What moral high ground would you have to make such a demand?

See both the above examples.

&gt;I also like to know how this is arguable.

Don't pretend it's an already concluded subject across society generally. I find it offensive that someone sees fit to take such precautions simply because of my gender - it's similar to women asserting that they have to remind all men that skimpy clothes &lt;&gt; rape - thanks, I didn't need reminding, you might want to target those that do instead of *everyone*. Sikh's wear a dagger (or they're supposed to) - it may be ceremonial, but I don't like that either.

I don't think it was lying, sounded more to me like he is saying he didn't mean to cause offense with it and is making the excuse of being tired, I don't think that's racism however.

See above. Whether what he said was a racial slur is one thing, whether he is actually a racist is another, [Ed Miliband said something similar](http://news.sky.com/story/1263755/ed-miliband-nigel-farage-is-not-a-racist).

&gt;The leader of Ukip is racist, and he lied about it.

You keep repeating yourself, you don't need to keep telling me that it's your opinion. You've avoided responding to some of what I've said properly so I'll ask: If Nigel Farage and UKIP are so racist, why would people from various backgrounds join UKIP?

&gt;Ukip is the only party led by a lying racist.

Again you've repeated yourself, I understand your point.

&gt;The leader of Ukip is racist and its supporters think this is acceptable.

This is likely because the majority of UKIP supporters don't think Nigel Farage is racist.

You've also gone away from the point a lot with this, my argument in that post was about how UKIP isn't a racist party, even if Nigel Farage is a racist(to which I still disagree) that doesn't make UKIP racist.",0,1418318266,null,0,false,0,cmrxq74,t3_2or3jd,t1_cmrxq74,t1_cmrvj7i,null,1425484595,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0

It is my belief that it is mainly a cynical method of deliberately placing themselves outside of the sexual game. Covering your head or body sends a clear and direct message to the public at large that you are *unavailable/off limits*.

This isn't just me being a xenophobe, look at the global standard of beauty, look at catwalk models, look at who stars on the front page of magazines, look who the media care about more when a child goes missing. So faced with this reality, a second generation Muslim girl attempts to increase her sexual worth by proclaiming that she's more pious than other women. She cannot compete in the looks department, she tries to gain ground in another area of desirability - stability, loyalty, obedience, piousness. The whole religious reason is a smokescreen, it's what the official narrative is very few would would ever publicly concede they feel inferior to other women.

There is also another reason for the proliferation of these garments, and that's community peer pressure. Imagine you have a community of 100 muslims in the UK, 50 men and 50 women.

""Mr Farage said he thought people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were a ""racial slur"", while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the remarks had no place in modern Britain.

On Sunday, Mr Farage said he regretted his form of words but said there was a ""real problem"" of Romanian criminality.

In an interview for LBC Radio on Friday, Mr Farage was asked what the difference was between having a group of Romanian men and German children as neighbours.

""You know what the difference is,"" Mr Farage replied.

He added: ""I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be.""

He also said many migrants coming to the UK had been ""forced into a life of crime"" by ""real poverty"" in their country.

In a statement following the interview he said: ""Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door.""""

""I don't think it was lying, sounded more to me like he is saying he didn't mean to cause offense with it and is making the excuse of being tired, I don't think that's racism however.""

I didnt say Farage was a racist because he is a liar, I said he is a racist liar. Ukip is led by a racist.
Thinking Ukip is not racist because you cannot understand the facts doesnt make Ukip not racist. Do you understand?

SO the party is led by a racist, and you come on here an post how Ukip is stamping out racism, so my question to you is how can you support Farage in that case?

They can keep trying to hack various hosts - the sites pop up on different servers the next day. And... that is literally it. Everything else is mere scaremongering and smoke and mirrors.

And the more the normal internet gets censored (see the recent new laws on British produced porn for example) the more people will turn to the darknet to do what they need to do. And the more people inside the Tor network, the harder it is to track individual users.

So my mate went out of his way to learn how to use Usenet clients to get ahold of certain films and or television shows.

The stupid thing is, my mate can get his hands on films and TV shows via usenet clients for what is essentially nothing, yet he still pays for netflix.

&gt;

&gt;__Albert Stubbins__ (13 July 1919 – 28 December 2002) was an English [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football). He played in the position of [centre forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_forward), although his career was limited by the onset of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). He gained most of his fame and success playing for [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) where he won the [League Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) in 1947. His later claim to fame was an appearance on the front cover of [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles)' *[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band)* album.

false,imrewn,num23,,"I'm gonna be doing updates in this comment:
Wow so Besikates jersey looks like German NT jersey

&amp;nbsp;


9' Corner for Spurs and it goes over everybody

14' Cross into the box we are pressing, but Besikates recovers

16' Free kick into the box great header by Kaboul to lay it off but Soldado's shot is blocked by the GK

19' Counter attack by BES but good defending by Kaboul. BES really only looking threatening on the counter as we have majority of possession 

**20' Yellow Card to BES player**

22' Offsides called against Paulinho (?)

23' Good ball by Dembele to Soldado who can't capitalize and it goes for a corner

25' Another offsides this time against Chadli, who to be fair was slightly offsides

28' BES with a good spell of possession but ball is back in TOT possession

29' Shot by BES player who just dribbled into the box, lucky he wasn't more clinical there

31' Lovely deft touch by Townsend who faked the shot then passed to Chadli who I think should have shot, but centered and we got a corner. Corner comes in and we get another

*My stream is in another language, does ITV have the game I couldn't find it on there*

33' I love the way Dembele plays, he just dips his shoulder and gets around a few defenders. He had a shot on target, but it was too soft and easily grabbed by BES GK

*Walker has looked good so far, great to see him back in the squad*

39' How was that a foul on Chadli? BES with some possession now

40' Some good link up play by BES, but Kaboul clears the center

42' Skill play by a BES player, but Paulinho rams him to the ground. No foul, STFD son


**Half Time** Thoughts? Spurs with more attempts and possession, but still nill nill at the half

[English Stream I found](http://www.fixalen.tv/20141211/vv-964294-football-5489a74d1edf81.82378596.html)

**45' SUB by BES for some tall defender to come on**


49' Tall defender who came on is winner headers for BES, poor Soldado isn't tall enough

51' Paulinho needs to do better on the corner, they've all been bad so far

52' Freekick by Townsend is good, but nobody gets to it and it's a goal kick

55' Corner goes to walker who beats player with pace, his cross gets deflected for another corner, the 10th of the game

58' Kaboul with a poor clearance leads to a long shot by BES player who almost scores a cracker from 20-25 yards out, but it hits the post

**58' BES keeps possession and scores** 

**COYS**

63' Over the top ball goes to Chadli who lays it off first time to Soldado. Shot is blocked though

67' Simply 1-2 leads to a great opportunity by BES but it hits the outside netting. Lucky to not be 2 down

**69' SUBS (IN/OUT) Lamela/Soldado &amp; Lennon/Paulinho**

71' Offside by Chadli

73' Shot attempt by BES who completely fools Chicheres but shot is off target, Rose needs to come back on defense when he goes up, that counter was entirely up his (empty) side

**76' SUB Capoue/Walker** - Stramboli at RB now

81' Player down from BES and time is stopped to attend him

*Had to take a call at work sorry for lack of updates*

88' Goal kick for BES not sure what happened before this. We still need just 1 goal

89' Foul by Capou, and not looking good right now. What if we match with Zenit?

**90' 3 extra minutes added**, and oh my what's this the lights have gone out again? I don't believe it. M8 you have to pay your bills

**MATCH SUSPENDED (WITH 2 MINUTES OR SO LEFT) - STREAM GOING TO GOODISON PARK**

**LIGHTS ARE BACK ON**

**90'3 BES SUB**

Every year on the first sabbath after St Bartholiwithan's feast day it is customary for the eldest (and married of course) sons of each local family to take a turn tussling with the breeding ram used to service all the lucky ewes on father's estate.

The first clever chap to avoid a porking - or should that be a sheeping? - gets a chance to ask for the freedom of the village from papa. Papa, like all the men-folk of our family before him, never lets them have it of course. That goes back to the glory days when we did not have to let any old Tom, Dick or Harry walk about the place if we did not like the colour of their trews.

But as I was saying: the de-lousing. As well as a tickle or two in the ear (or somewhere else!) from the jolly-roger-ing ram, the fine country yokels always manage to pick up a mite or two from its musty furs. This leads to a charming afternoon of the ladies picking their loved-one's hair clean and feeding the nutritious grubs to their (many!) offspring. All the while they sing a cheery song about happier times when men were men and women were beaten when he got home.

As I do not have a homely chap to call my own, and as Bunty prefers saddle bags to tackle bags, we did not have anyone to pick clean. So we instead spent our time directing our old family butler Curruthers - now a sprightly 97 - to chase the little orphan children who have started coming near the estate at night. They seemed to be emboldened by all days activities, with some having the temerity to ask for water!

Fortunately I bought a truffle dog with me back from Italy. But who'd have thought orphans smell so fungal?!",0,1418322642,null,0,false,0,cms09am,t3_2ozbvt,t1_cms09am,t3_2ozbvt,null,1425483346,44,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,44

All this talk of arrogance and being stubborn is fairly ridiculous because he doesn't pick the player who's flavour of the month(Borini now) or a respective fans favourite and in fairness he has changed with bringing in Lucas and Toure with Gerrard resting. If people had been listening to him from the start of his reign they would know he is overly positive and does talk a lot if shite(even I was annoyed at the start) so I'm surprised people have jumping on him for this so far this season.

How old were you in 2010? Do you even remember how things *were* back then? 

Labour were despised, discredited, morally bankrupt, and *financially* bankrupt. They threw everything they had at that election- they'd have been at a severe financial disadvantage in any snap followup election called by a minority Tory government. 

As for the Lib Dems? They *exist* in a perpetual state of financial distress- they don't have the corporate sponsorship that the other two parties have, and they'd have been absolutely hammered by any ""Holding the country to ransom for short-term political gain!"" narrative the Tories pulled out in a snap election- which they *would have*.

Couple that with the spectre of fighting an election just as the financial crisis is winding down, in an environment dominated by the Tory ""Deficit Deniers!"" narrative, and you'd be hard-pressed to see a Labour victory. 

&gt;Again, at best they have tempered some of the Tory policies, at worst they enabled the Tory policies

""Enabled""? *It's a coalition government!*

Yes, Liberal Democrat involvement *technically* made Tory policy implementation possible. But given that the alternative was, overwhelmingly, looking like a snap election and Tory majority, that's not a bad thing. 

On that note, the Conservatives could be said to have ""enabled"" Liberal Democrat policy on things like gay marriage- which is losing them members and votes on the doorstep by the bucketload. Similarly, it could be said to have ""enabled"" ghastly Liberal Democrat like, say, blocking the snooper's charter! Or the [Protection of Freedoms Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Freedoms_Act_2012), which rolled back the majority of the authoritarian wingnuttery people were going apeshit over during the New Labour years- but which nobody cared about when it finally got fixed, because the nasty Lib Dems had a hand in it. Or the Pupil Premium. Or ending child detention in asylum holding centres. Or ending indefinite detention without trial. Or the £10,000 personal allowance- *which the Tories actively fought against in 2010*.

According to Ofcom, any subscription service which changes the contract mid-term should give you the right to leave that contract. Price changes, service changes etc.

The 2 for 1 isn't technically in the contract, but it is a perk offered to sell their contracts, and as such makes up the overall package.

Do people tied to contracts now have a right to get out of them?

I've been desperate to get out since I joined, I don't get signal in my home (Three have a booster box, EE don't), I've had no end of troubles when roaming abroad, all things I took for granted when I was with Three (and O2 before them). EE are utter toad testicles and seem to run their mobile masts off the same.

We're promised 4g speeds from Mr Bacon, but instead of 100mbps, I'm getting 2.5mbps which means I constantly suffer with bufferface, far more buffer face than I ever had with Three and O2.

Their customer services are absolute tosh, I went round and round in circles and it took 2 weeks to get hold of someone who OMG still can't help, admits EE has a crap service, but he genuinely listened and seemed to actually care. He did solve the roaming issue, but everything else?... stuck in contract for 2 sodding years.

I just looked up the ISA you're in and you're paying 2% annually based on the value of your ISA which is coming straight out of any growth that you could earn. That's 1% for the ISA itself, and a further 1% for the investment. I have to stress, **I'm no financial adviser**, but the documentation for that fund suggests it's getting some good returns over the years. 


As a purely basic and not to be trusted example, a similar S&amp;S ISA from Nationwide (via Legal &amp; General - and the first company that came to mind more than anything) for a FTSE All Share investment has total charges of [0.9% per year](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/investments/our-investment-funds/investment-funds). Although, this is a relatively new fund and the FTSE has tanked the last few months, there's no past performance to consider, but then, past performance is no guarantee for future performance.


You're correct though, there are options for cheaper charges and it pays off to do some research. As far as I can see, there's no contract style ties to that Virgin ISA, so you *could* be better off getting away from it.

1) I wanna see the 4-3-3 more, with Ramires or Oscar in that mid 3. We looked fierce the whole game. 

2) Happy for Happy (badumtish) and Schurrly, who had fantastic games. Hopefully Mou gives them another shot again Hull. 

3) Cahill is becoming a bit too aggressive on header challenges, only a matter of time before one of these kills us. 

4) Salah had an OKAY game. I love the kid, but he has failed to make an impact. He's good, but if we ever actually keep Moses or Thorgan I'd see him leave. Unforunate, Ive wanted to see a bigger middle eastern presence in the Prem, as i think the region has potential, but I could be wrong. 

5) Mikel proving to be the rock he always is. I wanna see the M-M midfield pair more, which should be used for more defensive games. 

6) RLC - the way Mou talked about him in the conference made it seem like he was going to get alot more than 10 minutes. I wish he did, but after shaking off a few jitters he was IMPRESSIVE. I want to see him against Hull as well or in the C1C coming up. I want more of RLC. 

7) Mou's talk about the academy has been my sentiment for about 2 years. Our kids are phenomenal, from Ake to Atsu, Baker to Blackman (i know theyre on loan, i wanted illiteration).  I WANT MORE Ake, Baker, and RLC in first team. 

8) I feel like we may see this back line more in the coming years, but with Branna seeing more of the center. Luis and Dave both do well up front, and are a little less risky, while Branna has shown us he still hasnt forgotten how to CD. It would be a better rotation for an aging Terry. I want 2 more years outta the skipper. 

9) my word schurrlys goal &lt;3

10) Diego is on a bit of a slump imo, but i feel like we arent accomodating him as much. Really want him to put one in against Hull or Derby, especially with Aguero being out.

Otherwise *The Flood* might be a good one. It is Vol.4 of the Eighth Doctor collected comics, but is pretty much separate to the earlier ones, so don't let that put you off.  

Alternatively, if she is more of a fan of the NuWho Doctors only, then *The Forgotten* might be an interesting one - starring the Tenth Doctor, but with sections featuring the Doctors from Classic Who, or *A Fairytale Life* starring the Eleventh Doctor.

false,[deleted],null,null,"There are two main problems with Tor:

1) Timing attacks

2) Nodes

Timing attacks are where you can access ISP records and records of visits to a certain site and correlate them to find out the true identity of a Tor user. This is what gets more and more difficult as more people use the network.

The nodes however are the more pressing issue. While the Tor network has a large userbase, there are only a couple thousand Tor nodes, and anyone can get one up. When you connect to Tor you go through three nodes. The first two only see encrypted data but the third, the exit node, can in theory see everything you're doing, if the owner of that node were to set it up as such. It would not be unbelievable to suggest that LE own a fair few of these exit nodes and use them for this purpose and it makes for a good way to monitor the darknet. Not figure out who the user is, mind, unless they're really stupid and write their full name and address in plaintext or something, or more realistically buy something from a darknet market without using PGP, but it means they can indeed control a portion of the network, monitor it, and use these nodes to perform timing attacks more reliably too.

So you are absolutely right to be wary of Tor, for it is not a magic anonymity pixie. But both of these problems can be fixed by one thing: more users. You want more people using Tor and more people running nodes so your chances of being detected in a swarm of thousands are tiny.

The issue here though? Running a Tor exit node is a massive risk. Let's say I use Tor to buy £500 worth of cocaine. That transaction has just gone through your ISP connection if you run the exit node. If someone goes on CP, that goes through your connection. You get the picture.

I think a charitable organisation like the EFF or the British version, the Open Rights Group, needs to pay for off-shore hosting to be used for Tor exit nodes, in countries like Russia where no one really gives a fuck.

Let's imagine I am a divorcee with three children: Emma, Michael and Elliott. I write a cheque to Emma for £331,000 and another for the same amount to Michael. I tell them that I will be changing my Will and leaving my entire Estate to Elliott. My Estate - for the purposes of equality - is also worth £331,000 once the gifts have been deducted.


Emma - having more knowledge than Michael - says to her brother: ""I'm going to the bank tomorrow bruv; let me pay in your cheque for you."" The next day, she pays in her cheque but ""forgets"" to pay in Michael's. His goes in the following day.


One year later, I die. My various gifts - and the IHT due upon them - is calculated as follows:


**Gift 1:**

Emma's cheque was the first to be deducted from my bank account, and therefore from my Estate. We can deduct this year's and last year's Annual Gift Allowance (£3,000 x 2) from the gift, reducing its value to £325,000. This is within the Nil Rate Band (NRB) and so no IHT is payable. **But** my NRB has been fully utilised by this gift.


**Gift 2:**

Michael's cheque is next in the queue. There are no Annual Gift Allowances to deduct from it, and no NRB to apply. The entire gift is taxed @ 40% giving a liability of £132,400 - payable by Michael, as the recipient of the gift.

*Edit:* Taper Relief does not apply, as I died within 3 years of the reduction in the value of my Estate. Otherwise, the liability is reduced as follows: 3-4 years: 20% off / 4-5 years: 40% off / 5-6 years: 60% off / 6-7 years: 80% off. After 7 years, the gift becomes wholly exempt and is ignored in any IHT calculation. The moral of the story: don't switch off that life support machine until 7 years are up!


**Estate:**

The entire Estate, valued at £331,000 is liable for IHT, as there is no NRB left. The liability paid by the Estate will be @ 40% = £132,400.


Therefore, Michael and Elliott have received net gifts after IHT from me of £198,600 each. Emma walked away with £331,000, because she understood how IHT works.

Where children are concerned, you are correct that their vulnerability and subsequent extra protection leads to a chain of criminal acts.

Criminalising possession and distribution is a perhaps, or perhaps not, misguided attempt at reducing the demand for the supply, and thus reducing the creation, whilst also going after the producers. A dual-pronged attack. 

However, yes, it has its problems. David Cameron's remarks are ambiguous and ill-worded.

""Mr Farage said he thought people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door.

&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband said the comments were a ""racial slur"", while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the remarks had no place in modern Britain.

&gt;On Sunday, Mr Farage said he regretted his form of words but said there was a ""real problem"" of Romanian criminality.

&gt;In an interview for LBC Radio on Friday, Mr Farage was asked what the difference was between having a group of Romanian men and German children as neighbours.

&gt;""You know what the difference is,"" Mr Farage replied.

&gt;He added: ""I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next to you, would you be concerned? And if you lived in London, I think you would be.""

&gt;He also said many migrants coming to the UK had been ""forced into a life of crime"" by ""real poverty"" in their country.

&gt;In a statement following the interview he said: ""Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door.""""

What's your point with this? He is saying that there is a fairly high crime rate with Romanians in London, as a result of this somebody could be worried that some Romanians have moved in next door to them, that isn't racism. The other part of this article which you've quoted contains statements which were in the previous article I linked, did you read my post properly?

&gt;I didnt say Farage was a racist because he is a liar, I said he is a racist liar. Ukip is led by a racist.

You keep saying this over and over again, as I said in my last post, I get your point.

&gt;Thinking Ukip is not racist because you cannot understand the facts doesnt make Ukip not racist. Do you understand?

I understand your point of course, but I disagree. UKIP is not a racist organisation from my point of view.

&gt;SO the party is led by a racist, and you come on here an post how Ukip is stamping out racism, so my question to you is how can you support Farage in that case?

The answer to that question is simple, I answered it in my previous post, me and the vast majority(if not all) UKIP supporters do not think Nigel Farage is racist.

You don't seem to read my arguments properly either, you've ignored blatant points in both of my posts even after I pointed it out, I'm fine with having a civil discussion with you, but I'd much prefer it if you could respond to my points and not ask questions which I've already answered.",0,1418326785,null,0,false,0,cms2o3y,t3_2or3jd,t1_cms2o3y,t1_cmrz4ce,null,1425482151,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0

I wonder if this has been tested (not necessarily for adult pictures). It's an interesting area. Not one I'm clear on at all - hence asking, of course. As for the rest, it basically seems messy and ill-thought out as a response to this issue. Both the proposals and the presentation are off.

false,TriumphantGeorge,null,null,"&gt;Yes, but remember that my reasoning depends on seeing the 'dark net'(but not emails) as a public forum which can be policed, which is what people disagree with.

That's a tricky area, and would depend on specifics. Perhaps the difference between hosting and making available, vs communication. 

To be clear: If I have a server hosting webpages (say) which can be publicly connected to if you know the IP address, then that material is essentially public (like web-browsing). However, the *communication between one computer and that server* is not public, without a warrant (like email).

If my private computer is password protected and only accessible to me and certain friends, that is not public. A warrant would be required here, obtained based on other evidence.

&gt;However, Theresa May is not a politician I find to be reasonable, and a haystack as she calls it is unacceptable if it contains private information.

May is, frankly, ignorant. And the ""haystack"" metaphor was given to her. See [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/crux-nsa-collect-it-all). This might tell you as to the direction this stuff is coming from, who is driving it. The key phrase is, of course, ""collect it all"". The seeds of this go back awhile - see [Total Information Awareness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness) - which just goes to show that these things don't ever go away, they just bounce back with different names, metaphors and justifications. Look how often we've had to deal with the ID cards/database effort under new guises. Which is still happening now, actually. ""[Identity Assurance](http://www.no2id.net)"", etc, may or may not turn out to be harmless.

&gt;just because powers of investigation are abused, doesn't mean they should be taken away (as some suggest). It means they need to be scrutinised and checked more rigidly. I believe that there should be a regulation of the internet, but Ms May is doing it wrongly.

Sounds reasonable. One of the challenges is, that inherent in this technical situation is an inability for citizens to be able to hold their government and its apparatus accountable. Given that this isn't possible - I believe it isn't, look how far along the road GCHQ/NSA got before we found out what was going on - then we may have to actively choose to not go down certain roads.

Personally I don't believe the Internet should be regulated. Laws should apply to activities and impacts between people, not the mechanism itself in this case.

What I suspect will happen is that, as we're seeing glimmers of already, this stuff will start to affect corporations and they'll push back via lobbying and innovation: e.g. introduction of universal encryption (without back doors this time), lobbying for law changes, and publicly reporting on their interactions with the government (requests and notices, whether or not reporting is technically illegal).

Goodwill and benefit of the doubt has been destroyed.

While this would be death in American sports (because there's so much ""resetting"" especially in baseball and football), in soccer I think it's important to take longer pauses.  The game never stops, and if the announcers are both constantly talking, it makes it overly frenetic and a bit annoying.  Sometimes you just want to see things play out - save the talk for something actually important, a poignant comment after the half on how the game has professed, or on dramatic fast break/counter/goal/build-up, etc.

But yes, the FOX commentators tend to also be a bit annoying - they're much louder and kind of have a ""bro-ey"" vibe to them.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I probably agree that while in public, provided it's not too intrusive, you can't ever expect real privacy but the difficulty is that its so hard to define where that line is on the internet. If you're on your own downloading illegally a copyrighted film then are you in public or in private. I would say you are in private given that you are at your computer and your actions are not effecting anyone else. In that case the police should need a warrant to find enough information to prosecute you which would be fine. 

As far as we know from Edward Snowden's leaking they don't even need one right now because they can just watch your internet traffic or pull it from an ISP, no need to access your computer so no need for a warrant. They can read the content of all your emails, the content of Facebook private messages and they can record your voice when you make a phone call and they don't need a warrant for any of it nor do they need any permission to had it over to a foreign power. But that's slightly beside the point. 

Specifically with reference to this news, giving the security services the ability to track every photo and video you watch and know the content (not just metadata) because they can reference a hash value effectively gives the police total information on your internet media viewing habits. There's no reference in the article that a warrant is needed to connect a person to a hash value which I would expect would be mentioned if it was actually needed; ergo, police can know what your search history (at least in reference to pictures and video) looks like without a warrant which seems like a gross breach of privacy. Again, I'm happy for them to look at anyone's search history with a warrant but without one it should be out of their reach. 

Maybe they will only do this with specific images related to child pornography but what's to stop them doing it for other pornography that they feel breaches obscenity laws. Then maybe they use it on people watching subversive material (subversive according to some arbitrary definition maybe which encompasses huge swathes of previously legitimate activity). Again there's nothing to stop them doing that, at least not that David Cameron has said - he announced no limits on what they can do and no limits of what they may use the technology for, absolutely none. They will because they can. 

If Cameron had said ""This technology will be limited to child abuse cases. Any evidence gained using this technology in any other circumstances will be inadmissible in court"" then I would have been totally satisfied but he didn't. One example, [The Patriot Act in the US is being used mostly \(92% of the time\) in drug cases](http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/patriot-act/) and not for terrorism despite that being the intention of the law. It happens; people use the new powers they have for anything they can possible use it for even if it's totally inappropriate so you *have* to put limitations in and I don't see any here. I'm worried when stuff like this comes up because I'm just imagining 10 years down the line some 16 years old kid is going to be given a criminal record because he merely looked at an image of someone smoking weed or something. David Cameron's aim is to whip up fear of kiddy fiddlers, divert attention from the Westminster paedophile scandal and win some suburban housewife votes before the election - he's not thinking long term. He doesn't give a shit whether this is misused and/or if it gives the police too much power over people's internet use. It's not his concern if it stifles protest because people are worried about watching anti-government political material in case it's been tagged by GCHQ and they're put on a list of who to pick up on some minor charge and get off the streets before a major event in case they organise a protest. He'll be gone by then and we'll be left to clear up the mess and the only person to do it will be another careless, short-termist moron at No.10 who won't do shit. I said elsewhere in this thread that given the history of the security services:

&gt;They helped torture prisoners in Iraq, they protected and supported child rapists in Westminter in the 70's, they assassinated people in drive by shootings in Belfast in the Troubles, they've overthrown governments to protect a private company's interests in Iran and now they're spying on all of us

i'd rather not give them the benefit of the doubt and say ""Oh, well there doesn't seem to be any oversight whatsoever but hey, I'm sure their top blokes and wouldn't dare do anything untoward!"" because they aren't and they have proved that they would either alone or when ordered.

false,MrFuckingRandom,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt; That's a tricky area, and would depend on specifics. Perhaps the difference between hosting and making available, vs communication

I agree. The distinction between what is public and private when downloading something that is public but has the privacy of a computer to server relationship, is a very hard line to draw. 

The problem with GCHQ/NSA is that they are not part of the government but exist independent of who is in power. This means they often think themselves above the government, which has to be addressed. 

&gt; Personally I don't believe the Internet should be regulated. Laws should apply to activities and impacts between people, not the mechanism itself in this case

I would rather it wasn't. I wish there were reliable ways of catching criminals outside of it. However, the nature of some crimes and the nature of the internet I think makes it a necessity (not to say that it should not be controlled as we have said).

I myself got two things:

1) I'm all for getting behind players and supporting them. And I think we can all agree that Soldado has received a ton of support. Yet he is still struggling with something and not taking advantage of his chances. Had he put us up 1-0 the game might have gone differently. It's not just this game tho - it seems like every game he plays he misses one or two clear chances. It's come to the point where its affecting the team as a whole and the amount of points we win. Hate to say it, but I'm really looking forward to the day we sell him and buy a PL proven striker. 

2) Also really looking forward to the day we get new defensive coaches. Anyone can see we like to play out the back - including our opposition. Yet our back four simply does not seem suited for that. Time and again individual errors either lead to a good chance for the other team or a goal. These individual errors might not happen if we told our back 4 to not hang onto the ball. Just a thought.

Our attacks are straight forward, uninspiring and easy to prevent. And whenever a player does try something a bit more imaginative, nobody else is expecting it or knows what to do. 

There was a great attack by Besiktas after the 1st goal which they were unlucky to not have scored from. They simply ran through the space our defense left. Even a back-up defensive line shouldn't be making that mistake, let alone our captain.

So there are probably certain suspects that they don't want to implicate just yet. They want an inquiry, but one that they can control.

To ride it back home on the public roads, you have to have insurance on it, and you don't. You've got insurance on your -other- bike, but you are not riding that one. According to the letter of the law, you would be uninsured, hence your insurance provider will not cover the 3rd party - especially since they are blood sucking monsters, not cuddly friendly chaps which would go ""LordASsworthMcThor, you know what, between you and me, it's ok, we'll pay for the damages and once you get back home, we'll get something sorted out, OK""? Instead, before you say ""wut?"", you'll be charged by the pigs, the remains of your bike impounded, your insurance would be invalidated and you will be also holding a very hefty 3rd party's repair and car hire bills in your hand...

That's not an outcome you'd like to end up with. Especially with the current law, the tax disc also disappears with the sale so you have to insure it, tax it and only then can ride it home. 

It's massively annoying for 2nd hand buyers, I admit...

I think there's a trend in the community that seems to accept the relationship between Arthur and Merlin as strong and valuable regardless of if people see them as romantic opposites, which is pretty awesome.

I'll also mention that the commentary on the last episode with Katie and Julian (producer or director) pretty much confirms that they wrote this in intentionally.  It can be there if you look for it or see it but the series is just as powerful without the romantic pairing.

If you read the comments... Apparently the insurer can cancel your cover but cannot cancel 3rd party cover due to the laws. As a result, as long as the insurance runs, even if you don't own the bike / car, the 3rd party cover is active. If buyer crashes, seller is responsible.

You are uninsured on that bike. All the seller has to say is ""Here's my V5 with the bit ripped off"" and you find yourself not on a borrowed bike but on a bike you own with no insurance. Your insurance won't cover it. His insurance won't cover it but will make the seller liable for any 3rd party damages. 

So, as I said in my original post, there's a loop hole that's very bad for the seller, do not leave your insurance running the moment after you sell the bike. Cancel it immediately.

And the buyer, he's buggered. He is uninsured. He would end up with a massive bill and riding w/o insurance charges from the Plod, his insurance costs will also increase.",0,1418333007,null,0,false,0,cms6c2v,t3_2oussl,t1_cms6c2v,t1_cms5gnm,null,1425480442,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

I've cleaned, washed ironed etc. since I was about 13 and my parents had a business (local post office/shop) to run. They didn't need a cleaner they had me :-) In my early 40s I employed a cleaner as our business was becoming a lot of work and I couldn't keep up - and my kids are boys and haven't a clue beyond hovering their rooms and changing their sheets. 4 weeks ago I also took the decision to let my cleaner go as the business is running more smoothly and we needed to save the money.

Basically, I set aside the same amount of time  during one evening as the cleaner had (2 hours) and tried to go around the whole house in that time doing all the jobs she had done without getting side-tracked into 'tidying' which was beyond her remit. I found that much easier than doing a little here and a little there...and once it's done, it's done and you can relax for the rest of the week. For the record we have a 5 bed house,2 teenagers and 2 house rabbits.

Morality should not be linked with the fear of reprehension in the afterlife.

The way he worded it doesn't do him any favours, true. The levels of immigration though, will put a strain on infrastructure. 250k~ people a year is not good. You may say that immigration is a net economic benefit, when the study doesn't factor in many losses.


MigrationWatch
&gt;The only major inquiry ever conducted in the UK was carried out by the Select Committee on Economic Affairs of the House of Lords in 2007/08. In April 2008 they reported that ""We have found no evidence for the argument, made by the government, business and many others, that net immigration - immigration minus emigration - generates significant economic benefits for the existing UK population.

As Farage said, this is fake outrage. The media get hyped about anti-UKIP stories, but ignore when other politicians do/say similar things.

&gt;James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, last month said immigration is putting pressure on Britain’s road network.
He dismissed a report that concluded that European migrants make a net economic gain to Britain by saying its “narrow focus” had failed to take into account pressure on infrastructure.

When our defense was solid, almost totally shutting down the Besiktas attack, and our offense created a bunch of good chances.  Even in the opening period of the second half, even though Besiktas ramped up their urgency, we didn't look like conceding, until Kaboul (who had been great up to that point) suddenly got stupid.

We didn't play particularly well overall, but in the end, we really got bitten by two crucial issues:

1. Our striker can't finish his chances, and
2. Our CBs can't maintain their focus for a full 90'.

These are not amazing luxury qualities that only elite CL-champion players do.  This is basic stuff that should players at this level (EL, PL) have to be able to do.  

As mediocre as we were in many respects, correcting either of those issues would have seen us draw or win.

Also, our midfield fucking bossed the first half.  Dembele and Paulinho seemed to have finally figured out how to play together (both in front of Stambouli, apparently).

false,DEADB33F,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I have a similar deal grandfathered in from T-Mobile.

The original deal was sim-only, 30 day rolling, £10 pm for 150 mins, 250 texts, 1GB data. Minutes &amp; texts were doubled if you agreed to sign up for a 12-month contract.

Also, at the time I signed up they were offering two free 'boosters' (worth £5 each) if you went for the 12-month option. This made the deal pretty awesome.

The two I have enabled are 'unlimited internet' &amp; 'unlimited texts'. Although you can swap &amp; change these at any time, so when I go abroad I swap out one of them for cheap international roaming.

---

In addition to this, up until last year every time I renewed the 12 month contract (rather than reverting to 30-day rolling) I got a £2.50 p/m loyalty bonus discount. Which made the contract £7.50 p/m for unlimited texts &amp; internet, 300 mins.

Last year EE put a stop to the loyalty discount, which I was a bit bummed about. It's still the cheapest deal I can find by far though, so it isn't the end of the world.

---

---

Also, totally unrelated, but I found a little loophole which gave me a £10 discount just by calling EE's support line.

I'd just bought a new phone on eBay which required a micro-SIM (which I didn't have), so I called up EE to see whether I could get one sent out. They informed me that the new SIM would be free of charge but would take up to a week to arrive and my current SIM would become deactivated for a few days in the mean-time.

I explained that I'm self employed and need my phone working 24/7. They suggested that I could go into an EE shop where they'd be able to provide me with a working SIM there &amp; then, but that there'd be a £10 fee which would be added to my phone bill. After a bit of wrangling I got the chap on the phone to agree to credit my account with £10 so I could go to the shop, pick up a SIM and it wouldn't end up costing me anything.

Anyhow, that night I figured that first thing tomorrow I'd have a new SIM so what the hell, I'll have a go at using some scissors to trim down my existing SIM so I can play with my new phone. I did this and it worked, so I never bothered picking up a new SIM. When my next bill came I saw that my account was in credit and that EE/T-Mob had actually paid me to have my service with them that month (felt good, very good).

A year or so later I was telling some mates about this and they didn't believe me, so I tried the same trick again and it worked ...again.

There seems to be less intrinsic risk in riding a bicylce but greater environmental risk. Which means you're less likely to hurt yourself on a bike but more likely to be hit by something like car. 

For a car its probably the opposite. The environment poses less of a threat but if you get yourself into an accident (like running off the road) there's a higher probability of serious injury or death. 

Now the effect is the same no matter what but we should take that into account for whatever policies we decide to implement based off these statistics.

Honestly, I think even picking our ""top 3 names on the team sheet"" would be a fascinating question and lead to a wide range of opinions.  So in the interest of being different, I am going to talk about player groups that should, and should not, play together.

1. Gerrard/Lambert - I actually like Gerrard in his new role, but he needs to be surrounded with pace.  We are not going to reach the heights of last year, but a team with Gerrard and Lambert (and throw in Lucas) has to be one of the slowest in the entire league.  This combo eliminates not only counter-attacking football, but also narrows spaces as these players are no danger running behind defenses.

2. Lucas/Allen/Hendo - We can get away with that midfield with two (preferably 3) world-class attackers.  As it is, they are each too similar and provide too little going forward to drive attacks.  Perhaps a front 3 of Sturridge, Balo, and Sterling could work with these 3 behind, but even then I am not convinced.  

3. Lovren/Skrtel.  Just no.  Again, they seem too similar and make too many positional mistakes.  Kolo and/or Sakho should be in every CB pairing

4. Johnson and Enrique - I get that Rodgers wants experience, but the body of work put together by these two over the past year would have them both fixtures on the bench.  Johnson's heroic header aside, they too often are caught out of position, give the ball away cheaply, or lack the desire to cover their area.   

Ok, now for players that I think should be playing together.

1. Lallana and Lambert - If we are going to play 1 touch football and patiently work the ball into the box, these two have shown the craftiness to do it. 

2.  Coutinho and Sterling/Markovic.  Coutinho is at his best when he can play through balls to pacey players, or at least willing runners.  Coutinho to Lambert is not going going to worry any CB in the league.  On a related note, Markovic's effort from last game leads me to think that this team needs, desperately, to play with runners up top.  Markovic, Sterling, and (gasp) Borini fit the makeup of this team much better then Lambert or Balo. 

3.  Sakho and Kolo - each have appeared to be our best defended at various times, yet I am not sure they have ever paired.  I think they would do well behind Lucas and might (!) clean up some of the defensive errors

4. Can and . . . anyone?  Having looked great vs Chelsea, he has been demoted to squad member.  Not sure why, as none of the midfielders have covered themselves in glory over the past month.  What does he need to do to get a game?

If the payroll is running every 3 months or so then the -M1 is a bit silly, but it shouldn't make any difference here as there's no allowance to be counted differently.

Could it be that your colleague started this year and was put on an emergency tax code for a bit in the main job? I once got a few months of negative tax for that reason, and that didn't show on my tax code.

You might have overpaid tax (although, if this is your main job and you've been doing it all year it's unlikely). Equally, your colleague might have underpaid tax. Generally you're not supposed to have to worry about this kind of thing.

I suppose there could be all sorts of subtleties around National Insurance contributions, too? All that said, I'd expect to be paying 20% tax on tips if it's being run through independently from your main paycheque. It should all come out in the wash over the course of a year, though.

If you or your colleague is concerned then I'd recommend calling HMRC and asking what could cause the discrepancy, they've always been very helpful when I've called with questions.

But it's also a personnel thing, simply put a number of players have not been up to scratch. Whether they can be absolved from this due to the physical and moral fatigue of a world cup year, coming so close to the title, etc etc. There's also the inflated expectations, more matches, inexperience, financial standing relative to other clubs I could go on...

Point being, it is irrational to place most, if not all, blame on any single factor. Football itself is a game of massive variables and our situation at the club is no different. I could also make a point in how the role of the manager at a top club has become more minimal from the days when managers experienced incredible longevity, due in part to the influx of money in the game and barring outliers like Guardiola's Barca. That being said, I have no doubt that in the event that Rodgers gets sacked our results will improve, that has been statistically proven. What that does though is open any number of variables. We could go on to do well, and that's very much a possibility with fixes to the transfer system, giving the new signings a season to bed in and fixing other ails at the club. But it leaves open the possibility of an inevitable regression after a rise, which has also been shown (don't have figures but I can point out Kenny's second reign as an example). I can respect that Rodgers may not be the tactical god we thought he was, but unless we replace him with someone of PROVEN quality I think it might be an exercise in futility. When I mean proven we have to think big in this regard, someone like Simeone, Klopp, De Boer, etc. and that's even assuming they want to come to us at all. 

I can accept the fact that there is no indication that Rodgers will grow into this adversity, but that is neither here nor there due to the fact that he is relatively green in terms of managerial experience. We cannot say for sure that he will make the necessary changes to bring us into long term success because there is not a very large sample size. Klopp started managing Mainz in 01 and Dortmund in 08 (which we can consider a relatively high level), the year Rodgers started at Watford. 

Ultimately, I think we've become a victim of our success, in our past or even recent history. We are **Liverpool Football Club**, the weight of name alone has made great footballers crumble under pressure, what else explains Stewart Downing's renaissance at West Ham after a generally underwhelming career for us (obviously this doesn't cover other factors but you get the point). There is a culture of winning inherent to the club that has become the equivalent of a Abramovich-sacking mentality amongst the fans. While FSG might not have as eager a trigger finger as some of the fans do, they will be putting these kinds of considerations about the expectations of our fanbase and history to make moves that might not be in our best interests. This plays a part into our status in English football as ""delusional"" (fuck whoever says that, but they have a point that some people don't realize). While we cannot give up hopes to be back at the top eventually, we have to realize what we have now in our present state. We have a history that we can be immensely proud of, even in the 21st century, more than can be said for an overwhelming majority of top European sides. 2 FA Cups, 3 League Cups, 2 Community Shields, 1 UEFA Cup and 1 Champions League is nothing to sneer at. I believe are name alone is what allows us to get transfers even when we're not near the top. Unfortunately it is not the 70s or 80s anymore, the status quo has changed and the sooner we accept the present culture of money in football, the better it will be in the long run in terms of managing expectations and results. We have to look at what we have now from a bigger perspective, which can involve looking at the ownership as it is largely their direction that will prove if we can make it back to the top: we can be proud of renovations to Anfield finally getting underway as well as owners who are seemingly in for the long term and have plans to be fiscally responsible. If we can't beat the big spenders at their own game then it is up to our plans in place to make us viable contenders without shelling almost our entire budget that we spent this summer on someone like Di Maria. That is what proven quality costs nowadays unfortunately. Being fiscally responsible doesn't always equate to success, i.e. Arsenal but that's a whole other range of issues that I am not willing to nor am prepared to write about. There's nothing wrong with their model, i'm sure at this stage everyone would like for us to be a consistently top 4 team that gets into the champions league knockout round.

I guess all i can leave with is that the next coming weeks will be a turning point for us, better or worse. To see if Rodgers can defy expectations and give us a semblance of hope going into the second half of the season. Failing that, to see if the ownership thinks they can do better and, more importantly, if its a risk worth taking.

We signed maybe 1 player who was good enough to go straight into our starting 11 (Lallana) and everyone else was either ""for the future"", ""a squad player"" or ""cheap enough that it's worth gambling on them"".
&gt;

Moreno just won Europa league, Markovic played in Europa league semi finals and played very well against teams like Juventus. Lovren was supposed to be one of the best defenders of last season. So we bought 'almost' starters this season. We are just not playing as a team. There is no strategy except to go straight direct ball to sterling or Lambert or Coutinho.


&gt; Is Rodgers making mistakes? Hell yes. But we do not have a team or squad that is as good as City, Chelsea, Arsenal or United (say what you will about their problems at the back, their defenders are doing a better job than ours lately). Hell, I sometimes think that Tottenham have a better squad than us (maybe not a better starting 11).
&gt; 

We don't have a squad like the City, Chelsea or United (I don't rate Arsenal's squad. Too many attacking players and far less good players in defense). But we have a squad that should have qualified for R16 in CL and be in a better position in League.

&gt;
Now all that said, imagine this exact squad in 4 years. Nearly every one of our good players right now will be hitting their prime years. Despite what people want to think because we got 2nd last year...we are STILL in the rebuilding phases of this club.
&gt;

The exact squad might not be great after 4 years if Rodger's does not improve them and if we don't learn how to play as a team. If we don't do particularly well this year and next, we might sell and buy a different set of players.

But I don't think that discredits what Farage is saying either: you can simultaneously hold that the major issue is the economic elite *and* that open-door immigration causes significant issues such as not enough housing, competition for school places, etc.

You could argue that the main reason for that is a lack of investment, and you might be right, but the solution to that is that we need to bring in more revenue to be able to increase funding.

For example, after the recent Pirate Bay raid in Sweden, my mom is much more reluctant to pirate stuff off the internet. 

The government are responding to lobbying off the media companies.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3643826/Enoch-Powells-Rivers-of-Blood-speech.html

Excerpt : 
""A week or two ago I fell into conversation with a constituent, a middle-aged, quite ordinary working man employed in one of our nationalised industries.
After a sentence or two about the weather, he suddenly said: ""If I had the money to go, I wouldn't stay in this country."" I made some deprecatory reply to the effect that even this government wouldn't last for ever; but he took no notice, and continued: ""I have three children, all of them been through grammar school and two of them married now, with family. I shan't be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas. In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man.""

I can already hear the chorus of execration. How dare I say such a horrible thing? How dare I stir up trouble and inflame feelings by repeating such a conversation?
The answer is that I do not have the right not to do so. Here is a decent, ordinary fellow Englishman, who in broad daylight in my own town says to me, his Member of Parliament, that his country will not be worth living in for his children.""

Within the EU we absolutely do, that's inarguable. The free movement of labour is one of the fundamental pillars (the first IIRC) of the EU and has been since it was founded. There are *very* few restrictions on it because the entire point is that people are to be treated as capital just like anything else.

Farage and UKIP do not argue that non-EU immigration is open-door. What they actually argue is that if we applied the same standard to EU immigration as we do to non-EU immigrants we stand to gain a lot more, as well as being *fairer* to non-EU immigrants.

It's just never going to happen. It's a complete lost cause. 

The majority of this country, despite Russells claims, are extremely comfortable. There's a downtrodden minority, and an elite minority, there's no doubt about that. 

But then there's a huge middle class and comfortable that aren't going to want to fuck that up in the hope of helping the downtrodden minority.. We've seen with other 'revolutions' how rather than raising the standard of living for the poor, they're more likely to bring everyone down to the poor peoples level and entrench an even more powerful elite. 

Particularly the communist leaning kind of revolution which is what Brand believes, even if he's not saying it directly any more. After Paxman he learned his lesson about voicing his communist leaning. 

Anyway, he's wasting his fucking time when he could be doing so much more with his new found following. 

He could be championing proper proportional representation, for example. That's just one idea, off the top of my head.. A problem with a clear solution. 

He thinks we can just have a fairer society overnight if everyone agrees, and then we'll all hug on clouds of marshmallow dreams. But reality isn't like that. 

It takes gradual incremental improvements over time. If he's genuinely interested in making a better world, then he has to give in to the fact that he won't be able to make a perfect world. 

With each generation improvement should be the name of the game. We need to leave this world in a better state than when we lived in it.. If we all just do that then we'll get there eventually, and with the least amount of disruption.

Look at some of the British immigrants in Spain, I know some of them are far from 'Quality Immigrants'.... It's a bullshit argument, freedom of movement in the EU is one of the best principles of the Union.

Perhaps there might be a lot of Eastern european people in the UK now, but so does Germany and France, this is merely a transition phase of adopting in nations who where poorer, it will eventually level out. Britain needs to calm the fuck down and quit with how easy it is to claim benefits or get housing in the UK, it's a total lie, I can not just go to the UK tomorrow and get benefits or council house (even if I could, i'd be waiting sodding years anyway). 

Control comes from reacting to the increase of population, by putting funding into education, encourage industry in the entire country (not just the South East), hire more doctors, build more hospitals and build more public housing... But none of this is happening, it's just being ignored and now immigrants need to listen to that petty shit due to the lack of action in your own country.  Tories have had nearly 5 years and have done sweet fuck all to improve this situation, they've removed investment to most of it, which is going to create more problems and I will have to unfortunately read more of this bullshit.

Ugh, this dumb point again. Look it's simple supply and demand. Nobody wants to do your shitty job for £6 an hour? Right you need to pay more.

By intentionally providing the jobs to unskilled migrants (asda et all have been known to find recruiters who specifically shop abroad for managers and regulars who will do those jobs relatively cheaply) then you are able to keep the wage low as you fulfill your demand.

The counter point is ""if nobody wants to do them why are they done by desperate unskilled foreigners?"" a) they're desperate so it is wrong b) ""we're lazy"" which is in itself racist so you can't apply an argument that isn't acceptable to one group but is acceptable to others.

He's not given me any reason to. All I've seen of him is essentially boiled down to the poor are poor, and the rich are rich. How awful is that?!

Yeah, it's unfair. Where's the solution? Where's the better system? Is it possible to even have a fair solution when self preservation is one of our most basic primal instincts?

&gt;And this subject has nothing to do with the middle class.it has everything to do with the people at the top, who have all of the money.

If you have wealth of £36K, that puts you in the top 50%. 

The top 50% own 93% of the wealth. That can be considered 'all of the money', imo. 

So my question to you is should the top 50% be penalized for the sake of the bottom 50%? It doesn't even take much to get into that top 50%... You can get into there on £20K a year wage by accident if you bought a house or flat 4 years ago in the South East..

A lot of this so called 'wealth' is completely unrealised and in the form of housing. Maybe Russell could argue for increased house building? There's no easier way to reduce that top 50%'s wealth than by devaluing the value of their homes.. That's where the vast majority of that wealth will be tied up in.

false,good_lucky_ducky,null,null,"You really do have beautiful skin - I agree a bb cream would be more suited to you for a more natural, dewy, look as you don't need the heavy coverage that foundation affords.  Try identifying the three main areas where makeup will make the most impact for you and buy products for those areas first before anything else. In your case I would say eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones (followed by some funky lipsticks when funds allow) :)  The MUA range at superdrug is simply fantastic and I would highly recommend them if you want decent product with a price rage that you won't mind experimenting with. Their undress your skin powders are just plain yum! They also have a 3 for 2 deal at the moment on eye products (www.muastore.co.uk) yay! I use their undress me eye palettes daily as they're a good dupe for Urban Decay's Naked palettes. I highly recommend primer, the type you will want depends on individual needs and suitability to makeup products used etc but ultimately it's the first thing I would say to get as it makes such a difference to the appearance of your skin, meaning you have to use less bb cream, as well as helping your makeup last longer! You won't have to use a lot of primer so it will be a worthwhile purchase. Definitely try before you buy when it comes to foundations or whichever coverage you want to go for, by searching those that take your fancy and checking them in natural light - there's nothing worse than spending money on something that doesn't match your skintone as onetwofee has said. Also, always use the right brush for product used. With my bb cream I always use my stippling brush by Real Techniques, this helps with better application and again less product used. You have beautiful eyes and the colour will pop even more with brown, gold and orange toned eyeshadows. The MUA £1 Brown mascara is my go-to for casual/work look as it really makes my blue eyes stand out and also makes a bigger impact when I wear black mascara with darker eyeshadow on nights out. I can't help with recommendations for dry skin as mine is like an oil slick, alas! Have fun with it and enjoy working out what suits you and what doesn't!

As for Dzeko, I am a fan.  I love the guy, and I think he is a good player.  Its been shown that we are capable of winning the league with him as a striker.  However, he hasn't seemed to improve much, he is very streaky, and their are games where he honestly seems to do little right.  Being simply a poacher, or having someone who is in the right places, isn't enough for a squad pushing to be the best in the world.  

These are just opinions, though.  I am happy with the squad, not saying anyone should be dropped or anything.  Whether Dzeko is a better option than Jovetic, I don't know.  As mentioned, they are different players-- Jovetic being more of a second striker, almost a playmaker, while Dzeko is your classic striker up top.

population 61.13 million

Ecological foot print in global hectares per capita. 4.89

Biocapacity in global hectares per capita 1.34

Ecological remainder in global hectares per capita. -3.55

making the UK the top20 of the least sustainable countries in the world

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint

What does it mean?

The UK is currently using about 3 times as much of resources than it has.

For a sustainable economy on the current standard of living the UK would have to

A) add some land and resources to its shores increasing it's size and resources threefold.

OR

B) decrease population by 73%

OR

C) decrease the standard of living by 73% (so getting to the living standard of Sri Lanka)

OR

D) constantly rob other countries of their resources. Take 3 pounds worth of goods and giving them back only 1

what we are currently seeing is not A. We see the opposite of B (increasing population) we see C for the average bloke and D. But even so that's not enough so what is actually happening is that the current population is living off the resources of the future generation it's basically robbing their children and grandchildren of a good life.

He also didn't try to win vs. Real.  Then lauded his players' performance in a 1-0 loss where they never threatened...  

The team I mainly support is En Avant Guingamp (I've only taken to Liverpool because so many games are shown here in Canada).  Probably the smallest Ligue 1 side in France, with a coach who is quite new to coaching.  We won the French Cup last year, then lost our top striker.  Half the players are new, many are young.

Today we had a Europa league game where all we needed was a tie vs. PAOK Salonika to advance to the knockout stages for the first time in the club's history.  Do you think they played for a tie?  Fuck no, they attacked all game long, the only goal conceded was an unlucky penalty for a hand ball, and we won 2-1.  

Gourvennec (the coach) has everything working against him, every possible excuse in the world to make.  But at least when Guingamp play, they play to win (hence 2 French Cups in 5 years, the first as a Ligue 2 side).  Yeah, our league standing sucks (not a ton of depth to our team, then again, when you're the smallest team in France...), but when we need to win, we often find a way.  

Another example is Simeone at Atletico.  Last year they won La Liga and half their players left, including an instrumental Courtois, Diego Costa, David Villa, etc...  This year?  They're still 3rd in La Liga, and topped their CL group.  

When I watch Liverpool, there's no cohesion, no urgency.  Maybe if they had shown even a touch of desperation vs. Basel in the first half, they could have won...  And all BR gives is excuses.

Going even further back, I remember when people were pissed off we signed Big Dunc again. 'Waste of money', 'he's never improved'. I even remember when my own dad said we should've got Gary Megson to replace Walter Smith. 

Opinions change based upon performances. People get pissed off in football over the most fickle things, but you can never take anyone's comments in all seriousness. Let's not judge people on past opinions, but reflect on improvement!
