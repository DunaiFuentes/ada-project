I believe that it is extremely unfair that if any number of British people are allowed to move and live, without hindrance, elsewhere in the EU, that we should not and, more importantly, CANNOT deny other European Union residents the right to move, live and work in the UK. Being part of the European Union can be summarised as process of give and take, that is why I believe that we must be all in or all out - not a mish-mash of both.

false,Annaeus,eng-cumberland,Wind-blasted outskirts of nowhere,"Several people argued that they may not have known that guide dogs should be treated differently. I was pointing out that this was irrelevant to a legal action. Even if they didn't know, that is not a defence. It is a defence in tort, but not under criminal law, and this is criminal law (Tesco can be fined, not just have to pay compensation). 

Moreover, the responsibility, under the doctrine of strict liability, devolves to the employer. That is, Tesco is responsible for their employees' actions even if they could not or did not control them. And Tesco as a legal person certainly does know. Furthermore, intent is not necessary for liability to attach as the statute requires positive action. *Failure* to make accommodations is the illegal part here, and failure to do something does not require intent. Indeed, for failure to do something to be defendable would require an intent to take advantage of a legal exception. Lack of intent to comply with the law would itself be proof of liability.

As you say (and as I said) reasonable ignorance of the disability would be a defence. However, guide dogs wear fluorescent vests with 'guide dog' on them. It actually doesn't matter whether the staff noticed it or knew what it meant, the 'reasonable person' standard (the so-called 'man on the Clapham omnibus') which applies here means that they should have known, and that is what the statute requires. 

Even if they didn't see it, people at the shop were pointing out that it was a guide dog. They could see, and they knew. They even understood that it meant that the dog should be allowed in the shop. For the staff to claim that it was reasonable for them not to know it was a guide dog, when customers there at the time knew, would be absurd.

Also, it has been part of English common law since Roman times. No need for Law and Order repeats to pick it up.

Unless there are other circumstances that the article doesn't mention, then it is hard to see how Tesco could defend against a claim. However, as you say, such things would be for a court to decide - but that doesn't stop us from mooting about it.

TL;DR The law doesn't care if the staff knew the law. It's not the staff that are legally responsible anyway, Tesco is, and Tesco certainly knew.

One that looked pretty decent was a skills-based work academy with an all-female plumbing company that would lead to an apprenticeship with the local social-housing provider.

Things like the colony not advancing are as simple as the Doctor not wanted to mess up the timeline anymore than he had. The regeneration thing actually makes a lot of sense. Look back to Nine's regen - It was small, nothing special. Just some glowey lights. Then Ten's regen was explodey, destroying the Tardis interior and making it crash. So, seeing as his regens had slowly been building up, and seeing as he had lived in Elevens body for so long, AND the fact that that regen wasn't even suppose to happen at all (It was his 13th body), it makes a lot of sense that it'd cause that kind of explosion. Now, things like the Angles working in groups isn't something exclusive to Time of The Doctor. So if you're going to use that argument, don't leave to just ToTD.

From 'Roma (Gypsies) and the Holocaust' 

""For many thousands of years, the Gypsies were a vagabond people, living in horse-drawn caravans, telling fortunes with tarot cards, tinkering with violins and panning for gold in the rivers. They were usually thought of as shrewd and tricky group who often indulged in petty thievery.

This thievery contributed to a large extent to the many prejudices against the Romani. As a result, Gypsies have been targets for a variety of persecutions. This has ranged from enslavement in Rumania until 1864, to attempted annihilation by the Nazis.""

I'm not saying you're a Nazi, I just think it may be time for a 21st century way of thinking and dealing with people.

The writing really has been downright slapdash, and insultingly *stupid* at times. Like in Robots of Sherwood, where the Doctor's *100% accurate* complaints about anachronisms are simply ignored so they can pretend there was a real Robin Hood after all.  What the hell?

And let's not even start on Kill the Moon, and what a scripting clusterfuck that was.

I really think Moffat has come to believe his own BS and that there's no one involved in the operation willing or able to tell him when he has bad ideas.  The show desperately needs, at the least, a script-editor who's independent of Moffat and can fix some of the glaring logic problems.

I could sort of deal with Eleven being the ""fairytale Doctor"" with more magic\fantastic plotlines...  But that sort of ad-hoc approach just doesn't work with Capaldi's Doctor.  His harshness just draws more attention to the story problems.

(For the record, I think the same thing happened on Sherlock.  The first two seasons were great, but then they got a huge attack of the stupids.

Since last June, I've been working in Los Angeles in sports television. I like some things about it, but there's a lot of things I don't like. The same goes with Los Angeles. I miss my family and Bojangles.

My favorite band is--and has been for a long time--Frightened Rabbit. I actually got to see them live at the beginning (Carrboro) and end (Los Angeles) of their latest U.S. tour, and they were amazing. I actually grabbed some drinks with them in Carrboro after the show. I also love horrible '80s pop, beach music, classic r&amp;b, disco and funk. 

I recently saw Cloud Atlas, and I loved it. At this time, it's my favorite movie. Her and The Lego Movie were the best movies I saw last year in my opinion. The Shawshank Redemption and Sonnenallee are probably my favorite movies of all time.

I've taken German since high school, so I'm as fluent as an American can be I guess. I love many things about Germany and its culture, including the movies. I've seen a lot of quality German films, but there's still many I need to see. I studied abroad in Berlin for about six weeks over the summer of 2010.

I just finished reading A Storm of Swords. I read 1984 before that, and I'm currently reading Brave New World. I want to get Cloud Atlas for Christmas and read that. I'm not much of a foodie. In fact, I'm a pretty picky eater. I could probably live off of barbecue and Bojangles. 

As far as hobbies go, my favorite sport to play is volleyball, and my favorite sport to watch is soccer. I want soccer and MLS to grow in America, but I won't really support the league until there's a team in Charlotte or a Charlotte team has the possibility to join the league. I spend too much time playing Football Manager.

I think Chris Lilley is at least one of the funniest comedians alive today; although, I didn't really enjoy Jonah from Tonga that much.

Highly skilled engineers from Germany contributes to the exchequer and improves our manufacturing base. Mass migration of cleaners from Bulgaria puts pressure on minimum wage jobs. 

Immigration can be a very good thing for the country but it needs to be sensibly managed, both in terms of restricting it to high quality immigrants, and in making sure the overall scale is happening at a rate that those coming here can be integrated, and that our infrastructure and public services can adapt.

You just fill in your circumstances (age, marital status, job, experience, etc etc) and it'll tell you what visa you're eligible for and why.

Well that's not a surprise, Harold. You're on a pretty penny at QPR and being an active Premier League manager breathes life into other facets of your life in the public eye.

&gt;I’ve seen it all before. But my commitment to the job hasn’t changed and I believe when everyone is fit results will start to turn.

Even if you are committed to the job - and I'll point to your comments about retirement and golf - what do you understand the job to be, especially beyond throwing out 11 men every weekend and ringing around your old agent mates each transfer window? I'll reference the point made on the last podcast - Pulis at the end of last season stalking the club's facilities, pointing out which minutiae he wanted changed. If Redknapp is doing the same, I'm Modibo Maiga's pizza delivery guy.

&gt;“If it’s not [Newcastle manager] Alan Pardew with one game to save his job, it’s me. Perhaps people don’t have anything better to write about.

Well...Pardew has a long contract that will be expensive to buy out. And QPR supporters are generally pretty invested in terms of time and money in supporting the club. I'm sure they could write about better things on the forums and Twitter (""What's your favourite KFC Krushem?"") but the online reaction isn't exactly whimsical tip-tapping on the keyboard on a Sunday afternoon.

&gt;When we went to Ireland on a pre-season tour we only had 12 outfield players.

12 players? Hmmmmm.

&gt; I get fed up some days having to drive from home at 5am in the morning and getting criticised but I enjoy football too much to think about walking away.

His enjoyment of 'football' would probably be better served as a full-time pundit.

&gt;“I had no interest in signing one either. I said to Tony Fernandes that if we stay in the Premier League then let’s sit down and have a discussion....I wouldn’t have any interest managing in the Championship""

Again with his conditions. Some might interpret this as him only staying if he swerves failure. Others...that he will only bother waking up at 5am to drive up if it's to a Premier League club.

&gt;“There would be no benefit to the club other than to pay me money for walking away and that wouldn’t be right.”

A lot of people are saying scrap housing benefit yet I know there are times in my life I would have really really struggled had that support not been there for me. It's a stupid idea and I don't see how it would solve the issue of sky high rents given two things. One is that 99% of properties to rent advertised that I have seen state explicitly that they won't accept DSS tenants. Obviously you could lie, but then it's still difficult as most DSS tenants can't afford deposits or fees and the council generally will not give payments on advance or help towards any extra payments. The other point is that housing benefit (in my experience) rarely covers the cost of the entire rent anyway. I was renting a room for £280 a month and the council wouldn't give me all the money and I had to make up the rest with my JSA pittance. A couple of times my housing benefit or JSA was late which would ring alarm bells with my private landlord and led to some uncomfortable conversations. I was left with about £50 a month to buy food and pay for anything I needed (clothes, formal interview wear, transport etc).

Delph I'd like to think will sign an extension, but it will probably cost us a bit (like it did with Bentekkers). Who would sign him now, pay considerably more money AND give him as prominent a role as he has at Villa? I'm drawing a blank, personally. It's clear he's happy here and enjoying his role in the team, so I think as long as he doesn't take the piss with wage demands, he re-signs. Unlike Albrighton, Delph can probably justify a fairly substantial pay rise, too.

OK, so let's take Dustmann's findings that:

&gt;...each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK-born working age population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers and to an increase in the wages of higher paid workers.

Leave aside that for 95% of workers in the UK, immigration is economically neutral or a benefit, let's talk about this poorest 5%.

If there are 7,505,000 foreign born people living in Britain, then for every additional 75,050 immigrants entering the country we should expect that the poorest 5% in Britain see a wage decrease of 0.6%. 

The poorest 5% earn around £9,690 pa, so that's a wage decrease of about £60 a year, or £4.84 a month. This is significant, but there's a caveat to this in the form of the Wadsworth study. Again, this appears in both links, i'll quote yours:

&gt; The available research further shows that any adverse wage effects of immigration are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are themselves migrants. This is because the skills of new migrants are likely to be closer substitutes for the skills of migrants already employed in the UK than for those of UK-born workers. Manacorda, Manning and Wadsworth (2012) analyse data from 1975-2005 and conclude that the main impact of increased immigration is on the wages of migrants already in the UK.

So who are the lowest 5% of workers? Here's a list of the [lowest paid jobs in the UK in 2011](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/25/lowest-paid-jobs-uk-2011), all of which are about £5000 pa more than this.

I told them to stop using water until the leak was fixed, and she refused outright. I invited them into the flat and show them that it was coming from under their floor, but they just wouldn't accept it. My letting agent and his plumber dropped what they were doing and came around immediately, but after seeing the leak the couple decided to go out for the night and my plumber couldn't get access to their property.

They refused to accept it was them. They bizarrely blamed ""the chinese people"" upstairs who are ""always putting grease down their drains"". 

I had to get onto their letting agents, who to their credit then threatened them with forced entry. The whole process took about a week though, because I stupidly assumed they would do the right thing. They caused so much damage to the property by continuing to use the water.

No where have I said that; and this article isn't about mid-staffs it is about the majority of the NHS. You are using mid-staffs to de-humanise  the rest of NHS workers and now you're attempting to de-humanise me because it fits your political agenda.

&gt; Investigations show how it happened and the role that staff played in it.

This isn't about that is it, you're trying to shift the debate away from the continuous stream of conservative propaganda against just about the only British institution our entire working population benefits from.

&gt; More concerning you believe that no worker should ever be criticised even after 1200 people died.

 No-where did I say that no where has anyone said that. All I have stated is that the NHS external quality assurance was, and is, understaffed because its priority has dropped in successive budgets because quality control costs money. Do you even listen to the words that come out of you? It seems like you don't care whether what you say is actually true or not.

false,Capsulets,null,null,"&gt;In our current economic system everyone has to work in unappealing and unsatisfying jobs, unless they are one of the lucky few.


The difference is that almost everyone else has the opportunity to better themselves. To go back into education, to learn and develop and get  better at what they do. 

Even if you hate your job, if you do it for 20 years, you will get better, you have the opportunity to develop your skills, and after 20 years, you should be in a better place than you were when you started. If you are not, you only really have yourself to blame. 

If you have moderate autism, you can work for 20 years doing the same thing, and never get any better at it. Can you imagine how horrible it would feel to be in that situation? That is why I believe that people with such disabilities deserve a bit more compassion than everyone else. 

&gt; Everyone, including people with disabilities, have the right to minimum wage. Enabling employers to pay less than the minimum wage is just enabling further wage repression, we need to be increasing pay and reducing inequality, not making poverty pay easier for employers to get away with.

Ok, but employers also have the responsibility to hire the best person for the job, and in reality, there are many disabilities which will always limit the person suffering from it. How do you get them a job? Or do you condemn them to living off benefits for the rest of their lives.

Some disabled people want to work, and they also understand that they cannot perform as well as others. Its not unreasonable to say that some people cannot perform at a level that is worthy of minimum wage, we have apprentices, interns and lower wages for under 18's. If someone with a disability such as autism can only perform as well as a 16 year old, why should an employer not be able to take them on at the same rate?

1. Reducing this to a ""mistake"" is the reason why discrimination like this is still commonplace (and it *is*).

2. Of **COURSE** it's not going to solve serious human rights issues - who said it was? I have a sprained ankle and cancer - is the doctor going to refuse to treat my ankle because there's no point? *""It's hardly going to cure that cancer, is it?""*

What's your argument here? That because there are huge injustices elsewhere in the world, it's not worth improving things in our own country? 
Do you know how social change happens? Lots and lots of little things change. For an entire society to change their behavior, every single person needs to change their behavior. That doesn't just happen by waving a flipping magic wand. 

Do you know how Uganda's homophobia is going to change? The same way ours did. Over a long period of time it is going to become gradually more unacceptable. Person by person. Day by day. Britain has taken hundreds of years to get to where we are, and the difference is still marked between now and the 1980s, the 1980s and the 1950s, the 1950s and the 1850s. 

We are not there yet. Evidently. Stopping our progress now, because some corner of Africa hasn't caught up? That's fucking *madness.*

That's so far from beside the point I don't even know where to start. It isn't our *job* to convince Americans to end the death penalty. The death penalty has fuck all to do with homophobia. 

In your mind, should these two girls not bring attention to discrimination they experienced (in a way that genuinely made a difference - national news), because a handful of federal states in the USA democratically continue to allow the death penalty because their population has different, more conservative socio-political views than them? Can you explain that logic? Should you really have posted that comment when it isn't actively feeding children in Africa?

&gt;Monckton asserts that the [House of Lords Act 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999), that deprived him of a hereditary seat, is flawed and unconstitutional. In 2006 he referred to himself as ""a member of the Upper House of the United Kingdom legislature"" in a letter to US Senators,  and has also claimed to be ""a member of the Upper House but without the right to sit or vote.""  The House of Lords authorities have said Monckton is not and never has been a member and that there is no such thing as a non-voting or honorary member of the House.

This doesn't qualify for corporation tax, under the Substantial Shareholding Exemption:

&gt; The Substantial Shareholding Exemption applies only to trading companies, or trading groups, who sell or otherwise dispose of shares, interests in shares and certain assets related to shares in other trading companies or holding companies of trading groups. There's no Corporation Tax to pay on any gain on these disposals, and any losses are not allowable to set off against gains on other assets, including any on shareholdings that don't qualify for the exemption.

&gt; A substantial shareholding is one that amounts to more than 10 per cent of the ordinary share capital, which has been held for at least a continuous 12 month period during the two years immediately before the shares were sold or otherwise disposed of.

Reality bites back; capital, skills, and investment are King.  As long as Brits are selling homes in the UK and travelling with a stronger currency, they''re effectively a business on legs.

Don't think its fair that people from a strong economy, strong housing market, strong currency will find it easier to do stuff?  It isn't fair.  It's reality.  It's the people with the pot that can be whimsical about where they live, or that can buy what is compared to the markets they're used to  cheap second homes.

Not much consolation for the youth?  The youth have it easier still.  Learn skills, take student visas, the world is your oyster.  No commitments only opportunities.  Students will always be able to get student visas and seasonal work.

As for the 2 million figure, I think you'll find that 2 million people have property in Spain.  We're constantly moving back and forward, and if they're on a pension or have an external income they'll be able to 'visit' as a tourist for 6 months at a time.

Also, I'm absolutely certain it would and could not be applicable to people already in the country for either those in the UK or in the EU.  It would hit the EU economies very, very hard (the UK I suppose would be able to offset it by issuing work visas).  A French councillor told me last year that he'd commissioned a report in his local economy.  Around 50% was in the public sector.  Of the remaining private sector 70% was British in origin.   

Such fearmongering doesn't work on those of us that have worked overseas.  You could travel, work and live overseas long before the EU.  You'll be able to do so long after it.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"You are making a huge number of assumptions in your argument. There are so many factors that you have not taken into consideration, location, the size of families, how many people are actually working in each family. 

In many parts of the country, low paid jobs are incredibly hard to get, there is a huge amount of competition for them. I lived in a relatively well of area, and when a local Tesco opened there were about 3000 applicants for till and stocking jobs. Saying ""all you have to do is get a shelf stacker job"" shows a real lack of understanding about how competitive the job market is at all levels in this country. 

Another thing you have no considered is how many households contain one person working above the low wage threshold, at say £11,000, while another is working around £8,000. This give a combined household income of £19,000, not much for a family to live on. Any wage suppression on the lower earner is going to make things much harder fro that family to get by. 

Your report uses the lowest 5% as an example, but it does not state that only the lowest 5% will have their income reduced. Many low paid and low skilled workers will suffer.

 I think you are under the impression that someone like a shelf stacker would not be affected by immigration, maybe because a full time job has to pay minimum wage. But the point is that there are very few full time, low skilled jobs available any more. Most low paid jobs will be part time, or zero hour contracts. so comparing their wages to a full time job is meaningless. 


Also, your own report specifically states that: 

&gt;The greatest wage effects are found for low-waged workers.

The most noticeable impact that immigration has on wages is the negative impact is has on low wage workers. ",0,1413542800,null,0,1413559129,0,clby8mm,t3_2jgu5w,t1_clby8mm,t1_clbxt8i,null,1426484989,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

false,Quis_Custodiet,null,null,"There are a host of issues. Until 2003 the law didn't cover taking  children overseas for the purpose of FGM, but because of the way sovereign law is structured it still only covers UK nationals or permanent residents; both as victims and perpetrators. 

While you're right that the physical evidence of FGM is irrefutable, what is less clear is who is responsible for that. Often it's arranged by close family members so the victims are unwilling to lay blame, but additionally it sometimes takes place without the parents' consent or knowledge, organised instead by an aunt or grandmother. 

Other factors are that many of the victims are not British nationals or permanent residents but are immigrants pending judgement on their status. The framing of the law as noted above paints a distinctly unclear picture. There is a huge legal problem of whether UK courts can convict someone of an act committed in foreign territories, by a non-UK resident against a non-UK resident. 

The final large issue is that it's very difficult to determine how old the mutilation is. For many women and girls, they would have been mutilated before 2003 and so not fit within the new scope of the law. Likewise though, the difficulty in ageing the damage (unless the person was born after 2003, clearly) means that if a person is unwilling to speak against their family then there can be no determination of whether the mutilation was at that time a criminal act. 

FGM is a massive problem, which is predominantly a cultural issue that needs addressing as a matter of urgency. The success of prosecutions in France was as a result of the compulsory examination of women considered at risk which the UK does not (and in my view should not) intent to pursue as a means to gather evidence. 

To summarise, there are many complex reasons FGM goes unprosecuted. The barriers are legal, cultural, and are not easily remedied unless we want to neglect the bodily autonomy of people who have already been violated. 

FGM is an area of special focus for the emergency, paediatric, and maternal services. Anecdotally, the cultural norms are shifting away from FGM. It's my view that the incidence will decrease and prosecutions rise within the next five years.

David Cameron is right to tackle this anomaly and as a Scot, I support him in this.

There was adventure and it was like a promise of a great time while leaving behind all of the mushy romance. And then somehow, we got really far away from the adventure.

I stopped enjoying this season about 3 episodes ago. A Doctor Who recap is a regular theme on my blog and I actually cringed at the thought of having to write it. Seriously, the Kill the Moon episode was borderline about abortion and it just made me grit my teeth together and stare at my screen in a bit of horror.

All of the episodes now are full of fluff... an intent to push some deep plot between the characters. I'd like to hope that in some way, it's just a means to an end - the only way they knew how to change the companion / Doctor dynamic. I'm not a professional writer, but I would like to think that surely there was a better way than all of this. 

And yes, I really do think Capaldi is great. I think he's a fine actor and may very well be the only reason I'm watching Doctor Who right now. Because right now, the plot isn't doing it for me.

My point that MGM exists is mostly in response to /u/joper90's comment about 'rational free thinking and freedom of choice' which should be available to *everyone* here in the UK - particularly freedom of choice (or safety from others making such decisions) where children in the UK are concerned. 

But MGM *and* FGM exist in the UK and in terms of educating people that neither are OK - making a distinction doesn't really muddy anything.

&gt;As for the 2 million figure, I think you'll find that 2 million people have property in Spain. We're constantly moving back and forward, and if they're on a pension or have an external income they'll be able to 'visit' as a tourist for 6 months at a time.



It's 2 million total if I recall correctly. 1 Million in Spain if you believe [this](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1486202/thumbs/o-EU-MIGRANTS-570.jpg)  Like you said, how many of them live there permanently or seasonally, I have no idea.



&gt;Also, I'm absolutely certain it would and could not be applicable to people already in the country for either those in the UK or in the EU. It would hit the EU economies very, very hard (the UK I suppose would be able to offset it by issuing work visas). A French councillor told me last year that he'd commissioned a report in his local economy. Around 50% was in the public sector. Of the remaining private sector 70% was British in origin.


You're probably right.  I can't see people being booted out.  Interested if it would that created any anti-UK resentment.

I reckon the complainant isn't an innocent party in this at all. Without knowing the full facts, my gut feeling suggests she was some horny drunk slapper that was happy to shag whoever was about that night. I may be wrong but my gut feeling is that.

Because of this, I believe that while Evans has been a complete idiot for engaging in sex with her and also a complete slag himself, I don't believe the rape allegation for one second. I'm aware the jury found him guilty but I don't think they saw all the evidence including these witness statements.

I think people are getting too carried away with the stereotypical view that rape usually consists of ""some vulnerable innocent young woman exploited at the hands of some evil, manipulative, red blooded male who uses his power to give the poor innocent girl no option but to allow him to violate her. This clearly isn't how the Evans incident went down. This I see as the main driver behind the petition to stop him playing professional football again.

Wait and see how the appeal pans out in my view, the law isn't always right (look at people on death row in US or in prison for life in UK that are later found innocent) but it's the best we've got. With that in mind, he should be allowed to resume playing football again even if you believe he's guilty as the court found.

&gt;The origins and early history of nation states are disputed. A major theoretical issue is: ""Which came first, the nation or the nation state?"" Professor Steven Weber of the University of California, Berkeley, has advanced the hypothesis that the nation-state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies.[5][6] 

I know what did come first.  The island.  You don't need cartography.

The Althing was created in 930CE.  It applied to one geographic area.  It is the oldest parliament.  By every meter Iceland was a nation state.

Strange that at the same time another group of islands not too far away were also establishing extant boundaries.  The UK.  They only needed on short boundary.  The coastline did the rest.  Read your Shakespeare; they certainly didn't have any issue establishing what was and was not Scotland.

You just used an argument provided by a devout communist to embellish the role of a 'socialist' leading revolution to undermine anything else before.  Hobsbawm rewrote history - he was the historical photoshop of Stalinism.

Don't believe that.  It's [British Influence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Influence) (logo top right), a Peter Mandelson spin outlet.  Look at Bulgaria on the map.  Bulgaria has some of the lowest immigration much, much below that, but it's had a lot of UK property investment and speculation (I looked at it myself).

      According to official data, the number of permanent foreign residents in Bulgaria as at 31.12.2008 is 
      66,806[1] and the vast majority of these come from Russia (21,309), Ukraine (5,350), the Republic 
      of Macedonia (4,375), Turkey (3,828) and Moldova (2.203). However, this number does not include 
      immigrants who have already obtained Bulgarian citizenship or illegal immigrants. The number of 
      immigrants in Bulgaria is expected to grow as a result of the accession of Bulgaria in the European 
      Union in 2007.[2]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Bulgaria

Since then Bulgaria hasn't issued that many residence permits.  Let alone to Brits.  (They still do issue permits)

OECD in 2012:  

      The stock of foreign permanent residents was about 37 000


http://www.oecd.org/migration/mig/IMO%202012_Country%20note%20Bulgaria.pdf

There's over 20 000 Russians alone, and 5 000 Ukrainians.  There can't be 18 000 Brits if they only have 37 000 permanent residents!  Immigration to Bulgaria has flatlined.  It's counted in its hundreds.  How did 18 000 people from the UK sneak in?

  I've been to Bulgaria, it's absolutely beautiful, great weather, very cheap (like crazy property cheap).  The immigration just isn't there (the infrastructure and development isn't there yet).  The investment in beachside property and ski/mountain chalets by property speculators is.

Those figures are all overseas property and people that are there part of the year.  **It's not residents.**    
Once you appreciate it's property, not residents, you only have to reflect on the hundreds of thousands of  holiday apartments built in the 80s and 90s which stand empty for much of the year.

And yes, most policies geared towards welfare or immigration are inevitably open to abuse - you will always get people who try to cheat the system - but the accepted principle is that these represent such a tiny minority that the overall benefit to society makes the policies worthwhile. To constantly highlight every damning transgression committed by this minority completely skews public perception, and leaves people with an utterly warped picture of what is actually going on, and the reason it is so frustrating is that it's being done intentionally through a combination of driven ideology and blind profiteering.

Brendan Rodgers: I want to move on from the Sterling saga for the sake of the kid.

BR: Congratulations to England and all the home nations for the results they got and their performances.

BR: I’ve been very fortunate to work with Raheem. From the pre-season trip as a 17-year-old, he’s been incredible for me.

BR: He’s [Sterling] maturing into a great young man, now 19, he’s responsible, honest. Lots of players will play when they don’t feel right.

BR: It’s been grossly unfair how Sterling has been put in the back pages for something he clearly didn’t say.

BR: He’s back here in a secure environment. The last week shook him a wee bit but he was brilliant in training this morning.

BR: I take pride in players playing for their countries. I see it as an earmark for how we’re developing our players.

BR: Liverpool is very much club and country, not club vs. country. I will continue to work for all nations and all our players to progress.

BR: Me and Roy Hodgson have exchanged messages, but we want to put this to bed. Sterling is a huge talent, we all want him to do well.

BR: We’ll see how Daniel Sturridge is tomorrow. He’s training, looking well. Emre Can’s back in, Joe Allen’s back in.

BR: As a manager it’s key to have your best players playing. They can’t play every game at the top level - in particular young players.

BR: It doesn’t surprise me, the number of players who are tired given how many games they have to play.

BR: We have no thoughts towards the Real Madrid game - the next game is our most important, and that’s QPR away.

Journalist tells Brendan Rodgers that Daniel Sturridge has been photographed out shopping. BR jokes: “That’s not on!""

BR: Roy’s a manager with great experience. All managers will deal with different situations differently. I won’t make comment on that.

BR: I spent 15 years traveling around Europe looking at different methods so that I have an identity as a coach. My morals is to make...

BR: …players better. The nature of my game is to be aggressive, to press, at speed. So the recovery of players is different.

Our “second day recovery” is very important. It may be swimming, the key is intensity and density. I determine the training model.

BR: My methods have always worked for me with all players. Our senior players were able to play every game for a long time.

BR: I’m not waiting to read a thesis in 10 years time with the evidence. We’re at the leading edge here, we create the evidence.

BR: My medical team will look at the welfare of Kolo Toure if he was to go to the African Cup of Nations. We’ll address it at the time.

(Comment on Toure was in regard to the ebola outbreak in west Africa)

BR: When Sturridge is playing, he’s one of the top European strikers. It’s important for him to play games to prove that consistently.

BR: Adam Lallana has shown in recent seasons that he is a great player and a top talent. We knew he could slot into the PL straight away.

BR: Since Lallana came back from injury, his fitness has been growing all the time. He’s shown real signs of getting back to the top.

BR: I’m quite relaxed about our form and the season so far. If Phil Jagielka doesn’t score a worldy goal, we’d be even better off.

BR: There’s certainly no crisis. We lost a world class player in the summer and brought in new players, that takes time to settle in.

BR: I would rather make slow and steady progress because we’ll get there.

BR: Dejan Lovren will hopefully be fine for the weekend. (despite injury during the internationals).

You have to remember that the colonies didn't break away to form one nation, they broke away into sovereign states with their own constitution and when they did decide to turn the Continental Congress into the United States there was much debate of what that should actually mean. 

The creation of the constitution turned into a really bitter fight about what the role, if any, a federal government should have and what powers it could or should have over the sovereignty of the states. In fact it's pretty much exactly the same debate as we have now.

The USA in other words was the result of political prerogative not a wave of popular nationalism, that is something that came with time of having *been* a nation not the reason for setting one up.

The end of project carry over as far as I know is normally imposed by the research councils rather than the university itself because you have to spend the money from the grant on the project you won it for, and when applying for that grant you should have worked out the costs over the length of time that your project runs for, meaning you shouldn't have any leftover.

I guess you like shoving words in peoples mouths. *I don't know who your talking to because no-one has said anything like this*.

I think, in order to stop events like mid-staffs occurring we need *improved quality assurance and training as well as hospital staffing levels*. This amounts to more check-ups. How exactly do you plan on catching staff if you don't check up on what they are doing?

&gt; I'm afraid I don't agree with censoring bad news or discussion about the NHS. All public bodies need to be accountable as do the people working in them.

Nobody is censoring anything, what are you even talking about? Even if I wanted to censor something I do not have that power in any way shape or form. Where is the discussion of censorship.

&gt; It should be noted that I brought up Mid Staffs to counter a point you made way back up at the top of this thread.

To which I replied:

&gt; Yeah it was a lack of oversight, lack of quality control. If only there were more people dedicating their time to quality control of hospitals and trusts and less time introducing privatisation schemes.

So basically my point that *improved quality assurance and training as well as hospital staffing levels* will reduce error and catch poor care quality. This hasn't happened and hasn't even been discussed in all the talk about competition, saving money, or even how we stop something like mid-staffs happening.

So what exactly is your point? 

*That you think improved regulation of NHS hospitals isn't about staffing, training and quality assurance?*
*That blaming people is how we stop mid-staffs happening?*

* I'll concede that migration has clearly exacerbated an **existing** housing supply shortage.

* The most obvious, and the one on which UKIP thrives, is simply the sheer scale. I have some sympathy for the 70 year old woman whose spent 40 years living a very stable life on the same street... only to find in just 5 years it's unrecognizable...gone are the friendly Smiths, Greens and Taylors. Now 75% of the street is made up of Eastern Europeans who do things their own way... and I can tell you from experience, there's nothing quite like being woken up at 7am on a Sunday by Balkans electro dance music at full volume... and it's difficult to be angry at those migrants who just don't realize that isn't good neighborly behavior. You can sum these people up as those that **feel like strangers in their own land**, and I have some sympathy for them.

* It's strained our healthcare and education services. I recently went to London and saw a school trip of I'm guessing year 6 pupils going around the Museum of London down the road from St. Pauls... out of about 30 students two of them appeared to be English... that presents challenges that our education system is not set up to cope with. We're dealing with people who have different cultural values, different aspirations and limited understanding of **our** culture. And it strikes me that in a nutshell, these so called ""Trojan Horse"" scandals have effectively been born out of that.

* Low skilled European economic migrants, who have only come to the UK to earn money to send home due to the poor state of affairs in their own nations, have effectively displaced migrants from anglophone nations like Canada, Aus, NZ and the US, or the commonwealth, who might actually have more ""cultural value"" - and whose motivation for coming to the UK is because they are genuine anglophiles with a lot to contribute, if not economically then in their positive engagement with ""who we are"" as a people. They might not pay vast amounts of tax but you'll see them down the pub making friends with British people, marrying Brits and adopting our culture, rather than trying to export their own.   

Ultimately what we need is **less** low skilled migrants from the EU and more high skilled and ""cultural"" migration from anglophone nations, or the commonwealth. These people share our cultural identity and they also share our desire to make this nation a better place. Overall though I'd expect to see **total** net migration ideally come down to around 100,000 per year, including EU and non-EU. There should also be a putsch to try and attract those migrants to places that **need** it, like Scotland and N.Ireland, and away from places that really don't like the already saturated South East.

I'll be getting a bus next time, becauseg it's just not worth the risk, so they've lost my business in that respect.

That wouldn't change if it was nationalised though, which is what people seem to want. National Express presumably has the same rules, and it's pot luck as to whether the driver cares or not (unlike trains, I'm guessing national express doesn't have people who randomly get on coaches and check though). I guess another difference is that coaches typically must be booked in advance so the driver knows how many are getting on, but no UK train is like that (except Eurostar)

There are plenty of things about the rail industry that are stupid and idiotic but I just don't think this is one.

I'd say that it isn't just east coast - in my experience, if you try to find the train guard / train manager / whatever before you try to get on, and explain the situation, they might well let you on anyway, as you say it doesn't make much of a difference.

I'm 27, live in Northern California and am an editor at a major online automotive publication. Essentially, my job is to drive all kinds of cars (I'm usually in something different each week), write about them, manage/edit other writers and help determine the general voice and direction for the site. 

At least, that's my job for the next week. I recently handed in my resignation after taking a job up in my dream city of Seattle, Washington. I'll be moving there in the next couple of weeks, which will keep me crazy busy, but not too busy to watch some soccer!

Music: I like all kinds. I guess if I was pressed, I'd have to say my favorite band is Guster.

TV: Sitcoms and dramas. I watch a lot of reruns. Seinfeld, Arrested Development, HIMYM, Dexter, etc.

Books: My job is to read and write, so I don't do as much reading at home as I should. Lately, though, I've been on a big David Sedaris kick. I also love the classics from Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner and others.

Other sports: I'm from Michigan, so I still tend to pull for the Detroit teams (and Michigan State). This is, in general, not an easy thing to do. There are many ups and downs, which result in brief moments of glory, but mostly crushing disappointment.

Hobbies: I try to play soccer two or three times per week. The Bay Area has loads of pickup games and informal leagues, so it's never too difficult to find something. I also love hiking, cooking, video games (currently playing lots of FIFA and Destiny), driving, photography and trying different kinds of beer and wine.

This image shows it quite clearly, there is a chart out there as well that accompanies it.

The two main important structures lost are the frenar (or ridged) band which is at the tip of the foreskin, it contains nerve endings similar to that in the tips of the fingers but in much higher concentration then anywhere else on the human body.  Then there is the frenulum, which is where the frenar band meets the glans, this is a highly innervated area and is usually reported as giving the most pleasure (though this varies).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD2yW7AaZFw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD2yW7AaZFw)

This is a very informative video of a Professor of anatomy in New Zealand who has done alot of research in to the foreskin from an objective view, discussing the significance of the foreskin from his findings.

Not only does MGM reduce male pleasure in sex, but it also reduces it for their partners.  The foreskin gives a gliding motion, so instead of the shaft rubbing against the vaginal walls, the penis moves within the foreskin, which helps retain her natural lubricant, and as my GF has told me, feels much better.  If you as unfortunate as me and received an aggressively tight circumcision, you may have problems with a lot of hair pulled on the shaft from the pubic and testicle regions.  When erect half my shaft is covered in hair, which enters the vagina causing soreness and discomfort, shaving only makes this worse as the stubble is rougher.

It really hit me the most, in a Tom Baker story called The Seeds of Doom.  Basically, the primary threat to the Doctor in most of the story is a guy named Scorby.  He's really mean, and if the Doctor goes to do what he needs to do to stop the plant monster, Scorby will punch him.  That's pretty much that.  The scale involved is a bit different from the epic battles and huge conflict of the new series.  Scorby attempts to punch the Doctor, and locks him in a closet somewhere, only for the Doctor to escape, so many times, that one of the last times, Scorby just up and throws The Doctor at some trash cans (Tom Baker going full Kermitflail in the process), then he picks the Doctor back up, says, ""You look a bit unsteady on your feet, Doctor,"" and just throws him at the trash cans again.  It's fucking hilarious.  One of the silliest, most surreal things in the series, and absolutely does not detract from the story.  If you saw that in the new series, people would shit themselves.

There's another moment, in The Brain of Morbius, where a guy and the Doctor are walking along, they step in a room, the guy steps back, closes the door and locks it.  It's a real all is lost moment.  I remember seeing it and throwing my hands in the air, going, ""The door is locked!  The universe is fucked!""

There is no way of you knowing which one of these students is English or not, unless by English you mean white and if that's the case then your point is moot. What'd exactly are the challenges of teaching kids of a difference race? And giving you the benefit of the doubt, if all but two of those kids were British, then yeah, I agree with you, that would be a challenge. But the fact of the matter is that many of these kids speak English or are learning to speak English quickly because they are kids. I keeps seeing a stat that a certain percentage of kids don't speak English at home. So? Just because you don't speak English at home doesn't mean you can't speak English at all. The way stats are collected is flawed.

&gt;migrants from anglophone nations like Canada, Aus, NZ and the US, or the commonwealth, who might actually have more ""cultural value"" - and whose motivation for coming to the UK is because they are genuine anglophiles.

Countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh are commonwealth countries but a large majority of people who oppose immigration on ""cultural"" grounds wouldn't want Muslims to come over despite historic links. 

I disagree with you about the woman who's lived on the street 40 years and seen it change. She has my sympathy but things change all over the world and she won't have to out with it much longer. UKIP is very backwards looking. Their stance on immigration aside, everything about is about wanting to take the country back to the 50's. That isn't what Britain need. Britain needs to be forward thinking not insular, it's the only way to grow the economy and everything else.

I do agree with you on encouraging immigration northwards, I think that's do a great load of good to the economy (even if certain locals won't see it that way), but then that's linked to reducing London's dominance in the country ",0,1413559282,null,0,false,0,clc3p3q,t3_2jgu5w,t1_clc3p3q,t1_clc2b43,null,1426482372,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,AppleBlossom63,jack,Jack Harkness,"Clara is the problem. Hear me out on this, I've thought about it a lot.

Clara is beginning to follow the Amy Pond trope, not only by being someone so important the Doctor can't let them go, but also by never going away.

I was about to love this last episode. Really, really love it, but she had to ruin everything. There was an unexpected adventure, a bittersweet undertone that implied she was really leaving for good, even a few sweet moments with Pink that made me smile. But she ruined it. She ruined the whole thing by ""changing her mind"" at the last fucking second for no good apparent reason.

Clara is beginning to fall into the Amy Pond problem: a unique girl who the Doctor cannot let go of for some reason. But instead of the girl who waited we got the girl and her boy who never go away. And now instead of the girl who saves the Doctor, we're getting another girl who never goes away and can't ever find a good reason to leave anyway.

Amy Pond worked out, I guess, in the end. But Clara won't, and let me tell you why: She doesn't work with Capaldi. As simple as that. Their symmetry is nonexistent from what I see. She playfully banters like she would have with 11 and he responds with some curt, cold, sarcastic quip. Both are great, but they don't work together. I'm beginning to see Clara as an annoying one-dimensional character who is around just to carry out the Doctor's orders and make sure he's not alone. And... no. The Doctor can find another companion, he has in the past. He does not need to keep clinging to Clara with his creepy ""we could have been something if I hadn't become old"" attitude that the writing is forcing him to have.

So: I don't miss the Doctor. I miss the days when the Doctor had a companion that he could work with and have fun symmetry with instead of some bossy girl who doesn't like him and he doesn't really seem to like her. How painful is it every time he mentions one of her ""quirks""(flaws) and she rips him apart for what she perceives to be flaws. Goddamn; the whole first episode of the season was practically about whether or not Clara was willing to stay with the doctor now that he's old. What the fuck? Why is she being allowed to stay around? Why aren't we getting a companion more suited for Capaldi?

Don't even start on ""Well Rose Tyler was carried over from 9 to 10"" because that's completely different. Rose Tyler was so important to the Doctor that he based an entire regeneration around her and making her happy and helping her to fall in love with him. Capaldi is the Doctor who will save/bring back Gallifrey. He's a darker Doctor who, yeah, needs to be reminded to lighten up every now and then, and Clara is not the girl to do it. All she does is drag him into a darker place with guilt and forced responsibility. That's not what the Doctor needs. That's not what Gallifrey needs, and that's sure as hell not what I as a viewer need.

Basically to sum it up: Clara doesn't work because she was written for the 11th Doctor. Her personality and style of companion does not work for Capaldi. All it does is highlight both of their errors as individuals and barely focuses on what works because *so little works*. The new Doctor needs someone more resolute, someone who won't change their mind after a vapid ""I love you"". He needs someone who will stand beside him and say, ""Yes, you did the right thing, now let's keep going,"" as well as someone who says, ""Stop, you're going too far, this isn't the Doctor."" So far all we've seen from Clara is: ""Nooo! You're so mean! You're so cruel! You knew they would die! You could have saved them! Waaah!"" Okay, fine. If you don't like the new Doctor's way of handling things, leave!

false,Pcja,null,null,"From a Spanish tourism industry point of view, it would be advantageous if UK citizens lost EU citizenship. That would mean that Spain would be at freedom to set the requirements on UK citizens that are more advantageous to us.

For example, we require Americans (or any non-EU citizens) to invest €500,000 in Spain to get a permanent residence permit.

We could do the same with UK citizens if we think it would be advantageous. Or we could lower it to €100,000 if we want to encourage more numbers but we still want to leave out the poorest Britons. Or we could just choose to allow everybody in as usual if we make the math and it turns out that's the best way to go. There is nothing Spain loses if UK gets out of the EU, but we sure gain a lot of control.

People tend to spend a lot of money during short vacations, so it's considered good when people stay 15 days a year. But people who live here permanently, not so much, because they stay long enough to learn how to live economically (Unless they are very rich). If any citizen of a richer country was automatically welcome, why do we ask Japanese people for half a million to stay? By that logic we would let them in automatically.

If Spain decides to exercise the control to increase the average income of UK residents, though, a lot of people would indeed have to go back.

I feel you guys are seriously overestimating the acquisitive power of the average British expat. It's about 25% of them that we would like to keep, I estimate.

I doubt there would be any public support for lowering the requirements for UK citizens, by the way, the half million rule sounds pretty reasonable to me and it's on par with what other countries require.

In general terms I would expect a lot of independent businesses to be in a similar situation. I should think that our expectations are warped by the number of chains we've all grown up around. If one branch of a shop runs into problems such places can survive because their expenses are paid from the company coffers rather than their own. Independents don't have that safety net and so a shock like not being able to move extra stock seems like a real cause for financial concern.

&gt;That IJs weren't able to deal with a short term stop in business 

That depends on what a ""short term stop"" consists of. For a business that relies on a constant stream of customers (rather than large orders every few months) losing several weeks of custom sounds like a death blow.

&gt;that they didn't have the insurance to deal with the situation

Assuming they had insurance I wouldn't expect it to pay off quickly enough to save them. I'd wager any insurance would be a helpful boost during a recovery period rather than something to be relied on for survival.

If the owner stands to lose money I would think that the insurance will help him out further down the line.

In the circumstances I'd guess that the combination of ongoing financial obligations without income (which would add up extremely quickly), having bought extra stock which couldn't be moved, and the prospect of a rebuilding time ahead would create a situation where the owner could look at where the numbers were headed and see that there wasn't much hope of a recovery.",0,1413560043,null,0,false,0,clc42u7,t3_2jglsy,t1_clc42u7,t1_clc3mwb,null,1426482194,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

I am also a glasses wearer and know your pain well. I've found there are 3 things you can do here to make your life a lot easier:

- Ventilation, make sure all the events are open in your helmet. Unless your on the motorway, even in a downpour, you won't get any water coming in

- Clean it, this makes a massive difference, use some windscreen cleaner / visor cleaner / whatever to clean both your visor and glasses.

- Anti fog, you can go for a few different options here. A anti fog spray could be a good shout, these cost a few quid and come in a handy little bottle so you can keep it in your bag. Quick spray before you head off on both visor and glasses will do the job. Or you can use the homebrew method and rub a small amount of washing up liquid onto the inside of both. Use a dry tissue or cloth and apply like a polish. It will rub clear. The other thing is a an anti fog insert. I've never used one so can't comment, but suspect it won't help with the glasses much.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Fucking hell. There are arguments for and against circumcision in men, but comparing it to female genital mutilation in women is absolutely ridiculous.

Why? If it's not for medical purposes then it's the mutilation of ones genitals without consent from the person recieving it. Claiming otherwise is more damaging as it enables the practice to continue. 

&gt; I'm circumcised (I'm Jewish) and have never had any sexual problems, other than the fact that I probably wank too much. I recognise that some men have issues with circumcision but personally I resent the notion that I have been ""mutilated"" because frankly, I fucking love my cock and think it looks pretty magnificent as it is.

Good for you - and fortunate - but consider how far up shit creek you'd be if you *didn't* like how it looked? What choice did you have? What choice do any infants have when it happens to them? 

I'm not saying I pity you or that you are obliged to change what you think - but you can't speak for everyone and you can't say anyone who differs from your opinion is wrong simply because *you* like it. 

&gt; And there's literally no comparison between snipping off a bit of foreskin, which is unlikely to ever impact on a man's sexual pleasure or capacity 

Irrelevant. Even assuming something is harmless - what gives anyone the right to decide to do that to someone for anything other than out of medical necessity. 

I could cut patterned holes in babies ears and they could still hear - make them look like elves ears perhaps? There'd be no impact on the effectiveness of the ear after all. Perhaps I think it looks attractive. 

Are you OK with that idea? Do I have the right to do that to another person? 

&gt; and cutting off a woman's clit sewing up her vagina so that she can never derive any sexual pleasure from intercouse.

This is a barbaric practice and I'm not OK with it. I'm also not OK with cutting up young males penises either. I believe everyone should have a choice.

But let's look at this like domestic violence. It happens to men and women. Surely the more sensible appraoch is ""don't do this"" rather than spliting it by gender as though the distinction in some way makes any more or less of the message. 

Do you understand that it's wrong to cut up girls vaginas differently because the message you hear doesn't specify women specificaly but simply people?

That is my point. I don't think it's moot. You can call them whatever you want, ""Native Britons"", whatever. My immigration views are not based on race. I'd be happy to see more immigration from the notably more colourful commonwealth than, for example, low skilled migrants from Eastern Europe. One of the reasons why UKIP are so successful right now is that people, like myself, who are genuinely perturbed about the immigration system here absolutely despise being painted as racists, since our views really aren't based on race. But it is fair to say that migrants bring with them their own unique cultural identity... that's no bad thing in its own right. However, it becomes a problem when they move here in such large groups and without the intention of integration, that in effect they are seeking to establish cultural enclaves within the UK - where they can speak their own languages, adopt their own customs and conduct business in the manners they find familiar.

It also complicates our public services - since we don't well understand the sorts of cultural values and needs that these other people have. Over the years this has manifested itself in lots of different ways, ranging from issues like honor killing and arranged marriage to things like female genital mutilation. Christ, for 50 odd years people have been coming here with a background of FGM and we've not done anything about it, because we simply didn't appreciate it was a thing. Why, after all, would we think to? 

I don't think it is unreasonable to accept migrants to the UK on the basis that they **must** make a reasonable effort to integrate. 

&gt; UKIPs stance on immigration aside...

Putting UKIPs immigration stance to one side is like putting the greens environmentalism to one side. I agree their other policies are backwards - Its also worth pointing out Farage dismissed in its entirety their ""manifesto"" so there is a lot of bullshit out there about their policies. It's also true that during their rapid rise party members of UKIP (often themselves new to the role) have made manifesto-esque commitments on and off record for all sorts of bizarre things, effectively in the form of a sort of traditionalist-circle-jerk. I think its fair to say though, people who vote UKIP will be doing it on the basis of immigration. It has little to do with traditional values, and even little to do with the EU.

• Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependents for 5 years. This means private health insurance (except emergency medical care)

• Proof of private health insurance must be a precondition for immigrants and tourists to enter the UK.

###From their [Policies for People](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people) document:

- UKIP will ensure the NHS is free at the point of delivery and time of need for all UK residents.

  _Note: UK residents, not just UK citizens. This is exactly the system currently in place_

- We will stop further use of PFI in the NHS and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where this is affordable.

- We will ensure that GPs’ surgeries are open at least one evening per week, where there is demand for it.

- UKIP opposes plans to charge patients for visiting their GP.

  _No mention of dentists or opticians though_

- We will ensure that visitors to the UK, and migrants until they have paid NI for five years, have NHS-approved private health insurance as a condition of entry to the UK, saving the NHS £2bn pa. UKIP will commit to spending £200m of the £2bn saving to end hospital car parking charges in England.

- We will replace Monitor and the Care Quality Commission with elected county health boards to be more responsive scrutineers of local health services. These will be able to inspect health services and take evidence from whistle-blowers.

- UKIP opposes the sale of NHS data to third parties.

- We will ensure foreign health service professionals coming to work in the NHS are properly qualified and can speak English to a standard acceptable to the profession.

- UKIP will amend working time rules to give trainee doctors, surgeons and medics the proper environment to train and practise.

- There will be a duty on all health service staff to report low standards of care.  ",0,1413562550,null,0,1413562939,0,clc5cus,t3_2jis4b,t1_clc5cus,t3_2jis4b,null,1426481598,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Chances are the police officer taking the shot has never had to shoot a live target moving erratically before, there's only so much you can simulate on a range, and the easiest way to make sure they take the target down is to hit centre mass every time. 

Ideally a shot to the head taking out the medulla oblongata would present the quickest take down if you only shoot to kill, however that's pretty hard to pull off and especially if you have someone who has never shot a person before and is filled with adrenaline. There's a high risk of missing extremities and possibly hitting somebody else, I know that you're not meant to shoot unless it's clear behind but if you miss the target you've got no guarantee that round won't ricochet or penetrate a wall or something like that. 

As dad put it to me many years ago, you don't point a weapon at something you aren't prepared to kill be that a gun, knife or anything else. The police shooting a target isn't taken lightly, not in this country at least, and they will only do it if there's no other option and the person offers a serious threat to others.

false,2localboi,eng-GreaterLondon,"Pecknarm ","&gt;I'd be happy to see more immigration from the notably more colourful commonwealth than, for example, low skilled migrants from Eastern Europe

You may be the exception but a great majority of people I have met and spoken to don't really make a distinction between commonwealth and EU migration.

&gt;However, it becomes a problem when they move here in such large groups and without the intention of integration, that in effect they are seeking to establish cultural enclaves within the UK - where they can speak their own languages, adopt their own customs and conduct business in the manners they find familiar.

I don't see why this is a problem whatsoever. If you feel English culture is threatened by the existence of cultural enclaves then that's a problem with English culture, not the fact that enclaves exist. When you go to foreign countries, you see little British colonies of pubs and shops giving ex-pats a home away from home. I also don't really see how one could stop said enclaves from happening in the first place since it's such an organic process anyway.

Also, speaking as the son/daughter of immigrants, I can't tell you how valuable having such an enclave is to practice the language of my parent and stay in touch with my heritage. If someone was to tell me I or my parents should integrate more I would tell them to get real, we live here, we work here and have English friends. I get the feeling from some people (not you) who spin the ""more integration"" line that they basically want immigrants to completely throw away their own heritage and assimilate completely to be British/English. 

It always irks me therefore when, by extension, these same people say that my parents should have taught me English at home. Why? It's not like there's a huge community of my community here so why should they forgoe one of the few benefits (bilingualism) they can offer me?

&gt;Over the years this has manifested itself in lots of different ways, ranging from issues like honor killing and arranged marriage to things like female genital mutilation. Christ, for 50 odd years people have been coming here with a background of FGM and we've not done anything about it

I agree with you here. I believe this is down to the Left being historically weak at confronting these issues in a post-nationalist context, when the left and Labour Party were still focused on class rather than a progressive nation building. But this also has to do with the fact that no one in white Britain really cared what the ""brown people"" did to each other until recently.

&gt;Putting UKIPs immigration stance to one side is like putting the greens environmentalism to one side

I wanted to put UKIPs stance on immigration aside to criticise UKIP from a point if view other than ""dey waisit"", but come to think of it, put UKIPs stance on immigration to one side and you just have a party annoyed that the present isn't the past. I also find it really funny how people have forgotten that this time last year UKIP predicted a horde of Romanians coming to Britain. I swear to god they pushed to talking point for weeks and in the end nothing much happend.

What's not comparable is your analogy. Murdering someone ends their life - possibly brutally, but we haven't specified. Slapping someone in the face *may* cause them pain but again you've not specified. They live on. 

Mutilating someone's genitals - be they male *or* female - is an involuntary act typically carried out upon a child. That's the first fact about it. Details of *how it is achieved* differ and yet again you don't find me claiming that FGM is in any way right or proper.

You're OK with your circumcision and therefore seem unable or unwilling to see the point of view: *what if you're a male and you never wanted to be circumcised?* You're still stuck with it. Bad luck. Now you feel you're disfigured for life. 

I see you've avoided my suggestion that cut up babies ears. Are you OK with that? Would you accept that practice as you accept circumcision? 

I also notice you've avoided my simple suggestion that we take a hard line message 'unless for medical purposes, the mutilation of an infants genitals is wrong'. To hell with the religious implications - religion is proven daily to be a dangerous thing that makes mistakes.

&gt;The __C class__ was a group of twenty-eight [light cruisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cruiser) of the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy), and were built in a sequence of seven groups known as the *Caroline* Class (six ships), the *Calliope* Class (two ships), the *Cambrian* Class (four ships), the *Centaur* Class (two ships), the *Caledon* Class (four ships), the *Ceres* Class (five ships) and the *Carlisle* Class (five ships). They were built for the rough conditions of the [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea), and proved to be rugged and capable vessels, despite their being somewhat small and cramped.

If you want to know Labour's policy direction, [this document might be worth a look](http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/ONE_NATION_ECONOMY.pdf). For instance:

**Energy**

* Pass legislation to force energy companies to separate their generation and supply businesses and track all electricity and gas on open exchanges.

* Introduce a simplified tariff structure that gives ordinary people more power to get the best deal from the market.

* Abolish Ofgem and put in place a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall and the market does not respond. 

**Employment and Housing**

* Labour would invest in building new homes to bring down the housing benefit bill, including by recycling benefit savings achieved by local authorities into new home building.

* We are proposing a fully-funded compulsory Jobs Guarantee for young people out of work for a year and for those over 25 out of work for two years. 

**Banking**

* We are proposing a proper British Investment Bank to support lending to businesses, and a regional banking network to serve every part of the country.

* If we do not see reform of the banks with a tough ringfence between casino banking, and high street banking, alongside a genuine change in banking culture by 2015, Labour will break up the banks.

* We will  introduce a Code of Conduct for bankers so that those who act recklessly or who are found to be mis-selling can be struck off.

To Nike, Liverpool FC will just be a minor piece of global appeal that they have almost no internal connection to

New Balance and FSG are both based in Boston. Given that they (NB) are more known for Running right now, they are going to want to break into the Football Market. As long as Liverpool are owned by FSG, I could see the rebranding being favourable since Liverpool will be NB's primary brand going into the football market.

What isn't helpful is going after one specific case because all you do is promote this case over all the others that happen on a daily basis but aren't reported because footballers aren't involved in them.  

&gt; oh buts its a big public profile, its a big deal, he's a role model for children  

all this fucking bullshit will do is apply a sticking plaster solution to the problem. Ched Evans will get fired as Sheffield United cave to the public pressure and then the entire issue will be forgotten about. What's better is to keep him there as a reminder that the public's idea of sentencing differs from the courts.  
Yes, its ugly when the fans chant: ""he scores when he wants"" and all the associated bile but that's a fucking clear representation of our issue at play here. Chase it away and we lose this incredibly powerful advertisement for the problem.

""Justice"" has been served. If you don't like it fix the justice system just don't go running around trying to be a crap batman by trying to drag people back to jail or somehow metering your own punishment because you don't think its been sufficient. Don't be blinded by vengeance and emotion because it clouds the real problem which is that **the justice system's sentencing and the public's perception differs by a country mile in regards to rape sentencing.** 

Fix the justice system and we might even have an ""Evans law"" or an ""Evans amendment"" or ""Evans sentencing guidelines"".

This has come as no surprise to me, he has been constantly on the wrong end of the law. He lived in Cornwall, had kids, cheated on his wife, got arrested for being drunk and disorderly (whilst I was visiting him no less when I was 10 years old).

Shit hit the fan when he rang up his brother/my other uncle telling him he was the father of his kids. At that time too, he comes back up and we get a phone call from the police telling us he voluntarily gave up a load drug dealer names for petty revenge and they swore to hit him where it hurt. At this point he goes from being a staunch Labour supporter to being swallowed up by the EDL, dragging my Aunt/his Sister into it as well. This is only part of his story, having spent years in prison previously.

He spoke as a martyr in his pre-sentencing facebook post, claiming to be giving up his family, his business and his house to stand up for his ridiculous beliefs. Sorry if I'm going on about some bullshit personal life of theirs but I only found out recently that he was so involved in the EDL. What it shows me is that all the EDL was to him was a way to legitimise his crime, drinking and general thuggishness. He has no real ideals.

To be honest I'm getting sick of this shit. If you have an issue with the way rape laws and sentencing work in our country deal with the fucking root of the issue, The justice system.  
What isn't helpful is going after one specific case because all you do is promote this case over all the others that happen on a daily basis but aren't reported because footballers aren't involved in them.  

&gt; oh buts its a big public profile, its a big deal, he's a role model for children

all this fucking bullshit will do is apply a sticking plaster solution to the problem. Ched Evans will get fired as Sheffield United cave to the public pressure and then the entire issue will be forgotten about. What's better is to keep him there as a reminder that the public's idea of sentencing differs from the courts.  
Yes, its ugly when the fans chant: ""he scores when he wants"" and all the associated bile but that's a fucking clear representation of our issue at play here. Chase it away and we lose this incredibly powerful advertisement for the problem.  

""Justice"" has been served. If you don't like it fix the justice system just don't go running around trying to be a crap batman by trying to drag people back to jail or somehow metering your own punishment because you don't think its been sufficient. Don't be blinded by vengeance and emotion because it clouds the real problem which is that **the justice system's sentencing and the public's perception differs by a country mile in regards to rape sentencing.**   

Fix the justice system and we might even have an ""Evans law"" or an ""Evans amendment"" or ""Evans sentencing guidelines"".

No, I didn't. I was making a different point. Everything you wrote is wrong, and you should feel bad. You misunderstood or chose to misunderstand and then wrote an essay attacking a strawman. 

Ironically, this is why these problems happen in the first place. The appropriate response to seeing someone say something you disagree with is to reach out and clarify and understand, or even just ignore, rather than overreact with unnecessarily rambling essays or public demonstrations or fueling the rage baiting social media. 

You seem to have resigned yourself that Uganda is going to take a long time to change. Well, it will with that attitude. 

And yes, we should wait for other countries to catch up, and help them do so, so that they don't take as long as we did. It's morally disgusting to spend years focusing our energy on minor issues while they are being beaten and dying in jail cells.

Can remember my dad saying at one point he thought about quitting, because he would probably be getting more if he did. 

I honestly think the court system is biased towards women. We were lucky enough that they let me talk (I was 13) otherwise I would have ended up with her just because she was my mum and a 13 year old girl living with her dad alone isn't the norm

Holidays we get her. She is just about to leave high school, and will be moving in with me. But when we were younger, my mum couldn't drive, so he had to drive 8 hours every other weekend to take me there/her come visit. 

I think me and my dad have a lot of bitterness about it all, my mum does nothing, was verbally abusive, is a complete narcissist and despite it everything was there to help her and go in her favour.

I don't talk about it often, when I do I could go on for ages. Every situation is different of course...not saying cases where the mother is batshit are common, but I always feel like it's a personal victory when the batshit mothers get called out.

false,LlamaExpert,num1,,"I liked this article, and although Liew addressed how sitting back against Arsenal was a good change of tactics, I didn't understand his final point:

&gt; But the irony is that in order to beat the big teams, Tottenham may just have to start thinking like a small one. 

After the last game against Arsenal, I remember pundits unanimously agreeing with the notion that Arsenal *deserved* to win: they had retained more possession and taken more chances on goal. I also remember talking to my brother after the game, who said that Arsenal looked to be in a league above us.

But in the grand scheme of things, is that what really happened? It may not have been the exciting NLD of old, with a ridiculous scoreline or comeback, but from Pochettino's managerial perspective it was quite significant.

Prior to the game we had been completely stagnant against Liverpool, West Brom, and Partizan. Instead of hoping that the gears would start clicking and approaching the game in an attacking manner similar to our match against QPR, Poch had our team sit back and depend on the counter attack. Minus the Lamela gaff leading to A*****l's only goal of the game, this tactic worked quite well. It almost reminded me of a Mourinho-lite style of playing big matches.

With City on the horizon, I am not so sure this tactic will work with their obscene pace. I'm not sure how we approach this match, but it'll be paramount that we press hard from the beginning to the final whistle.",0,1413576835,null,0,false,0,clccqdo,t3_2ji8dg,t1_clccqdo,t3_2ji8dg,null,1426478087,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

That made us struggle to get our passing game going and then it all fell apart because we couldn't keep hold of the ball. Pathetic defending for their first goal, but the second was just a wonder strike. That lad can keep trying for the rest of his career and won't hit a shot like that again.

A small card that you write your name, DoB, postcode and medical history/medication on, and then slide inside the lining of your helmet. It comes with a sticky green dot sticker which you put on the right hand side of your helmet or visor. Paramedics should be trained to recognise this, and is a secure way to provide them any information they need in case you are unconscious. 

Please note that even if you notice the green dot on someone's helmet when they have been in a crash, you shouldn't take their helmet off, instead wait for a trained professional from the fire brigade or a paramedic to do it. There may be serious spinal damage which would be made much worse by taking the helmet off.

*Making a decision - typically for infants - to cut apart their genitals in some fashion.*

I believe this is wrong - irrelevant of gender. Therefore the message must surely be the same across both sexes and non gender specific: *""Do not mutilate the genitals of infants for any reason except a medical need""*. 

I mention MGM as it makes no sense to omit it. It's as relevant and it is carried out openly in the UK. I do not agree with this. 

What you and others here are suggesting is akin to domestic violence prevention *specifically for women* when it affects both women and men. Omitting one almost endorses it. The message must be universal.

&gt;The __Uffington White Horse__ is a highly [stylized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(visual_arts\)#Stylization) [prehistoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_Britain) [hill figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_figure), 110 m long (374 feet), formed from deep trenches filled with crushed white [chalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk). The figure is situated on the upper slopes of White Horse Hill in the [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [civil parish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_England) of [Uffington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington,_Oxfordshire) (in the county of [Oxfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire), historically [Berkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire)), some 8 km (5 mi) south of the town of [Faringdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faringdon) and a similar distance west of the town of [Wantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wantage); or 2.5 km south of Uffington. The hill forms a part of the scarp of the [Berkshire Downs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Downs) and overlooks the [Vale of White Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vale_of_White_Horse) to the north.

&gt;Best views of the figure are obtained from the air, or from directly across the Vale, particularly around the villages of [Great Coxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Coxwell), [Longcot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longcot) and [Fernham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernham). The site is owned and managed by the [National Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty) and is a [Scheduled Ancient Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Ancient_Monument).
