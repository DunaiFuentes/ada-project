---

&gt;Since the Horn has finite volume but infinite surface area, it seems that it could be filled with a finite quantity of paint, and yet that paint would not be sufficient to coat its inner surface – an apparent paradox. In fact, in a theoretical mathematical sense, a finite amount of paint *can* coat an infinite area, provided the thickness of the coat becomes vanishingly small ""quickly enough"" to compensate for the ever-expanding area, which in this case is forced to happen to an inner-surface coat as the horn narrows. However, to coat the outer surface of the horn with a constant thickness of paint, no matter how thin, *would* require an infinite amount of paint.

As long as the Romanian strawberry prickers are paying more tax than they take out in welfare ([which generally they do](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467)) and as long as they are not crowding the market too much that wages are falling dramatically ([which the National Farmers’ Union thinks they aren't](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f610fb2-3e70-11e4-a620-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Hkq4e1Ug); in fact they are worried there are not enough seasonal workers to meet the needs of UK agriculture) then they are just as much worth having. They may contribute less per person than a wealthy engineer but they still end up giving more than they take representing a profit for the government leaving more for the rest of us. 

People tend to think about welfare and economics as a zero sum game. The more people the less there is for me. In fact of course even if we had 1 billion people in the UK, provided each person contributed 1 penny more than they took out we would make huge profit off of the welfare system.

The ad revenue a specialist channel gets is peanuts and would barely cover the new cameras. Specialist channels rely on either donations, subscriptions or selling products to cover the costs.

&gt; You say miles behind CFC TV &amp;MUFC TV. I have never known anyone to subscribe to those channels including friends who support them, where as I know lots on non LFC supporters who on occasion would have watched the odd show on LFC TV. They now will definitely not get non LFC fans but also reduce number of overall viewing figures.

I say miles behind in the terms of technology, programmes and services those two fan channels offer. 

&gt; Besides all that, the channel is funded by the club which operates in a multi billion pound industry, I am sure they can cover staff and equipment costs if it means having a personal channel to promote their product.

FSG are trying to make the club sustainable, if LFCTV became a free service it would bleed money from the clubs accounts which FSG don't want.

This is the thing I hated the most about this episode and about this season in general. Why does it all take place in the present? When they showed that weird ring on the tree I figured they would go back in time to that moment, face some peril, and discover the solution to the current day problem. That could have actually been a good story. Even if the annoying kids came with him. 

I don't think it would have been ""easier"" it just would have made a better story.  I thought there was a really interesting theme going on comparing the timeline of trees to the timeline of humans and the Doctor. The show is supposed to be about time travel and there was an interesting angle to sort of explore the passage of time from the trees perspective and compare the Doctor's way of life to these cosmic life cycle elements like the flare/tree relationship.

Tell me this - if a white person wanted to dress up as Obama (for a play for example) - to portray one of the most powerful black men to have walked the earth - would they, in your opinion, need to keep their faces white? Not a very accurate representation. In fact it could be misconstrued as being offensive. If you draw a person with dark skin on paper and colour it to represent that person - is that offensive?

I have zero interest in watching a match I know the scores of and I will 100% know the score by the next day and more than likely have watched it live.

Taking the games out, you have 

- A few pre and post interviews which I don't care for
- Training footage... I have a life with a lot of shit to fit in, I don't care for or have the time for this
- Press conferences which again I don't have time to watch or will be working etc when they're on and just skim read the main points raised. 
- Fun shit, which inevitably winds up on this sub or isn't that fun. I would watch these but this is really the only stuff I would care for.
- Youth content, as much as I want our young reds to do well I don't really want to watch full youth matches. Maybe a select few but I don't think most people would be too dissimilar to me on this. 

If you actually would watch and enjoy most this content then it is most definitely worth the price but most people imo just won't care enough about enough of it to justify the price. You break it down to £1.75 a week but Netflix is the same price and I will get a hell of a lot more from that so when I'm comparing this to other media services available at a similar price it's going to lose hard.

Restricting the ability to buy up so much housing for investment portfolios would lower the demand and therefore prices, hopefully to a level where those currently too poor to be considered for a mortgage would then be able to get one.

But even that said, I disagree with the concept as a whole.  The entire point of the Lords (in the modern day) is to create some element of technocracy.  To take people who were actually successful in their lives, and thus have experience in the real world, and to give them a degree of political power.  A senate would simply create another group of career politicians with no actual experience to waste public money and do nothing.   And I think we can agree that we have enough of those already.  Voter turnout is already low anyway.  To most people this will feel like voting for another representative when they already have three (Local Councillor, MP and MEP). 

And the whole shtick about the North not being represented is easily explainable.  Given that London is the capital of business, art, culture, sports, journalism and pretty much everything else in the UK, the leaders of those areas of industry are obviously going to live there.  If you want to change representation the answer isn't arbitrarily giving the North more politicians (the existing ones are hardly doing much).  It's to encourage business to move there.

Also, there is a bit in ~~Series 6 Episode 5 (F - France)~~ Series 8 (H) Episode 16 (History) where they talk about the ""Bayeux Tapestory"" (as well as the Battle of Hastings) and then mention about how Saxon names Disappeared in favor of Norman names. The part about language is mentioned about how the Saxon names are what we use for the animals (as the laborers and farmers call things 'cows') but we use the Norman words for same things as food (beef). It is roughly at 20 minutes into the episode, but you can start a couple of minutes earlier to get the rest of that segment.

false,Flackintosh,null,null,"As a recent graduate I'd like to just clarify on the perks on getting a student account for you, the student, and the man, the bank.

For You:

**1) Overdraft**
It can be very tight in monetary terms sometimes as a student, main contributing factor for this; You've been given way more money than you should of been by the government, and in turn go made on takeaway, nandos, alcohol and clothes (and maybe eat in and cook a ridiculously sized portion of food now and then, yes you bought it from Aldi, but 1kg of mince per meal is not pricing your food right). Don't let yourself or anyone else tell you otherwise, get a part time job at uni + the student loan, and not act like an immature person with money and you'll be rolling in it at the end of uni (exactly what my girlfriend did and I am very jealous of her savings, and she still went out more than me!). 

Anyway an overdraft, **0% overdraft**, usually these days £500-£750 first term moving up to something like £1500 in year 3 if you keep increasing it. This is a good thing and a bad thing as you probably already know, it is REAL debt unlike your student loan but it can be very helpful when you've spent all your student loan in topman &amp; lidl's vodka isle and only have enough money to live of baked beans for next 2 months.

**2) Perks**
I'd try an ignore the first one, overdraft (this is /r/UKPersonalFinance  after all), and stick to the simple perks many banks offer when opening a student account. For example I got a free young persons railcard, and another one the year after, and another one the year after. This in monetary terms is around £60 per railcard I believe, so that's essentially £180 free just for joining a bank.

That's it really, that's all there is to a student account. Now why do banks even have student accounts?

**1) Loyalty**
It's been proven many times over that once somebody is comfortable with there bank, they usually stay with that bank till pretty much the day they die, excluding credit cards and savings accounts, your current account rarely gets changed. You don't look for fancy offers or interest rates because that's for your other accounts. The banks know this and try and entice you in as best they can because it means they more often than not will have your custom for a very long time.

**2) Overdraft**
I'm getting tired now I apologize, so I'll keep this brief. The 0% overdraft offered to students is the biggest con the banks have going. It's a small loan you don't have to pay for a long time essentially. Which seems great but what the bank is really doing is getting you used to and normalised to credit and using credit. They want you to have an overdraft, they want you to use credit cards. These things exist for a reason, and this three year honeymoon period is just a selling trick. So honestly if you haven't already, don't fall for the bullshit, build your own emergency fund and never get an overdraft. Credit card, sure, for the protection when making large purchases, but say no to the overdraft.

By all accounts the Lords have done a pretty exemplary job recently, haven't vetoed anything major that would be good for the country, and have acted by and large in the public interest.  There is no need for change.

I wish it because I feel it's driven a wedge inbetween Scotland and the rest of the UK which need not have existed.

&gt;it's brought a great deal of questions to how we Scots view ourselves in the union and what we want for our country

But 55% of us *know* and already *knew* what we want for our country. This might have been some nice little voyage of self-exploration for yes voters, but for the rest of us it's been an expensive and bitter experience just to keep what we had and knew we wanted to keep.

&gt;pretending that we're partners in this union

What do you mean by that?

&gt;not questioning the powers that be because it's not our place.

You want some sauce for the chips on your shoulder?

&gt;I guess you would say you're more British than Scottish aswell?

I'm both. I'm not sure I'd quantify one more than the other or attempt to quantify either really.

&gt;""I wish we never went to question the higher authority"", 

Was that a deliberate misrepresentation or are you really that ignorant of how No voters feel? This is nothing about ""higher"" authorities, it's about the fact that we now have a rabble of people who seem to think that they can demand a referendum every decade until they get the answer they want and destroy the union. This conversation should be over, and the fact that it isn't really betrays what the Yes voters feel about democracy - it's only valid if they get the answer they like.

&gt;Out of more curiosity, do you even support more devolution for this country?

That depends on what form it takes.

As their seats in the legislature are preordained, they cannot be filtered out by any political party or interest group. They also are able to focus on the long-term future of the country rather than the short-term concerns that affect legislators wishing to win re-election.

I think the hereditaries are well-suited for the job, working in tandem with life peers  who are selected for their merits. After all, the upper chamber doesn't have much power, it's not like I'm advocating for the aristocracy to rule the country again. This is a good article about how the hereditaries have recently made positive contributions: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10191978/These-hereditary-peers-put-our-MPs-to-shame.html. Another worthwhile thing to watch is a 2002 documentary called The Lords' Tale, you can listen to the hereditaries make their case.
